Parsing [sent. 1 len. 28]: The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit by Charles Dickens PREFACE What is exaggeration to one class of minds and perceptions , is plain truth to another .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 22]: That which is commonly called a long-sight , perceives in a prospect innumerable features and bearings non-existent to a short-sighted person .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 49]: I sometimes ask myself whether there may occasionally be a difference of this kind between some writers and some readers ; whether it is ALWAYS the writer who colours highly , or whether it is now and then the reader whose eye for colour is a little dull ?
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 22]: On this head of exaggeration I have a positive experience , more curious than the speculation I have just set down .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 41]: It is this : I have never touched a character precisely from the life , but some counterpart of that character has incredulously asked me : `` Now really , did I ever really , see one like it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 28]: All the Pecksniff family upon earth are quite agreed , I believe , that Mr. Pecksniff is an exaggeration , and that no such character ever existed .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 29]: I will not offer any plea on his behalf to so powerful and genteel a body , but will make a remark on the character of Jonas Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 45]: I conceive that the sordid coarseness and brutality of Jonas would be unnatural , if there had been nothing in his early education , and in the precept and example always before him , to engender and develop the vices that make him odious .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 48]: But , so born and so bred , admired for that which made him hateful , and justified from his cradle in cunning , treachery , and avarice ; I claim him as the legitimate issue of the father upon whom those vices are seen to recoil .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 35]: And I submit that their recoil upon that old man , in his unhonoured age , is not a mere piece of poetical justice , but is the extreme exposition of a direct truth .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 50]: I make this comment , and solicit the reader 's attention to it in his or her consideration of this tale , because nothing is more common in real life than a want of profitable reflection on the causes of many vices and crimes that awaken the general horror .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 17]: What is substantially true of families in this respect , is true of a whole commonwealth .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 7]: As we sow , we reap .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 65]: Let the reader go into the children 's side of any prison in England , or , I grieve to add , of many workhouses , and judge whether those are monsters who disgrace our streets , people our hulks and penitentiaries , and overcrowd our penal colonies , or are creatures whom we have deliberately suffered to be bred for misery and ruin .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 77]: The American portion of this story is in no other respect a caricature than as it is an exhibition , for the most part -LRB- Mr. Bevan expected -RRB- , of a ludicrous side , ONLY , of the American character -- of that side which was , four-and-twenty years ago , from its nature , the most obtrusive , and the most likely to be seen by such travellers as Young Martin and Mark Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 50]: As I had never , in writing fiction , had any disposition to soften what is ridiculous or wrong at home , so I then hoped that the good-humored people of the United States would not be generally disposed to quarrel with me for carrying the same usage abroad .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 16]: I am happy to believe that my confidence in that great nation was not misplaced .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 30]: When this book was first published , I was given to understand , by some authorities , that the Watertoast Association and eloquence were beyond all bounds of belief .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 84]: Therefore I record the fact that all that portion of Martin Chuzzlewit 's experiences is a literal paraphrase of some reports of public proceedings in the United States -LRB- especially of the proceedings of a certain Brandywine Association -RRB- , which were printed in the Times Newspaper in June and July , 1843 -- at about the time when I was engaged in writing those parts of the book ; and which remain on the file of the Times Newspaper , of course .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 28]: In all my writings , I hope I have taken every available opportunity of showing the want of sanitary improvements in the neglected dwellings of the poor .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 22]: Mrs. Sarah Gamp was , four-and-twenty years ago , a fair representation of the hired attendant on the poor in sickness .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 19]: The hospitals of London were , in many respects , noble Institutions ; in others , very defective .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 70]: I think it not the least among the instances of their mismanagement , that Mrs. Betsey Prig was a fair specimen of a Hospital Nurse ; and that the Hospitals , with their means and funds , should have left it to private humanity and enterprise , to enter on an attempt to improve that class of persons -- since , greatly improved through the agency of good women .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 130]: POSTSCRIPT At a Public Dinner given to me on Saturday the 18th of April , 1868 , in the city of New York , by two hundred representatives of the Press of the United States of America , I made the following observations , among others : -- `` So much of my voice has lately been heard in the land , that I might have been contented with troubling you no further from my present standing-point , were it not a duty with which I henceforth charge myself , not only here but on every suitable occasion , whatsoever and wheresoever , to express my high and grateful sense of my second reception in America , and to bear my honest testimony to the national generosity and magnanimity .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 83]: Also , to declare how astounded I have been by the amazing changes I have seen around me on every side -- changes moral , changes physical , changes in the amount of land subdued and peopled , changes in the rise of vast new cities , changes in the growth of older cities almost out of recognition , changes in the graces and amenities of life , changes in the Press , without whose advancement no advancement can take place anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 43]: Nor am I , believe me , so arrogant as to suppose that in five-and-twenty years there have been no changes in me , and that I had nothing to learn and no extreme impressions to correct when I was here first .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 55]: And this brings me to a point on which I have , ever since I landed in the United States last November , observed a strict silence , though sometimes tempted to break it , but in reference to which I will , with your good leave , take you into my confidence now .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 40]: Even the Press , being human , may be sometimes mistaken or misinformed , and I rather think that I have in one or two rare instances observed its information to be not strictly accurate with reference to myself .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 39]: Indeed , I have , now and again , been more surprised by printed news that I have read of myself , than by any printed news that I have ever read in my present state of existence .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 68]: Thus , the vigour and perseverance with which I have for some months past been collecting materials for , and hammering away at , a new book on America has much astonished me ; seeing that all that time my declaration has been perfectly well known to my publishers on both sides of the Atlantic , that no consideration on earth would induce me to write one .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 69]: But what I have intended , what I have resolved upon -LRB- and this is the confidence I seek to place in you -RRB- , is , on my return to England , in my own person , in my own Journal , to bear , for the behoof of my countrymen , such testimony to the gigantic changes in this country as I have hinted at to-night .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 61]: Also , to record that wherever I have been , in the smallest places equally with the largest , I have been received with unsurpassable politeness , delicacy , sweet temper , hospitality , consideration , and with unsurpassable respect for the privacy daily enforced upon me by the nature of my avocation here and the state of my health .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 50]: This testimony , so long as I live , and so long as my descendants have any legal right in my books , I shall cause to be republished , as an appendix to every copy of those two books of mine in which I have referred to America .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 33]: And this I will do and cause to be done , not in mere love and thankfulness , but because I regard it as an act of plain justice and honour . ''
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 26]: I said these words with the greatest earnestness that I could lay upon them , and I repeat them in print here with equal earnestness .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 34]: So long as this book shall last , I hope that they will form a part of it , and will be fairly read as inseparable from my experiences and impressions of America .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 3]: CHARLES DICKENS .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 4]: May , 1868 .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 79]: CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTORY , CONCERNING THE PEDIGREE OF THE CHUZZLEWIT FAMILY As no lady or gentleman , with any claims to polite breeding , can possibly sympathize with the Chuzzlewit Family without being first assured of the extreme antiquity of the race , it is a great satisfaction to know that it undoubtedly descended in a direct line from Adam and Eve ; and was , in the very earliest times , closely connected with the agricultural interest .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 70]: If it should ever be urged by grudging and malicious persons , that a Chuzzlewit , in any period of the family history , displayed an overweening amount of family pride , surely the weakness will be considered not only pardonable but laudable , when the immense superiority of the house to the rest of mankind , in respect of this its ancient origin , is taken into account .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 50]: It is remarkable that as there was , in the oldest family of which we have any record , a murderer and a vagabond , so we never fail to meet , in the records of all old families , with innumerable repetitions of the same phase of character .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 66]: Indeed , it may be laid down as a general principle , that the more extended the ancestry , the greater the amount of violence and vagabondism ; for in ancient days those two amusements , combining a wholesome excitement with a promising means of repairing shattered fortunes , were at once the ennobling pursuit and the healthful recreation of the Quality of this land .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 35]: Consequently , it is a source of inexpressible comfort and happiness to find , that in various periods of our history , the Chuzzlewits were actively connected with divers slaughterous conspiracies and bloody frays .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 46]: It is further recorded of them , that being clad from head to heel in steel of proof , they did on many occasions lead their leather-jerkined soldiers to the death with invincible courage , and afterwards return home gracefully to their relations and friends .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 17]: There can be no doubt that at least one Chuzzlewit came over with William the Conqueror .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 46]: It does not appear that this illustrious ancestor ` came over ' that monarch , to employ the vulgar phrase , at any subsequent period ; inasmuch as the Family do not seem to have been ever greatly distinguished by the possession of landed estate .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 49]: And it is well known that for the bestowal of that kind of property upon his favourites , the liberality and gratitude of the Norman were as remarkable as those virtues are usually found to be in great men when they give away what belongs to other people .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 127]: Perhaps in this place the history may pause to congratulate itself upon the enormous amount of bravery , wisdom , eloquence , virtue , gentle birth , and true nobility , that appears to have come into England with the Norman Invasion : an amount which the genealogy of every ancient family lends its aid to swell , and which would beyond all question have been found to be just as great , and to the full as prolific in giving birth to long lines of chivalrous descendants , boastful of their origin , even though William the Conqueror had been William the Conquered ; a change of circumstances which , it is quite certain , would have made no manner of difference in this respect .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 65]: There was unquestionably a Chuzzlewit in the Gunpowder Plot , if indeed the arch-traitor , Fawkes himself , were not a scion of this remarkable stock ; as he might easily have been , supposing another Chuzzlewit to have emigrated to Spain in the previous generation , and there intermarried with a Spanish lady , by whom he had issue , one olive-complexioned son .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 41]: This probable conjecture is strengthened , if not absolutely confirmed , by a fact which can not fail to be interesting to those who are curious in tracing the progress of hereditary tastes through the lives of their unconscious inheritors .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 68]: It is a notable circumstance that in these later times , many Chuzzlewits , being unsuccessful in other pursuits , have , without the smallest rational hope of enriching themselves , or any conceivable reason , set up as coal-merchants ; and have , month after month , continued gloomily to watch a small stock of coals , without in any one instance negotiating with a purchaser .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 41]: The remarkable similarity between this course of proceeding and that adopted by their Great Ancestor beneath the vaults of the Parliament House at Westminster , is too obvious and too full of interest , to stand in need of comment .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 77]: It is also clearly proved by the oral traditions of the Family , that there existed , at some one period of its history which is not distinctly stated , a matron of such destructive principles , and so familiarized to the use and composition of inflammatory and combustible engines , that she was called ` The Match Maker ; ' by which nickname and byword she is recognized in the Family legends to this day .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 20]: Surely there can be no reasonable doubt that this was the Spanish lady , the mother of Chuzzlewit Fawkes .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 48]: But there is one other piece of evidence , bearing immediate reference to their close connection with this memorable event in English History , which must carry conviction , even to a mind -LRB- if such a mind there be -RRB- remaining unconvinced by these presumptive proofs .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 77]: There was , within a few years , in the possession of a highly respectable and in every way credible and unimpeachable member of the Chuzzlewit Family -LRB- for his bitterest enemy never dared to hint at his being otherwise than a wealthy man -RRB- , a dark lantern of undoubted antiquity ; rendered still more interesting by being , in shape and pattern , extremely like such as are in use at the present day .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 48]: Now this gentleman , since deceased , was at all times ready to make oath , and did again and again set forth upon his solemn asseveration , that he had frequently heard his grandmother say , when contemplating this venerable relic , ` Aye , aye !
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 21]: This was carried by my fourth son on the fifth of November , when he was a Guy Fawkes . '
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 29]: These remarkable words wrought -LRB- as well they might -RRB- a strong impression on his mind , and he was in the habit of repeating them very often .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 20]: The just interpretation which they bear , and the conclusion to which they lead , are triumphant and irresistible .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 41]: The old lady , naturally strong-minded , was nevertheless frail and fading ; she was notoriously subject to that confusion of ideas , or , to say the least , of speech , to which age and garrulity are liable .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 22]: The slight , the very slight , confusion apparent in these expressions is manifest , and is ludicrously easy of correction .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 34]: ` Aye , aye , ' quoth she , and it will be observed that no emendation whatever is necessary to be made in these two initiative remarks , ` Aye , aye !
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 24]: This lantern was carried by my forefather ' -- not fourth son , which is preposterous -- ` on the fifth of November .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 7]: And HE was Guy Fawkes . '
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 24]: Here we have a remark at once consistent , clear , natural , and in strict accordance with the character of the speaker .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 67]: Indeed the anecdote is so plainly susceptible of this meaning and no other , that it would be hardly worth recording in its original state , were it not a proof of what may be -LRB- and very often is -RRB- affected not only in historical prose but in imaginative poetry , by the exercise of a little ingenious labour on the part of a commentator .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 28]: It has been said that there is no instance , in modern times , of a Chuzzlewit having been found on terms of intimacy with the Great .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 22]: But here again the sneering detractors who weave such miserable figments from their malicious brains , are stricken dumb by evidence .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 42]: For letters are yet in the possession of various branches of the family , from which it distinctly appears , being stated in so many words , that one Diggory Chuzzlewit was in the habit of perpetually dining with Duke Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 97]: So constantly was he a guest at that nobleman 's table , indeed ; and so unceasingly were His Grace 's hospitality and companionship forced , as it were , upon him ; that we find him uneasy , and full of constraint and reluctance ; writing his friends to the effect that if they fail to do so and so by bearer , he will have no choice but to dine again with Duke Humphrey ; and expressing himself in a very marked and extraordinary manner as one surfeited of High Life and Gracious Company .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 46]: It has been rumoured , and it is needless to say the rumour originated in the same base quarters , that a certain male Chuzzlewit , whose birth must be admitted to be involved in some obscurity , was of very mean and low descent .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 5]: How stands the proof ?
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 60]: When the son of that individual , to whom the secret of his father 's birth was supposed to have been communicated by his father in his lifetime , lay upon his deathbed , this question was put to him in a distinct , solemn , and formal way : ` Toby Chuzzlewit , who was your grandfather ? '
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 51]: To which he , with his last breath , no less distinctly , solemnly , and formally replied : and his words were taken down at the time , and signed by six witnesses , each with his name and address in full : ` The Lord No Zoo . '
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 51]: It may be said -- it HAS been said , for human wickedness has no limits -- that there is no Lord of that name , and that among the titles which have become extinct , none at all resembling this , in sound even , is to be discovered .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 7]: But what is the irresistible inference ?
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 134]: Rejecting a theory broached by some well-meaning but mistaken persons , that this Mr Toby Chuzzlewit 's grandfather , to judge from his name , must surely have been a Mandarin -LRB- which is wholly insupportable , for there is no pretence of his grandmother ever having been out of this country , or of any Mandarin having been in it within some years of his father 's birth ; except those in the tea-shops , which can not for a moment be regarded as having any bearing on the question , one way or other -RRB- , rejecting this hypothesis , is it not manifest that Mr Toby Chuzzlewit had either received the name imperfectly from his father , or that he had forgotten it , or that he had mispronounced it ?
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 33]: and that even at the recent period in question , the Chuzzlewits were connected by a bend sinister , or kind of heraldic over-the-left , with some unknown noble and illustrious House ?
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 41]: From documentary evidence , yet preserved in the family , the fact is clearly established that in the comparatively modern days of the Diggory Chuzzlewit before mentioned , one of its members had attained to very great wealth and influence .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 94]: Throughout such fragments of his correspondence as have escaped the ravages of the moths -LRB- who , in right of their extensive absorption of the contents of deeds and papers , may be called the general registers of the Insect World -RRB- , we find him making constant reference to an uncle , in respect of whom he would seem to have entertained great expectations , as he was in the habit of seeking to propitiate his favour by presents of plate , jewels , books , watches , and other valuable articles .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 54]: Thus , he writes on one occasion to his brother in reference to a gravy-spoon , the brother 's property , which he -LRB- Diggory -RRB- would appear to have borrowed or otherwise possessed himself of : ` Do not be angry , I have parted with it -- to my uncle . '
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 27]: On another occasion he expresses himself in a similar manner with regard to a child 's mug which had been entrusted to him to get repaired .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 22]: On another occasion he says , ' I have bestowed upon that irresistible uncle of mine everything I ever possessed . '
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 68]: And that he was in the habit of paying long and constant visits to this gentleman at his mansion , if , indeed , he did not wholly reside there , is manifest from the following sentence : ` With the exception of the suit of clothes I carry about with me , the whole of my wearing apparel is at present at my uncle 's . '
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 42]: This gentleman 's patronage and influence must have been very extensive , for his nephew writes , ` His interest is too high ' -- ` It is too much ' -- ` It is tremendous ' -- and the like .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 75]: Still it does not appear -LRB- which is strange -RRB- to have procured for him any lucrative post at court or elsewhere , or to have conferred upon him any other distinction than that which was necessarily included in the countenance of so great a man , and the being invited by him to certain entertainment 's , so splendid and costly in their nature , that he calls them ` Golden Balls . '
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 25]: It is needless to multiply instances of the high and lofty station , and the vast importance of the Chuzzlewits , at different periods .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 42]: If it came within the scope of reasonable probability that further proofs were required , they might be heaped upon each other until they formed an Alps of testimony , beneath which the boldest scepticism should be crushed and beaten flat .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 116]: As a goodly tumulus is already collected , and decently battened up above the Family grave , the present chapter is content to leave it as it is : merely adding , by way of a final spadeful , that many Chuzzlewits , both male and female , are proved to demonstration , on the faith of letters written by their own mothers , to have had chiselled noses , undeniable chins , forms that might have served the sculptor for a model , exquisitely-turned limbs and polished foreheads of so transparent a texture that the blue veins might be seen branching off in various directions , like so many roads on an ethereal map .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 76]: This fact in itself , though it had been a solitary one , would have utterly settled and clenched the business in hand ; for it is well known , on the authority of all the books which treat of such matters , that every one of these phenomena , but especially that of the chiselling , are invariably peculiar to , and only make themselves apparent in , persons of the very best condition .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 72]: This history having , to its own perfect satisfaction , -LRB- and , consequently , to the full contentment of all its readers , -RRB- proved the Chuzzlewits to have had an origin , and to have been at one time or other of an importance which can not fail to render them highly improving and acceptable acquaintance to all right-minded individuals , may now proceed in earnest with its task .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 66]: And having shown that they must have had , by reason of their ancient birth , a pretty large share in the foundation and increase of the human family , it will one day become its province to submit , that such of its members as shall be introduced in these pages , have still many counterparts and prototypes in the Great World about us .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 59]: At present it contents itself with remarking , in a general way , on this head : Firstly , that it may be safely asserted , and yet without implying any direct participation in the Manboddo doctrine touching the probability of the human race having once been monkeys , that men do play very strange and extraordinary tricks .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 53]: Secondly , and yet without trenching on the Blumenbach theory as to the descendants of Adam having a vast number of qualities which belong more particularly to swine than to any other class of animals in the creation , that some men certainly are remarkable for taking uncommon good care of themselves .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 70]: CHAPTER TWO WHEREIN CERTAIN PERSONS ARE PRESENTED TO THE READER , WITH WHOM HE MAY , IF HE PLEASE , BECOME BETTER ACQUAINTED It was pretty late in the autumn of the year , when the declining sun struggling through the mist which had obscured it all day , looked brightly down upon a little Wiltshire village , within an easy journey of the fair old town of Salisbury .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 37]: Like a sudden flash of memory or spirit kindling up the mind of an old man , it shed a glory upon the scene , in which its departed youth and freshness seemed to live again .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 96]: The wet grass sparkled in the light ; the scanty patches of verdure in the hedges -- where a few green twigs yet stood together bravely , resisting to the last the tyranny of nipping winds and early frosts -- took heart and brightened up ; the stream which had been dull and sullen all day long , broke out into a cheerful smile ; the birds began to chirp and twitter on the naked boughs , as though the hopeful creatures half believed that winter had gone by , and spring had come already .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 63]: The vane upon the tapering spire of the old church glistened from its lofty station in sympathy with the general gladness ; and from the ivy-shaded windows such gleams of light shone back upon the glowing sky , that it seemed as if the quiet buildings were the hoarding-place of twenty summers , and all their ruddiness and warmth were stored within .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 35]: Even those tokens of the season which emphatically whispered of the coming winter , graced the landscape , and , for the moment , tinged its livelier features with no oppressive air of sadness .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 74]: The fallen leaves , with which the ground was strewn , gave forth a pleasant fragrance , and subduing all harsh sounds of distant feet and wheels created a repose in gentle unison with the light scattering of seed hither and thither by the distant husbandman , and with the noiseless passage of the plough as it turned up the rich brown earth , and wrought a graceful pattern in the stubbled fields .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 139]: On the motionless branches of some trees , autumn berries hung like clusters of coral beads , as in those fabled orchards where the fruits were jewels ; others stripped of all their garniture , stood , each the centre of its little heap of bright red leaves , watching their slow decay ; others again , still wearing theirs , had them all crunched and crackled up , as though they had been burnt ; about the stems of some were piled , in ruddy mounds , the apples they had borne that year ; while others -LRB- hardy evergreens this class -RRB- showed somewhat stern and gloomy in their vigour , as charged by nature with the admonition that it is not to her more sensitive and joyous favourites she grants the longest term of life .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 46]: Still athwart their darker boughs , the sunbeams struck out paths of deeper gold ; and the red light , mantling in among their swarthy branches , used them as foils to set its brightness off , and aid the lustre of the dying day .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 10]: A moment , and its glory was no more .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 67]: The sun went down beneath the long dark lines of hill and cloud which piled up in the west an airy city , wall heaped on wall , and battlement on battlement ; the light was all withdrawn ; the shining church turned cold and dark ; the stream forgot to smile ; the birds were silent ; and the gloom of winter dwelt on everything .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 26]: An evening wind uprose too , and the slighter branches cracked and rattled as they moved , in skeleton dances , to its moaning music .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 54]: The withering leaves no longer quiet , hurried to and fro in search of shelter from its chill pursuit ; the labourer unyoked his horses , and with head bent down , trudged briskly home beside them ; and from the cottage windows lights began to glance and wink upon the darkening fields .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 12]: Then the village forge came out in all its bright importance .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 7]: The lusty bellows roared Ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 28]: to the clear fire , which roared in turn , and bade the shining sparks dance gayly to the merry clinking of the hammers on the anvil .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 19]: The gleaming iron , in its emulation , sparkled too , and shed its red-hot gems around profusely .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 49]: The strong smith and his men dealt such strokes upon their work , as made even the melancholy night rejoice , and brought a glow into its dark face as it hovered about the door and windows , peeping curiously in above the shoulders of a dozen loungers .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 72]: As to this idle company , there they stood , spellbound by the place , and , casting now and then a glance upon the darkness in their rear , settled their lazy elbows more at ease upon the sill , and leaned a little further in : no more disposed to tear themselves away than if they had been born to cluster round the blazing hearth like so many crickets .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 6]: Out upon the angry wind !
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 37]: how from sighing , it began to bluster round the merry forge , banging at the wicket , and grumbling in the chimney , as if it bullied the jolly bellows for doing anything to order .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 130]: And what an impotent swaggerer it was too , for all its noise ; for if it had any influence on that hoarse companion , it was but to make him roar his cheerful song the louder , and by consequence to make the fire burn the brighter , and the sparks to dance more gayly yet ; at length , they whizzed so madly round and round , that it was too much for such a surly wind to bear ; so off it flew with a howl giving the old sign before the ale-house door such a cuff as it went , that the Blue Dragon was more rampant than usual ever afterwards , and indeed , before Christmas , reared clean out of its crazy frame .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 99]: It was small tyranny for a respectable wind to go wreaking its vengeance on such poor creatures as the fallen leaves , but this wind happening to come up with a great heap of them just after venting its humour on the insulted Dragon , did so disperse and scatter them that they fled away , pell-mell , some here , some there , rolling over each other , whirling round and round upon their thin edges , taking frantic flights into the air , and playing all manner of extraordinary gambols in the extremity of their distress .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 68]: Nor was this enough for its malicious fury ; for not content with driving them abroad , it charged small parties of them and hunted them into the wheel wright 's saw-pit , and below the planks and timbers in the yard , and , scattering the sawdust in the air , it looked for them underneath , and when it did meet with any , whew !
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 11]: how it drove them on and followed at their heels !
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 90]: The scared leaves only flew the faster for all this , and a giddy chase it was ; for they got into unfrequented places , where there was no outlet , and where their pursuer kept them eddying round and round at his pleasure ; and they crept under the eaves of houses , and clung tightly to the sides of hay-ricks , like bats ; and tore in at open chamber windows , and cowered close to hedges ; and , in short , went anywhere for safety .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 90]: But the oddest feat they achieved was , to take advantage of the sudden opening of Mr Pecksniff 's front-door , to dash wildly into his passage ; whither the wind following close upon them , and finding the back-door open , incontinently blew out the lighted candle held by Miss Pecksniff , and slammed the front-door against Mr Pecksniff who was at that moment entering , with such violence , that in the twinkling of an eye he lay on his back at the bottom of the steps .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 50]: Being by this time weary of such trifling performances , the boisterous rover hurried away rejoicing , roaring over moor and meadow , hill and flat , until it got out to sea , where it met with other winds similarly disposed , and made a night of it .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 54]: In the meantime Mr Pecksniff , having received from a sharp angle in the bottom step but one , that sort of knock on the head which lights up , for the patient 's entertainment , an imaginary general illumination of very bright short-sixes , lay placidly staring at his own street door .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 144]: And it would seem to have been more suggestive in its aspect than street doors usually are ; for he continued to lie there , rather a lengthy and unreasonable time , without so much as wondering whether he was hurt or no ; neither , when Miss Pecksniff inquired through the key-hole in a shrill voice , which might have belonged to a wind in its teens , ` Who 's there ' did he make any reply ; nor , when Miss Pecksniff opened the door again , and shading the candle with her hand , peered out , and looked provokingly round him , and about him , and over him , and everywhere but at him , did he offer any remark , or indicate in any manner the least hint of a desire to be picked up . '
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 18]: I see you , ' cried Miss Pecksniff , to the ideal inflicter of a runaway knock .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 9]: ` You 'll catch it , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 14]: Still Mr Pecksniff , perhaps from having caught it already , said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 13]: ` You 're round the corner now , ' cried Miss Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 94]: She said it at a venture , but there was appropriate matter in it too ; for Mr Pecksniff , being in the act of extinguishing the candles before mentioned pretty rapidly , and of reducing the number of brass knobs on his street door from four or five hundred -LRB- which had previously been juggling of their own accord before his eyes in a very novel manner -RRB- to a dozen or so , might in one sense have been said to be coming round the corner , and just turning it .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 52]: With a sharply delivered warning relative to the cage and the constable , and the stocks and the gallows , Miss Pecksniff was about to close the door again , when Mr Pecksniff -LRB- being still at the bottom of the steps -RRB- raised himself on one elbow , and sneezed .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 5]: ` That voice ! '
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 4]: cried Miss Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 5]: ` My parent ! '
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 32]: At this exclamation , another Miss Pecksniff bounced out of the parlour ; and the two Miss Pecksniffs , with many incoherent expressions , dragged Mr Pecksniff into an upright posture .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 4]: ` Pa ! '
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 5]: they cried in concert .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 3]: ` Pa !
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 4]: Speak , Pa !
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 10]: Do not look so wild my dearest Pa ! '
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 99]: But as a gentleman 's looks , in such a case of all others , are by no means under his own control , Mr Pecksniff continued to keep his mouth and his eyes very wide open , and to drop his lower jaw , somewhat after the manner of a toy nut-cracker ; and as his hat had fallen off , and his face was pale , and his hair erect , and his coat muddy , the spectacle he presented was so very doleful , that neither of the Miss Pecksniffs could repress an involuntary screech .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 10]: ` That 'll do , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 6]: ` I 'm better . '
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 8]: ` He 's come to himself ! '
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 6]: cried the youngest Miss Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 6]: ` He speaks again ! '
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 4]: exclaimed the eldest .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 19]: With these joyful words they kissed Mr Pecksniff on either cheek ; and bore him into the house .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 56]: Presently , the youngest Miss Pecksniff ran out again to pick up his hat , his brown paper parcel , his umbrella , his gloves , and other small articles ; and that done , and the door closed , both young ladies applied themselves to tending Mr Pecksniff 's wounds in the back parlour .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 59]: They were not very serious in their nature ; being limited to abrasions on what the eldest Miss Pecksniff called ` the knobby parts ' of her parent 's anatomy , such as his knees and elbows , and to the development of an entirely new organ , unknown to phrenologists , on the back of his head .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 43]: These injuries having been comforted externally , with patches of pickled brown paper , and Mr Pecksniff having been comforted internally , with some stiff brandy-and-water , the eldest Miss Pecksniff sat down to make the tea , which was all ready .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 51]: In the meantime the youngest Miss Pecksniff brought from the kitchen a smoking dish of ham and eggs , and , setting the same before her father , took up her station on a low stool at his feet ; thereby bringing her eyes on a level with the teaboard .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 44]: It must not be inferred from this position of humility , that the youngest Miss Pecksniff was so young as to be , as one may say , forced to sit upon a stool , by reason of the shortness of her legs .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 21]: Miss Pecksniff sat upon a stool because of her simplicity and innocence , which were very great , very great .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 22]: Miss Pecksniff sat upon a stool because she was all girlishness , and playfulness , and wildness , and kittenish buoyancy .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 27]: She was the most arch and at the same time the most artless creature , was the youngest Miss Pecksniff , that you can possibly imagine .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 6]: It was her great charm .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 42]: She was too fresh and guileless , and too full of child-like vivacity , was the youngest Miss Pecksniff , to wear combs in her hair , or to turn it up , or to frizzle it , or braid it .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 31]: She wore it in a crop , a loosely flowing crop , which had so many rows of curls in it , that the top row was only one curl .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 30]: Moderately buxom was her shape , and quite womanly too ; but sometimes -- yes , sometimes -- she even wore a pinafore ; and how charming THAT was !
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 35]: she was indeed ' a gushing thing ' -LRB- as a young gentleman had observed in verse , in the Poet 's Corner of a provincial newspaper -RRB- , was the youngest Miss Pecksniff !
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 27]: Mr Pecksniff was a moral man -- a grave man , a man of noble sentiments and speech -- and he had had her christened Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 2]: Mercy !
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 17]: oh , what a charming name for such a pure-souled Being as the youngest Miss Pecksniff !
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 7]: Her sister 's name was Charity .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 6]: There was a good thing !
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 4]: Mercy and Charity !
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 33]: And Charity , with her fine strong sense and her mild , yet not reproachful gravity , was so well named , and did so well set off and illustrate her sister !
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 46]: What a pleasant sight was that the contrast they presented ; to see each loved and loving one sympathizing with , and devoted to , and leaning on , and yet correcting and counter-checking , and , as it were , antidoting , the other !
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 56]: To behold each damsel in her very admiration of her sister , setting up in business for herself on an entirely different principle , and announcing no connection with over-the-way , and if the quality of goods at that establishment do n't please you , you are respectfully invited to favour ME with a call !
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 24]: And the crowning circumstance of the whole delightful catalogue was , that both the fair creatures were so utterly unconscious of all this !
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 7]: They had no idea of it .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 13]: They no more thought or dreamed of it than Mr Pecksniff did .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 20]: Nature played them off against each other ; THEY had no hand in it , the two Miss Pecksniffs .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 12]: It has been remarked that Mr Pecksniff was a moral man .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 4]: So he was .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 19]: Perhaps there never was a more moral man than Mr Pecksniff , especially in his conversation and correspondence .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 25]: It was once said of him by a homely admirer , that he had a Fortunatus 's purse of good sentiments in his inside .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 38]: In this particular he was like the girl in the fairy tale , except that if they were not actual diamonds which fell from his lips , they were the very brightest paste , and shone prodigiously .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 16]: He was a most exemplary man ; fuller of virtuous precept than a copy book .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 40]: Some people likened him to a direction-post , which is always telling the way to a place , and never goes there ; but these were his enemies , the shadows cast by his brightness ; that was all .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 6]: His very throat was moral .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 8]: You saw a good deal of it .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 46]: You looked over a very low fence of white cravat -LRB- whereof no man had ever beheld the tie for he fastened it behind -RRB- , and there it lay , a valley between two jutting heights of collar , serene and whiskerless before you .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 33]: It seemed to say , on the part of Mr Pecksniff , ` There is no deception , ladies and gentlemen , all is peace , a holy calm pervades me . '
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 34]: So did his hair , just grizzled with an iron-grey which was all brushed off his forehead , and stood bolt upright , or slightly drooped in kindred action with his heavy eyelids .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 13]: So did his person , which was sleek though free from corpulency .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 11]: So did his manner , which was soft and oily .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 37]: In a word , even his plain black suit , and state of widower and dangling double eye-glass , all tended to the same purpose , and cried aloud , ` Behold the moral Pecksniff ! '
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 45]: The brazen plate upon the door -LRB- which being Mr Pecksniff 's , could not lie -RRB- bore this inscription , ` PECKSNIFF , ARCHITECT , ' to which Mr Pecksniff , on his cards of business , added , AND LAND SURVEYOR . '
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 38]: In one sense , and only one , he may be said to have been a Land Surveyor on a pretty large scale , as an extensive prospect lay stretched out before the windows of his house .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 38]: Of his architectural doings , nothing was clearly known , except that he had never designed or built anything ; but it was generally understood that his knowledge of the science was almost awful in its profundity .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 51]: Mr Pecksniff 's professional engagements , indeed , were almost , if not entirely , confined to the reception of pupils ; for the collection of rents , with which pursuit he occasionally varied and relieved his graver toils , can hardly be said to be a strictly architectural employment .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 13]: His genius lay in ensnaring parents and guardians , and pocketing premiums .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 154]: A young gentleman 's premium being paid , and the young gentleman come to Mr Pecksniff 's house , Mr Pecksniff borrowed his case of mathematical instruments -LRB- if silver-mounted or otherwise valuable -RRB- ; entreated him , from that moment , to consider himself one of the family ; complimented him highly on his parents or guardians , as the case might be ; and turned him loose in a spacious room on the two-pair front ; where , in the company of certain drawing-boards , parallel rulers , very stiff-legged compasses , and two , or perhaps three , other young gentlemen , he improved himself , for three or five years , according to his articles , in making elevations of Salisbury Cathedral from every possible point of sight ; and in constructing in the air a vast quantity of Castles , Houses of Parliament , and other Public Buildings .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 80]: Perhaps in no place in the world were so many gorgeous edifices of this class erected as under Mr Pecksniff 's auspices ; and if but one-twentieth part of the churches which were built in that front room , with one or other of the Miss Pecksniffs at the altar in the act of marrying the architect , could only be made available by the parliamentary commissioners , no more churches would be wanted for at least five centuries .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 51]: ` Even the worldly goods of which we have just disposed , ' said Mr Pecksniff , glancing round the table when he had finished , ` even cream , sugar , tea , toast , ham -- ' ` And eggs , ' suggested Charity in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 16]: ` And eggs , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` even they have their moral .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 7]: See how they come and go !
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 5]: Every pleasure is transitory .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 8]: We ca n't even eat , long .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 21]: If we indulge in harmless fluids , we get the dropsy ; if in exciting liquids , we get drunk .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 8]: What a soothing reflection is that ! '
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 17]: ` Do n't say WE get drunk , Pa , ' urged the eldest Miss Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 35]: ` When I say we , my dear , ' returned her father , ' I mean mankind in general ; the human race , considered as a body , and not as individuals .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 10]: There is nothing personal in morality , my love .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 76]: Even such a thing as this , ' said Mr Pecksniff , laying the fore-finger of his left hand upon the brown paper patch on the top of his head , ` slight casual baldness though it be , reminds us that we are but ' -- he was going to say ` worms , ' but recollecting that worms were not remarkable for heads of hair , he substituted ` flesh and blood . '
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 37]: ` Which , ' cried Mr Pecksniff after a pause , during which he seemed to have been casting about for a new moral , and not quite successfully , ` which is also very soothing .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 15]: Mercy , my dear , stir the fire and throw up the cinders . '
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 31]: The young lady obeyed , and having done so , resumed her stool , reposed one arm upon her father 's knee , and laid her blooming cheek upon it .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 21]: Miss Charity drew her chair nearer the fire , as one prepared for conversation , and looked towards her father .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 42]: ` Yes , ' said Mr Pecksniff , after a short pause , during which he had been silently smiling , and shaking his head at the fire -- ' I have again been fortunate in the attainment of my object .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 12]: A new inmate will very shortly come among us . ' '
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 6]: A youth , papa ? '
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 3]: asked Charity .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 11]: ` Ye-es , a youth , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 57]: ` He will avail himself of the eligible opportunity which now offers , for uniting the advantages of the best practical architectural education with the comforts of a home , and the constant association with some who -LRB- however humble their sphere , and limited their capacity -RRB- are not unmindful of their moral responsibilities . '
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 5]: ` Oh Pa ! '
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 9]: cried Mercy , holding up her finger archly .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 5]: ` See advertisement ! '
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 11]: ` Playful -- playful warbler , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 59]: It may be observed in connection with his calling his daughter a ` warbler , ' that she was not at all vocal , but that Mr Pecksniff was in the frequent habit of using any word that occurred to him as having a good sound , and rounding a sentence well without much care for its meaning .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 32]: And he did this so boldly , and in such an imposing manner , that he would sometimes stagger the wisest people with his eloquence , and make them gasp again .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 25]: His enemies asserted , by the way , that a strong trustfulness in sounds and forms was the master-key to Mr Pecksniff 's character .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 8]: ` Is he handsome , Pa ? '
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 5]: inquired the younger daughter .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 5]: ` Silly Merry ! '
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 10]: said the eldest : Merry being fond for Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 8]: ` What is the premium , Pa ?
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 5]: tell us that . '
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 9]: ` Oh , good gracious , Cherry ! '
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 25]: cried Miss Mercy , holding up her hands with the most winning giggle in the world , ` what a mercenary girl you are !
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 10]: oh you naughty , thoughtful , prudent thing ! '
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 37]: It was perfectly charming , and worthy of the Pastoral age , to see how the two Miss Pecksniffs slapped each other after this , and then subsided into an embrace expressive of their different dispositions .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 20]: ` He is well looking , ' said Mr Pecksniff , slowly and distinctly ; ` well looking enough .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 12]: I do not positively expect any immediate premium with him . '
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 43]: Notwithstanding their different natures , both Charity and Mercy concurred in opening their eyes uncommonly wide at this announcement , and in looking for the moment as blank as if their thoughts had actually had a direct bearing on the main chance .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 7]: ` But what of that ! '
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 10]: said Mr Pecksniff , still smiling at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 11]: ` There is disinterestedness in the world , I hope ?
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 16]: We are not all arrayed in two opposite ranks ; the OFfensive and the DEfensive .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 24]: Some few there are who walk between ; who help the needy as they go ; and take no part with either side .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 3]: Umph ! '
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 13]: There was something in these morsels of philanthropy which reassured the sisters .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 9]: They exchanged glances , and brightened very much .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 52]: let us not be for ever calculating , devising , and plotting for the future , ' said Mr Pecksniff , smiling more and more , and looking at the fire as a man might , who was cracking a joke with it : ' I am weary of such arts .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 25]: If our inclinations are but good and open-hearted , let us gratify them boldly , though they bring upon us Loss instead of Profit .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 5]: Eh , Charity ? '
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 68]: Glancing towards his daughters for the first time since he had begun these reflections , and seeing that they both smiled , Mr Pecksniff eyed them for an instant so jocosely -LRB- though still with a kind of saintly waggishness -RRB- that the younger one was moved to sit upon his knee forthwith , put her fair arms round his neck , and kiss him twenty times .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 25]: During the whole of this affectionate display she laughed to a most immoderate extent : in which hilarious indulgence even the prudent Cherry joined .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 29]: ` Tut , tut , ' said Mr Pecksniff , pushing his latest-born away and running his fingers through his hair , as he resumed his tranquil face .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 6]: ` What folly is this !
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 15]: Let us take heed how we laugh without reason lest we cry with it .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 8]: What is the domestic news since yesterday ?
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 9]: John Westlock is gone , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 9]: ` Indeed , no , ' said Charity .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 6]: ` And why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 4]: returned her father .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 6]: ` His term expired yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 24]: And his box was packed , I know ; for I saw it , in the morning , standing in the hall . '
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 25]: ` He slept last night at the Dragon , ' returned the young lady , ` and had Mr Pinch to dine with him .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 17]: They spent the evening together , and Mr Pinch was not home till very late . '
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 33]: ` And when I saw him on the stairs this morning , Pa , ' said Mercy with her usual sprightliness , ` he looked , oh goodness , SUCH a monster !
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 65]: with his face all manner of colours , and his eyes as dull as if they had been boiled , and his head aching dreadfully , I am sure from the look of it , and his clothes smelling , oh it 's impossible to say how strong , oh ' -- here the young lady shuddered -- ` of smoke and punch . '
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 65]: ` Now I think , ' said Mr Pecksniff with his accustomed gentleness , though still with the air of one who suffered under injury without complaint , ' I think Mr Pinch might have done better than choose for his companion one who , at the close of a long intercourse , had endeavoured , as he knew , to wound my feelings .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 13]: I am not quite sure that this was delicate in Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 13]: I am not quite sure that this was kind in Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 23]: I will go further and say , I am not quite sure that this was even ordinarily grateful in Mr Pinch . '
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 11]: ` But what can anyone expect from Mr Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 40]: cried Charity , with as strong and scornful an emphasis on the name as if it would have given her unspeakable pleasure to express it , in an acted charade , on the calf of that gentleman 's leg .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 91]: ` Aye , aye , ' returned her father , raising his hand mildly : ` it is very well to say what can we expect from Mr Pinch , but Mr Pinch is a fellow-creature , my dear ; Mr Pinch is an item in the vast total of humanity , my love ; and we have a right , it is our duty , to expect in Mr Pinch some development of those better qualities , the possession of which in our own persons inspires our humble self-respect .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 7]: No , ' continued Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 3]: ` No !
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 76]: Heaven forbid that I should say , nothing can be expected from Mr Pinch ; or that I should say , nothing can be expected from any man alive -LRB- even the most degraded , which Mr Pinch is not , no , really -RRB- ; but Mr Pinch has disappointed me ; he has hurt me ; I think a little the worse of him on this account , but not if human nature .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 7]: Oh , no , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 4]: ` Hark ! '
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 20]: said Miss Charity , holding up her finger , as a gentle rap was heard at the street door .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 6]: ` There is the creature !
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 29]: Now mark my words , he has come back with John Westlock for his box , and is going to help him to take it to the mail .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 13]: Only mark my words , if that is n't his intention ! '
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 42]: Even as she spoke , the box appeared to be in progress of conveyance from the house , but after a brief murmuring of question and answer , it was put down again , and somebody knocked at the parlour door .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 5]: ` Come in ! '
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 10]: cried Mr Pecksniff -- not severely ; only virtuously .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 5]: ` Come in ! '
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 46]: An ungainly , awkward-looking man , extremely short-sighted , and prematurely bald , availed himself of this permission ; and seeing that Mr Pecksniff sat with his back towards him , gazing at the fire , stood hesitating , with the door in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 100]: He was far from handsome certainly ; and was drest in a snuff-coloured suit , of an uncouth make at the best , which , being shrunk with long wear , was twisted and tortured into all kinds of odd shapes ; but notwithstanding his attire , and his clumsy figure , which a great stoop in his shoulders , and a ludicrous habit he had of thrusting his head forward , by no means redeemed , one would not have been disposed -LRB- unless Mr Pecksniff said so -RRB- to consider him a bad fellow by any means .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 50]: He was perhaps about thirty , but he might have been almost any age between sixteen and sixty ; being one of those strange creatures who never decline into an ancient appearance , but look their oldest when they are very young , and get it over at once .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 72]: Keeping his hand upon the lock of the door , he glanced from Mr Pecksniff to Mercy , from Mercy to Charity , and from Charity to Mr Pecksniff again , several times ; but the young ladies being as intent upon the fire as their father was , and neither of the three taking any notice of him , he was fain to say , at last , ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 37]: I beg your pardon , Mr Pecksniff : I beg your pardon for intruding ; but -- ' ` No intrusion , Mr Pinch , ' said that gentleman very sweetly , but without looking round .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 8]: ` Pray be seated , Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 16]: Have the goodness to shut the door , Mr Pinch , if you please . '
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 53]: ` Certainly , sir , ' said Pinch ; not doing so , however , but holding it rather wider open than before , and beckoning nervously to somebody without : ` Mr Westlock , sir , hearing that you were come home -- ' ` Mr Pinch , Mr Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 29]: said Pecksniff , wheeling his chair about , and looking at him with an aspect of the deepest melancholy , ' I did not expect this from you .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 9]: I have not deserved this from you ! '
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 14]: ` No , but upon my word , sir -- ' urged Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 18]: ` The less you say , Mr Pinch , ' interposed the other , ` the better .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 5]: I utter no complaint .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 5]: Make no defence . '
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 24]: ` No , but do have the goodness , sir , ' cried Pinch , with great earnestness , ` if you please .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 21]: Mr Westlock , sir , going away for good and all , wishes to leave none but friends behind him .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 23]: Mr Westlock and you , sir , had a little difference the other day ; you have had many little differences . '
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 5]: ` Little differences ! '
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 3]: cried Charity .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 5]: ` Little differences ! '
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 3]: echoed Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 5]: ` My loves ! '
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 18]: said Mr Pecksniff , with the same serene upraising of his hand ; ` My dears ! '
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 82]: After a solemn pause he meekly bowed to Mr Pinch , as who should say , ` Proceed ; ' but Mr Pinch was so very much at a loss how to resume , and looked so helplessly at the two Miss Pecksniffs , that the conversation would most probably have terminated there , if a good-looking youth , newly arrived at man 's estate , had not stepped forward from the doorway and taken up the thread of the discourse .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 27]: ` Come , Mr Pecksniff , ' he said , with a smile , ` do n't let there be any ill-blood between us , pray .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 18]: I am sorry we have ever differed , and extremely sorry I have ever given you offence .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 11]: Bear me no ill-will at parting , sir . ' '
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 21]: I bear , ' answered Mr Pecksniff , mildly , ` no ill-will to any man on earth . ' '
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 22]: I told you he did n't , ' said Pinch , in an undertone ; ' I knew he did n't !
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 8]: He always says he do n't . '
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 10]: ` Then you will shake hands , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 20]: cried Westlock , advancing a step or two , and bespeaking Mr Pinch 's close attention by a glance .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 4]: ` Umph ! '
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 10]: said Mr Pecksniff , in his most winning tone .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 9]: ` You will shake hands , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 27]: ` No , John , ' said Mr Pecksniff , with a calmness quite ethereal ; ` no , I will not shake hands , John .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 5]: I have forgiven you .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 16]: I had already forgiven you , even before you ceased to reproach and taunt me .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 18]: I have embraced you in the spirit , John , which is better than shaking hands . '
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 29]: ` Pinch , ' said the youth , turning towards him , with a hearty disgust of his late master , ` what did I tell you ? '
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 35]: Poor Pinch looked down uneasily at Mr Pecksniff , whose eye was fixed upon him as it had been from the first ; and looking up at the ceiling again , made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 24]: ` As to your forgiveness , Mr Pecksniff , ' said the youth , ` I 'll not have it upon such terms .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 7]: I wo n't be forgiven . '
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 8]: ` Wo n't you , John ? '
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 8]: retorted Mr Pecksniff , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 4]: ` You must .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 6]: You ca n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 19]: Forgiveness is a high quality ; an exalted virtue ; far above YOUR control or influence , John .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 5]: I WILL forgive you .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 18]: You can not move me to remember any wrong you have ever done me , John . '
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 4]: ` Wrong ! '
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 14]: cried the other , with all the heat and impetuosity of his age .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 7]: ` Here 's a pretty fellow !
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 2]: Wrong !
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 6]: Wrong I have done him !
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 35]: He 'll not even remember the five hundred pounds he had with me under false pretences ; or the seventy pounds a year for board and lodging that would have been dear at seventeen !
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 6]: Here 's a martyr ! '
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 18]: ` Money , John , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` is the root of all evil .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 14]: I grieve to see that it is already bearing evil fruit in you .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 8]: But I will not remember its existence .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 91]: I will not even remember the conduct of that misguided person ' -- and here , although he spoke like one at peace with all the world , he used an emphasis that plainly said `` I have my eye upon the rascal now '' -- ` that misguided person who has brought you here to-night , seeking to disturb -LRB- it is a happiness to say , in vain -RRB- the heart 's repose and peace of one who would have shed his dearest blood to serve him . '
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 18]: The voice of Mr Pecksniff trembled as he spoke , and sobs were heard from his daughters .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 22]: Sounds floated on the air , moreover , as if two spirit voices had exclaimed : one , ` Beast ! '
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 7]: the other , ` Savage ! '
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 34]: ` Forgiveness , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` entire and pure forgiveness is not incompatible with a wounded heart ; perchance when the heart is wounded , it becomes a greater virtue .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 30]: With my breast still wrung and grieved to its inmost core by the ingratitude of that person , I am proud and glad to say that I forgive him .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 2]: Nay !
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 44]: I beg , ' cried Mr Pecksniff , raising his voice , as Pinch appeared about to speak , ' I beg that individual not to offer a remark ; he will truly oblige me by not uttering one word , just now .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 12]: I am not sure that I am equal to the trial .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 28]: In a very short space of time , I shall have sufficient fortitude , I trust to converse with him as if these events had never happened .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 31]: But not , ' said Mr Pecksniff , turning round again towards the fire , and waving his hand in the direction of the door , ` not now . '
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 4]: ` Bah ! '
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 17]: cried John Westlock , with the utmost disgust and disdain the monosyllable is capable of expressing .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 6]: ` Ladies , good evening .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 11]: Come , Pinch , it 's not worth thinking of .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 8]: I was right and you were wrong .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 13]: That 's small matter ; you 'll be wiser another time . '
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 53]: So saying , he clapped that dejected companion on the shoulder , turned upon his heel , and walked out into the passage , whither poor Mr Pinch , after lingering irresolutely in the parlour for a few seconds , expressing in his countenance the deepest mental misery and gloom followed him .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 17]: Then they took up the box between them , and sallied out to meet the mail .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 25]: That fleet conveyance passed , every night , the corner of a lane at some distance ; towards which point they bent their steps .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 29]: For some minutes they walked along in silence , until at length young Westlock burst into a loud laugh , and at intervals into another , and another .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 9]: Still there was no response from his companion .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 10]: ` I 'll tell you what , Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 21]: he said abruptly , after another lengthened silence -- ` You have n't half enough of the devil in you .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 3]: Half enough !
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 6]: You have n't any . '
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 16]: said Pinch with a sigh , ' I do n't know , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 7]: It 's compliment to say so .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 17]: If I have n't , I suppose , I 'm all the better for it . '
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 6]: ` All the better ! '
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 16]: repeated his companion tartly : ` All the worse , you mean to say . '
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 51]: ` And yet , ' said Pinch , pursuing his own thoughts and not this last remark on the part of his friend , ' I must have a good deal of what you call the devil in me , too , or how could I make Pecksniff so uncomfortable ?
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 36]: I would n't have occasioned him so much distress -- do n't laugh , please -- for a mine of money ; and Heaven knows I could find good use for it too , John .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 6]: How grieved he was ! '
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 5]: ` HE grieved ! '
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 4]: returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 18]: ` Why did n't you observe that the tears were almost starting out of his eyes ! '
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 3]: cried Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 28]: ` Bless my soul , John , is it nothing to see a man moved to that extent and know one 's self to be the cause !
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 17]: And did you hear him say that he could have shed his blood for me ? '
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 11]: ` Do you WANT any blood shed for you ? '
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 8]: returned his friend , with considerable irritation .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 12]: ` Does he shed anything for you that you DO want ?
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 16]: Does he shed employment for you , instruction for you , pocket money for you ?
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 21]: Does he shed even legs of mutton for you in any decent proportion to potatoes and garden stuff ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 32]: I am afraid , ' said Pinch , sighing again , ` that I am a great eater ; I ca n't disguise from myself that I 'm a great eater .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 9]: Now , you know that , John . '
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 7]: ` You a great eater ! '
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 11]: retorted his companion , with no less indignation than before .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 9]: ` How do you know you are ? '
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 36]: There appeared to be forcible matter in this inquiry , for Mr Pinch only repeated in an undertone that he had a strong misgiving on the subject , and that he greatly feared he was .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 27]: ` Besides , whether I am or no , ' he added , ` that has little or nothing to do with his thinking me ungrateful .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 47]: John , there is scarcely a sin in the world that is in my eyes such a crying one as ingratitude ; and when he taxes me with that , and believes me to be guilty of it , he makes me miserable and wretched . '
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 11]: ` Do you think he do n't know that ? '
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 5]: returned the other scornfully .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 32]: ` But come , Pinch , before I say anything more to you , just run over the reasons you have for being grateful to him at all , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 10]: Change hands first , for the box is heavy .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 4]: That 'll do .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 6]: Now , go on . '
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 25]: ` In the first place , ' said Pinch , ` he took me as his pupil for much less than he asked . '
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 16]: ` Well , ' rejoined his friend , perfectly unmoved by this instance of generosity .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 8]: ` What in the second place ? '
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 8]: ` What in the second place ? '
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 18]: cried Pinch , in a sort of desperation , ` why , everything in the second place .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 19]: My poor old grandmother died happy to think that she had put me with such an excellent man .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 37]: I have grown up in his house , I am in his confidence , I am his assistant , he allows me a salary ; when his business improves , my prospects are to improve too .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 15]: All this , and a great deal more , is in the second place .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 77]: And in the very prologue and preface to the first place , John , you must consider this , which nobody knows better than I : that I was born for much plainer and poorer things , that I am not a good hand for his kind of business , and have no talent for it , or indeed for anything else but odds and ends that are of no use or service to anybody . '
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 65]: He said this with so much earnestness , and in a tone so full of feeling , that his companion instinctively changed his manner as he sat down on the box -LRB- they had by this time reached the finger-post at the end of the lane -RRB- ; motioned him to sit down beside him ; and laid his hand upon his shoulder . '
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 22]: I believe you are one of the best fellows in the world , ' he said , ` Tom Pinch . '
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 9]: ` Not at all , ' rejoined Tom .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 27]: ` If you only knew Pecksniff as well as I do , you might say it of him , indeed , and say it truly . '
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 26]: ` I 'll say anything of him , you like , ' returned the other , ` and not another word to his disparagement . '
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 25]: ` It 's for my sake , then ; not his , I am afraid , ' said Pinch , shaking his head gravely .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 15]: ` For whose you please , Tom , so that it does please you .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 6]: He 's a famous fellow !
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 28]: HE never scraped and clawed into his pouch all your poor grandmother 's hard savings -- she was a housekeeper , was n't she , Tom ? '
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 27]: ` Yes , ' said Mr Pinch , nursing one of his large knees , and nodding his head ; ' a gentleman 's housekeeper . '
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 38]: ` HE never scraped and clawed into his pouch all her hard savings ; dazzling her with prospects of your happiness and advancement , which he knew -LRB- and no man better -RRB- never would be realised !
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 32]: HE never speculated and traded on her pride in you , and her having educated you , and on her desire that you at least should live to be a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 6]: Not he , Tom ! '
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 25]: ` No , ' said Tom , looking into his friend 's face , as if he were a little doubtful of his meaning .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 6]: ` Of course not . '
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 17]: ` So I say , ' returned the youth , ` of course he never did .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 29]: HE did n't take less than he had asked , because that less was all she had , and more than he expected ; not he , Tom !
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 89]: He does n't keep you as his assistant because you are of any use to him ; because your wonderful faith in his pretensions is of inestimable service in all his mean disputes ; because your honesty reflects honesty on him ; because your wandering about this little place all your spare hours , reading in ancient books and foreign tongues , gets noised abroad , even as far as Salisbury , making of him , Pecksniff the master , a man of learning and of vast importance .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 13]: HE gets no credit from you , Tom , not he . '
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 25]: ` Why , of course he do n't , ' said Pinch , gazing at his friend with a more troubled aspect than before .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 7]: ` Pecksniff get credit from me !
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 3]: Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 25]: ` Do n't I say that it 's ridiculous , ' rejoined the other , ` even to think of such a thing ? '
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 11]: ` Why , it 's madness , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 4]: ` Madness ! '
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 4]: returned young Westlock .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 6]: ` Certainly it 's madness .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 46]: Who but a madman would suppose he cares to hear it said on Sundays , that the volunteer who plays the organ in the church , and practises on summer evenings in the dark , is Mr Pecksniff 's young man , eh , Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 52]: Who but a madman would suppose it is the game of such a man as he , to have his name in everybody 's mouth , connected with the thousand useless odds and ends you do -LRB- and which , of course , he taught you -RRB- , eh , Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 28]: Who but a madman would suppose you advertised him hereabouts , much cheaper and much better than a chalker on the walls could , eh , Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 115]: As well might one suppose that he does n't on all occasions pour out his whole heart and soul to you ; that he does n't make you a very liberal and indeed rather an extravagant allowance ; or , to be more wild and monstrous still , if that be possible , as well might one suppose , ' and here , at every word , he struck him lightly on the breast , ` that Pecksniff traded in your nature , and that your nature was to be timid and distrustful of yourself , and trustful of all other men , but most of all , of him who least deserves it .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 8]: There would be madness , Tom ! '
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 38]: Mr Pinch had listened to all this with looks of bewilderment , which seemed to be in part occasioned by the matter of his companion 's speech , and in part by his rapid and vehement manner .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 116]: Now that he had come to a close , he drew a very long breath ; and gazing wistfully in his face as if he were unable to settle in his own mind what expression it wore , and were desirous to draw from it as good a clue to his real meaning as it was possible to obtain in the dark , was about to answer , when the sound of the mail guard 's horn came cheerily upon their ears , putting an immediate end to the conference ; greatly as it seemed to the satisfaction of the younger man , who jumped up briskly , and gave his hand to his companion .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 6]: ` Both hands , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 11]: I shall write to you from London , mind ! '
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' said Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 4]: Do , please .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 2]: Good-bye .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 2]: Good-bye .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 8]: I can hardly believe you 're going .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 11]: It seems , now , but yesterday that you came .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 2]: Good-bye !
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 6]: my dear old fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 23]: John Westlock returned his parting words with no less heartiness of manner , and sprung up to his seat upon the roof .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 29]: Off went the mail at a canter down the dark road ; the lamps gleaming brightly , and the horn awakening all the echoes , far and wide .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 46]: ` Go your ways , ' said Pinch , apostrophizing the coach ; ' I can hardly persuade myself but you 're alive , and are some great monster who visits this place at certain intervals , to bear my friends away into the world .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 59]: You 're more exulting and rampant than usual tonight , I think ; and you may well crow over your prize ; for he is a fine lad , an ingenuous lad , and has but one fault that I know of ; he do n't mean it , but he is most cruelly unjust to Pecksniff ! '
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 43]: CHAPTER THREE IN WHICH CERTAIN OTHER PERSONS ARE INTRODUCED ; ON THE SAME TERMS AS IN THE LAST CHAPTER Mention has been already made more than once , of a certain Dragon who swung and creaked complainingly before the village alehouse door .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 41]: A faded , and an ancient dragon he was ; and many a wintry storm of rain , snow , sleet , and hail , had changed his colour from a gaudy blue to a faint lack-lustre shade of grey .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 65]: But there he hung ; rearing , in a state of monstrous imbecility , on his hind legs ; waxing , with every month that passed , so much more dim and shapeless , that as you gazed at him on one side of the sign-board it seemed as if he must be gradually melting through it , and coming out upon the other .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 68]: He was a courteous and considerate dragon , too ; or had been in his distincter days ; for in the midst of his rampant feebleness , he kept one of his forepaws near his nose , as though he would say , ` Do n't mind me -- it 's only my fun ; ' while he held out the other in polite and hospitable entreaty .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 27]: Indeed it must be conceded to the whole brood of dragons of modern times , that they have made a great advance in civilisation and refinement .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 90]: They no longer demand a beautiful virgin for breakfast every morning , with as much regularity as any tame single gentleman expects his hot roll , but rest content with the society of idle bachelors and roving married men ; and they are now remarkable rather for holding aloof from the softer sex and discouraging their visits -LRB- especially on Saturday nights -RRB- , than for rudely insisting on their company without any reference to their inclinations , as they are known to have done in days of yore .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 74]: Nor is this tribute to the reclaimed animals in question so wide a digression into the realms of Natural History as it may , at first sight , appear to be ; for the present business of these pages in with the dragon who had his retreat in Mr Pecksniff 's neighbourhood , and that courteous animal being already on the carpet , there is nothing in the way of its immediate transaction .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 170]: For many years , then , he had swung and creaked , and flapped himself about , before the two windows of the best bedroom of that house of entertainment to which he lent his name ; but never in all his swinging , creaking , and flapping , had there been such a stir within its dingy precincts , as on the evening next after that upon which the incidents , detailed in the last chapter occurred ; when there was such a hurrying up and down stairs of feet , such a glancing of lights , such a whispering of voices , such a smoking and sputtering of wood newly lighted in a damp chimney , such an airing of linen , such a scorching smell of hot warming-pans , such a domestic bustle and to-do , in short , as never dragon , griffin , unicorn , or other animal of that species presided over , since they first began to interest themselves in household affairs .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 149]: An old gentleman and a young lady , travelling , unattended , in a rusty old chariot with post-horses ; coming nobody knew whence and going nobody knew whither ; had turned out of the high road , and driven unexpectedly to the Blue Dragon ; and here was the old gentleman , who had taken this step by reason of his sudden illness in the carriage , suffering the most horrible cramps and spasms , yet protesting and vowing in the very midst of his pain , that he would n't have a doctor sent for , and would n't take any remedies but those which the young lady administered from a small medicine-chest , and would n't , in a word , do anything but terrify the landlady out of her five wits , and obstinately refuse compliance with every suggestion that was made to him .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 28]: Of all the five hundred proposals for his relief which the good woman poured out in less than half an hour , he would entertain but one .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 9]: That was that he should go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 29]: And it was in the preparation of his bed and the arrangement of his chamber , that all the stir was made in the room behind the Dragon .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 42]: He was , beyond all question , very ill , and suffered exceedingly ; not the less , perhaps , because he was a strong and vigorous old man , with a will of iron , and a voice of brass .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 31]: But neither the apprehensions which he plainly entertained , at times , for his life , nor the great pain he underwent , influenced his resolution in the least degree .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 8]: He would have no person sent for .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 16]: The worse he grew , the more rigid and inflexible he became in his determination .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 46]: If they sent for any person to attend him , man , woman , or child , he would leave the house directly -LRB- so he told them -RRB- , though he quitted it on foot , and died upon the threshold of the door .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 50]: Now , there being no medical practitioner actually resident in the village , but a poor apothecary who was also a grocer and general dealer , the landlady had , upon her own responsibility , sent for him , in the very first burst and outset of the disaster .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 21]: Of course it followed , as a necessary result of his being wanted , that he was not at home .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 69]: He had gone some miles away , and was not expected home until late at night ; so the landlady , being by this time pretty well beside herself , dispatched the same messenger in all haste for Mr Pecksniff , as a learned man who could bear a deal of responsibility , and a moral man who could administer a world of comfort to a troubled mind .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 40]: That her guest had need of some efficient services under the latter head was obvious enough from the restless expressions , importing , however , rather a worldly than a spiritual anxiety , to which he gave frequent utterance .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 25]: From this last-mentioned secret errand , the messenger returned with no better news than from the first ; Mr Pecksniff was not at home .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 40]: However , they got the patient into bed without him ; and in the course of two hours , he gradually became so far better that there were much longer intervals than at first between his terms of suffering .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 30]: By degrees , he ceased to suffer at all ; though his exhaustion was occasionally so great that it suggested hardly less alarm than his actual endurance had done .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 85]: It was in one of his intervals of repose , when , looking round with great caution , and reaching uneasily out of his nest of pillows , he endeavoured , with a strange air of secrecy and distrust , to make use of the writing materials which he had ordered to be placed on a table beside him , that the young lady and the mistress of the Blue Dragon found themselves sitting side by side before the fire in the sick chamber .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 69]: The mistress of the Blue Dragon was in outward appearance just what a landlady should be : broad , buxom , comfortable , and good looking , with a face of clear red and white , which , by its jovial aspect , at once bore testimony to her hearty participation in the good things of the larder and cellar , and to their thriving and healthful influences .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 82]: She was a widow , but years ago had passed through her state of weeds , and burst into flower again ; and in full bloom she had continued ever since ; and in full bloom she was now ; with roses on her ample skirts , and roses on her bodice , roses in her cap , roses in her cheeks , -- aye , and roses , worth the gathering too , on her lips , for that matter .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 75]: She had still a bright black eye , and jet black hair ; was comely , dimpled , plump , and tight as a gooseberry ; and though she was not exactly what the world calls young , you may make an affidavit , on trust , before any mayor or magistrate in Christendom , that there are a great many young ladies in the world -LRB- blessings on them one and all ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 24]: whom you would n't like half as well , or admire half as much , as the beaming hostess of the Blue Dragon .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 86]: As this fair matron sat beside the fire , she glanced occasionally with all the pride of ownership , about the room ; which was a large apartment , such as one may see in country places , with a low roof and a sunken flooring , all downhill from the door , and a descent of two steps on the inside so exquisitely unexpected , that strangers , despite the most elaborate cautioning , usually dived in head first , as into a plunging-bath .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 68]: It was none of your frivolous and preposterously bright bedrooms , where nobody can close an eye with any kind of propriety or decent regard to the association of ideas ; but it was a good , dull , leaden , drowsy place , where every article of furniture reminded you that you came there to sleep , and that you were expected to go to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 51]: There was no wakeful reflection of the fire there , as in your modern chambers , which upon the darkest nights have a watchful consciousness of French polish ; the old Spanish mahogany winked at it now and then , as a dozing cat or dog might , nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 40]: The very size and shape , and hopeless immovability of the bedstead , and wardrobe , and in a minor degree of even the chairs and tables , provoked sleep ; they were plainly apoplectic and disposed to snore .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 28]: There were no staring portraits to remonstrate with you for being lazy ; no round-eyed birds upon the curtains , disgustingly wide awake , and insufferably prying .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 36]: The thick neutral hangings , and the dark blinds , and the heavy heap of bed-clothes , were all designed to hold in sleep , and act as nonconductors to the day and getting up .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 34]: Even the old stuffed fox upon the top of the wardrobe was devoid of any spark of vigilance , for his glass eye had fallen out , and he slumbered as he stood .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 29]: The wandering attention of the mistress of the Blue Dragon roved to these things but twice or thrice , and then for but an instant at a time .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 41]: It soon deserted them , and even the distant bed with its strange burden , for the young creature immediately before her , who , with her downcast eyes intently fixed upon the fire , sat wrapped in silent meditation .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 45]: She was very young ; apparently no more than seventeen ; timid and shrinking in her manner , and yet with a greater share of self possession and control over her emotions than usually belongs to a far more advanced period of female life .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 17]: This she had abundantly shown , but now , in her tending of the sick gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 36]: She was short in stature ; and her figure was slight , as became her years ; but all the charms of youth and maidenhood set it off , and clustered on her gentle brow .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 14]: Her face was very pale , in part no doubt from recent agitation .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 42]: Her dark brown hair , disordered from the same cause , had fallen negligently from its bonds , and hung upon her neck ; for which instance of its waywardness no male observer would have had the heart to blame it .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 45]: Her attire was that of a lady , but extremely plain ; and in her manner , even when she sat as still as she did then , there was an indefinable something which appeared to be in kindred with her scrupulously unpretending dress .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 77]: She had sat , at first looking anxiously towards the bed ; but seeing that the patient remained quiet , and was busy with his writing , she had softly moved her chair into its present place ; partly , as it seemed , from an instinctive consciousness that he desired to avoid observation ; and partly that she might , unseen by him , give some vent to the natural feelings she had hitherto suppressed .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 29]: Of all this , and much more , the rosy landlady of the Blue Dragon took as accurate note and observation as only woman can take of woman .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 33]: And at length she said , in a voice too low , she knew , to reach the bed : ` You have seen the gentleman in this way before , miss ?
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 9]: Is he used to these attacks ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 19]: I have seen him very ill before , but not so ill as he has been tonight . '
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 6]: ` What a Providence ! '
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 22]: said the landlady of the Dragon , ` that you had the prescriptions and the medicines with you , miss ! '
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 9]: ` They are intended for such an emergency .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 7]: We never travel without them . '
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 20]: thought the hostess , ` then we are in the habit of travelling , and of travelling together . '
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 33]: She was so conscious of expressing this in her face , that meeting the young lady 's eyes immediately afterwards , and being a very honest hostess , she was rather confused .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 35]: ` The gentleman -- your grandpapa ' -- she resumed , after a short pause , ` being so bent on having no assistance , must terrify you very much , miss ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 8]: I have been very much alarmed to-night .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 9]: He -- he is not my grandfather . '
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 21]: ` Father , I should have said , ' returned the hostess , sensible of having made an awkward mistake .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 10]: ` Nor my father ' said the young lady .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 27]: ` Nor , ' she added , slightly smiling with a quick perception of what the landlady was going to add , ` Nor my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 6]: We are not related . '
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 6]: ` Oh dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 46]: returned the landlady , still more embarrassed than before ; ` how could I be so very much mistaken ; knowing , as anybody in their proper senses might that when a gentleman is ill , he looks so much older than he really is ?
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 15]: That I should have called you `` Miss , '' too , ma'am ! '
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 35]: But when she had proceeded thus far , she glanced involuntarily at the third finger of the young lady 's left hand , and faltered again ; for there was no ring upon it .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 33]: ` When I told you we were not related , ' said the other mildly , but not without confusion on her own part , ' I meant not in any way .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 5]: Not even by marriage .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 8]: Did you call me , Martin ? '
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 5]: ` Call you ? '
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 24]: cried the old man , looking quickly up , and hurriedly drawing beneath the coverlet the paper on which he had been writing .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 20]: She had moved a pace or two towards the bed , but stopped immediately , and went no farther .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 12]: ` No , ' he repeated , with a petulant emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 7]: ` Why do you ask me ?
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 14]: If I had called you , what need for such a question ? '
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 51]: ` It was the creaking of the sign outside , sir , I dare say , ' observed the landlady ; a suggestion by the way -LRB- as she felt a moment after she had made it -RRB- , not at all complimentary to the voice of the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 31]: ` No matter what , ma'am , ' he rejoined : ` it was n't I. Why how you stand there , Mary , as if I had the plague !
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 23]: But they 're all afraid of me , ' he added , leaning helplessly backward on his pillow ; ` even she !
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 7]: There is a curse upon me .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 9]: What else have I to look for ? '
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 6]: ` Oh dear , no .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 20]: Oh no , I 'm sure , ' said the good-tempered landlady , rising , and going towards him .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 8]: ` Be of better cheer , sir .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 7]: These are only sick fancies . '
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 8]: ` What are only sick fancies ? '
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 3]: he retorted .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 8]: ` What do you know about fancies ?
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 6]: Who told you about fancies ?
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 4]: The old story !
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 3]: Fancies ! '
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 13]: ` Only see again there , how you take one up ! '
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 13]: said the mistress of the Blue Dragon , with unimpaired good humour .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 22]: ` Dear heart alive , there is no harm in the word , sir , if it is an old one .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 18]: Folks in good health have their fancies , too , and strange ones , every day . '
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 21]: Harmless as this speech appeared to be , it acted on the traveller 's distrust , like oil on fire .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 63]: He raised his head up in the bed , and , fixing on her two dark eyes whose brightness was exaggerated by the paleness of his hollow cheeks , as they in turn , together with his straggling locks of long grey hair , were rendered whiter by the tight black velvet skullcap which he wore , he searched her face intently .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 27]: you begin too soon , ' he said , in so low a voice that he seemed to be thinking it , rather than addressing her .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 7]: ` But you lose no time .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 11]: You do your errand , and you earn your fee .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 9]: Now , who may be your client ? '
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 28]: The landlady looked in great astonishment at her whom he called Mary , and finding no rejoinder in the drooping face , looked back again at him .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 48]: At first she had recoiled involuntarily , supposing him disordered in his mind ; but the slow composure of his manner , and the settled purpose announced in his strong features , and gathering , most of all , about his puckered mouth , forbade the supposition .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 14]: ` Come , ' he said , ` tell me who is it ?
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 18]: Being here , it is not very hard for me to guess , you may suppose . '
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 39]: ` Martin , ' interposed the young lady , laying her hand upon his arm ; ` reflect how short a time we have been in this house , and that even your name is unknown here . '
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 64]: ` Unless , ' he said , ` you -- ' He was evidently tempted to express a suspicion of her having broken his confidence in favour of the landlady , but either remembering her tender nursing , or being moved in some sort by her face , he checked himself , and changing his uneasy posture in the bed , was silent .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 23]: said Mrs Lupin ; for in that name the Blue Dragon was licensed to furnish entertainment , both to man and beast .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 11]: ` Now , you will be well again , sir .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 16]: You forgot , for the moment , that there were none but friends here . '
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 28]: cried the old man , moaning impatiently , as he tossed one restless arm upon the coverlet ; ` why do you talk to me of friends !
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 19]: Can you or anybody teach me to know who are my friends , and who my enemies ? '
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 24]: ` At least , ' urged Mrs Lupin , gently , ` this young lady is your friend , I am sure . '
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 26]: ` She has no temptation to be otherwise , ' cried the old man , like one whose hope and confidence were utterly exhausted . '
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 5]: I suppose she is .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 3]: Heaven knows .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 8]: There , let me try to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 8]: Leave the candle where it is . '
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 33]: As they retired from the bed , he drew forth the writing which had occupied him so long , and holding it in the flame of the taper burnt it to ashes .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 30]: That done , he extinguished the light , and turning his face away with a heavy sigh , drew the coverlet about his head , and lay quite still .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 39]: This destruction of the paper , both as being strangely inconsistent with the labour he had devoted to it , and as involving considerable danger of fire to the Dragon , occasioned Mrs Lupin not a little consternation .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 62]: But the young lady evincing no surprise , curiosity , or alarm , whispered her , with many thanks for her solicitude and company , that she would remain there some time longer ; and that she begged her not to share her watch , as she was well used to being alone , and would pass the time in reading .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 45]: Mrs Lupin had her full share and dividend of that large capital of curiosity which is inherited by her sex , and at another time it might have been difficult so to impress this hint upon her as to induce her to take it .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 37]: But now , in sheer wonder and amazement at these mysteries , she withdrew at once , and repairing straightway to her own little parlour below stairs , sat down in her easy-chair with unnatural composure .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 45]: At this very crisis , a step was heard in the entry , and Mr Pecksniff , looking sweetly over the half-door of the bar , and into the vista of snug privacy beyond , murmured : ` Good evening , Mrs Lupin ! '
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 8]: ` Oh dear me , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 19]: she cried , advancing to receive him , ' I am so very glad you have come . '
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 23]: ` And I am very glad I have come , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` if I can be of service .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 8]: I am very glad I have come .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 10]: What is the matter , Mrs Lupin ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 24]: A gentleman taken ill upon the road , has been so very bad upstairs , sir , ' said the tearful hostess . '
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 19]: A gentleman taken ill upon the road , has been so very bad upstairs , has he ? '
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 4]: repeated Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 6]: ` Well , well ! '
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 146]: Now there was nothing that one may call decidedly original in this remark , nor can it be exactly said to have contained any wise precept theretofore unknown to mankind , or to have opened any hidden source of consolation ; but Mr Pecksniff 's manner was so bland , and he nodded his head so soothingly , and showed in everything such an affable sense of his own excellence , that anybody would have been , as Mrs Lupin was , comforted by the mere voice and presence of such a man ; and , though he had merely said ' a verb must agree with its nominative case in number and person , my good friend , ' or ` eight times eight are sixty-four , my worthy soul , ' must have felt deeply grateful to him for his humanity and wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 42]: ` And how , ' asked Mr Pecksniff , drawing off his gloves and warming his hands before the fire , as benevolently as if they were somebody else 's , not his ; ` and how is he now ? '
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 14]: ` He is better , and quite tranquil , ' answered Mrs Lupin .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 14]: ` He is better , and quite tranquil , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 4]: ` Very well !
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 4]: Ve-ry well ! '
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 28]: Here again , though the statement was Mrs Lupin 's and not Mr Pecksniff 's , Mr Pecksniff made it his own and consoled her with it .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 23]: It was not much when Mrs Lupin said it , but it was a whole book when Mr Pecksniff said it . '
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 28]: I observe , ' he seemed to say , ` and through me , morality in general remarks , that he is better and quite tranquil . '
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 36]: ` There must be weighty matters on his mind , though , ' said the hostess , shaking her head , ` for he talks , sir , in the strangest way you ever heard .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 25]: He is far from easy in his thoughts , and wants some proper advice from those whose goodness makes it worth his having . '
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 19]: ` Then , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` he is the sort of customer for me . '
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 17]: But though he said this in the plainest language , he did n't speak a word .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 12]: He only shook his head ; disparagingly of himself too . '
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 33]: I am afraid , sir , ' continued the landlady , first looking round to assure herself that there was nobody within hearing , and then looking down upon the floor . '
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 38]: I am very much afraid , sir , that his conscience is troubled by his not being related to -- or -- or even married to -- a very young lady -- ' ` Mrs Lupin ! '
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 34]: said Mr Pecksniff , holding up his hand with something in his manner as nearly approaching to severity as any expression of his , mild being that he was , could ever do .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 3]: ` Person !
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 5]: young person ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 47]: A very young person , ' said Mrs Lupin , curtseying and blushing ; ' -- I beg your pardon , sir , but I have been so hurried to-night , that I do n't know what I say -- who is with him now . '
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 59]: ` Who is with him now , ' ruminated Mr Pecksniff , warming his back -LRB- as he had warmed his hands -RRB- as if it were a widow 's back , or an orphan 's back , or an enemy 's back , or a back that any less excellent man would have suffered to be cold .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 9]: ` Oh dear me , dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 38]: ` At the same time I am bound to say , and I do say with all my heart , ' observed the hostess , earnestly , ` that her looks and manner almost disarm suspicion . '
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 19]: ` Your suspicion , Mrs Lupin , ' said Mr Pecksniff gravely , ` is very natural . '
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 50]: Touching which remark , let it be written down to their confusion , that the enemies of this worthy man unblushingly maintained that he always said of what was very bad , that it was very natural ; and that he unconsciously betrayed his own nature in doing so .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 23]: ` Your suspicion , Mrs Lupin , ' he repeated , ` is very natural , and I have no doubt correct .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 8]: I will wait upon these travellers . '
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 37]: With that he took off his great-coat , and having run his fingers through his hair , thrust one hand gently in the bosom of his waist-coat and meekly signed to her to lead the way .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 6]: ` Shall I knock ? '
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 11]: asked Mrs Lupin , when they reached the chamber door .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 15]: ` No , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` enter if you please . '
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 20]: They went in on tiptoe ; or rather the hostess took that precaution for Mr Pecksniff always walked softly .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 19]: The old gentleman was still asleep , and his young companion still sat reading by the fire . '
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 31]: I am afraid , ' said Mr Pecksniff , pausing at the door , and giving his head a melancholy roll , ' I am afraid that this looks artful .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 18]: I am afraid , Mrs Lupin , do you know , that this looks very artful ! '
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 26]: As he finished this whisper , he advanced before the hostess ; and at the same time the young lady , hearing footsteps , rose .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 22]: Mr Pecksniff glanced at the volume she held , and whispered Mrs Lupin again ; if possible , with increased despondency .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 16]: ` Yes , ma'am , ' he said , ` it is a good book .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 7]: I was fearful of that beforehand .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 13]: I am apprehensive that this is a very deep thing indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 7]: ` What gentleman is this ? '
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 8]: inquired the object of his virtuous doubts .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 3]: ` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 20]: do n't trouble yourself , ma'am , ' said Mr Pecksniff , as the landlady was about to answer .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 69]: ` This young ' -- in spite of himself he hesitated when `` person '' rose to his lips , and substituted another word : ` this young stranger , Mrs Lupin , will excuse me for replying briefly , that I reside in this village ; it may be in an influential manner , however , undeserved ; and that I have been summoned here by you .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 21]: I am here , as I am everywhere , I hope , in sympathy for the sick and sorry . '
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 69]: With these impressive words , Mr Pecksniff passed over to the bedside , where , after patting the counterpane once or twice in a very solemn manner , as if by that means he gained a clear insight into the patient 's disorder , he took his seat in a large arm-chair , and in an attitude of some thoughtfulness and much comfort , waited for his waking .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 32]: Whatever objection the young lady urged to Mrs Lupin went no further , for nothing more was said to Mr Pecksniff , and Mr Pecksniff said nothing more to anybody else .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 38]: Full half an hour elapsed before the old man stirred , but at length he turned himself in bed , and , though not yet awake , gave tokens that his sleep was drawing to an end .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 25]: By little and little he removed the bed-clothes from about his head , and turned still more towards the side where Mr Pecksniff sat .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 36]: In course of time his eyes opened ; and he lay for a few moments as people newly roused sometimes will , gazing indolently at his visitor , without any distinct consciousness of his presence .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 31]: There was nothing remarkable in these proceedings , except the influence they worked on Mr Pecksniff , which could hardly have been surpassed by the most marvellous of natural phenomena .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 81]: Gradually his hands became tightly clasped upon the elbows of the chair , his eyes dilated with surprise , his mouth opened , his hair stood more erect upon his forehead than its custom was , until , at length , when the old man rose in bed , and stared at him with scarcely less emotion than he showed himself , the Pecksniff doubts were all resolved , and he exclaimed aloud : ` You ARE Martin Chuzzlewit ! '
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 33]: His consternation of surprise was so genuine , that the old man , with all the disposition that he clearly entertained to believe it assumed , was convinced of its reality . '
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 33]: I am Martin Chuzzlewit , ' he said , bitterly : ` and Martin Chuzzlewit wishes you had been hanged , before you had come here to disturb him in his sleep .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 9]: Why , I dreamed of this fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 24]: he said , lying down again , and turning away his face , ` before I knew that he was near me ! '
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 10]: ` My good cousin -- ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 3]: ` There !
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 6]: His very first words ! '
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 22]: cried the old man , shaking his grey head to and fro upon the pillow , and throwing up his hands .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 11]: ` In his very first words he asserts his relationship !
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 10]: I knew he would ; they all do it !
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 13]: Near or distant , blood or water , it 's all one .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 2]: Ugh !
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 24]: What a calendar of deceit , and lying , and false-witnessing , the sound of any word of kindred opens before me ! '
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 50]: ` Pray do not be hasty , Mr Chuzzlewit , ' said Pecksniff , in a tone that was at once in the sublimest degree compassionate and dispassionate ; for he had by this time recovered from his surprise , and was in full possession of his virtuous self .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 13]: ` You will regret being hasty , I know you will . '
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 5]: ` You know ! '
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 5]: said Martin , contemptuously .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 8]: ` Yes , ' retorted Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 29]: ` Aye , aye , Mr Chuzzlewit ; and do n't imagine that I mean to court or flatter you ; for nothing is further from my intention .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 26]: Neither , sir , need you entertain the least misgiving that I shall repeat that obnoxious word which has given you so much offence already .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 4]: Why should I ?
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 9]: What do I expect or want from you ?
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 28]: There is nothing in your possession that I know of , Mr Chuzzlewit , which is much to be coveted for the happiness it brings you . '
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 12]: ` That 's true enough , ' muttered the old man .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 86]: ` Apart from that consideration , ' said Mr Pecksniff , watchful of the effect he made , ` it must be plain to you -LRB- I am sure -RRB- by this time , that if I had wished to insinuate myself into your good opinion , I should have been , of all things , careful not to address you as a relative ; knowing your humour , and being quite certain beforehand that I could not have a worse letter of recommendation . '
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 51]: Martin made not any verbal answer ; but he as clearly implied though only by a motion of his legs beneath the bed-clothes , that there was reason in this , and that he could not dispute it , as if he had said as much in good set terms .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 47]: ` No , ' said Mr Pecksniff , keeping his hand in his waistcoat as though he were ready , on the shortest notice , to produce his heart for Martin Chuzzlewit 's inspection , ' I came here to offer my services to a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 20]: I make no offer of them to you , because I know you would distrust me if I did .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 40]: But lying on that bed , sir , I regard you as a stranger , and I have just that amount of interest in you which I hope I should feel in any stranger , circumstanced as you are .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 21]: Beyond that , I am quite as indifferent to you , Mr Chuzzlewit , as you are to me . '
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 45]: Having said which , Mr Pecksniff threw himself back in the easy-chair ; so radiant with ingenuous honesty , that Mrs Lupin almost wondered not to see a stained-glass Glory , such as the Saint wore in the church , shining about his head .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 5]: A long pause succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 14]: The old man , with increased restlessness , changed his posture several times .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 13]: Mrs Lupin and the young lady gazed in silence at the counterpane .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 21]: Mr Pecksniff toyed abstractedly with his eye-glass , and kept his eyes shut , that he might ruminate the better .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 4]: ` Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 16]: he said at last , opening them suddenly , and looking towards the bed . '
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 5]: I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 5]: I thought you spoke .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 25]: Mrs Lupin , ' he continued , slowly rising ' I am not aware that I can be of any service to you here .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 17]: The gentleman is better , and you are as good a nurse as he can have .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 3]: Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 38]: This last note of interrogation bore reference to another change of posture on the old man 's part , which brought his face towards Mr Pecksniff for the first time since he had turned away from him .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 56]: ` If you desire to speak to me before I go , sir , ' continued that gentleman , after another pause , ` you may command my leisure ; but I must stipulate , in justice to myself , that you do so as to a stranger , strictly as to a stranger . '
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 75]: Now if Mr Pecksniff knew , from anything Martin Chuzzlewit had expressed in gestures , that he wanted to speak to him , he could only have found it out on some such principle as prevails in melodramas , and in virtue of which the elderly farmer with the comic son always knows what the dumb girl means when she takes refuge in his garden , and relates her personal memoirs in incomprehensible pantomime .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 38]: But without stopping to make any inquiry on this point , Martin Chuzzlewit signed to his young companion to withdraw , which she immediately did , along with the landlady leaving him and Mr Pecksniff alone together .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 42]: For some time they looked at each other in silence ; or rather the old man looked at Mr Pecksniff , and Mr Pecksniff again closing his eyes on all outward objects , took an inward survey of his own breast .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 26]: That it amply repaid him for his trouble , and afforded a delicious and enchanting prospect , was clear from the expression of his face .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 25]: ` You wish me to speak to you as to a total stranger , ' said the old man , ` do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 39]: Mr Pecksniff replied , by a shrug of his shoulders and an apparent turning round of his eyes in their sockets before he opened them , that he was still reduced to the necessity of entertaining that desire .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 10]: ` You shall be gratified , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 9]: ` Sir , I am a rich man .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 13]: Not so rich as some suppose , perhaps , but yet wealthy .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 24]: I am not a miser sir , though even that charge is made against me , as I hear , and currently believed .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 7]: I have no pleasure in hoarding .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 26]: I have no pleasure in the possession of money , The devil that we call by that name can give me nothing but unhappiness . '
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 36]: It would be no description of Mr Pecksniff 's gentleness of manner to adopt the common parlance , and say that he looked at this moment as if butter would n't melt in his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 33]: He rather looked as if any quantity of butter might have been made out of him , by churning the milk of human kindness , as it spouted upwards from his heart .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 28]: ` For the same reason that I am not a hoarder of money , ' said the old man , ' I am not lavish of it .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 28]: Some people find their gratification in storing it up ; and others theirs in parting with it ; but I have no gratification connected with the thing .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 14]: Pain and bitterness are the only goods it ever could procure for me .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 4]: I hate it .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 19]: It is a spectre walking before me through the world , and making every social pleasure hideous . '
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 65]: A thought arose in Pecksniff 's mind , which must have instantly mounted to his face , or Martin Chuzzlewit would not have resumed as quickly and as sternly as he did : ` You would advise me for my peace of mind , to get rid of this source of misery , and transfer it to some one who could bear it better .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 18]: Even you , perhaps , would rid me of a burden under which I suffer so grievously .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 33]: But , kind stranger , ' said the old man , whose every feature darkened as he spoke , ` good Christian stranger , that is a main part of my trouble .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 49]: In other hands , I have known money do good ; in other hands I have known it triumphed in , and boasted of with reason , as the master-key to all the brazen gates that close upon the paths to worldly honour , fortune , and enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 29]: To what man or woman ; to what worthy , honest , incorruptible creature ; shall I confide such a talisman , either now or when I die ?
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 7]: Do you know any such person ?
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 28]: YOUR virtues are of course inestimable , but can you tell me of any other living creature who will bear the test of contact with myself ? '
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 9]: ` Of contact with yourself , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 4]: echoed Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 20]: ` Aye , ' returned the old man , ` the test of contact with me -- with me .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 28]: You have heard of him whose misery -LRB- the gratification of his own foolish wish -RRB- was , that he turned every thing he touched into gold .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 46]: The curse of my existence , and the realisation of my own mad desire is that by the golden standard which I bear about me , I am doomed to try the metal of all other men , and find it false and hollow . '
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 15]: Mr Pecksniff shook his head , and said , ` You think so . '
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 15]: ` Oh yes , ' cried the old man , ' I think so !
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 21]: and in your telling me `` I think so , '' I recognize the true unworldly ring of YOUR metal .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 73]: I tell you , man , ' he added , with increasing bitterness , ` that I have gone , a rich man , among people of all grades and kinds ; relatives , friends , and strangers ; among people in whom , when I was poor , I had confidence , and justly , for they never once deceived me then , or , to me , wronged each other .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 45]: But I have never found one nature , no , not one , in which , being wealthy and alone , I was not forced to detect the latent corruption that lay hid within it waiting for such as I to bring it forth .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 68]: Treachery , deceit , and low design ; hatred of competitors , real or fancied , for my favour ; meanness , falsehood , baseness , and servility ; or , ' and here he looked closely in his cousin 's eyes , ` or an assumption of honest independence , almost worse than all ; these are the beauties which my wealth has brought to light .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 29]: Brother against brother , child against parent , friends treading on the faces of friends , this is the social company by whom my way has been attended .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 31]: There are stories told -- they may be true or false -- of rich men who , in the garb of poverty , have found out virtue and rewarded it .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 9]: They were dolts and idiots for their pains .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 11]: They should have made the search in their own characters .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 61]: They should have shown themselves fit objects to be robbed and preyed upon and plotted against and adulated by any knaves , who , but for joy , would have spat upon their coffins when they died their dupes ; and then their search would have ended as mine has done , and they would be what I am . '
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 55]: Mr Pecksniff , not at all knowing what it might be best to say in the momentary pause which ensued upon these remarks , made an elaborate demonstration of intending to deliver something very oracular indeed ; trusting to the certainty of the old man interrupting him , before he should utter a word .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 43]: Nor was he mistaken , for Martin Chuzzlewit having taken breath , went on to say : ` Hear me to an end ; judge what profit you are like to gain from any repetition of this visit ; and leave me .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 119]: I have so corrupted and changed the nature of all those who have ever attended on me , by breeding avaricious plots and hopes within them ; I have engendered such domestic strife and discord , by tarrying even with members of my own family ; I have been such a lighted torch in peaceful homes , kindling up all the inflammable gases and vapours in their moral atmosphere , which , but for me , might have proved harmless to the end , that I have , I may say , fled from all who knew me , and taking refuge in secret places have lived , of late , the life of one who is hunted .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 11]: The young girl whom you just now saw -- what !
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 9]: your eye lightens when I talk of her !
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 9]: You hate her already , do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 8]: ` Upon my word , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 17]: said Mr Pecksniff , laying his hand upon his breast , and dropping his eyelids . '
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 36]: I forgot , ' cried the old man , looking at him with a keenness which the other seemed to feel , although he did not raise his eyes so as to see it . '
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 5]: I ask your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 7]: I forgot you were a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 15]: For the moment you reminded me of one Pecksniff , a cousin of mine .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 42]: As I was saying -- the young girl whom you just now saw , is an orphan child , whom , with one steady purpose , I have bred and educated , or , if you prefer the word , adopted .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 19]: For a year or more she has been my constant companion , and she is my only one .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 41]: I have taken , as she knows , a solemn oath never to leave her sixpence when I die , but while I live I make her an annual allowance ; not extravagant in its amount and yet not stinted .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 40]: There is a compact between us that no term of affectionate cajolery shall ever be addressed by either to the other , but that she shall call me always by my Christian name ; I her , by hers .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 37]: She is bound to me in life by ties of interest , and losing by my death , and having no expectation disappointed , will mourn it , perhaps ; though for that I care little .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 13]: This is the only kind of friend I have or will have .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 25]: Judge from such premises what a profitable hour you have spent in coming here , and leave me , to return no more . '
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 14]: With these words , the old man fell slowly back upon his pillow .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 22]: Mr Pecksniff as slowly rose , and , with a prefatory hem , began as follows : ` Mr Chuzzlewit . '
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 3]: ` There .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 3]: Go ! '
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 4]: interposed the other .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 5]: ` Enough of this .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 8]: I am weary of you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 34]: I am sorry for that , sir , ' rejoined Mr Pecksniff , ` because I have a duty to discharge , from which , depend upon it , I shall not shrink .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 10]: No , sir , I shall not shrink . '
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 57]: It is a lamentable fact , that as Mr Pecksniff stood erect beside the bed , in all the dignity of Goodness , and addressed him thus , the old man cast an angry glance towards the candlestick , as if he were possessed by a strong inclination to launch it at his cousin 's head .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 22]: But he constrained himself , and pointing with his finger to the door , informed him that his road lay there .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 16]: ` Thank you , ' said Mr Pecksniff ; ' I am aware of that .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 4]: I am going .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 39]: But before I go , I crave your leave to speak , and more than that , Mr Chuzzlewit , I must and will -- yes indeed , I repeat it , must and will -- be heard .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 15]: I am not surprised , sir , at anything you have told me tonight .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 19]: It is natural , very natural , and the greater part of it was known to me before .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 43]: I will not say , ' continued Mr Pecksniff , drawing out his pocket-handkerchief , and winking with both eyes at once , as it were , against his will , ' I will not say that you are mistaken in me .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 16]: While you are in your present mood I would not say so for the world .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 48]: I almost wish , indeed , that I had a different nature , that I might repress even this slight confession of weakness ; which I can not disguise from you ; which I feel is humiliating ; but which you will have the goodness to excuse .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 50]: We will say , if you please , ' added Mr Pecksniff , with great tenderness of manner , ` that it arises from a cold in the head , or is attributable to snuff , or smelling-salts , or onions , or anything but the real cause . '
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 15]: Here he paused for an instant , and concealed his face behind his pocket-handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 89]: Then , smiling faintly , and holding the bed furniture with one hand , he resumed : ` But , Mr Chuzzlewit , while I am forgetful of myself , I owe it to myself , and to my character -- aye , sir , and I HAVE a character which is very dear to me , and will be the best inheritance of my two daughters -- to tell you , on behalf of another , that your conduct is wrong , unnatural , indefensible , monstrous .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 83]: And I tell you , sir , ' said Mr Pecksniff , towering on tiptoe among the curtains , as if he were literally rising above all worldly considerations , and were fain to hold on tight , to keep himself from darting skyward like a rocket , ' I tell you without fear or favour , that it will not do for you to be unmindful of your grandson , young Martin , who has the strongest natural claim upon you .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 16]: It will not do , sir , ' repeated Mr Pecksniff , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 13]: ` You may think it will do , but it wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 20]: You must provide for that young man ; you shall provide for him ; you WILL provide for him .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 23]: I believe , ' said Mr Pecksniff , glancing at the pen-and-ink , ` that in secret you have already done so .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 6]: Bless you for doing so .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 8]: Bless you for doing right , sir .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 6]: Bless you for hating me .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 5]: And good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 24]: So saying , Mr Pecksniff waved his right hand with much solemnity , and once more inserting it in his waistcoat , departed .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 13]: There was emotion in his manner , but his step was firm .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 11]: Subject to human weaknesses , he was upheld by conscience .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 35]: Martin lay for some time , with an expression on his face of silent wonder , not unmixed with rage ; at length he muttered in a whisper : ` What does this mean ?
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 18]: Can the false-hearted boy have chosen such a tool as yonder fellow who has just gone out ?
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 3]: Why not !
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 19]: He has conspired against me , like the rest , and they are but birds of one feather .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 8]: A new plot ; a new plot !
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 7]: Oh self , self , self !
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 8]: At every turn nothing but self ! '
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 22]: He fell to trifling , as he ceased to speak , with the ashes of the burnt paper in the candlestick .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 21]: He did so , at first , in pure abstraction , but they presently became the subject of his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 26]: ` Another will made and destroyed , ' he said , ` nothing determined on , nothing done , and I might have died to-night !
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 50]: I plainly see to what foul uses all this money will be put at last , ' he cried , almost writhing in the bed ; ` after filling me with cares and miseries all my life , it will perpetuate discord and bad passions when I am dead .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 5]: So it always is .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 33]: What lawsuits grow out of the graves of rich men , every day ; sowing perjury , hatred , and lies among near kindred , where there should be nothing but love !
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 11]: Heaven help us , we have much to answer for !
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 7]: Oh self , self , self !
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 12]: Every man for himself , and no creature for me ! '
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 3]: Universal self !
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 23]: Was there nothing of its shadow in these reflections , and in the history of Martin Chuzzlewit , on his own showing ?
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 124]: CHAPTER FOUR FROM WHICH IT WILL APPEAR THAT IF UNION BE STRENGTH , AND FAMILY AFFECTION BE PLEASANT TO CONTEMPLATE , THE CHUZZLEWITS WERE THE STRONGEST AND MOST AGREEABLE FAMILY IN THE WORLD That worthy man Mr Pecksniff having taken leave of his cousin in the solemn terms recited in the last chapter , withdrew to his own home , and remained there three whole days ; not so much as going out for a walk beyond the boundaries of his own garden , lest he should be hastily summoned to the bedside of his penitent and remorseful relative , whom , in his ample benevolence , he had made up his mind to forgive unconditionally , and to love on any terms .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 40]: But such was the obstinacy and such the bitter nature of that stern old man , that no repentant summons came ; and the fourth day found Mr Pecksniff apparently much farther from his Christian object than the first .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 89]: During the whole of this interval , he haunted the Dragon at all times and seasons in the day and night , and , returning good for evil evinced the deepest solicitude in the progress of the obdurate invalid , in so much that Mrs Lupin was fairly melted by his disinterested anxiety -LRB- for he often particularly required her to take notice that he would do the same by any stranger or pauper in the like condition -RRB- , and shed many tears of admiration and delight .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 42]: Meantime , old Martin Chuzzlewit remained shut up in his own chamber , and saw no person but his young companion , saving the hostess of the Blue Dragon , who was , at certain times , admitted to his presence .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 17]: So surely as she came into the room , however , Martin feigned to fall asleep .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 53]: It was only when he and the young lady were alone , that he would utter a word , even in answer to the simplest inquiry ; though Mr Pecksniff could make out , by hard listening at the door , that they two being left together , he was talkative enough .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 68]: It happened on the fourth evening , that Mr Pecksniff walking , as usual , into the bar of the Dragon and finding no Mrs Lupin there , went straight upstairs ; purposing , in the fervour of his affectionate zeal , to apply his ear once more to the keyhole , and quiet his mind by assuring himself that the hard-hearted patient was going on well .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 104]: It happened that Mr Pecksniff , coming softly upon the dark passage into which a spiral ray of light usually darted through the same keyhole , was astonished to find no such ray visible ; and it happened that Mr Pecksniff , when he had felt his way to the chamber-door , stooping hurriedly down to ascertain by personal inspection whether the jealousy of the old man had caused this keyhole to be stopped on the inside , brought his head into such violent contact with another head that he could not help uttering in an audible voice the monosyllable ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 18]: which was , as it were , sharply unscrewed and jerked out of him by very anguish .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 108]: It happened then , and lastly , that Mr Pecksniff found himself immediately collared by something which smelt like several damp umbrellas , a barrel of beer , a cask of warm brandy-and-water , and a small parlour-full of stale tobacco smoke , mixed ; and was straightway led downstairs into the bar from which he had lately come , where he found himself standing opposite to , and in the grasp of , a perfectly strange gentleman of still stranger appearance who , with his disengaged hand , rubbed his own head very hard , and looked at him , Pecksniff , with an evil countenance .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 63]: The gentleman was of that order of appearance which is currently termed shabby-genteel , though in respect of his dress he can hardly be said to have been in any extremities , as his fingers were a long way out of his gloves , and the soles of his feet were at an inconvenient distance from the upper leather of his boots .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 54]: His nether garments were of a bluish grey -- violent in its colours once , but sobered now by age and dinginess -- and were so stretched and strained in a tough conflict between his braces and his straps , that they appeared every moment in danger of flying asunder at the knees .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 21]: His coat , in colour blue and of a military cut , was buttoned and frogged up to his chin .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 32]: His cravat was , in hue and pattern , like one of those mantles which hairdressers are accustomed to wrap about their clients , during the progress of the professional mysteries .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 24]: His hat had arrived at such a pass that it would have been hard to determine whether it was originally white or black .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 48]: But he wore a moustache -- a shaggy moustache too ; nothing in the meek and merciful way , but quite in the fierce and scornful style ; the regular Satanic sort of thing -- and he wore , besides , a vast quantity of unbrushed hair .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 44]: He was very dirty and very jaunty ; very bold and very mean ; very swaggering and very slinking ; very much like a man who might have been something better , and unspeakably like a man who deserved to be something worse .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 12]: ` You were eaves-dropping at that door , you vagabond ! '
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 4]: said this gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 33]: Mr Pecksniff cast him off , as Saint George might have repudiated the Dragon in that animal 's last moments , and said : ` Where is Mrs Lupin , I wonder !
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 20]: can the good woman possibly be aware that there is a person here who -- ' ` Stay ! '
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 4]: said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 5]: ` Wait a bit .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 4]: She DOES know .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 4]: What then ? '
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 7]: ` What then , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 4]: cried Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 4]: ` What then ?
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 18]: Do you know , sir , that I am the friend and relative of that sick gentleman ?
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 38]: That I am his protector , his guardian , his -- ' ` Not his niece 's husband , ' interposed the stranger , ` I 'll be sworn ; for he was there before you . '
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 8]: said Mr Pecksniff , with indignant surprise .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 10]: ` What do you tell me , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 6]: ` Wait a bit ! '
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 21]: cried the other , ` Perhaps you are a cousin -- the cousin who lives in this place ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 17]: I AM the cousin who lives in this place , ' replied the man of worth .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 7]: ` Your name is Pecksniff ? '
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 4]: said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 6]: ` It is . ' '
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 44]: I am proud to know you , and I ask your pardon , ' said the gentleman , touching his hat , and subsequently diving behind his cravat for a shirt-collar , which however he did not succeed in bringing to the surface .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 19]: ` You behold in me , sir , one who has also an interest in that gentleman upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 5]: Wait a bit . '
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 80]: As he said this , he touched the tip of his high nose , by way of intimation that he would let Mr Pecksniff into a secret presently ; and pulling off his hat , began to search inside the crown among a mass of crumpled documents and small pieces of what may be called the bark of broken cigars ; whence he presently selected the cover of an old letter , begrimed with dirt and redolent of tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 14]: ` Read that , ' he cried , giving it to Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 15]: ` This is addressed to Chevy Slyme , Esquire , ' said that gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 12]: ` You know Chevy Slyme , Esquire , I believe ? '
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 4]: returned the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 27]: Mr Pecksniff shrugged his shoulders as though he would say ' I know there is such a person , and I am sorry for it . '
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 9]: ` Very good , ' remarked the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 10]: ` That is my interest and business here . '
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 15]: With that he made another dive for his shirt-collar and brought up a string .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 23]: ` Now , this is very distressing , my friend , ' said Mr Pecksniff , shaking his head and smiling composedly .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 24]: ` It is very distressing to me , to be compelled to say that you are not the person you claim to be .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 28]: I know Mr Slyme , my friend ; this will not do ; honesty is the best policy you had better not ; you had indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 30]: ` Stop ' cried the gentleman , stretching forth his right arm , which was so tightly wedged into his threadbare sleeve that it looked like a cloth sausage .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 6]: ` Wait a bit ! '
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 17]: He paused to establish himself immediately in front of the fire with his back towards it .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 38]: Then gathering the skirts of his coat under his left arm , and smoothing his moustache with his right thumb and forefinger , he resumed : ' I understand your mistake , and I am not offended .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 5]: Because it 's complimentary .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 11]: You suppose I would set myself up for Chevy Slyme .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 29]: Sir , if there is a man on earth whom a gentleman would feel proud and honoured to be mistaken for , that man is my friend Slyme .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 45]: For he is , without an exception , the highest-minded , the most independent-spirited , most original , spiritual , classical , talented , the most thoroughly Shakspearian , if not Miltonic , and at the same time the most disgustingly-unappreciated dog I know .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 16]: But , sir , I have not the vanity to attempt to pass for Slyme .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 28]: Any other man in the wide world , I am equal to ; but Slyme is , I frankly confess , a great many cuts above me .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 7]: Therefore you are wrong . ' '
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 18]: I judged from this , ' said Mr Pecksniff , holding out the cover of the letter .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 11]: ` No doubt you did , ' returned the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 20]: ` But , Mr Pecksniff , the whole thing resolves itself into an instance of the peculiarities of genius .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 9]: Every man of true genius has his peculiarity .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 19]: Sir , the peculiarity of my friend Slyme is , that he is always waiting round the corner .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 9]: He is perpetually round the corner , sir .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 9]: He is round the corner at this instant .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 72]: Now , ' said the gentleman , shaking his forefinger before his nose , and planting his legs wider apart as he looked attentively in Mr Pecksniff 's face , ` that is a remarkably curious and interesting trait in Mr Slyme 's character ; and whenever Slyme 's life comes to be written , that trait must be thoroughly worked out by his biographer or society will not be satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 10]: Observe me , society will not be satisfied ! '
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 4]: Mr Pecksniff coughed .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 56]: ` Slyme 's biographer , sir , whoever he may be , ' resumed the gentleman , ` must apply to me ; or , if I am gone to that what 's - his-name from which no thingumbob comes back , he must apply to my executors for leave to search among my papers .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 31]: I have taken a few notes in my poor way , of some of that man 's proceedings -- my adopted brother , sir , -- which would amaze you .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 47]: He made use of an expression , sir , only on the fifteenth of last month when he could n't meet a little bill and the other party would n't renew , which would have done honour to Napoleon Bonaparte in addressing the French army . '
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 53]: ` And pray , ' asked Mr Pecksniff , obviously not quite at his ease , ` what may be Mr Slyme 's business here , if I may be permitted to inquire , who am compelled by a regard for my own character to disavow all interest in his proceedings ? '
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 42]: ` In the first place , ' returned the gentleman , ` you will permit me to say , that I object to that remark , and that I strongly and indignantly protest against it on behalf of my friend Slyme .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 14]: In the next place , you will give me leave to introduce myself .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 8]: My name , sir , is Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 25]: The name of Montague Tigg will perhaps be familiar to you , in connection with the most remarkable events of the Peninsular War ? '
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 7]: Mr Pecksniff gently shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 9]: ` No matter , ' said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 13]: ` That man was my father , and I bear his name .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 9]: I am consequently proud -- proud as Lucifer .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 5]: Excuse me one moment .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 16]: I desire my friend Slyme to be present at the remainder of this conference . '
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 42]: With this announcement he hurried away to the outer door of the Blue Dragon , and almost immediately returned with a companion shorter than himself , who was wrapped in an old blue camlet cloak with a lining of faded scarlet .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 45]: His sharp features being much pinched and nipped by long waiting in the cold , and his straggling red whiskers and frowzy hair being more than usually dishevelled from the same cause , he certainly looked rather unwholesome and uncomfortable than Shakspearian or Miltonic .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 78]: ` Now , ' said Mr Tigg , clapping one hand on the shoulder of his prepossessing friend , and calling Mr Pecksniff 's attention to him with the other , ` you two are related ; and relations never did agree , and never will ; which is a wise dispensation and an inevitable thing , or there would be none but family parties , and everybody in the world would bore everybody else to death .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 48]: If you were on good terms , I should consider you a most confoundedly unnatural pair ; but standing towards each other as you do , I took upon you as a couple of devilish deep-thoughted fellows , who may be reasoned with to any extent . '
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 37]: Here Mr Chevy Slyme , whose great abilities seemed one and all to point towards the sneaking quarter of the moral compass , nudged his friend stealthily with his elbow , and whispered in his ear .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 24]: ` Chiv , ' said Mr Tigg aloud , in the high tone of one who was not to be tampered with . '
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 7]: I shall come to that presently .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 12]: I act upon my own responsibility , or not at all .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 151]: To the extent of such a trifling loan as a crownpiece to a man of your talents , I look upon Mr Pecksniff as certain ; ' and seeing at this juncture that the expression of Mr Pecksniff 's face by no means betokened that he shared this certainty , Mr Tigg laid his finger on his nose again for that gentleman 's private and especial behoof ; calling upon him thereby to take notice that the requisition of small loans was another instance of the peculiarities of genius as developed in his friend Slyme ; that he , Tigg , winked at the same , because of the strong metaphysical interest which these weaknesses possessed ; and that in reference to his own personal advocacy of such small advances , he merely consulted the humour of his friend , without the least regard to his own advantage or necessities .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 8]: ` Oh , Chiv , Chiv ! '
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 21]: added Mr Tigg , surveying his adopted brother with an air of profound contemplation after dismissing this piece of pantomime .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 21]: ` You are , upon my life , a strange instance of the little frailties that beset a mighty mind .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 33]: If there had never been a telescope in the world , I should have been quite certain from my observation of you , Chiv , that there were spots on the sun !
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 30]: I wish I may die , if this is n't the queerest state of existence that we find ourselves forced into without knowing why or wherefore , Mr Pecksniff !
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 5]: Well , never mind !
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 10]: Moralise as we will , the world goes on .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 55]: As Hamlet says , Hercules may lay about him with his club in every possible direction , but he ca n't prevent the cats from making a most intolerable row on the roofs of the houses , or the dogs from being shot in the hot weather if they run about the streets unmuzzled .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 16]: Life 's a riddle ; a most infernally hard riddle to guess , Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 25]: My own opinions , that like that celebrated conundrum , `` Why 's a man in jail like a man out of jail ? ''
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 7]: there 's no answer to it .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 25]: Upon my soul and body , it 's the queerest sort of thing altogether -- but there 's no use in talking about it .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 3]: Ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 26]: With which consolatory deduction from the gloomy premises recited , Mr Tigg roused himself by a great effort , and proceeded in his former strain .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 10]: ` Now I 'll tell you what it is .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 40]: I 'm a most confoundedly soft-hearted kind of fellow in my way , and I can not stand by , and see you two blades cutting each other 's throats when there 's nothing to be got by it .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 24]: Mr Pecksniff , you 're the cousin of the testator upstairs and we 're the nephew -- I say we , meaning Chiv .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 16]: Perhaps in all essential points you are more nearly related to him than we are .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 3]: Very good .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 7]: If so , so be it .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 12]: But you ca n't get at him , neither can we .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 69]: I give you my brightest word of honour , sir , that I 've been looking through that keyhole with short intervals of rest , ever since nine o'clock this morning , in expectation of receiving an answer to one of the most moderate and gentlemanly applications for a little temporary assistance -- only fifteen pounds , and MY security -- that the mind of man can conceive .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 25]: In the meantime , sir , he is perpetually closeted with , and pouring his whole confidence into the bosom of , a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 41]: Now I say decisively with regard to this state of circumstances , that it wo n't do ; that it wo n't act ; that it ca n't be ; and that it must not be suffered to continue . '
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 39]: ` Every man , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` has a right , an undoubted right , -LRB- which I , for one , would not call in question for any earthly consideration ; oh no ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 21]: to regulate his own proceedings by his own likings and dislikings , supposing they are not immoral and not irreligious .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 36]: I may feel in my own breast , that Mr Chuzzlewit does not regard -- me , for instance ; say me -- with exactly that amount of Christian love which should subsist between us .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 31]: I may feel grieved and hurt at the circumstance ; still I may not rush to the conclusion that Mr Chuzzlewit is wholly without a justification in all his coldnesses .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 3]: Heaven forbid !
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 61]: Besides ; how , Mr Tigg , ' continued Pecksniff even more gravely and impressively than he had spoken yet , ` how could Mr Chuzzlewit be prevented from having these peculiar and most extraordinary confidences of which you speak ; the existence of which I must admit ; and which I can not but deplore -- for his sake ?
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 26]: Consider , my good sir -- ' and here Mr Pecksniff eyed him wistfully -- ` how very much at random you are talking . '
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 20]: ` Why , as to that , ' rejoined Tigg , ` it certainly is a difficult question . '
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 13]: ` Undoubtedly it is a difficult question , ' Mr Pecksniff answered .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 29]: As he spoke he drew himself aloft , and seemed to grow more mindful , suddenly , of the moral gulf between himself and the creature he addressed .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 9]: ` Undoubtedly it is a very difficult question .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 19]: And I am far from feeling sure that it is a question any one is authorized to discuss .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 6]: Good evening to you . '
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 15]: ` You do n't know that the Spottletoes are here , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 4]: said Mr Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 8]: ` What do you mean , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 4]: what Spottletoes ? '
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 12]: asked Pecksniff , stopping abruptly on his way to the door .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 32]: ` Mr and Mrs Spottletoe , ' said Chevy Slyme , Esquire , speaking aloud for the first time , and speaking very sulkily ; shambling with his legs the while .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 14]: ` Spottletoe married my father 's brother 's child , did n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 13]: And Mrs Spottletoe is Chuzzlewit 's own niece , is n't she ?
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 6]: She was his favourite once .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 8]: You may well ask what Spottletoes . '
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 8]: ` Now upon my sacred word ! '
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 7]: cried Mr Pecksniff , looking upwards .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 5]: ` This is dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 10]: The rapacity of these people is absolutely frightful ! '
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 25]: ` It 's not only the Spottletoes either , Tigg , ' said Slyme , looking at that gentleman and speaking at Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 19]: ` Anthony Chuzzlewit and his son have got wind of it , and have come down this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 17]: I saw 'em not five minutes ago , when I was waiting round the corner . '
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 8]: ` Oh , Mammon , Mammon ! '
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 8]: cried Mr Pecksniff , smiting his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 26]: ` So there , ' said Slyme , regardless of the interruption , ` are his brother and another nephew for you , already . '
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 41]: ` This is the whole thing , sir , ' said Mr Tigg ; ` this is the point and purpose at which I was gradually arriving when my friend Slyme here , with six words , hit it full .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 49]: Mr Pecksniff , now that your cousin -LRB- and Chiv 's uncle -RRB- has turned up , some steps must be taken to prevent his disappearing again ; and , if possible , to counteract the influence which is exercised over him now , by this designing favourite .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 9]: Everybody who is interested feels it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 10]: The whole family is pouring down to this place .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 28]: The time has come when individual jealousies and interests must be forgotten for a time , sir , and union must be made against the common enemy .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 63]: When the common enemy is routed , you will all set up for yourselves again ; every lady and gentleman who has a part in the game , will go in on their own account and bowl away , to the best of their ability , at the testator 's wicket , and nobody will be in a worse position than before .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 4]: Think of it .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 6]: Do n't commit yourself now .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 26]: You 'll find us at the Half Moon and Seven Stars in this village , at any time , and open to any reasonable proposition .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 2]: Hem !
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 19]: Chiv , my dear fellow , go out and see what sort of a night it is . '
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 20]: Mr Slyme lost no time in disappearing , and it is to be presumed in going round the corner .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 33]: Mr Tigg , planting his legs as wide apart as he could be reasonably expected by the most sanguine man to keep them , shook his head at Mr Pecksniff and smiled .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 22]: ` We must not be too hard , ' he said , ` upon the little eccentricities of our friend Slyme .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 7]: You saw him whisper me ? '
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 6]: Mr Pecksniff had seen him .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 10]: ` You heard my answer , I think ? '
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 6]: Mr Pecksniff had heard it .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 7]: ` Five shillings , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 6]: said Mr Tigg , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 5]: what an extraordinary fellow !
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 5]: Very moderate too ! '
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 6]: Mr Pecksniff made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 5]: ` Five shillings ! '
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 22]: pursued Mr Tigg , musing ; ` and to be punctually repaid next week ; that 's the best of it .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 5]: You heard that ? '
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 7]: Mr Pecksniff had not heard that .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 3]: ` No !
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 5]: You surprise me ! '
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 3]: cried Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 10]: ` That 's the cream of the thing sir .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 15]: I never knew that man fail to redeem a promise , in my life .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 12]: You 're not in want of change , are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 12]: ` No , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` thank you .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 5]: Not at all . '
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 9]: ` Just so , ' returned Mr Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 15]: ` If you had been , I 'd have got it for you . '
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 41]: With that he began to whistle ; but a dozen seconds had not elapsed when he stopped short , and looking earnestly at Mr Pecksniff , said : ` Perhaps you 'd rather not lend Slyme five shillings ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 11]: I would much rather not , ' Mr Pecksniff rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 4]: ` Egad ! '
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 34]: cried Tigg , gravely nodding his head as if some ground of objection occurred to him at that moment for the first time , ` it 's very possible you may be right .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 16]: Would you entertain the same sort of objection to lending me five shillings now ? '
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 16]: ` Yes , I could n't do it , indeed , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 8]: ` Not even half-a-crown , perhaps ? '
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 4]: urged Mr Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 6]: ` Not even half-a-crown . '
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 22]: ` Why , then we come , ' said Mr Tigg , ` to the ridiculously small amount of eighteen pence .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 3]: ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 16]: ` And that , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` would be equally objectionable . '
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 47]: On receipt of this assurance , Mr Tigg shook him heartily by both hands , protesting with much earnestness , that he was one of the most consistent and remarkable men he had ever met , and that he desired the honour of his better acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 98]: He moreover observed that there were many little characteristics about his friend Slyme , of which he could by no means , as a man of strict honour , approve ; but that he was prepared to forgive him all these slight drawbacks , and much more , in consideration of the great pleasure he himself had that day enjoyed in his social intercourse with Mr Pecksniff , which had given him a far higher and more enduring delight than the successful negotiation of any small loan on the part of his friend could possibly have imparted .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 20]: With which remarks he would beg leave , he said , to wish Mr Pecksniff a very good evening .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 22]: And so he took himself off ; as little abashed by his recent failure as any gentleman would desire to be .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 61]: The meditations of Mr Pecksniff that evening at the bar of the Dragon , and that night in his own house , were very serious and grave indeed ; the more especially as the intelligence he had received from Messrs Tigg and Slyme touching the arrival of other members of the family , were fully confirmed on more particular inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 100]: For the Spottletoes had actually gone straight to the Dragon , where they were at that moment housed and mounting guard , and where their appearance had occasioned such a vast sensation that Mrs Lupin , scenting their errand before they had been under her roof half an hour , carried the news herself with all possible secrecy straight to Mr Pecksniff 's house ; indeed it was her great caution in doing so which occasioned her to miss that gentleman , who entered at the front door of the Dragon just as she emerged from the back one .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 114]: Moreover , Mr Anthony Chuzzlewit and his son Jonas were economically quartered at the Half Moon and Seven Stars , which was an obscure ale-house ; and by the very next coach there came posting to the scene of action , so many other affectionate members of the family -LRB- who quarrelled with each other , inside and out , all the way down , to the utter distraction of the coachman -RRB- , that in less than four-and-twenty hours the scanty tavern accommodation was at a premium , and all the private lodgings in the place , amounting to full four beds and sofa , rose cent per cent in the market .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 36]: In a word , things came to that pass that nearly the whole family sat down before the Blue Dragon , and formally invested it ; and Martin Chuzzlewit was in a state of siege .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 33]: But he resisted bravely ; refusing to receive all letters , messages , and parcels ; obstinately declining to treat with anybody ; and holding out no hope or promise of capitulation .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 115]: Meantime the family forces were perpetually encountering each other in divers parts of the neighbourhood ; and , as no one branch of the Chuzzlewit tree had ever been known to agree with another within the memory of man , there was such a skirmishing , and flouting , and snapping off of heads , in the metaphorical sense of that expression ; such a bandying of words and calling of names ; such an upturning of noses and wrinkling of brows ; such a formal interment of good feelings and violent resurrection of ancient grievances ; as had never been known in those quiet parts since the earliest record of their civilized existence .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 53]: At length , in utter despair and hopelessness , some few of the belligerents began to speak to each other in only moderate terms of mutual aggravation ; and nearly all addressed themselves with a show of tolerable decency to Mr Pecksniff , in recognition of his high character and influential position .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 84]: Thus , by little and little , they made common cause of Martin Chuzzlewit 's obduracy , until it was agreed -LRB- if such a word can be used in connection with the Chuzzlewits -RRB- that there should be a general council and conference held at Mr Pecksniff 's house upon a certain day at noon ; which all members of the family who had brought themselves within reach of the summons , were forthwith bidden and invited , solemnly , to attend .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 17]: If ever Mr Pecksniff wore an apostolic look , he wore it on this memorable day .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 18]: If ever his unruffled smile proclaimed the words , ' I am a messenger of peace ! '
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 6]: that was its mission now .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 48]: If ever man combined within himself all the mild qualities of the lamb with a considerable touch of the dove , and not a dash of the crocodile , or the least possible suggestion of the very mildest seasoning of the serpent , that man was he .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 9]: And , oh , the two Miss Pecksniffs !
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 47]: Oh , the serene expression on the face of Charity , which seemed to say , ' I know that all my family have injured me beyond the possibility of reparation , but I forgive them , for it is my duty so to do ! '
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 86]: And , oh , the gay simplicity of Mercy ; so charming , innocent , and infant-like , that if she had gone out walking by herself , and it had been a little earlier in the season , the robin-redbreasts might have covered her with leaves against her will , believing her to be one of the sweet children in the wood , come out of it , and issuing forth once more to look for blackberries in the young freshness of her heart !
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 11]: What words can paint the Pecksniffs in that trying hour ?
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 19]: Oh , none ; for words have naughty company among them , and the Pecksniffs were all goodness .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 6]: But when the company arrived !
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 5]: That was the time .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 61]: When Mr Pecksniff , rising from his seat at the table 's head , with a daughter on either hand , received his guests in the best parlour and motioned them to chairs , with eyes so overflowing and countenance so damp with gracious perspiration , that he may be said to have been in a kind of moist meekness !
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 57]: And the company ; the jealous stony-hearted distrustful company , who were all shut up in themselves , and had no faith in anybody , and would n't believe anything , and would no more allow themselves to be softened or lulled asleep by the Pecksniffs than if they had been so many hedgehogs or porcupines !
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 55]: First , there was Mr Spottletoe , who was so bald and had such big whiskers , that he seemed to have stopped his hair , by the sudden application of some powerful remedy , in the very act of falling off his head , and to have fastened it irrevocably on his face .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 81]: Then there was Mrs Spottletoe , who being much too slim for her years , and of a poetical constitution , was accustomed to inform her more intimate friends that the said whiskers were ` the lodestar of her existence ; ' and who could now , by reason of her strong affection for her uncle Chuzzlewit , and the shock it gave her to be suspected of testamentary designs upon him , do nothing but cry -- except moan .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 98]: Then there were Anthony Chuzzlewit , and his son Jonas ; the face of the old man so sharpened by the wariness and cunning of his life , that it seemed to cut him a passage through the crowded room , as he edged away behind the remotest chairs ; while the son had so well profited by the precept and example of the father , that he looked a year or two the elder of the twain , as they stood winking their red eyes , side by side , and whispering to each other softly .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 100]: Then there was the widow of a deceased brother of Mr Martin Chuzzlewit , who being almost supernaturally disagreeable , and having a dreary face and a bony figure and a masculine voice , was , in right of these qualities , what is commonly called a strong-minded woman ; and who , if she could , would have established her claim to the title , and have shown herself , mentally speaking , a perfect Samson , by shutting up her brother-in-law in a private madhouse , until he proved his complete sanity by loving her very much .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 47]: Beside her sat her spinster daughters , three in number , and of gentlemanly deportment , who had so mortified themselves with tight stays , that their tempers were reduced to something less than their waists , and sharp lacing was expressed in their very noses .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 54]: Then there was a young gentleman , grandnephew of Mr Martin Chuzzlewit , very dark and very hairy , and apparently born for no particular purpose but to save looking-glasses the trouble of reflecting more than just the first idea and sketchy notion of a face , which had never been carried out .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 28]: Then there was a solitary female cousin who was remarkable for nothing but being very deaf , and living by herself , and always having the toothache .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 101]: Then there was George Chuzzlewit , a gay bachelor cousin , who claimed to be young but had been younger , and was inclined to corpulency , and rather overfed himself ; to that extent , indeed , that his eyes were strained in their sockets , as if with constant surprise ; and he had such an obvious disposition to pimples , that the bright spots on his cravat , the rich pattern on his waistcoat , and even his glittering trinkets , seemed to have broken out upon him , and not to have come into existence comfortably .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 14]: Last of all there were present Mr Chevy Slyme and his friend Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 41]: And it is worthy of remark , that although each person present disliked the other , mainly because he or she DID belong to the family , they one and all concurred in hating Mr Tigg because he did n't .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 38]: Such was the pleasant little family circle now assembled in Mr Pecksniff 's best parlour , agreeably prepared to fall foul of Mr Pecksniff or anybody else who might venture to say anything whatever upon any subject .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 23]: ` This , ' said Mr Pecksniff , rising and looking round upon them with folded hands , ` does me good .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 6]: It does my daughters good .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 7]: We thank you for assembling here .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 10]: We are grateful to you with our whole hearts .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 37]: It is a blessed distinction that you have conferred upon us , and believe me ' -- it is impossible to conceive how he smiled here -- ` we shall not easily forget it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 35]: I am sorry to interrupt you , Pecksniff , ' remarked Mr Spottletoe , with his whiskers in a very portentous state ; ` but you are assuming too much to yourself , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 18]: Who do you imagine has it in contemplation to confer a distinction upon YOU , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 11]: A general murmur echoed this inquiry , and applauded it .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 52]: ` If you are about to pursue the course with which you have begun , sir , ' pursued Mr Spottletoe in a great heat , and giving a violent rap on the table with his knuckles , ` the sooner you desist , and this assembly separates , the better .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 35]: I am no stranger , sir , to your preposterous desire to be regarded as the head of this family , but I can tell YOU , sir -- ' Oh yes , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 3]: HE tell .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 2]: HE !
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 2]: What ?
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 8]: He was the head , was he ?
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 74]: From the strong-minded woman downwards everybody fell , that instant , upon Mr Spottletoe , who after vainly attempting to be heard in silence was fain to sit down again , folding his arms and shaking his head most wrathfully , and giving Mrs Spottletoe to understand in dumb show , that that scoundrel Pecksniff might go on for the present , but he would cut in presently , and annihilate him . '
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 28]: I am not sorry , ' said Mr Pecksniff in resumption of his address , ' I am really not sorry that this little incident has happened .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 13]: It is good to feel that we are met here without disguise .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 24]: It is good to know that we have no reserve before each other , but are appearing freely in our own characters . '
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 189]: Here , the eldest daughter of the strong-minded woman rose a little way from her seat , and trembling violently from head to foot , more as it seemed with passion than timidity , expressed a general hope that some people WOULD appear in their own characters , if it were only for such a proceeding having the attraction of novelty to recommend it ; and that when they -LRB- meaning the some people before mentioned -RRB- talked about their relations , they would be careful to observe who was present in company at the time ; otherwise it might come round to those relations ' ears , in a way they little expected ; and as to red noses -LRB- she observed -RRB- she had yet to learn that a red nose was any disgrace , inasmuch as people neither made nor coloured their own noses , but had that feature provided for them without being first consulted ; though even upon that branch of the subject she had great doubts whether certain noses were redder than other noses , or indeed half as red as some .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 99]: This remark being received with a shrill titter by the two sisters of the speaker , Miss Charity Pecksniff begged with much politeness to be informed whether any of those very low observations were levelled at her ; and receiving no more explanatory answer than was conveyed in the adage ` Those the cap fits , let them wear it , ' immediately commenced a somewhat acrimonious and personal retort , wherein she was much comforted and abetted by her sister Mercy , who laughed at the same with great heartiness ; indeed far more naturally than life .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 76]: And it being quite impossible that any difference of opinion can take place among women without every woman who is within hearing taking active part in it , the strong-minded lady and her two daughters , and Mrs Spottletoe , and the deaf cousin -LRB- who was not at all disqualified from joining in the dispute by reason of being perfectly unacquainted with its merits -RRB- , one and all plunged into the quarrel directly .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 103]: The two Miss Pecksniffs being a pretty good match for the three Miss Chuzzlewits , and all five young ladies having , in the figurative language of the day , a great amount of steam to dispose of , the altercation would no doubt have been a long one but for the high valour and prowess of the strong-minded woman , who , in right of her reputation for powers of sarcasm , did so belabour and pummel Mrs Spottletoe with taunting words that the poor lady , before the engagement was two minutes old , had no refuge but in tears .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 97]: These she shed so plentifully , and so much to the agitation and grief of Mr Spottletoe , that that gentleman , after holding his clenched fist close to Mr Pecksniff 's eyes , as if it were some natural curiosity from the near inspection whereof he was likely to derive high gratification and improvement , and after offering -LRB- for no particular reason that anybody could discover -RRB- to kick Mr George Chuzzlewit for , and in consideration of , the trifling sum of sixpence , took his wife under his arm and indignantly withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 40]: This diversion , by distracting the attention of the combatants , put an end to the strife , which , after breaking out afresh some twice or thrice in certain inconsiderable spurts and dashes , died away in silence .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 13]: It was then that Mr Pecksniff once more rose from his chair .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 57]: It was then that the two Miss Pecksniffs composed themselves to look as if there were no such beings -- not to say present , but in the whole compass of the world -- as the three Miss Chuzzlewits ; while the three Miss Chuzzlewits became equally unconscious of the existence of the two Miss Pecksniffs .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 70]: ` It is to be lamented , ' said Mr Pecksniff , with a forgiving recollection of Mr Spottletoe 's fist , ` that our friend should have withdrawn himself so very hastily , though we have cause for mutual congratulation even in that , since we are assured that he is not distrustful of us in regard to anything we may say or do while he is absent .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 12]: Now , that is very soothing , is it not ? '
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 31]: ` Pecksniff , ' said Anthony , who had been watching the whole party with peculiar keenness from the first -- ` do n't you be a hypocrite . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 8]: A what , my good sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 5]: demanded Mr Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 4]: A hypocrite . '
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 43]: ` Charity , my dear , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` when I take my chamber candlestick to-night , remind me to be more than usually particular in praying for Mr Anthony Chuzzlewit ; who has done me an injustice . '
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 22]: This was said in a very bland voice , and aside , as being addressed to his daughter 's private ear .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 69]: With a cheerfulness of conscience , prompting almost a sprightly demeanour , he then resumed : ` All our thoughts centring in our very dear but unkind relative , and he being as it were beyond our reach , we are met to-day , really as if we were a funeral party , except -- a blessed exception -- that there is no body in the house . '
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 15]: The strong-minded lady was not at all sure that this was a blessed exception .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 4]: Quite the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 8]: ` Well , my dear madam ! '
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 4]: said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 61]: ` Be that as it may , here we are ; and being here , we are to consider whether it is possible by any justifiable means -- ' ` Why , you know as well as I , ' said the strong-minded lady , ` that any means are justifiable in such a case , do n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 39]: ` Very good , my dear madam , very good ; whether it is possible by ANY means , we will say by ANY means , to open the eyes of our valued relative to his present infatuation .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 81]: Whether it is possible to make him acquainted by any means with the real character and purpose of that young female whose strange , whose very strange position , in reference to himself ' -- here Mr Pecksniff sunk his voice to an impressive whisper -- ` really casts a shadow of disgrace and shame upon this family ; and who , we know ' -- here he raised his voice again -- ` else why is she his companion ?
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 13]: harbours the very basest designs upon his weakness and his property . '
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 22]: In their strong feeling on this point , they , who agreed in nothing else , all concurred as one mind .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 12]: Good Heaven , that she should harbour designs upon his property !
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 32]: The strong-minded lady was for poison , her three daughters were for Bridewell and bread-and-water , the cousin with the toothache advocated Botany Bay , the two Miss Pecksniffs suggested flogging .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 94]: Nobody but Mr Tigg , who , notwithstanding his extreme shabbiness , was still understood to be in some sort a lady 's man , in right of his upper lip and his frogs , indicated a doubt of the justifiable nature of these measures ; and he only ogled the three Miss Chuzzlewits with the least admixture of banter in his admiration , as though he would observe , ` You are positively down upon her to too great an extent , my sweet creatures , upon my soul you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 91]: ` Now , ' said Mr Pecksniff , crossing his two forefingers in a manner which was at once conciliatory and argumentative ; ' I will not , upon the one hand , go so far as to say that she deserves all the inflictions which have been so very forcibly and hilariously suggested ; ' one of his ornamental sentences ; ` nor will I , upon the other , on any account compromise my common understanding as a man , by making the assertion that she does not .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 28]: What I would observe is , that I think some practical means might be devised of inducing our respected , shall I say our revered -- ? '
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 9]: interposed the strong-minded woman in a loud voice .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 11]: ` Then I will not , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 49]: ` You are quite right , my dear madam , and I appreciate and thank you for your discriminating objection -- our respected relative , to dispose himself to listen to the promptings of nature , and not to the -- ' ` Go on , Pa ! '
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 3]: cried Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 32]: ` Why , the truth is , my dear , ' said Mr Pecksniff , smiling upon his assembled kindred , ` that I am at a loss for a word .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 28]: The name of those fabulous animals -LRB- pagan , I regret to say -RRB- who used to sing in the water , has quite escaped me . '
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 8]: Mr George Chuzzlewit suggested ` swans . '
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 8]: ` No , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 4]: ` Not swans .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 6]: Very like swans , too .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 4]: Thank you . '
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 25]: The nephew with the outline of a countenance , speaking for the first and last time on that occasion , propounded ` Oysters . '
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 18]: ` No , ' said Mr Pecksniff , with his own peculiar urbanity , ` nor oysters .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 22]: But by no means unlike oysters ; a very excellent idea ; thank you , my dear sir , very much .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 2]: Wait !
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 2]: Sirens .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 3]: Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 5]: sirens , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 33]: I think , I say , that means might be devised of disposing our respected relative to listen to the promptings of nature , and not to the siren-like delusions of art .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 51]: Now we must not lose sight of the fact that our esteemed friend has a grandson , to whom he was , until lately , very much attached , and whom I could have wished to see here to-day , for I have a real and deep regard for him .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 5]: A fine young man .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 6]: a very fine young man !
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 74]: I would submit to you , whether we might not remove Mr Chuzzlewit 's distrust of us , and vindicate our own disinterestedness by -- ' ` If Mr George Chuzzlewit has anything to say to ME , ' interposed the strong-minded woman , sternly , ' I beg him to speak out like a man ; and not to look at me and my daughters as if he could eat us . '
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 63]: ` As to looking , I have heard it said , Mrs Ned , ' returned Mr George , angrily , ` that a cat is free to contemplate a monarch ; and therefore I hope I have some right , having been born a member of this family , to look at a person who only came into it by marriage .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 32]: As to eating , I beg to say , whatever bitterness your jealousies and disappointed expectations may suggest to you , that I am not a cannibal , ma'am . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 7]: I do n't know that ! '
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 5]: cried the strong-minded woman .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 56]: ` At all events , if I was a cannibal , ' said Mr George Chuzzlewit , greatly stimulated by this retort , ' I think it would occur to me that a lady who had outlived three husbands , and suffered so very little from their loss , must be most uncommonly tough . '
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 6]: The strong-minded woman immediately rose .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 116]: ` And I will further add , ' said Mr George , nodding his head violently at every second syllable ; ` naming no names , and therefore hurting nobody but those whose consciences tell them they are alluded to , that I think it would be much more decent and becoming , if those who hooked and crooked themselves into this family by getting on the blind side of some of its members before marriage , and manslaughtering them afterwards by crowing over them to that strong pitch that they were glad to die , would refrain from acting the part of vultures in regard to other members of this family who are living .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 72]: I think it would be full as well , if not better , if those individuals would keep at home , contenting themselves with what they have got -LRB- luckily for them -RRB- already ; instead of hovering about , and thrusting their fingers into , a family pie , which they flavour much more than enough , I can tell them , when they are fifty miles away . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 9]: I might have been prepared for this ! '
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 25]: cried the strong-minded woman , looking about her with a disdainful smile as she moved towards the door , followed by her three daughters .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 12]: ` Indeed I was fully prepared for it from the first .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 13]: What else could I expect in such an atmosphere as this ! '
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 31]: ` Do n't direct your halfpay-officers ' gaze at me , ma'am , if you please , ' interposed Miss Charity ; ` for I wo n't bear it . '
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 24]: This was a smart stab at a pension enjoyed by the strong-minded woman , during her second widowhood and before her last coverture .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 5]: It told immensely . '
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 66]: I passed from the memory of a grateful country , you very miserable minx , ' said Mrs Ned , ` when I entered this family ; and I feel now , though I did not feel then , that it served me right , and that I lost my claim upon the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland when I so degraded myself .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 35]: Now , my dears , if you 're quite ready , and have sufficiently improved yourselves by taking to heart the genteel example of these two young ladies , I think we 'll go .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 13]: Mr Pecksniff , we are very much obliged to you , really .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 24]: We came to be entertained , and you have far surpassed our utmost expectations , in the amusement you have provided for us .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 3]: Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 3]: Good-bye ! '
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 56]: With such departing words , did this strong-minded female paralyse the Pecksniffian energies ; and so she swept out of the room , and out of the house , attended by her daughters , who , as with one accord , elevated their three noses in the air , and joined in a contemptuous titter .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 38]: As they passed the parlour window on the outside , they were seen to counterfeit a perfect transport of delight among themselves ; and with this final blow and great discouragement for those within , they vanished .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 42]: Before Mr Pecksniff or any of his remaining visitors could offer a remark , another figure passed this window , coming , at a great rate in the opposite direction ; and immediately afterwards , Mr Spottletoe burst into the chamber .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 19]: Compared with his present state of heat , he had gone out a man of snow or ice .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 37]: His head distilled such oil upon his whiskers , that they were rich and clogged with unctuous drops ; his face was violently inflamed , his limbs trembled ; and he gasped and strove for breath .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 6]: ` My good sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 4]: cried Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 5]: ` Oh yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 10]: returned the other ; ` oh yes , certainly !
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 5]: Oh to be sure !
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 5]: Oh , of course !
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 4]: You hear him ?
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 4]: You hear him ?
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 5]: all of you ! '
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 7]: ` What 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 4]: cried several voices .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 5]: ` Oh nothing ! '
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 6]: cried Spottletoe , still gasping .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 5]: ` Nothing at all !
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 6]: It 's of no consequence !
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 3]: Ask him !
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 7]: HE 'll tell you ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 20]: I do not understand our friend , ' said Mr Pecksniff , looking about him in utter amazement . '
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 12]: I assure you that he is quite unintelligible to me . '
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 6]: ` Unintelligible , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 4]: cried the other .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 3]: ` Unintelligible !
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 17]: Do you mean to say , sir , that you do n't know what has happened !
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 18]: That you have n't decoyed us here , and laid a plot and a plan against us !
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 30]: Will you venture to say that you did n't know Mr Chuzzlewit was going , sir , and that you do n't know he 's gone , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 4]: ` Gone ! '
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 5]: was the general cry .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 8]: ` Gone , ' echoed Mr Spottletoe .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 8]: ` Gone while we were sitting here .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 2]: Gone .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 7]: Nobody knows where he 's gone .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 6]: Oh , of course not !
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 6]: Nobody knew he was going .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 6]: Oh , of course not !
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 24]: The landlady thought up to the very last moment that they were merely going for a ride ; she had no other suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 6]: Oh , of course not !
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 8]: She 's not this fellow 's creature .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 7]: Oh , of course not ! '
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 44]: Adding to these exclamations a kind of ironical howl , and gazing upon the company for one brief instant afterwards , in a sudden silence , the irritated gentleman started off again at the same tremendous pace , and was seen no more .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 35]: It was in vain for Mr Pecksniff to assure them that this new and opportune evasion of the family was at least as great a shock and surprise to him as to anybody else .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 44]: Of all the bullyings and denunciations that were ever heaped on one unlucky head , none can ever have exceeded in energy and heartiness those with which he was complimented by each of his remaining relatives , singly , upon bidding him farewell .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 72]: The moral position taken by Mr Tigg was something quite tremendous ; and the deaf cousin , who had the complicated aggravation of seeing all the proceedings and hearing nothing but the catastrophe , actually scraped her shoes upon the scraper , and afterwards distributed impressions of them all over the top step , in token that she shook the dust from her feet before quitting that dissembling and perfidious mansion .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 67]: Mr Pecksniff had , in short , but one comfort , and that was the knowledge that all these his relations and friends had hated him to the very utmost extent before ; and that he , for his part , had not distributed among them any more love than , with his ample capital in that respect , he could comfortably afford to part with .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 36]: This view of his affairs yielded him great consolation ; and the fact deserves to be noted , as showing with what ease a good man may be consoled under circumstances of failure and disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 24]: CHAPTER FIVE CONTAINING A FULL ACCOUNT OF THE INSTALLATION OF MR PECKSNIFF 'S NEW PUPIL INTO THE BOSOM OF MR PECKSNIFF 'S FAMILY .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 49]: WITH ALL THE FESTIVITIES HELD ON THAT OCCASION , AND THE GREAT ENJOYMENT OF MR PINCH The best of architects and land surveyors kept a horse , in whom the enemies already mentioned more than once in these pages pretended to detect a fanciful resemblance to his master .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 49]: Not in his outward person , for he was a raw-boned , haggard horse , always on a much shorter allowance of corn than Mr Pecksniff ; but in his moral character , wherein , said they , he was full of promise , but of no performance .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 15]: He was always in a manner , going to go , and never going .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 76]: When at his slowest rate of travelling he would sometimes lift up his legs so high , and display such mighty action , that it was difficult to believe he was doing less than fourteen miles an hour ; and he was for ever so perfectly satisfied with his own speed , and so little disconcerted by opportunities of comparing himself with the fastest trotters , that the illusion was the more difficult of resistance .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 32]: He was a kind of animal who infused into the breasts of strangers a lively sense of hope , and possessed all those who knew him better with a grim despair .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 28]: In what respect , having these points of character , he might be fairly likened to his master , that good man 's slanderers only can explain .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 24]: But it is a melancholy truth , and a deplorable instance of the uncharitableness of the world , that they made the comparison .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 81]: In this horse , and the hooded vehicle , whatever its proper name might be , to which he was usually harnessed -- it was more like a gig with a tumour than anything else -- all Mr Pinch 's thoughts and wishes centred , one bright frosty morning ; for with this gallant equipage he was about to drive to Salisbury alone , there to meet with the new pupil , and thence to bring him home in triumph .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 76]: Blessings on thy simple heart , Tom Pinch , how proudly dost thou button up that scanty coat , called by a sad misnomer , for these many years , a ` great ' one ; and how thoroughly , as with thy cheerful voice thou pleasantly adjurest Sam the hostler ` not to let him go yet , ' dost thou believe that quadruped desires to go , and would go if he might !
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 119]: Who could repress a smile -- of love for thee , Tom Pinch , and not in jest at thy expense , for thou art poor enough already , Heaven knows -- to think that such a holiday as lies before thee should awaken that quick flow and hurry of the spirits , in which thou settest down again , almost untasted , on the kitchen window-sill , that great white mug -LRB- put by , by thy own hands , last night , that breakfast might not hold thee late -RRB- , and layest yonder crust upon the seat beside thee , to be eaten on the road , when thou art calmer in thy high rejoicing !
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 66]: Who , as thou drivest off , a happy , man , and noddest with a grateful lovingness to Pecksniff in his nightcap at his chamber-window , would not cry , ` Heaven speed thee , Tom , and send that thou wert going off for ever to some quiet home where thou mightst live at peace , and sorrow should not touch thee ! '
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 47]: What better time for driving , riding , walking , moving through the air by any means , than a fresh , frosty morning , when hope runs cheerily through the veins with the brisk blood , and tingles in the frame from head to foot !
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 47]: This was the glad commencement of a bracing day in early winter , such as may put the languid summer season -LRB- speaking of it when it ca n't be had -RRB- to the blush , and shame the spring for being sometimes cold by halves .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 53]: The sheep-bells rang as clearly in the vigorous air , as if they felt its wholesome influence like living creatures ; the trees , in lieu of leaves or blossoms , shed upon the ground a frosty rime that sparkled as it fell , and might have been the dust of diamonds .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 6]: So it was to Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 34]: From cottage chimneys , smoke went streaming up high , high , as if the earth had lost its grossness , being so fair , and must not be oppressed by heavy vapour .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 47]: The crust of ice on the else rippling brook was so transparent , and so thin in texture , that the lively water might of its own free will have stopped -- in Tom 's glad mind it had -- to look upon the lovely morning .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 46]: And lest the sun should break this charm too eagerly , there moved between him and the ground , a mist like that which waits upon the moon on summer nights -- the very same to Tom -- and wooed him to dissolve it gently .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 37]: Tom Pinch went on ; not fast , but with a sense of rapid motion , which did just as well ; and as he went , all kinds of things occurred to keep him happy .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 19]: Thus when he came within sight of the turnpike , and was -- oh a long way off !
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 39]: -- he saw the tollman 's wife , who had that moment checked a waggon , run back into the little house again like mad , to say -LRB- she knew -RRB- that Mr Pinch was coming up .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 32]: And she was right , for when he drew within hail of the gate , forth rushed the tollman 's children , shrieking in tiny chorus , ` Mr Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 6]: to Tom 's intense delight .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 83]: The very tollman , though an ugly chap in general , and one whom folks were rather shy of handling , came out himself to take the toll , and give him rough good morning ; and that with all this , and a glimpse of the family breakfast on a little round table before the fire , the crust Tom Pinch had brought away with him acquired as rich a flavour as though it had been cut from a fairy loaf .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 7]: But there was more than this .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 20]: It was not only the married people and the children who gave Tom Pinch a welcome as he passed .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 4]: No , no .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 34]: Sparkling eyes and snowy breasts came hurriedly to many an upper casement as he clattered by , and gave him back his greeting : not stinted either , but sevenfold , good measure .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 5]: They were all merry .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 4]: They all laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 16]: And some of the wickedest among them even kissed their hands as Tom looked back .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 7]: For who minded poor Mr Pinch ?
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 7]: There was no harm in HIM .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 54]: And now the morning grew so fair , and all things were so wide awake and gay , that the sun seeming to say -- Tom had no doubt he said -- ' I ca n't stand it any longer ; I must have a look , ' streamed out in radiant majesty .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 59]: The mist , too shy and gentle for such lusty company , fled off , quite scared , before it ; and as it swept away , the hills and mounds and distant pasture lands , teeming with placid sheep and noisy crows , came out as bright as though they were unrolled bran new for the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 29]: In compliment to which discovery , the brook stood still no longer , but ran briskly off to bear the tidings to the water-mill , three miles away .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 63]: Mr Pinch was jogging along , full of pleasant thoughts and cheerful influences , when he saw , upon the path before him , going in the same direction with himself , a traveller on foot , who walked with a light quick step , and sang as he went -- for certain in a very loud voice , but not unmusically .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 79]: He was a young fellow , of some five or six-and-twenty perhaps , and was dressed in such a free and fly-away fashion , that the long ends of his loose red neckcloth were streaming out behind him quite as often as before ; and the bunch of bright winter berries in the buttonhole of his velveteen coat was as visible to Mr Pinch 's rearward observation , as if he had worn that garment wrong side foremost .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 48]: He continued to sing with so much energy , that he did not hear the sound of wheels until it was close behind him ; when he turned a whimsical face and a very merry pair of blue eyes on Mr Pinch , and checked himself directly .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 6]: ` Why , Mark ? '
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 6]: said Tom Pinch , stopping .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 10]: ` Who 'd have thought of seeing you here ?
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 5]: this is surprising ! '
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 23]: Mark touched his hat , and said , with a very sudden decrease of vivacity , that he was going to Salisbury .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 10]: ` And how spruce you are , too ! '
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 10]: said Mr Pinch , surveying him with great pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 18]: ` Really , I did n't think you were half such a tight-made fellow , Mark ! '
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 6]: ` Thankee , Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 8]: Pretty well for that , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 9]: It 's not my fault , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 18]: With regard to being spruce , sir , that 's where it is , you see . '
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 7]: And here he looked particularly gloomy .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 6]: ` Where what is ? '
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 4]: Mr Pinch demanded .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 8]: ` Where the aggravation of it is .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 16]: Any man may be in good spirits and good temper when he 's well dressed .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 8]: There a n't much credit in that .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 25]: If I was very ragged and very jolly , then I should begin to feel I had gained a point , Mr Pinch . '
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 26]: ` So you were singing just now , to bear up , as it were , against being well dressed , eh , Mark ? '
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 3]: said Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 20]: ` Your conversation 's always equal to print , sir , ' rejoined Mark , with a broad grin .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 6]: ` That was it . '
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 20]: cried Pinch , ` you are the strangest young man , Mark , I ever knew in my life .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 14]: I always thought so ; but now I am quite certain of it .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 8]: I am going to Salisbury , too .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 5]: Will you get in ?
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 10]: I shall be very glad of your company . '
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 51]: The young fellow made his acknowledgments and accepted the offer ; stepping into the carriage directly , and seating himself on the very edge of the seat with his body half out of it , to express his being there on sufferance , and by the politeness of Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 13]: As they went along , the conversation proceeded after this manner . '
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 32]: I more than half believed , just now , seeing you so very smart , ' said Pinch , ` that you must be going to be married , Mark . '
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 17]: ` Well , sir , I 've thought of that , too , ' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 30]: ` There might be some credit in being jolly with a wife , ` specially if the children had the measles and that , and was very fractious indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 11]: But I 'm a ` most afraid to try it .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 9]: I do n't see my way clear . '
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 12]: ` You 're not very fond of anybody , perhaps ? '
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 3]: said Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 10]: ` Not particular , sir , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 40]: ` But the way would be , you know , Mark , according to your views of things , ' said Mr Pinch , ` to marry somebody you did n't like , and who was very disagreeable . '
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 25]: ` So it would , sir ; but that might be carrying out a principle a little too far , might n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 10]: ` Perhaps it might , ' said Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 7]: At which they both laughed gayly .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 21]: ` Lord bless you , sir , ' said Mark , ` you do n't half know me , though .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 36]: I do n't believe there ever was a man as could come out so strong under circumstances that would make other men miserable , as I could , if I could only get a chance .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 8]: But I ca n't get a chance .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 23]: It 's my opinion that nobody never will know half of what 's in me , unless something very unexpected turns up .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 10]: And I do n't see any prospect of that .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 11]: I 'm a-going to leave the Dragon , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 8]: ` Going to leave the Dragon ! '
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 11]: cried Mr Pinch , looking at him with great astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 12]: ` Why , Mark , you take my breath away ! '
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 28]: ` Yes , sir , ' he rejoined , looking straight before him and a long way off , as men do sometimes when they cogitate profoundly .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 12]: ` What 's the use of my stopping at the Dragon ?
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 12]: It a n't at all the sort of place for ME .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 53]: When I left London -LRB- I 'm a Kentish man by birth , though -RRB- , and took that situation here , I quite made up my mind that it was the dullest little out-of-the-way corner in England , and that there would be some credit in being jolly under such circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 12]: But , Lord , there 's no dullness at the Dragon !
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 23]: Skittles , cricket , quoits , nine-pins , comic songs , choruses , company round the chimney corner every winter 's evening .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 9]: Any man could be jolly at the Dragon .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 8]: There 's no credit in THAT . '
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 50]: ` But if common report be true for once , Mark , as I think it is , being able to confirm it by what I know myself , ' said Mr Pinch , ` you are the cause of half this merriment , and set it going . '
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 16]: ` There may be something in that , too , sir , ' answered Mark .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 8]: ` But that 's no consolation . '
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 22]: said Mr Pinch , after a short silence , his usually subdued tone being even now more subdued than ever . '
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 11]: I can hardly think enough of what you tell me .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 12]: Why , what will become of Mrs Lupin , Mark ? '
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 30]: Mark looked more fixedly before him , and further off still , as he answered that he did n't suppose it would be much of an object to her .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 15]: There were plenty of smart young fellows as would be glad of the place .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 6]: He knew a dozen himself .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 28]: ` That 's probable enough , ' said Mr Pinch , ` but I am not at all sure that Mrs Lupin would be glad of them .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 33]: Why , I always supposed that Mrs Lupin and you would make a match of it , Mark ; and so did every one , as far as I know . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 54]: I never , ' Mark replied , in some confusion , ` said nothing as was in a direct way courting-like to her , nor she to me , but I do n't know what I might n't do one of these odd times , and what she might n't say in answer .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 10]: Well , sir , THAT would n't suit . '
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 12]: ` Not to be landlord of the Dragon , Mark ? '
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 4]: cried Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 26]: ` No , sir , certainly not , ' returned the other , withdrawing his gaze from the horizon , and looking at his fellow-traveller .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 13]: ` Why that would be the ruin of a man like me .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 17]: I go and sit down comfortably for life , and no man never finds me out .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 15]: What would be the credit of the landlord of the Dragon 's being jolly ?
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 13]: Why , he could n't help it , if he tried . '
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 13]: ` Does Mrs Lupin know you are going to leave her ? '
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 5]: Mr Pinch inquired . '
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 15]: I have n't broke it to her yet , sir , but I must .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 21]: I 'm looking out this morning for something new and suitable , ' he said , nodding towards the city .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 8]: ` What kind of thing now ? '
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 5]: Mr Pinch demanded . '
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 15]: I was thinking , ' Mark replied , ` of something in the grave-digging .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 3]: way . '
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 7]: ` Good gracious , Mark ? '
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 4]: cried Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 56]: ` It 's a good damp , wormy sort of business , sir , ' said Mark , shaking his head argumentatively , ` and there might be some credit in being jolly , with one 's mind in that pursuit , unless grave-diggers is usually given that way ; which would be a drawback .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 18]: You do n't happen to know how that is in general , do you , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 14]: ` No , ' said Mr Pinch , ' I do n't indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 8]: I never thought upon the subject . '
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 31]: ` In case of that not turning out as well as one could wish , you know , ' said Mark , musing again , ` there 's other businesses .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 3]: Undertaking now .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 4]: That 's gloomy .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 9]: There might be credit to be gained there .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 14]: A broker 's man in a poor neighbourhood would n't be bad perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 8]: A jailor sees a deal of misery .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 12]: A doctor 's man is in the very midst of murder .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 12]: A bailiff 's a n't a lively office nat ` rally .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 14]: Even a tax-gatherer must find his feelings rather worked upon , at times .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 17]: There 's lots of trades in which I should have an opportunity , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 79]: Mr Pinch was so perfectly overwhelmed by these remarks that he could do nothing but occasionally exchange a word or two on some indifferent subject , and cast sidelong glances at the bright face of his odd friend -LRB- who seemed quite unconscious of his observation -RRB- , until they reached a certain corner of the road , close upon the outskirts of the city , when Mark said he would jump down there , if he pleased .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 62]: ` But bless my soul , Mark , ' said Mr Pinch , who in the progress of his observation just then made the discovery that the bosom of his companion 's shirt was as much exposed as if it was Midsummer , and was ruffled by every breath of air , ` why do n't you wear a waistcoat ? '
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 11]: ` What 's the good of one , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 3]: asked Mark .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 6]: ` Good of one ? '
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 4]: said Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 10]: ` Why , to keep your chest warm . '
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 8]: ` Lord love you , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 10]: cried Mark , ` you do n't know me .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 8]: My chest do n't want no warming .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 13]: Even if it did , what would no waistcoat bring it to ?
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 7]: Inflammation of the lungs , perhaps ?
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 19]: Well , there 'd be some credit in being jolly , with a inflammation of the lungs . '
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 50]: As Mr Pinch returned no other answer than such as was conveyed in his breathing very hard , and opening his eyes very wide , and nodding his head very much , Mark thanked him for his ride , and without troubling him to stop , jumped lightly down .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 45]: And away he fluttered , with his red neckerchief , and his open coat , down a cross-lane ; turning back from time to time to nod to Mr Pinch , and looking one of the most careless , good-humoured comical fellows in life .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 14]: His late companion , with a thoughtful face pursued his way to Salisbury .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 86]: Mr Pinch had a shrewd notion that Salisbury was a very desperate sort of place ; an exceeding wild and dissipated city ; and when he had put up the horse , and given the hostler to understand that he would look in again in the course of an hour or two to see him take his corn , he set forth on a stroll about the streets with a vague and not unpleasant idea that they teemed with all kinds of mystery and bedevilment .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 62]: To one of his quiet habits this little delusion was greatly assisted by the circumstance of its being market-day , and the thoroughfares about the market-place being filled with carts , horses , donkeys , baskets , waggons , garden-stuff , meat , tripe , pies , poultry and huckster 's wares of every opposite description and possible variety of character .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 93]: Then there were young farmers and old farmers with smock-frocks , brown great-coats , drab great-coats , red worsted comforters , leather-leggings , wonderful shaped hats , hunting-whips , and rough sticks , standing about in groups , or talking noisily together on the tavern steps , or paying and receiving huge amounts of greasy wealth , with the assistance of such bulky pocket-books that when they were in their pockets it was apoplexy to get them out , and when they were out it was spasms to get them in again .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 60]: Also there were farmers ' wives in beaver bonnets and red cloaks , riding shaggy horses purged of all earthly passions , who went soberly into all manner of places without desiring to know why , and who , if required , would have stood stock still in a china shop , with a complete dinner-service at each hoof .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 35]: Also a great many dogs , who were strongly interested in the state of the market and the bargains of their masters ; and a great confusion of tongues , both brute and human .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 56]: Mr Pinch regarded everything exposed for sale with great delight , and was particularly struck by the itinerant cutlery , which he considered of the very keenest kind , insomuch that he purchased a pocket knife with seven blades in it , and not a cut -LRB- as he afterwards found out -RRB- among them .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 26]: When he had exhausted the market-place , and watched the farmers safe into the market dinner , he went back to look after the horse .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 107]: Having seen him eat unto his heart 's content he issued forth again , to wander round the town and regale himself with the shop windows ; previously taking a long stare at the bank , and wondering in what direction underground the caverns might be where they kept the money ; and turning to look back at one or two young men who passed him , whom he knew to be articled to solicitors in the town ; and who had a sort of fearful interest in his eyes , as jolly dogs who knew a thing or two , and kept it up tremendously .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 4]: But the shops .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 56]: First of all there were the jewellers ' shops , with all the treasures of the earth displayed therein , and such large silver watches hanging up in every pane of glass , that if they were anything but first-rate goers it certainly was not because the works could decently complain of want of room .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 88]: In good sooth they were big enough , and perhaps , as the saying is , ugly enough , to be the most correct of all mechanical performers ; in Mr Pinch 's eyes , however they were smaller than Geneva ware ; and when he saw one very bloated watch announced as a repeater , gifted with the uncommon power of striking every quarter of an hour inside the pocket of its happy owner , he almost wished that he were rich enough to buy it .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 62]: But what were even gold and silver , precious stones and clockwork , to the bookshops , whence a pleasant smell of paper freshly pressed came issuing forth , awakening instant recollections of some new grammar had at school , long time ago , with ` Master Pinch , Grove House Academy , ' inscribed in faultless writing on the fly-leaf !
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 26]: That whiff of russia leather , too , and all those rows on rows of volumes neatly ranged within -- what happiness did they suggest !
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 60]: And in the window were the spick-and-span new works from London , with the title-pages , and sometimes even the first page of the first chapter , laid wide open ; tempting unwary men to begin to read the book , and then , in the impossibility of turning over , to rush blindly in , and buy it !
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 72]: Here too were the dainty frontispiece and trim vignette , pointing like handposts on the outskirts of great cities , to the rich stock of incident beyond ; and store of books , with many a grave portrait and time-honoured name , whose matter he knew well , and would have given mines to have , in any form , upon the narrow shell beside his bed at Mr Pecksniff 's .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 7]: What a heart-breaking shop it was !
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 96]: There was another ; not quite so bad at first , but still a trying shop ; where children 's books were sold , and where poor Robinson Crusoe stood alone in his might , with dog and hatchet , goat-skin cap and fowling-pieces ; calmly surveying Philip Quarn and the host of imitators round him , and calling Mr Pinch to witness that he , of all the crowd , impressed one solitary footprint on the shore of boyish memory , whereof the tread of generations should not stir the lightest grain of sand .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 86]: And there too were the Persian tales , with flying chests and students of enchanted books shut up for years in caverns ; and there too was Abudah , the merchant , with the terrible little old woman hobbling out of the box in his bedroom ; and there the mighty talisman , the rare Arabian Nights , with Cassim Baba , divided by four , like the ghost of a dreadful sum , hanging up , all gory , in the robbers ' cave .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 61]: Which matchless wonders , coming fast on Mr Pinch 's mind , did so rub up and chafe that wonderful lamp within him , that when he turned his face towards the busy street , a crowd of phantoms waited on his pleasure , and he lived again , with new delight , the happy days before the Pecksniff era .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 48]: He had less interest now in the chemists ' shops , with their great glowing bottles -LRB- with smaller repositories of brightness in their very stoppers -RRB- ; and in their agreeable compromises between medicine and perfumery , in the shape of toothsome lozenges and virgin honey .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 50]: Neither had he the least regard -LRB- but he never had much -RRB- for the tailors ' , where the newest metropolitan waistcoat patterns were hanging up , which by some strange transformation always looked amazing there , and never appeared at all like the same thing anywhere else .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 51]: But he stopped to read the playbill at the theatre and surveyed the doorway with a kind of awe , which was not diminished when a sallow gentleman with long dark hair came out , and told a boy to run home to his lodgings and bring down his broadsword .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 39]: Mr Pinch stood rooted to the spot on hearing this , and might have stood there until dark , but that the old cathedral bell began to ring for vesper service , on which he tore himself away .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 54]: Now , the organist 's assistant was a friend of Mr Pinch 's , which was a good thing , for he too was a very quiet gentle soul , and had been , like Tom , a kind of old-fashioned boy at school , though well liked by the noisy fellow too .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 67]: As good luck would have it -LRB- Tom always said he had great good luck -RRB- the assistant chanced that very afternoon to be on duty by himself , with no one in the dusty organ loft but Tom ; so while he played , Tom helped him with the stops ; and finally , the service being just over , Tom took the organ himself .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 27]: It was then turning dark , and the yellow light that streamed in through the ancient windows in the choir was mingled with a murky red .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 39]: As the grand tones resounded through the church , they seemed , to Tom , to find an echo in the depth of every ancient tomb , no less than in the deep mystery of his own heart .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 52]: Great thoughts and hopes came crowding on his mind as the rich music rolled upon the air and yet among them -- something more grave and solemn in their purpose , but the same -- were all the images of that day , down to its very lightest recollection of childhood .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 87]: The feeling that the sounds awakened , in the moment of their existence , seemed to include his whole life and being ; and as the surrounding realities of stone and wood and glass grew dimmer in the darkness , these visions grew so much the brighter that Tom might have forgotten the new pupil and the expectant master , and have sat there pouring out his grateful heart till midnight , but for a very earthy old verger insisting on locking up the cathedral forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 37]: So he took leave of his friend , with many thanks , groped his way out , as well as he could , into the now lamp-lighted streets , and hurried off to get his dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 69]: All the farmers being by this time jogging homewards , there was nobody in the sanded parlour of the tavern where he had left the horse ; so he had his little table drawn out close before the fire , and fell to work upon a well-cooked steak and smoking hot potatoes , with a strong appreciation of their excellence , and a very keen sense of enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 50]: Beside him , too , there stood a jug of most stupendous Wiltshire beer ; and the effect of the whole was so transcendent , that he was obliged every now and then to lay down his knife and fork , rub his hands , and think about it .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 64]: By the time the cheese and celery came , Mr Pinch had taken a book out of his pocket , and could afford to trifle with the viands ; now eating a little , now drinking a little , now reading a little , and now stopping to wonder what sort of a young man the new pupil would turn out to be .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 48]: He had passed from this latter theme and was deep in his book again , when the door opened , and another guest came in , bringing with him such a quantity of cold air , that he positively seemed at first to put the fire out .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 40]: ` Very hard frost to-night , sir , ' said the newcomer , courteously acknowledging Mr Pinch 's withdrawal of the little table , that he might have place : ` Do n't disturb yourself , I beg . '
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 50]: Though he said this with a vast amount of consideration for Mr Pinch 's comfort , he dragged one of the great leather-bottomed chairs to the very centre of the hearth , notwithstanding ; and sat down in front of the fire , with a foot on each hob .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 7]: ` My feet are quite numbed .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 7]: Bitter cold to be sure . '
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 16]: ` You have been in the air some considerable time , I dare say ? '
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 4]: said Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 4]: ` All day .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 7]: Outside a coach , too . '
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 16]: ` That accounts for his making the room so cool , ' thought Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 4]: ` Poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 8]: How thoroughly chilled he must be ! '
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 20]: The stranger became thoughtful likewise , and sat for five or ten minutes looking at the fire in silence .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 71]: At length he rose and divested himself of his shawl and great-coat , which -LRB- far different from Mr Pinch 's -RRB- was a very warm and thick one ; but he was not a whit more conversational out of his great-coat than in it , for he sat down again in the same place and attitude , and leaning back in his chair , began to bite his nails .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 48]: He was young -- one-and-twenty , perhaps -- and handsome ; with a keen dark eye , and a quickness of look and manner which made Tom sensible of a great contrast in his own bearing , and caused him to feel even more shy than usual .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 17]: There was a clock in the room , which the stranger often turned to look at .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 44]: Tom made frequent reference to it also ; partly from a nervous sympathy with its taciturn companion ; and partly because the new pupil was to inquire for him at half after six , and the hands were getting on towards that hour .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 61]: Whenever the stranger caught him looking at this clock , a kind of confusion came upon Tom as if he had been found out in something ; and it was a perception of his uneasiness which caused the younger man to say , perhaps , with a smile : ` We both appear to be rather particular about the time .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 15]: The fact is , I have an engagement to meet a gentleman here . '
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 10]: ` So have I , ' said Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 10]: ` At half-past six , ' said the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 24]: ` At half-past six , ' said Tom in the very same breath ; whereupon the other looked at him with some surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 31]: ` The young gentleman , I expect , ' remarked Tom , timidly , ` was to inquire at that time for a person by the name of Pinch . '
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 7]: cried the other , jumping up .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 14]: ` And I have been keeping the fire from you all this while !
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 9]: I had no idea you were Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 12]: I am the Mr Martin for whom you were to inquire .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 4]: Pray excuse me .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 5]: How do you do ?
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 9]: Oh , do draw nearer , pray ! '
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 12]: ` Thank you , ' said Tom , ` thank you .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 20]: I am not at all cold , and you are ; and we have a cold ride before us .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 10]: Well , if you wish it , I will .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 76]: I -- I am very glad , ' said Tom , smiling with an embarrassed frankness peculiarly his , and which was as plainly a confession of his own imperfections , and an appeal to the kindness of the person he addressed , as if he had drawn one up in simple language and committed it to paper : ' I am very glad indeed that you turn out to be the party I expected .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 21]: I was thinking , but a minute ago , that I could wish him to be like you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 43]: I am very glad to hear it , ' returned Martin , shaking hands with him again ; ` for I assure you , I was thinking there could be no such luck as Mr Pinch 's turning out like you . '
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 6]: ` No , really ! '
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 7]: said Tom , with great pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 6]: ` Are you serious ? '
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 13]: ` Upon my word I am , ' replied his new acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 60]: ` You and I will get on excellently well , I know ; which it 's no small relief to me to feel , for to tell you the truth , I am not at all the sort of fellow who could get on with everybody , and that 's the point on which I had the greatest doubts .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 7]: But they 're quite relieved now .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 14]: -- Do me the favour to ring the bell , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 39]: Mr Pinch rose , and complied with great alacrity -- the handle hung just over Martin 's head , as he warmed himself -- and listened with a smiling face to what his friend went on to say .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 39]: It was : ` If you like punch , you 'll allow me to order a glass apiece , as hot as it can be made , that we may usher in our friendship in a becoming manner .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 70]: To let you into a secret , Mr Pinch , I never was so much in want of something warm and cheering in my life ; but I did n't like to run the chance of being found drinking it , without knowing what kind of person you were ; for first impressions , you know , often go a long way , and last a long time . '
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 10]: Mr Pinch assented , and the punch was ordered .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 10]: In due course it came ; hot and strong .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 15]: After drinking to each other in the steaming mixture , they became quite confidential .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 20]: ` I 'm a sort of relation of Pecksniff 's , you know , ' said the young man .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 4]: ` Indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 4]: cried Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 24]: My grandfather is his cousin , so he 's kith and kin to me , somehow , if you can make that out .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 5]: I ca n't . '
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 9]: ` Then Martin is your Christian name ? '
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 6]: said Mr Pinch , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 42]: ` Of course it is , ' returned his friend : ' I wish it was my surname for my own is not a very pretty one , and it takes a long time to sign Chuzzlewit is my name . '
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 9]: cried Mr Pinch , with an involuntary start .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 15]: ` You 're not surprised at my having two names , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 11]: returned the other , setting his glass to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 6]: ` Most people have . '
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 15]: ` Oh , no , ' said Mr Pinch , ` not at all .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 4]: Oh dear no !
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 3]: Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 60]: And then remembering that Mr Pecksniff had privately cautioned him to say nothing in reference to the old gentleman of the same name who had lodged at the Dragon , but to reserve all mention of that person for him , he had no better means of hiding his confusion than by raising his own glass to his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 23]: They looked at each other out of their respective tumblers for a few seconds , and then put them down empty . '
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 26]: I told them in the stable to be ready for us ten minutes ago , ' said Mr Pinch , glancing at the clock again .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 6]: ` Shall we go ? '
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 10]: ` If you please , ' returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 8]: ` Would you like to drive ? '
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 18]: said Mr Pinch ; his whole face beaming with a consciousness of the splendour of his offer .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 9]: ` You shall , if you wish . '
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 25]: ` Why , that depends , Mr Pinch , ' said Martin , laughing , ` upon what sort of a horse you have .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 25]: Because if he 's a bad one , I would rather keep my hands warm by holding them comfortably in my greatcoat pockets . '
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 23]: He appeared to think this such a good joke , that Mr Pinch was quite sure it must be a capital one .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 17]: Accordingly , he laughed too , and was fully persuaded that he enjoyed it very much .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 47]: Then he settled his bill , and Mr Chuzzlewit paid for the punch ; and having wrapped themselves up , to the extent of their respective means , they went out together to the front door , where Mr Pecksniff 's property stopped the way . '
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 22]: I wo n't drive , thank you , Mr Pinch , ' said Martin , getting into the sitter 's place .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 12]: ` By the bye , there 's a box of mine .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 8]: Can we manage to take it ? '
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 9]: ` Oh , certainly , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 10]: ` Put it in , Dick , anywhere ! '
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 35]: It was not precisely of that convenient size which would admit of its being squeezed into any odd corner , but Dick the hostler got it in somehow , and Mr Chuzzlewit helped him .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 57]: It was all on Mr Pinch 's side , and Mr Chuzzlewit said he was very much afraid it would encumber him ; to which Tom said , ` Not at all ; ' though it forced him into such an awkward position , that he had much ado to see anything but his own knees .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 68]: But it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good ; and the wisdom of the saying was verified in this instance ; for the cold air came from Mr Pinch 's side of the carriage , and by interposing a perfect wall of box and man between it and the new pupil , he shielded that young gentleman effectually ; which was a great comfort .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 11]: It was a clear evening , with a bright moon .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 19]: The whole landscape was silvered by its light and by the hoar-frost ; and everything looked exquisitely beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 44]: At first , the great serenity and peace through which they travelled , disposed them both to silence ; but in a very short time the punch within them and the healthful air without , made them loquacious , and they talked incessantly .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 51]: When they were halfway home , and stopped to give the horse some water , Martin -LRB- who was very generous with his money -RRB- ordered another glass of punch , which they drank between them , and which had not the effect of making them less conversational than before .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 90]: Their principal topic of discourse was naturally Mr Pecksniff and his family ; of whom , and of the great obligations they had heaped upon him , Tom Pinch , with the tears standing in his eyes , drew such a picture as would have inclined any one of common feeling almost to revere them ; and of which Mr Pecksniff had not the slightest foresight or preconceived idea , or he certainly -LRB- being very humble -RRB- would not have sent Tom Pinch to bring the pupil home .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 59]: In this way they went on , and on , and on -- in the language of the story-books -- until at last the village lights appeared before them , and the church spire cast a long reflection on the graveyard grass ; as if it were a dial -LRB- alas , the truest in the world ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 28]: marking , whatever light shone out of Heaven , the flight of days and weeks and years , by some new shadow on that solemn ground . '
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 5]: A pretty church ! '
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 19]: said Martin , observing that his companion slackened the slack pace of the horse , as they approached .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 6]: ` Is it not ? '
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 7]: cried Tom , with great pride .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 12]: ` There 's the sweetest little organ there you ever heard .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 7]: I play it for them . '
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 4]: ` Indeed ? '
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 12]: ` It is hardly worth the trouble , I should think .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 10]: What do you get for that , now ? '
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 7]: ` Nothing , ' answered Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 17]: ` Well , ' returned his friend , ` you ARE a very strange fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 9]: To which remark there succeeded a brief silence .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 50]: ` When I say nothing , ' observed Mr Pinch , cheerfully , ' I am wrong , and do n't say what I mean , because I get a great deal of pleasure from it , and the means of passing some of the happiest hours I know .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 23]: It led to something else the other day ; but you will not care to hear about that I dare say ? '
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 6]: ` Oh yes I shall .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 3]: What ? '
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 33]: ` It led to my seeing , ' said Tom , in a lower voice , ` one of the loveliest and most beautiful faces you can possibly picture to yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 31]: ` And yet I am able to picture a beautiful one , ' said his friend , thoughtfully , ` or should be , if I have any memory . '
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 62]: ` She came ' said Tom , laying his hand upon the other 's arm , ` for the first time very early in the morning , when it was hardly light ; and when I saw her , over my shoulder , standing just within the porch , I turned quite cold , almost believing her to be a spirit .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 32]: A moment 's reflection got the better of that , of course , and fortunately it came to my relief so soon , that I did n't leave off playing . '
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 5]: ` Why fortunately ? '
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 3]: ` Why ?
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 7]: Because she stood there , listening .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 27]: I had my spectacles on , and saw her through the chinks in the curtains as plainly as I see you ; and she was beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 20]: After a while she glided off , and I continued to play until she was out of hearing . '
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 8]: ` Why did you do that ? '
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 7]: ` Do n't you see ? '
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 3]: responded Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 16]: ` Because she might suppose I had n't seen her ; and might return . '
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 6]: ` And did she ? '
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 5]: ` Certainly she did .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 21]: Next morning , and next evening too ; but always when there were no people about , and always alone .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 32]: I rose earlier and sat there later , that when she came , she might find the church door open , and the organ playing , and might not be disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 14]: She strolled that way for some days , and always stayed to listen .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 33]: But she is gone now , and of all unlikely things in this wide world , it is perhaps the most improbable that I shall ever look upon her face again . '
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 11]: ` You do n't know anything more about her ? '
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 12]: ` And you never followed her when she went away ? '
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 11]: ` Why should I distress her by doing that ? '
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 4]: said Tom Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 10]: ` Is it likely that she wanted my company ?
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 31]: She came to hear the organ , not to see me ; and would you have had me scare her from a place she seemed to grow quite fond of ?
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 7]: Now , Heaven bless her ! '
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 76]: cried Tom , ` to have given her but a minute 's pleasure every day , I would have gone on playing the organ at those times until I was an old man ; quite contented if she sometimes thought of a poor fellow like me , as a part of the music ; and more than recompensed if she ever mixed me up with anything she liked as well as she liked that ! '
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 58]: The new pupil was clearly very much amazed by Mr Pinch 's weakness , and would probably have told him so , and given him some good advice , but for their opportune arrival at Mr Pecksniff 's door ; the front door this time , on account of the occasion being one of ceremony and rejoicing .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 74]: The same man was in waiting for the horse who had been adjured by Mr Pinch in the morning not to yield to his rabid desire to start ; and after delivering the animal into his charge , and beseeching Mr Chuzzlewit in a whisper never to reveal a syllable of what he had just told him in the fullness of his heart , Tom led the pupil in , for instant presentation .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 65]: Mr Pecksniff had clearly not expected them for hours to come ; for he was surrounded by open books , and was glancing from volume to volume , with a black lead-pencil in his mouth , and a pair of compasses in his hand , at a vast number of mathematical diagrams , of such extraordinary shapes that they looked like designs for fireworks .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 28]: Neither had Miss Charity expected them , for she was busied , with a capacious wicker basket before her , in making impracticable nightcaps for the poor .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 23]: Neither had Miss Mercy expected them , for she was sitting upon her stool , tying on the -- oh good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 61]: -- the petticoat of a large doll that she was dressing for a neighbour 's child -- really , quite a grown-up doll , which made it more confusing -- and had its little bonnet dangling by the ribbon from one of her fair curls , to which she had fastened it lest it should be lost or sat upon .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 27]: It would be difficult , if not impossible , to conceive a family so thoroughly taken by surprise as the Pecksniffs were , on this occasion .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 5]: Bless my life ! '
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 19]: said Mr Pecksniff , looking up , and gradually exchanging his abstracted face for one of joyful recognition .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 4]: ` Here already !
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 18]: Martin , my dear boy , I am delighted to welcome you to my poor house ! '
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 45]: With this kind greeting , Mr Pecksniff fairly took him to his arms , and patted him several times upon the back with his right hand the while , as if to express that his feelings during the embrace were too much for utterance .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 42]: ` But here , ' he said , recovering , ` are my daughters , Martin ; my two only children , whom -LRB- if you ever saw them -RRB- you have not beheld -- ah , these sad family divisions !
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 7]: -- since you were infants together .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 15]: Nay , my dears , why blush at being detected in your everyday pursuits ?
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 41]: We had prepared to give you the reception of a visitor , Martin , in our little room of state , ' said Mr Pecksniff , smiling , ` but I like this better , I like this better ! '
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 45]: Oh blessed star of Innocence , wherever you may be , how did you glitter in your home of ether , when the two Miss Pecksniffs put forth each her lily hand , and gave the same , with mantling cheeks , to Martin !
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 56]: How did you twinkle , as if fluttering with sympathy , when Mercy , reminded of the bonnet in her hair , hid her fair face and turned her head aside ; the while her gentle sister plucked it out , and smote her with a sister 's soft reproof , upon her buxom shoulder !
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 41]: ` And how , ' said Mr Pecksniff , turning round after the contemplation of these passages , and taking Mr Pinch in a friendly manner by the elbow , ` how has our friend used you , Martin ? '
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 7]: ` Very well indeed , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 12]: We are on the best terms , I assure you . '
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 6]: ` Old Tom Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 11]: said Mr Pecksniff , looking on him with affectionate sadness .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 15]: It seems but yesterday that Thomas was a boy fresh from a scholastic course .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 20]: Yet years have passed , I think , since Thomas Pinch and I first walked the world together ! '
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 6]: Mr Pinch could say nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 6]: He was too much moved .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 14]: But he pressed his master 's hand , and tried to thank him .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 29]: ` And Thomas Pinch and I , ' said Mr Pecksniff , in a deeper voice , ` will walk it yet , in mutual faithfulness and friendship !
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 46]: And if it comes to pass that either of us be run over in any of those busy crossings which divide the streets of life , the other will convey him to the hospital in Hope , and sit beside his bed in Bounty ! '
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 8]: ` Well , well , well ! '
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 16]: he added in a happier tone , as he shook Mr Pinch 's elbow hard .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 6]: ` No more of this !
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 27]: Martin , my dear friend , that you may be at home within these walls , let me show you how we live , and where .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 3]: Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 23]: With that he took up a lighted candle , and , attended by his young relative , prepared to leave the room .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 7]: At the door , he stopped .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 11]: ` You 'll bear us company , Tom Pinch ? '
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 28]: Aye , cheerfully , though it had been to death , would Tom have followed him ; glad to lay down his life for such a man !
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 29]: ` This , ' said Mr Pecksniff , opening the door of an opposite parlour , ` is the little room of state , I mentioned to you .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 9]: My girls have pride in it , Martin !
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 26]: This , ' opening another door , ` is the little chamber in which my works -LRB- slight things at best -RRB- have been concocted .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 6]: Portrait of myself by Spiller .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 4]: Bust by Spoker .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 8]: The latter is considered a good likeness .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 16]: I seem to recognize something about the left-hand corner of the nose , myself . '
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 12]: Martin thought it was very like , but scarcely intellectual enough .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 14]: Mr Pecksniff observed that the same fault had been found with it before .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 12]: It was remarkable it should have struck his young relation too .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 12]: He was glad to see he had an eye for art .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 24]: ` Various books you observe , ' said Mr Pecksniff , waving his hand towards the wall , ` connected with our pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 11]: I have scribbled myself , but have not yet published .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 7]: Be careful how you come upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 12]: This , ' opening another door , ` is my chamber .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 13]: I read here when the family suppose I have retired to rest .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 28]: Sometimes I injure my health rather more than I can quite justify to myself , by doing so ; but art is long and time is short .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 14]: Every facility you see for jotting down crude notions , even here . '
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 73]: These latter words were explained by his pointing to a small round table on which were a lamp , divers sheets of paper , a piece of India rubber , and a case of instruments ; all put ready , in case an architectural idea should come into Mr Pecksniff 's head in the night ; in which event he would instantly leap out of bed , and fix it for ever .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 27]: Mr Pecksniff opened another door on the same floor , and shut it again , all at once , as if it were a Blue Chamber .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 21]: But before he had well done so , he looked smilingly round , and said , ` Why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 18]: Martin could n't say why not , because he did n't know anything at all about it .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 21]: So Mr Pecksniff answered himself , by throwing open the door , and saying : ` My daughters ' room .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 12]: A poor first-floor to us , but a bower to them .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 3]: Very neat .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 3]: Very airy .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 12]: Plants you observe ; hyacinths ; books again ; birds . '
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 29]: These birds , by the bye , comprised , in all , one staggering old sparrow without a tail , which had been borrowed expressly from the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 9]: ` Such trifles as girls love are here .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 3]: Nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 13]: Those who seek heartless splendour , would seek here in vain . '
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 10]: With that he led them to the floor above .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 31]: ` This , ' said Mr Pecksniff , throwing wide the door of the memorable two-pair front ; ` is a room where some talent has been developed I believe .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 24]: This is a room in which an idea for a steeple occurred to me that I may one day give to the world .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 8]: We work here , my dear Martin .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 19]: Some architects have been bred in this room ; a few , I think , Mr Pinch ? '
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 14]: Tom fully assented ; and , what is more , fully believed it .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 28]: ` You see , ' said Mr Pecksniff , passing the candle rapidly from roll to roll of paper , ` some traces of our doings here .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 6]: Salisbury Cathedral from the north .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 4]: From the south .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 4]: From the east .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 4]: From the west .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 4]: From the south-east .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 6]: From the nor ` west .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 3]: A bridge .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 3]: An almshouse .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 3]: A jail .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 3]: A church .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 3]: A powder-magazine .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 3]: A wine-cellar .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 3]: A portico .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 3]: A summer-house .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 3]: An ice-house .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 11]: Plans , elevations , sections , every kind of thing .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 43]: And this , ' he added , having by this time reached another large chamber on the same story , with four little beds in it , ` this is your room , of which Mr Pinch here is the quiet sharer .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 22]: A southern aspect ; a charming prospect ; Mr Pinch 's little library , you perceive ; everything agreeable and appropriate .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 19]: If there is any additional comfort you would desire to have here at anytime , pray mention it .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 22]: Even to strangers , far less to you , my dear Martin , there is no restriction on that point . '
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 36]: It was undoubtedly true , and may be stated in corroboration of Mr Pecksniff , that any pupil had the most liberal permission to mention anything in this way that suggested itself to his fancy .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 19]: Some young gentlemen had gone on mentioning the very same thing for five years without ever being stopped .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 20]: ` The domestic assistants , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` sleep above ; and that is all . '
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 32]: After which , and listening complacently as he went , to the encomiums passed by his young friend on the arrangements generally , he led the way to the parlour again .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 33]: Here a great change had taken place ; for festive preparations on a rather extensive scale were already completed , and the two Miss Pecksniffs were awaiting their return with hospitable looks .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 67]: There were two bottles of currant wine , white and red ; a dish of sandwiches -LRB- very long and very slim -RRB- ; another of apples ; another of captain 's biscuits -LRB- which are always a moist and jovial sort of viand -RRB- ; a plate of oranges cut up small and gritty ; with powdered sugar , and a highly geological home-made cake .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 88]: The magnitude of these preparations quite took away Tom Pinch 's breath ; for though the new pupils were usually let down softly , as one may say , particularly in the wine department , which had so many stages of declension , that sometimes a young gentleman was a whole fortnight in getting to the pump ; still this was a banquet ; a sort of Lord Mayor 's feast in private life ; a something to think of , and hold on by , afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 44]: To this entertainment , which apart from its own intrinsic merits , had the additional choice quality , that it was in strict keeping with the night , being both light and cool , Mr Pecksniff besought the company to do full justice .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 26]: ` Martin , ' he said , ` will seat himself between you two , my dears , and Mr Pinch will come by me .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 15]: Let us drink to our new inmate , and may we be happy together !
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 11]: Martin , my dear friend , my love to you !
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 13]: Mr Pinch , if you spare the bottle we shall quarrel . '
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 38]: And trying -LRB- in his regard for the feelings of the rest -RRB- to look as if the wine were not acid and did n't make him wink , Mr Pecksniff did honour to his own toast .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 30]: ` This , ' he said , in allusion to the party , not the wine , ` is a mingling that repays one for much disappointment and vexation .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 6]: Let us be merry . '
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 8]: Here he took a captain 's biscuit .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 17]: ` It is a poor heart that never rejoices ; and our hearts are not poor .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 3]: No ! '
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 60]: With such stimulants to merriment did he beguile the time , and do the honours of the table ; while Mr Pinch , perhaps to assure himself that what he saw and heard was holiday reality , and not a charming dream , ate of everything , and in particular disposed of the slim sandwiches to a surprising extent .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 64]: Nor was he stinted in his draughts of wine ; but on the contrary , remembering Mr Pecksniff 's speech , attacked the bottle with such vigour , that every time he filled his glass anew , Miss Charity , despite her amiable resolves , could not repress a fixed and stony glare , as if her eyes had rested on a ghost .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 51]: Mr Pecksniff also became thoughtful at those moments , not to say dejected ; but as he knew the vintage , it is very likely he may have been speculating on the probable condition of Mr Pinch upon the morrow , and discussing within himself the best remedies for colic .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 25]: Martin and the young ladies were excellent friends already , and compared recollections of their childish days , to their mutual liveliness and entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 40]: Miss Mercy laughed immensely at everything that was said ; and sometimes , after glancing at the happy face of Mr Pinch , was seized with such fits of mirth as brought her to the very confines of hysterics .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 77]: But for these bursts of gaiety , her sister , in her better sense , reproved her ; observing , in an angry whisper , that it was far from being a theme for jest ; and that she had no patience with the creature ; though it generally ended in her laughing too -- but much more moderately -- and saying that indeed it was a little too ridiculous and intolerable to be serious about .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 60]: At length it became high time to remember the first clause of that great discovery made by the ancient philosopher , for securing health , riches , and wisdom ; the infallibility of which has been for generations verified by the enormous fortunes constantly amassed by chimney-sweepers and other persons who get up early and go to bed betimes .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 37]: The young ladies accordingly rose , and having taken leave of Mr Chuzzlewit with much sweetness , and of their father with much duty and of Mr Pinch with much condescension , retired to their bower .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 41]: Mr Pecksniff insisted on accompanying his young friend upstairs for personal superintendence of his comforts ; and taking him by the arm , conducted him once more to his bedroom , followed by Mr Pinch , who bore the light .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 21]: ` Mr Pinch , ' said Pecksniff , seating himself with folded arms on one of the spare beds . '
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 10]: I do n't see any snuffers in that candlestick .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 15]: Will you oblige me by going down , and asking for a pair ? '
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 14]: Mr Pinch , only too happy to be useful , went off directly .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 35]: ` You will excuse Thomas Pinch 's want of polish , Martin , ' said Mr Pecksniff , with a smile of patronage and pity , as soon as he had left the room .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 6]: ` He means well . '
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 11]: ` He is a very good fellow , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 10]: ` Oh , yes , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 5]: Thomas Pinch means well .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 5]: He is very grateful .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 11]: I have never regretted having befriended Thomas Pinch . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 10]: I should think you never would , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 8]: ` No , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 4]: I hope not .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 18]: Poor fellow , he is always disposed to do his best ; but he is not gifted .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 14]: You will make him useful to you , Martin , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 20]: If Thomas has a fault , it is that he is sometimes a little apt to forget his position .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 6]: But that is soon checked .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 3]: Worthy soul !
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 8]: You will find him easy to manage .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 4]: Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 7]: ` Good night , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 11]: By this time Mr Pinch had returned with the snuffers .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 14]: ` And good night to YOU , Mr Pinch , ' said Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 8]: ` And sound sleep to you both .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 3]: Bless you !
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 4]: Bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 31]: Invoking this benediction on the heads of his young friends with great fervour , he withdrew to his own room ; while they , being tired , soon fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 25]: If Martin dreamed at all , some clue to the matter of his visions may possibly be gathered from the after-pages of this history .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 16]: Those of Thomas Pinch were all of holidays , church organs , and seraphic Pecksniffs .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 40]: It was some time before Mr Pecksniff dreamed at all , or even sought his pillow , as he sat for full two hours before the fire in his own chamber , looking at the coals and thinking deeply .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 11]: But he , too , slept and dreamed at last .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 25]: Thus in the quiet hours of the night , one house shuts in as many incoherent and incongruous fancies as a madman 's head .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 69]: CHAPTER SIX COMPRISES , AMONG OTHER IMPORTANT MATTERS , PECKSNIFFIAN AND ARCHITECTURAL , AND EXACT RELATION OF THE PROGRESS MADE BY MR PINCH IN THE CONFIDENCE AND FRIENDSHIP OF THE NEW PUPIL It was morning ; and the beautiful Aurora , of whom so much hath been written , said , and sung , did , with her rosy fingers , nip and tweak Miss Pecksniff 's nose .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 45]: It was the frolicsome custom of the Goddess , in her intercourse with the fair Cherry , so to do ; or in more prosaic phrase , the tip of that feature in the sweet girl 's countenance was always very red at breakfast-time .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 79]: For the most part , indeed , it wore , at that season of the day , a scraped and frosty look , as if it had been rasped ; while a similar phenomenon developed itself in her humour , which was then observed to be of a sharp and acid quality , as though an extra lemon -LRB- figuratively speaking -RRB- had been squeezed into the nectar of her disposition , and had rather damaged its flavour .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 50]: This additional pungency on the part of the fair young creature led , on ordinary occasions , to such slight consequences as the copious dilution of Mr Pinch 's tea , or to his coming off uncommonly short in respect of butter , or to other the like results .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 109]: But on the morning after the Installation Banquet , she suffered him to wander to and fro among the eatables and drinkables , a perfectly free and unchecked man ; so utterly to Mr Pinch 's wonder and confusion , that like the wretched captive who recovered his liberty in his old age , he could make but little use of his enlargement , and fell into a strange kind of flutter for want of some kind hand to scrape his bread , and cut him off in the article of sugar with a lump , and pay him those other little attentions to which he was accustomed .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 49]: There was something almost awful , too , about the self-possession of the new pupil ; who ` troubled ' Mr Pecksniff for the loaf , and helped himself to a rasher of that gentleman 's own particular and private bacon , with all the coolness in life .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 80]: He even seemed to think that he was doing quite a regular thing , and to expect that Mr Pinch would follow his example , since he took occasion to observe of that young man ` that he did n't get on ' ; a speech of so tremendous a character , that Tom cast down his eyes involuntarily , and felt as if he himself had committed some horrible deed and heinous breach of Mr Pecksniff 's confidence .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 57]: Indeed , the agony of having such an indiscreet remark addressed to him before the assembled family , was breakfast enough in itself , and would , without any other matter of reflection , have settled Mr Pinch 's business and quenched his appetite , for one meal , though he had been never so hungry .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 35]: The young ladies , however , and Mr Pecksniff likewise , remained in the very best of spirits in spite of these severe trials , though with something of a mysterious understanding among themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 18]: When the meal was nearly over , Mr Pecksniff smilingly explained the cause of their common satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 33]: ` It is not often , ' he said , ` Martin , that my daughters and I desert our quiet home to pursue the giddy round of pleasures that revolves abroad .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 9]: But we think of doing so to-day . '
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 6]: ` Indeed , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 5]: cried the new pupil .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 23]: ` Yes , ' said Mr Pecksniff , tapping his left hand with a letter which he held in his right . '
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 43]: I have a summons here to repair to London ; on professional business , my dear Martin ; strictly on professional business ; and I promised my girls , long ago , that whenever that happened again , they should accompany me .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 36]: We shall go forth to-night by the heavy coach -- like the dove of old , my dear Martin -- and it will be a week before we again deposit our olive-branches in the passage .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 23]: When I say olive-branches , ' observed Mr Pecksniff , in explanation , ' I mean , our unpretending luggage . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 14]: I hope the young ladies will enjoy their trip , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 8]: that I 'm sure we shall ! '
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 7]: cried Mercy , clapping her hands .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 15]: ` Good gracious , Cherry , my darling , the idea of London ! '
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 5]: ` Ardent child ! '
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 12]: said Mr Pecksniff , gazing on her in a dreamy way .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 13]: ` And yet there is a melancholy sweetness in these youthful hopes !
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 12]: It is pleasant to know that they never can be realised .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 34]: I remember thinking once myself , in the days of my childhood , that pickled onions grew on trees , and that every elephant was born with an impregnable castle on his back .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 26]: I have not found the fact to be so ; far from it ; and yet those visions have comforted me under circumstances of trial .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 38]: Even when I have had the anguish of discovering that I have nourished in my breast on ostrich , and not a human pupil -- even in that hour of agony , they have soothed me . '
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 35]: At this dread allusion to John Westlock , Mr Pinch precipitately choked in his tea ; for he had that very morning received a letter from him , as Mr Pecksniff very well knew .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 32]: ` You will take care , my dear Martin , ' said Mr Pecksniff , resuming his former cheerfulness , ` that the house does not run away in our absence .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 8]: We leave you in charge of everything .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 11]: There is no mystery ; all is free and open .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 26]: Unlike the young man in the Eastern tale -- who is described as a one-eyed almanac , if I am not mistaken , Mr Pinch ?
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 16]: -- ' ' A one-eyed calender , I think , sir , ' faltered Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 30]: ` They are pretty nearly the same thing , I believe , ' said Mr Pecksniff , smiling compassionately ; ` or they used to be in my time .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 35]: Unlike that young man , my dear Martin , you are forbidden to enter no corner of this house ; but are requested to make yourself perfectly at home in every part of it .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 20]: You will be jovial , my dear Martin , and will kill the fatted calf if you please ! '
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 71]: There was not the least objection , doubtless , to the young man 's slaughtering and appropriating to his own use any calf , fat or lean , that he might happen to find upon the premises ; but as no such animal chanced at that time to be grazing on Mr Pecksniff 's estate , this request must be considered rather as a polite compliment that a substantial hospitality .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 34]: It was the finishing ornament of the conversation ; for when he had delivered it , Mr Pecksniff rose and led the way to that hotbed of architectural genius , the two-pair front .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 29]: ` Let me see , ' he said , searching among the papers , ` how you can best employ yourself , Martin , while I am absent .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 40]: Suppose you were to give me your idea of a monument to a Lord Mayor of London ; or a tomb for a sheriff ; or your notion of a cow-house to be erected in a nobleman 's park .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 44]: Do you know , now , ' said Mr Pecksniff , folding his hands , and looking at his young relation with an air of pensive interest , ` that I should very much like to see your notion of a cow-house ? '
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 12]: But Martin by no means appeared to relish this suggestion . '
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 14]: A pump , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` is very chaste practice .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 20]: I have found that a lamp post is calculated to refine the mind and give it a classical tendency .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 11]: An ornamental turnpike has a remarkable effect upon the imagination .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 12]: What do you say to beginning with an ornamental turnpike ? '
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 12]: ` Whatever Mr Pecksniff pleased , ' said Martin , doubtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 8]: ` Stay , ' said that gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 3]: ` Come !
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 18]: as you 're ambitious , and are a very neat draughtsman , you shall -- ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 25]: -- you shall try your hand on these proposals for a grammar-school ; regulating your plan , of course , by the printed particulars .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 28]: Upon my word , now , ' said Mr Pecksniff , merrily , ' I shall be very curious to see what you make of the grammar-school .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 28]: Who knows but a young man of your taste might hit upon something , impracticable and unlikely in itself , but which I could put into shape ?
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 29]: For it really is , my dear Martin , it really is in the finishing touches alone , that great experience and long study in these matters tell .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 39]: Now it really will be , ' continued Mr Pecksniff , clapping his young friend on the back in his droll humour , ` an amusement to me , to see what you make of the grammar-school . '
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 58]: Martin readily undertook this task , and Mr Pecksniff forthwith proceeded to entrust him with the materials necessary for its execution ; dwelling meanwhile on the magical effect of a few finishing touches from the hand of a master ; which , indeed , as some people said -LRB- and these were the old enemies again ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 65]: was unquestionably very surprising , and almost miraculous ; as there were cases on record in which the masterly introduction of an additional back window , or a kitchen door , or half-a-dozen steps , or even a water spout , had made the design of a pupil Mr Pecksniff 's own work , and had brought substantial rewards into that gentleman 's pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 16]: But such is the magic of genius , which changes all it handles into gold !
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 58]: ` When your mind requires to be refreshed by change of occupation , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` Thomas Pinch will instruct you in the art of surveying the back garden , or in ascertaining the dead level of the road between this house and the finger-post , or in any other practical and pleasing pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 22]: There are a cart-load of loose bricks , and a score or two of old flower-pots , in the back yard .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 51]: If you could pile them up my dear Martin , into any form which would remind me on my return say of St. Peter 's at Rome , or the Mosque of St. Sophia at Constantinople , it would be at once improving to you and agreeable to my feelings .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 49]: And now , ' said Mr Pecksniff , in conclusion , ` to drop , for the present , our professional relations and advert to private matters , I shall be glad to talk with you in my own room , while I pack up my portmanteau . '
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 22]: Martin attended him ; and they remained in secret conference together for an hour or more ; leaving Tom Pinch alone .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 50]: When the young man returned , he was very taciturn and dull , in which state he remained all day ; so that Tom , after trying him once or twice with indifferent conversation , felt a delicacy in obtruding himself upon his thoughts , and said no more .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 138]: He would not have had leisure to say much , had his new friend been ever so loquacious ; for first of all Mr Pecksniff called him down to stand upon the top of his portmanteau and represent ancient statues there , until such time as it would consent to be locked ; and then Miss Charity called him to come and cord her trunk ; and then Miss Mercy sent for him to come and mend her box ; and then he wrote the fullest possible cards for all the luggage ; and then he volunteered to carry it all downstairs ; and after that to see it safely carried on a couple of barrows to the old finger-post at the end of the lane ; and then to mind it till the coach came up .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 68]: In short , his day 's work would have been a pretty heavy one for a porter , but his thorough good-will made nothing of it ; and as he sat upon the luggage at last , waiting for the Pecksniffs , escorted by the new pupil , to come down the lane , his heart was light with the hope of having pleased his benefactor . '
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 71]: I was almost afraid , ' said Tom , taking a letter from his pocket and wiping his face , for he was hot with bustling about though it was a cold day , ` that I should n't have had time to write it , and that would have been a thousand pities ; postage from such a distance being a serious consideration , when one 's not rich .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 23]: She will be glad to see my hand , poor girl , and to hear that Pecksniff is as kind as ever .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 40]: I would have asked John Westlock to call and see her , and tell her all about me by word of mouth , but I was afraid he might speak against Pecksniff to her , and make her uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 31]: Besides , they are particular people where she is , and it might have rendered her situation uncomfortable if she had had a visit from a young man like John .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 4]: Poor Ruth ! '
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 97]: Tom Pinch seemed a little disposed to be melancholy for half a minute or so , but he found comfort very soon , and pursued his ruminations thus : ` I 'm a nice man , I do n't think , as John used to say -LRB- John was a kind , merry-hearted fellow ; I wish he had liked Pecksniff better -RRB- , to be feeling low , on account of the distance between us , when I ought to be thinking , instead , of my extraordinary good luck in having ever got here .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 24]: I must have been born with a silver spoon in my mouth , I am sure , to have ever come across Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 16]: And here have I fallen again into my usual good luck with the new pupil !
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 17]: Such an affable , generous , free fellow , as he is , I never saw .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 7]: Why , we were companions directly !
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 30]: and he a relation of Pecksniff 's too , and a clever , dashing youth who might cut his way through the world as if it were a cheese !
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 28]: Here he comes while the words are on my lips ' said Tom ; ` walking down the lane as if the lane belonged to him . '
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 47]: In truth , the new pupil , not at all disconcerted by the honour of having Miss Mercy Pecksniff on his arm , or by the affectionate adieux of that young lady , approached as Mr Pinch spoke , followed by Miss Charity and Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 28]: As the coach appeared at the same moment , Tom lost no time in entreating the gentleman last mentioned , to undertake the delivery of his letter .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 9]: said Mr Pecksniff , glancing at the superscription .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 7]: ` For your sister , Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 13]: Yes , oh yes , it shall be delivered , Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 8]: Make your mind easy upon that score .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 10]: She shall certainly have it , Mr Pinch . '
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 36]: He made the promise with so much condescension and patronage , that Tom felt he had asked a great deal -LRB- this had not occurred to his mind before -RRB- , and thanked him earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 24]: The Miss Pecksniffs , according to a custom they had , were amused beyond description at the mention of Mr Pinch 's sister .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 4]: Oh the fright !
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 8]: The bare idea of a Miss Pinch !
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 3]: Good heavens !
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 25]: Tom was greatly pleased to see them so merry , for he took it as a token of their favour , and good-humoured regard .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 23]: Therefore he laughed too and rubbed his hands and wished them a pleasant journey and safe return , and was quite brisk .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 80]: Even when the coach had rolled away with the olive-branches in the boot and the family of doves inside , he stood waving his hand and bowing ; so much gratified by the unusually courteous demeanour of the young ladies , that he was quite regardless , for the moment , of Martin Chuzzlewit , who stood leaning thoughtfully against the finger-post , and who after disposing of his fair charge had hardly lifted his eyes from the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 32]: The perfect silence which ensued upon the bustle and departure of the coach , together with the sharp air of the wintry afternoon , roused them both at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 13]: They turned , as by mutual consent , and moved off arm-in-arm .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 7]: ` How melancholy you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 10]: said Tom ; ` what is the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 10]: ` Nothing worth speaking of , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 24]: ` Very little more than was the matter yesterday , and much more , I hope , than will be the matter to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 9]: I 'm out of spirits , Pinch . '
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 30]: ` Well , ' cried Tom , ` now do you know I am in capital spirits today , and scarcely ever felt more disposed to be good company .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 22]: It was a very kind thing in your predecessor , John , to write to me , was it not ? '
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 34]: ` Why , yes , ' said Martin carelessly ; ' I should have thought he would have had enough to do to enjoy himself , without thinking of you , Pinch . '
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 52]: ` Just what I felt to be so very likely , ' Tom rejoined ; ` but no , he keeps his word , and says , `` My dear Pinch , I often think of you , '' and all sorts of kind and considerate things of that description . '
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 29]: ` He must be a devilish good-natured fellow , ' said Martin , somewhat peevishly : ` because he ca n't mean that , you know . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 10]: I do n't suppose he can , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 11]: said Tom , looking wistfully in his companion 's face .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 12]: ` He says so to please me , you think ? '
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 63]: ` Why , is it likely , ' rejoined Martin , with greater earnestness , ` that a young man newly escaped from this kennel of a place , and fresh to all the delights of being his own master in London , can have much leisure or inclination to think favourably of anything or anybody he has left behind him here ?
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 13]: I put it to you , Pinch , is it natural ? '
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 38]: After a short reflection , Mr Pinch replied , in a more subdued tone , that to be sure it was unreasonable to expect any such thing , and that he had no doubt Martin knew best .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 11]: ` Of course I know best , ' Martin observed .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 14]: ` Yes , I feel that , ' said Mr Pinch mildly . '
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 5]: I said so . '
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 30]: And when he had made this rejoinder , they fell into a blank silence again , which lasted until they reached home ; by which time it was dark .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 52]: Now , Miss Charity Pecksniff , in consideration of the inconvenience of carrying them with her in the coach , and the impossibility of preserving them by artificial means until the family 's return , had set forth , in a couple of plates , the fragments of yesterday 's feast .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 57]: In virtue of which liberal arrangement , they had the happiness to find awaiting them in the parlour two chaotic heaps of the remains of last night 's pleasure , consisting of certain filmy bits of oranges , some mummied sandwiches , various disrupted masses of the geological cake , and several entire captain 's biscuits .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 49]: That choice liquor in which to steep these dainties might not be wanting , the remains of the two bottles of currant wine had been poured together and corked with a curl-paper ; so that every material was at hand for making quite a heavy night of it .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 44]: Martin Chuzzlewit beheld these roystering preparations with infinite contempt , and stirring the fire into a blaze -LRB- to the great destruction of Mr Pecksniff 's coals -RRB- , sat moodily down before it , in the most comfortable chair he could find .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 51]: That he might the better squeeze himself into the small corner that was left for him , Mr Pinch took up his position on Miss Mercy Pecksniff 's stool , and setting his glass down upon the hearthrug and putting his plate upon his knees , began to enjoy himself .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 61]: If Diogenes coming to life again could have rolled himself , tub and all , into Mr Pecksniff 's parlour and could have seen Tom Pinch as he sat on Mercy Pecksniff 's stool with his plate and glass before him he could not have faced it out , though in his surliest mood , but must have smiled good-temperedly .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 144]: The perfect and entire satisfaction of Tom ; his surpassing appreciation of the husky sandwiches , which crumbled in his mouth like saw-dust ; the unspeakable relish with which he swallowed the thin wine by drops , and smacked his lips , as though it were so rich and generous that to lose an atom of its fruity flavour were a sin ; the look with which he paused sometimes , with his glass in his hand , proposing silent toasts to himself ; and the anxious shade that came upon his contented face when , after wandering round the room , exulting in its uninvaded snugness , his glance encountered the dull brow of his companion ; no cynic in the world , though in his hatred of its men a very griffin , could have withstood these things in Thomas Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 60]: Some men would have slapped him on the back , and pledged him in a bumper of the currant wine , though it had been the sharpest vinegar -- aye , and liked its flavour too ; some would have seized him by his honest hand , and thanked him for the lesson that his simple nature taught them .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 36]: Some would have laughed with , and others would have laughed at him ; of which last class was Martin Chuzzlewit , who , unable to restrain himself , at last laughed loud and long .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 12]: ` That 's right , ' said Tom , nodding approvingly .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 4]: ` Cheer up !
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 5]: That 's capital ! '
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 35]: At which encouragement young Martin laughed again ; and said , as soon as he had breath and gravity enough : ' I never saw such a fellow as you are , Pinch . '
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 7]: ` Did n't you though ? '
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 35]: ` Well , it 's very likely you do find me strange , because I have hardly seen anything of the world , and you have seen a good deal I dare say ? '
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 31]: ` Pretty well for my time of life , ' rejoined Martin , drawing his chair still nearer to the fire , and spreading his feet out on the fender .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 12]: ` Deuce take it , I must talk openly to somebody .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 10]: I 'll talk openly to you , Pinch . '
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 4]: ` Do ! '
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 4]: said Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 24]: I shall take it as being very friendly of you , ' ` I 'm not in your way , am I ? '
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 22]: inquired Martin , glancing down at Mr Pinch , who was by this time looking at the fire over his leg .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 6]: ` Not at all ! '
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 66]: ` You must know then , to make short of a long story , ' said Martin , beginning with a kind of effort , as if the revelation were not agreeable to him ; ` that I have been bred up from childhood with great expectations , and have always been taught to believe that I should be , one day , very rich .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 29]: So I should have been , but for certain brief reasons which I am going to tell you , and which have led to my being disinherited . '
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 6]: ` By your father ? '
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 8]: inquired Mr Pinch , with open eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 5]: ` By my grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 9]: I have had no parents these many years .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 6]: Scarcely within my remembrance . '
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 24]: ` Neither have I , ' said Tom , touching the young man 's hand with his own and timidly withdrawing it again .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 69]: ` Why , as to that , you know , Pinch , ' pursued the other , stirring the fire again , and speaking in his rapid , off-hand way ; ` it 's all very right and proper to be fond of parents when we have them , and to bear them in remembrance after they 're dead , if you have ever known anything of them .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 28]: But as I never did know anything about mine personally , you know , why , I ca n't be expected to be very sentimental about 'em .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 11]: And I am not ; that 's the truth . '
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 11]: Mr Pinch was just then looking thoughtfully at the bars .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 17]: But on his companion pausing in this place , he started , and said ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 11]: of course ' -- and composed himself to listen again .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 29]: ` In a word , ' said Martin , ' I have been bred and reared all my life by this grandfather of whom I have just spoken .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 43]: Now , he has a great many good points -- there is no doubt about that ; I 'll not disguise the fact from you -- but he has two very great faults , which are the staple of his bad side .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 22]: In the first place , he has the most confirmed obstinacy of character you ever met with in any human creature .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 11]: In the second , he is most abominably selfish . '
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 6]: ` Is he indeed ? '
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 19]: ` In those two respects , ' returned the other , ` there never was such a man .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 35]: I have often heard from those who know , that they have been , time out of mind , the failings of our family ; and I believe there 's some truth in it .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 10]: But I ca n't say of my own knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 36]: All I have to do , you know , is to be very thankful that they have n't descended to me , and , to be very careful that I do n't contract 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 10]: ` To be sure , ' said Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 5]: ` Very proper . '
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 44]: ` Well , sir , ' resumed Martin , stirring the fire once more , and drawing his chair still closer to it , ` his selfishness makes him exacting , you see ; and his obstinacy makes him resolute in his exactions .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 35]: The consequence is that he has always exacted a great deal from me in the way of respect , and submission , and self-denial when his wishes were in question , and so forth .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 96]: I have borne a great deal from him , because I have been under obligations to him -LRB- if one can ever be said to be under obligations to one 's own grandfather -RRB- , and because I have been really attached to him ; but we have had a great many quarrels for all that , for I could not accommodate myself to his ways very often -- not out of the least reference to myself , you understand , but because -- ' he stammered here , and was rather at a loss .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 24]: Mr Pinch being about the worst man in the world to help anybody out of a difficulty of this sort , said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 23]: as you understand me , ' resumed Martin , quickly , ' I need n't hunt for the precise expression I want .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 18]: Now I come to the cream of my story , and the occasion of my being here .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 8]: I am in love , Pinch . '
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 12]: Mr Pinch looked up into his face with increased interest . '
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 7]: I say I am in love .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 17]: I am in love with one of the most beautiful girls the sun ever shone upon .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 39]: But she is wholly and entirely dependent upon the pleasure of my grandfather ; and if he were to know that she favoured my passion , she would lose her home and everything she possesses in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 13]: There is nothing very selfish in THAT love , I think ? '
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 4]: ` Selfish ! '
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 6]: ` You have acted nobly .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 36]: To love her as I am sure you do , and yet in consideration for her state of dependence , not even to disclose -- ' ` What are you talking about , Pinch ? '
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 15]: said Martin pettishly : ` do n't make yourself ridiculous , my good fellow !
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 10]: What do you mean by not disclosing ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 10]: I beg your pardon , ' answered Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 15]: I thought you meant that , or I would n't have said it . '
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 23]: ` If I did n't tell her I loved her , where would be the use of my being in love ? '
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 18]: said Martin : ` unless to keep myself in a perpetual state of worry and vexation ? '
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 9]: ` That 's true , ' Tom answered .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 22]: I can guess what SHE said when you told her , ' he added , glancing at Martin 's handsome face .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 51]: ` Why , not exactly , Pinch , ' he rejoined , with a slight frown ; ` because she has some girlish notions about duty and gratitude , and all the rest of it , which are rather hard to fathom ; but in the main you are right .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 9]: Her heart was mine , I found . '
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 10]: ` Just what I supposed , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 5]: ` Quite natural ! '
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 17]: and , in his great satisfaction , he took a long sip out of his wine-glass .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 45]: ` Although I had conducted myself from the first with the utmost circumspection , ' pursued Martin , ' I had not managed matters so well but that my grandfather , who is full of jealousy and distrust , suspected me of loving her .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 66]: He said nothing to her , but straightway attacked me in private , and charged me with designing to corrupt the fidelity to himself -LRB- there you observe his selfishness -RRB- , of a young creature whom he had trained and educated to be his only disinterested and faithful companion , when he should have disposed of me in marriage to his heart 's content .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 43]: Upon that , I took fire immediately , and told him that with his good leave I would dispose of myself in marriage , and would rather not be knocked down by him or any other auctioneer to any bidder whomsoever . '
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 19]: Mr Pinch opened his eyes wider , and looked at the fire harder than he had done yet .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 30]: ` You may be sure , ' said Martin , ` that this nettled him , and that he began to be the very reverse of complimentary to myself .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 33]: Interview succeeded interview ; words engendered words , as they always do ; and the upshot of it was , that I was to renounce her , or be renounced by him .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 75]: Now you must bear in mind , Pinch , that I am not only desperately fond of her -LRB- for though she is poor , her beauty and intellect would reflect great credit on anybody , I do n't care of what pretensions who might become her husband -RRB- , but that a chief ingredient in my composition is a most determined -- ' ` Obstinacy , ' suggested Tom in perfect good faith .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 35]: But the suggestion was not so well received as he had expected ; for the young man immediately rejoined , with some irritation , ` What a fellow you are , Pinch ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 19]: I beg your pardon , ' said Tom , ' I thought you wanted a word . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 12]: I did n't want that word , ' he rejoined . '
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 15]: I told you obstinacy was no part of my character , did I not ?
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 27]: I was going to say , if you had given me leave , that a chief ingredient in my composition is a most determined firmness . '
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 11]: cried Tom , screwing up his mouth , and nodding .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 9]: ` Yes , yes ; I see ! '
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 36]: ` And being firm , ' pursued Martin , ` of course I was not going to yield to him , or give way by so much as the thousandth part of an inch . '
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 9]: ` No , no , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 20]: ` On the contrary , the more he urged , the more I was determined to oppose him . '
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 6]: ` To be sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 55]: ` Very well , ' rejoined Martin , throwing himself back in his chair , with a careless wave of both hands , as if the subject were quite settled , and nothing more could be said about it -- ` There is an end of the matter , and here am I ! '
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 38]: Mr Pinch sat staring at the fire for some minutes with a puzzled look , such as he might have assumed if some uncommonly difficult conundrum had been proposed , which he found it impossible to guess .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 17]: At length he said : ` Pecksniff , of course , you had known before ? '
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 5]: ` Only by name .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 24]: No , I had never seen him , for my grandfather kept not only himself but me , aloof from all his relations .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 13]: But our separation took place in a town in the adjoining country .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 45]: From that place I came to Salisbury , and there I saw Pecksniff 's advertisement , which I answered , having always had some natural taste , I believe , in the matters to which it referred , and thinking it might suit me .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 47]: As soon as I found it to be his , I was doubly bent on coming to him if possible , on account of his being -- ' ` Such an excellent man , ' interposed Tom , rubbing his hands : ` so he is .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 6]: You were quite right . '
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 62]: ` Why , not so much on that account , if the truth must be spoken , ' returned Martin , ` as because my grandfather has an inveterate dislike to him , and after the old man 's arbitrary treatment of me , I had a natural desire to run as directly counter to all his opinions as I could .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 9]: As I said before , here I am .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 49]: My engagement with the young lady I have been telling you about is likely to be a tolerably long one ; for neither her prospects nor mine are very bright ; and of course I shall not think of marrying until I am well able to do so .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 37]: It would never do , you know , for me to be plunging myself into poverty and shabbiness and love in one room up three pair of stairs , and all that sort of thing . '
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 17]: ` To say nothing of her , ' remarked Tom Pinch , in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 20]: ` Exactly so , ' rejoined Martin , rising to warm his back , and leaning against the chimney-piece .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 7]: ` To say nothing of her .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 60]: At the same time , of course it 's not very hard upon her to be obliged to yield to the necessity of the case ; first , because she loves me very much ; and secondly , because I have sacrificed a great deal on her account , and might have done much better , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 35]: It was a very long time before Tom said ` Certainly ; ' so long , that he might have taken a nap in the interval , but he did say it at last .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 25]: ` Now , there is one odd coincidence connected with this love-story , ' said Martin , ` which brings it to an end .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 23]: You remember what you told me last night as we were coming here , about your pretty visitor in the church ? '
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 35]: ` Surely I do , ' said Tom , rising from his stool , and seating himself in the chair from which the other had lately risen , that he might see his face .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 4]: ` Undoubtedly . '
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 7]: ` That was she . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 23]: I knew what you were going to say , ' cried Tom , looking fixedly at him , and speaking very softly .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 9]: ` You do n't tell me so ? '
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 11]: ` That was she , ' repeated the young man .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 22]: ` After what I have heard from Pecksniff , I have no doubt that she came and went with my grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 28]: -- Do n't you drink too much of that sour wine , or you 'll have a fit of some sort , Pinch , I see . '
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 27]: ` It is not very wholesome , I am afraid , ' said Tom , setting down the empty glass he had for some time held .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 10]: ` So that was she , was it ? '
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 66]: Martin nodded assent ; and adding , with a restless impatience , that if he had been a few days earlier he would have seen her ; and that now she might be , for anything he knew , hundreds of miles away ; threw himself , after a few turns across the room , into a chair , and chafed like a spoilt child .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 58]: Tom Pinch 's heart was very tender , and he could not bear to see the most indifferent person in distress ; still less one who had awakened an interest in him , and who regarded him -LRB- either in fact , or as he supposed -RRB- with kindness , and in a spirit of lenient construction .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 44]: Whatever his own thoughts had been a few moments before -- and to judge from his face they must have been pretty serious -- he dismissed them instantly , and gave his young friend the best counsel and comfort that occurred to him .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 40]: ` All will be well in time , ' said Tom , ' I have no doubt ; and some trial and adversity just now will only serve to make you more attached to each other in better days .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 32]: I have always read that the truth is so , and I have a feeling within me , which tells me how natural and right it is that it should be .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 79]: That never ran smooth yet , ' said Tom , with a smile which , despite the homeliness of his face , was pleasanter to see than many a proud beauty 's brightest glance ; ` what never ran smooth yet , can hardly be expected to change its character for us ; so we must take it as we find it , and fashion it into the very best shape we can , by patience and good-humour .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 45]: I have no power at all ; I need n't tell you that ; but I have an excellent will ; and if I could ever be of use to you , in any way whatever , how very glad I should be ! '
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 12]: ` Thank you , ' said Martin , shaking his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 16]: ` You 're a good fellow , upon my word , and speak very kindly .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 50]: Of course you know , ' he added , after a moment 's pause , as he drew his chair towards the fire again , ' I should not hesitate to avail myself of your services if you could help me at all ; but mercy on us ! '
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 52]: -- Here he rumpled his hair impatiently with his hand , and looked at Tom as if he took it rather ill that he was not somebody else -- ` you might as well be a toasting-fork or a frying-pan , Pinch , for any help you can render me . '
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 12]: ` Except in the inclination , ' said Tom , gently .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 4]: to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 7]: I meant that , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 12]: If inclination went for anything , I should n't want help .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 22]: I tell you what you may do , though , if you will , and at the present moment too . '
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 6]: ` What is that ? '
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 3]: demanded Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 7]: ` Read to me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 16]: I shall be delighted , ' cried Tom , catching up the candle with enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 19]: ` Excuse my leaving you in the dark a moment , and I 'll fetch a book directly .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 5]: What will you like ?
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 3]: Shakespeare ? '
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 4]: ` Aye ! '
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 9]: replied his friend , yawning and stretching himself .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 5]: ` He 'll do .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 41]: I am tired with the bustle of to-day , and the novelty of everything about me ; and in such a case , there 's no greater luxury in the world , I think , than being read to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 14]: You wo n't mind my going to sleep , if I can ? '
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 6]: ` Not at all ! '
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 9]: ` Then begin as soon as you like .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 30]: You need n't leave off when you see me getting drowsy -LRB- unless you feel tired -RRB- , for it 's pleasant to wake gradually to the sounds again .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 7]: Did you ever try that ? '
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 14]: ` No , I never tried that , ' said Tom ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 19]: You can , you know , one of these days when we 're both in the right humour .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 9]: Do n't mind leaving me in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 4]: Look sharp ! '
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 29]: Mr Pinch lost no time in moving away ; and in a minute or two returned with one of the precious volumes from the shelf beside his bed .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 41]: Martin had in the meantime made himself as comfortable as circumstances would permit , by constructing before the fire a temporary sofa of three chairs with Mercy 's stool for a pillow , and lying down at full-length upon it .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 15]: ` Do n't be too loud , please , ' he said to Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 9]: ` No , no , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 15]: ` You 're sure you 're not cold ' ` Not at all ! '
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 4]: cried Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 8]: I am quite ready , then . '
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 36]: Mr Pinch accordingly , after turning over the leaves of his book with as much care as if they were living and highly cherished creatures , made his own selection , and began to read .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 11]: Before he had completed fifty lines his friend was snoring .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 5]: ` Poor fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 22]: said Tom , softly , as he stretched out his head to peep at him over the backs of the chairs .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 11]: ` He is very young to have so much trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 14]: How trustful and generous in him to bestow all this confidence in me .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 9]: And that was she , was it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 40]: But suddenly remembering their compact , he took up the poem at the place where he had left off , and went on reading ; always forgetting to snuff the candle , until its wick looked like a mushroom .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 43]: He gradually became so much interested , that he quite forgot to replenish the fire ; and was only reminded of his neglect by Martin Chuzzlewit starting up after the lapse of an hour or so , and crying with a shiver .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 11]: ` Why , it 's nearly out , I declare !
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 8]: No wonder I dreamed of being frozen .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 6]: Do call for some coals .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 9]: What a fellow you are , Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 65]: CHAPTER SEVEN IN WHICH MR CHEVY SLYME ASSERTS THE INDEPENDENCE OF HIS SPIRIT , AND THE BLUE DRAGON LOSES A LIMB Martin began to work at the grammar-school next morning , with so much vigour and expedition , that Mr Pinch had new reason to do homage to the natural endowments of that young gentleman , and to acknowledge his infinite superiority to himself .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 69]: The new pupil received Tom 's compliments very graciously ; and having by this time conceived a real regard for him , in his own peculiar way , predicted that they would always be the very best of friends , and that neither of them , he was certain -LRB- but particularly Tom -RRB- , would ever have reason to regret the day on which they became acquainted .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 39]: Mr Pinch was delighted to hear him say this , and felt so much flattered by his kind assurances of friendship and protection , that he was at a loss how to express the pleasure they afforded him .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 95]: And indeed it may be observed of this friendship , such as it was , that it had within it more likely materials of endurance than many a sworn brotherhood that has been rich in promise ; for so long as the one party found a pleasure in patronizing , and the other in being patronised -LRB- which was in the very essence of their respective characters -RRB- , it was of all possible events among the least probable , that the twin demons , Envy and Pride , would ever arise between them .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 30]: So in very many cases of friendship , or what passes for it , the old axiom is reversed , and like clings to unlike more than to like .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 119]: They were both very busy on the afternoon succeeding the family 's departure -- Martin with the grammar-school , and Tom in balancing certain receipts of rents , and deducting Mr Pecksniff 's commission from the same ; in which abstruse employment he was much distracted by a habit his new friend had of whistling aloud while he was drawing -- when they were not a little startled by the unexpected obtrusion into that sanctuary of genius , of a human head which , although a shaggy and somewhat alarming head in appearance , smiled affably upon them from the doorway , in a manner that was at once waggish , conciliatory , and expressive of approbation . '
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 26]: I am not industrious myself , gents both , ' said the head , ` but I know how to appreciate that quality in others .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 32]: I wish I may turn grey and ugly , if it is n't in my opinion , next to genius , one of the very charmingest qualities of the human mind .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 26]: Upon my soul , I am grateful to my friend Pecksniff for helping me to the contemplation of such a delicious picture as you present .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 13]: You remind me of Whittington , afterwards thrice Lord Mayor of London .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 20]: I give you my unsullied word of honour , that you very strongly remind me of that historical character .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 34]: You are a pair of Whittingtons , gents , without the cat ; which is a most agreeable and blessed exception to me , for I am not attached to the feline species .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 11]: My name is Tigg ; how do you do ? '
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 31]: Martin looked to Mr Pinch for an explanation ; and Tom , who had never in his life set eyes on Mr Tigg before , looked to that gentleman himself .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 5]: ` Chevy Slyme ? '
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 16]: said Mr Tigg , interrogatively , and kissing his left hand in token of friendship .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 29]: ` You will understand me when I say that I am the accredited agent of Chevy Slyme ; that I am the ambassador from the court of Chiv ?
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 4]: Ha ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 4]: ` Heyday ! '
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 13]: asked Martin , starting at the mention of a name he knew .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 11]: ` Pray , what does he want with me ? '
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 12]: ` If your name is Pinch ' -- Mr Tigg began .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 11]: ` It is not ' said Martin , checking himself .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 7]: ` That is Mr Pinch . '
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 82]: ` If that is Mr Pinch , ' cried Tigg , kissing his hand again , and beginning to follow his head into the room , ` he will permit me to say that I greatly esteem and respect his character , which has been most highly commended to me by my friend Pecksniff ; and that I deeply appreciate his talent for the organ , notwithstanding that I do not , if I may use the expression , grind myself .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 32]: If that is Mr Pinch , I will venture to express a hope that I see him well , and that he is suffering no inconvenience from the easterly wind ? '
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 9]: ` Thank you , ' said Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 6]: I am very well . '
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 11]: ` That is a comfort , ' Mr Tigg rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 36]: ` Then , ' he added , shielding his lips with the palm of his hand , and applying them close to Mr Pinch 's ear , ' I have come for the letter . '
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 11]: ` For the letter , ' said Tom , aloud .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 5]: ` What letter ? '
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 33]: ` The letter , ' whispered Tigg in the same cautious manner as before , ` which my friend Pecksniff addressed to Chevy Slyme , Esquire , and left with you . '
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 14]: ` He did n't leave any letter with me , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 4]: cried the other .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 23]: ` It 's all the same thing , though not so delicately done by my friend Pecksniff as I could have wished .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 4]: The money . '
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 5]: ` The money ! '
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 5]: cried Tom quite scared .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 9]: ` Exactly so , ' said Mr Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 67]: With which he rapped Tom twice or thrice upon the breast and nodded several times , as though he would say that he saw they understood each other ; that it was unnecessary to mention the circumstance before a third person ; and that he would take it as a particular favour if Tom would slip the amount into his hand , as quietly as possible .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 54]: Mr Pinch , however , was so very much astounded by this -LRB- to him -RRB- inexplicable deportment , that he at once openly declared there must be some mistake , and that he had been entrusted with no commission whatever having any reference to Mr Tigg or to his friend , either .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 55]: Mr Tigg received this declaration with a grave request that Mr Pinch would have the goodness to make it again ; and on Tom 's repeating it in a still more emphatic and unmistakable manner , checked it off , sentence for sentence , by nodding his head solemnly at the end of each .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 40]: When it had come to a close for the second time , Mr Tigg sat himself down in a chair and addressed the young men as follows : ` Then I tell you what it is , gents both .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 60]: There is at this present moment in this very place , a perfect constellation of talent and genius , who is involved , through what I can not but designate as the culpable negligence of my friend Pecksniff , in a situation as tremendous , perhaps , as the social intercourse of the nineteenth century will readily admit of .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 70]: There is actually at this instant , at the Blue Dragon in this village -- an ale-house , observe ; a common , paltry , low-minded , clodhopping , pipe-smoking ale-house -- an individual , of whom it may be said , in the language of the Poet , that nobody but himself can in any way come up to him ; who is detained there for his bill .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 4]: For his bill .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 8]: I repeat it -- for his bill .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 76]: Now , ' said Mr Tigg , ` we have heard of Fox 's Book of Martyrs , I believe , and we have heard of the Court of Requests , and the Star Chamber ; but I fear the contradiction of no man alive or dead , when I assert that my friend Chevy Slyme being held in pawn for a bill , beats any amount of cockfighting with which I am acquainted . '
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 36]: Martin and Mr Pinch looked , first at each other , and afterwards at Mr Tigg , who with his arms folded on his breast surveyed them , half in despondency and half in bitterness .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 19]: ` Do n't mistake me , gents both , ' he said , stretching forth his right hand .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 105]: ` If it had been for anything but a bill , I could have borne it , and could still have looked upon mankind with some feeling of respect ; but when such a man as my friend Slyme is detained for a score -- a thing in itself essentially mean ; a low performance on a slate , or possibly chalked upon the back of a door -- I do feel that there is a screw of such magnitude loose somewhere , that the whole framework of society is shaken , and the very first principles of things can no longer be trusted .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 47]: In short , gents both , ' said Mr Tigg with a passionate flourish of his hands and head , ` when a man like Slyme is detained for such a thing as a bill , I reject the superstitions of ages , and believe nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 19]: I do n't even believe that I DO N'T believe , curse me if I do ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 36]: I am very sorry , I am sure , ' said Tom after a pause , ` but Mr Pecksniff said nothing to me about it , and I could n't act without his instructions .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 32]: Would n't it be better , sir , if you were to go to -- to wherever you came from -- yourself , and remit the money to your friend ? '
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 14]: ` How can that be done , when I am detained also ? '
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 34]: said Mr Tigg ; ` and when moreover , owing to the astounding , and I must add , guilty negligence of my friend Pecksniff , I have no money for coach-hire ? '
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 67]: Tom thought of reminding the gentleman -LRB- who , no doubt , in his agitation had forgotten it -RRB- that there was a post-office in the land ; and that possibly if he wrote to some friend or agent for a remittance it might not be lost upon the road ; or at all events that the chance , however desperate , was worth trusting to .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 39]: But , as his good-nature presently suggested to him certain reasons for abstaining from this hint , he paused again , and then asked : ` Did you say , sir , that you were detained also ? '
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 11]: ` Come here , ' said Mr Tigg , rising .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 15]: ` You have no objection to my opening this window for a moment ? '
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 8]: ` Certainly not , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 13]: ` Very good , ' said Mr Tigg , lifting the sash .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 16]: ` You see a fellow down there in a red neckcloth and no waistcoat ? '
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 10]: ` Of course I do , ' cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 7]: ` That 's Mark Tapley . '
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 7]: ` Mark Tapley is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 4]: said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 28]: ` Then Mark Tapley had not only the great politeness to follow me to this house , but is waiting now , to see me home again .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 46]: And for that attention , sir , ' added Mr Tigg , stroking his moustache , ' I can tell you , that Mark Tapley had better in his infancy have been fed to suffocation by Mrs Tapley , than preserved to this time . '
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 65]: Mr Pinch was not so dismayed by this terrible threat , but that he had voice enough to call to Mark to come in , and upstairs ; a summons which he so speedily obeyed , that almost as soon as Tom and Mr Tigg had drawn in their heads and closed the window again , he , the denounced , appeared before them .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 7]: ` Come here , Mark ! '
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 4]: said Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 5]: ` Good gracious me !
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 12]: what 's the matter between Mrs Lupin and this gentleman ? '
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 7]: ` What gentleman , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 4]: said Mark . '
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 49]: I do n't see no gentleman here sir , excepting you and the new gentleman , ' to whom he made a rough kind of bow -- ` and there 's nothing wrong between Mrs Lupin and either of you , Mr Pinch , I am sure . '
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 6]: ` Nonsense , Mark ! '
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 14]: ` You see Mr -- ' ` Tigg , ' interposed that gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 5]: ` Wait a bit .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 6]: I shall crush him soon .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 6]: All in good time ! '
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 5]: ` Oh HIM ! '
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 10]: rejoined Mark , with an air of careless defiance .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 7]: ` Yes , I see HIM .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 21]: I could see him a little better , if he 'd shave himself , and get his hair cut . '
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 18]: Mr Tigg shook his head with a ferocious look , and smote himself once upon the breast .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 10]: ` It 's no use , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 17]: ` If you knock ever so much in that quarter , you 'll get no answer .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 4]: I know better .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 15]: There 's nothing there but padding ; and a greasy sort it is . '
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 23]: ` Nay , Mark , ' urged Mr Pinch , interposing to prevent hostilities , ` tell me what I ask you .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 11]: You 're not out of temper , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 8]: ` Out of temper , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 13]: cried Mark , with a grin ; ` why no , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 43]: There 's a little credit -- not much -- in being jolly , when such fellows as him is a-going about like roaring lions ; if there is any breed of lions , at least , as is all roar and mane .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 11]: What is there between him and Mrs Lupin , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 12]: Why , there 's a score between him and Mrs Lupin .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 27]: And I think Mrs Lupin lets him and his friend off very easy in not charging 'em double prices for being a disgrace to the Dragon .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 5]: That 's my opinion .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 28]: I would n't have any such Peter the Wild Boy as him in my house , sir , not if I was paid race-week prices for it .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 19]: He 's enough to turn the very beer in the casks sour with his looks ; he is !
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 11]: So he would , if it had judgment enough . '
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 18]: ` You 're not answering my question , you know , Mark , ' observed Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 24]: ` Well , sir , ' said Mark , ' I do n't know as there 's much to answer further than that .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 32]: Him and his friend goes and stops at the Moon and Stars till they 've run a bill there ; and then comes and stops with us and does the same .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 27]: The running of bills is common enough Mr Pinch ; it a n't that as we object to ; it 's the ways of this chap .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 39]: Nothing 's good enough for him ; all the women is dying for him he thinks , and is overpaid if he winks at 'em ; and all the men was made to be ordered about by him .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 29]: This not being aggravation enough , he says this morning to me , in his usual captivating way , `` We 're going to-night , my man . ''
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 7]: `` Are you , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 15]: says I. `` Perhaps you 'd like the bill got ready , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 18]: `` Oh no , my man , '' he says ; `` you need n't mind that .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 11]: I 'll give Pecksniff orders to see to that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 83]: In reply to which , the Dragon makes answer , `` Thankee , sir , you 're very kind to honour us so far , but as we do n't know any particular good of you , and you do n't travel with luggage , and Mr Pecksniff a n't at home -LRB- which perhaps you may n't happen to be aware of , sir -RRB- , we should prefer something more satisfactory ; '' and that 's where the matter stands .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 46]: And I ask , ' said Mr Tapley , pointing , in conclusion , to Mr Tigg , with his hat , ` any lady or gentleman , possessing ordinary strength of mind , to say whether he 's a disagreeable-looking chap or not ! '
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 36]: ` Let me inquire , ' said Martin , interposing between this candid speech and the delivery of some blighting anathema by Mr Tigg , ` what the amount of this debt may be ? '
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 15]: ` In point of money , sir , very little , ' answered Mark .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 8]: ` Only just turned of three pounds .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 26]: But it a n't that ; it 's the -- ' ` Yes , yes , you told us so before , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 9]: ` Pinch , a word with you . '
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 6]: ` What is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 13]: asked Tom , retiring with him to a corner of the room .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 58]: ` Why , simply -- I am ashamed to say -- that this Mr Slyme is a relation of mine , of whom I never heard anything pleasant ; and that I do n't want him here just now , and think he would be cheaply got rid of , perhaps , for three or four pounds .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 14]: You have n't enough money to pay this bill , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 16]: Tom shook his head to an extent that left no doubt of his entire sincerity .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 27]: ` That 's unfortunate , for I am poor too ; and in case you had had it , I 'd have borrowed it of you .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 22]: But if we told this landlady we would see her paid , I suppose that would answer the same purpose ? '
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 7]: ` Oh dear , yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 9]: ` She knows me , bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 25]: ` Then let us go down at once and tell her so ; for the sooner we are rid of their company the better .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 25]: As you have conducted the conversation with this gentleman hitherto , perhaps you 'll tell him what we purpose doing ; will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 37]: Mr Pinch , complying , at once imparted the intelligence to Mr Tigg , who shook him warmly by the hand in return , assuring him that his faith in anything and everything was again restored .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 57]: It was not so much , he said , for the temporary relief of this assistance that he prized it , as for its vindication of the high principle that Nature 's Nobs felt with Nature 's Nobs , and that true greatness of soul sympathized with true greatness of soul , all the world over .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 56]: It proved to him , he said , that like him they admired genius , even when it was coupled with the alloy occasionally visible in the metal of his friend Slyme ; and on behalf of that friend , he thanked them ; as warmly and heartily as if the cause were his own .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 64]: Being cut short in these speeches by a general move towards the stairs , he took possession at the street door of the lapel of Mr Pinch 's coat , as a security against further interruption ; and entertained that gentleman with some highly improving discourse until they reached the Dragon , whither they were closely followed by Mark and the new pupil .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 78]: The rosy hostess scarcely needed Mr Pinch 's word as a preliminary to the release of her two visitors , of whom she was glad to be rid on any terms ; indeed , their brief detention had originated mainly with Mr Tapley , who entertained a constitutional dislike to gentleman out-at-elbows who flourished on false pretences ; and had conceived a particular aversion to Mr Tigg and his friend , as choice specimens of the species .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 75]: The business in hand thus easily settled , Mr Pinch and Martin would have withdrawn immediately , but for the urgent entreaties of Mr Tigg that they would allow him the honour of presenting them to his friend Slyme , which were so very difficult of resistance that , yielding partly to these persuasions and partly to their own curiosity , they suffered themselves to be ushered into the presence of that distinguished gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 40]: He was brooding over the remains of yesterday 's decanter of brandy , and was engaged in the thoughtful occupation of making a chain of rings on the top of the table with the wet foot of his drinking-glass .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 38]: Wretched and forlorn as he looked , Mr Slyme had once been in his way , the choicest of swaggerers ; putting forth his pretensions boldly , as a man of infinite taste and most undoubted promise .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 47]: The stock-in-trade requisite to set up an amateur in this department of business is very slight , and easily got together ; a trick of the nose and a curl of the lip sufficient to compound a tolerable sneer , being ample provision for any exigency .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 108]: But , in an evil hour , this off-shoot of the Chuzzlewit trunk , being lazy , and ill qualified for any regular pursuit and having dissipated such means as he ever possessed , had formally established himself as a professor of Taste for a livelihood ; and finding , too late , that something more than his old amount of qualifications was necessary to sustain him in this calling , had quickly fallen to his present level , where he retained nothing of his old self but his boastfulness and his bile , and seemed to have no existence separate or apart from his friend Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 41]: And now so abject and so pitiful was he -- at once so maudlin , insolent , beggarly , and proud -- that even his friend and parasite , standing erect beside him , swelled into a Man by contrast .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 37]: ` Chiv , ' said Mr Tigg , clapping him on the back , ` my friend Pecksniff not being at home , I have arranged our trifling piece of business with Mr Pinch and friend .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 9]: Mr Pinch and friend , Mr Chevy Slyme !
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 8]: Chiv , Mr Pinch and friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 27]: ` These are agreeable circumstances in which to be introduced to strangers , ' said Chevy Slyme , turning his bloodshot eyes towards Tom Pinch . '
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 14]: I am the most miserable man in the world , I believe ! '
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 26]: Tom begged he would n't mention it ; and finding him in this condition , retired , after an awkward pause , followed by Martin .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 28]: But Mr Tigg so urgently conjured them , by coughs and signs , to remain in the shadow of the door , that they stopped there . '
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 47]: I swear , ' cried Mr Slyme , giving the table an imbecile blow with his fist , and then feebly leaning his head upon his hand , while some drunken drops oozed from his eyes , ` that I am the wretchedest creature on record .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 8]: Society is in a conspiracy against me .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 8]: I 'm the most literary man alive .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 6]: I 'm full of scholarship .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 28]: I 'm full of genius ; I 'm full of information ; I 'm full of novel views on every subject ; yet look at my condition !
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 15]: I 'm at this moment obliged to two strangers for a tavern bill ! '
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 32]: Mr Tigg replenished his friend 's glass , pressed it into his hand , and nodded an intimation to the visitors that they would see him in a better aspect immediately .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 13]: ` Obliged to two strangers for a tavern bill , eh ! '
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 12]: repeated Mr Slyme , after a sulky application to his glass .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 4]: ` Very pretty !
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 45]: And crowds of impostors , the while , becoming famous ; men who are no more on a level with me than -- Tigg , I take you to witness that I am the most persecuted hound on the face of the earth . '
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 30]: With a whine , not unlike the cry of the animal he named , in its lowest state of humiliation , he raised his glass to his mouth again .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 17]: He found some encouragement in it ; for when he set it down he laughed scornfully .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 32]: Upon that Mr Tigg gesticulated to the visitors once more , and with great expression , implying that now the time was come when they would see Chiv in his greatness .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 12]: ` Ha , ha , ha , ' laughed Mr Slyme .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 10]: ` Obliged to two strangers for a tavern bill !
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 21]: Yet I think I 've a rich uncle , Tigg , who could buy up the uncles of fifty strangers !
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 8]: Have I , or have I not ?
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 10]: I come of a good family , I believe !
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 8]: Do I , or do I not ?
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 14]: I 'm not a man of common capacity or accomplishments , I think !
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 9]: Am I , or am I not ? '
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 31]: ` You are the American aloe of the human race , my dear Chiv , ' said Mr Tigg , ` which only blooms once in a hundred years ! '
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 8]: ` Ha , ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 5]: laughed Mr Slyme again .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 10]: ` Obliged to two strangers for a tavern bill !
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 8]: I obliged to two architect 's apprentices .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 14]: Fellows who measure earth with iron chains , and build houses like bricklayers .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 9]: Give me the names of those two apprentices .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 7]: How dare they oblige me ! '
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 38]: Mr Tigg was quite lost in admiration of this noble trait in his friend 's character ; as he made known to Mr Pinch in a neat little ballet of action , spontaneously invented for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 38]: ` I 'll let 'em know , and I 'll let all men know , ' cried Chevy Slyme , ` that I 'm none of the mean , grovelling , tame characters they meet with commonly .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 6]: I have an independent spirit .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 10]: I have a heart that swells in my bosom .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 12]: I have a soul that rises superior to base considerations . '
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 22]: ` Oh Chiv , Chiv , ' murmured Mr Tigg , ` you have a nobly independent nature , Chiv ! '
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 62]: ` You go and do your duty , sir , ' said Mr Slyme , angrily , ` and borrow money for travelling expenses ; and whoever you borrow it of , let 'em know that I possess a haughty spirit , and a proud spirit , and have infernally finely-touched chords in my nature , which wo n't brook patronage .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 4]: Do you hear ?
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 32]: Tell 'em I hate 'em , and that that 's the way I preserve my self-respect ; and tell 'em that no man ever respected himself more than I do ! '
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 46]: He might have added that he hated two sorts of men ; all those who did him favours , and all those who were better off than himself ; as in either case their position was an insult to a man of his stupendous merits .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 107]: But he did not ; for with the apt closing words above recited , Mr Slyme ; of too haughty a stomach to work , to beg , to borrow , or to steal ; yet mean enough to be worked or borrowed , begged or stolen for , by any catspaw that would serve his turn ; too insolent to lick the hand that fed him in his need , yet cur enough to bite and tear it in the dark ; with these apt closing words Mr Slyme fell forward with his head upon the table , and so declined into a sodden sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 38]: ` Was there ever , ' cried Mr Tigg , joining the young men at the door , and shutting it carefully behind him , ` such an independent spirit as is possessed by that extraordinary creature ?
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 11]: Was there ever such a Roman as our friend Chiv ?
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 23]: Was there ever a man of such a purely classical turn of thought , and of such a toga-like simplicity of nature ?
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 12]: Was there ever a man with such a flow of eloquence ?
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 39]: Might he not , gents both , I ask , have sat upon a tripod in the ancient times , and prophesied to a perfectly unlimited extent , if previously supplied with gin-and-water at the public cost ? '
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 31]: Mr Pinch was about to contest this latter position with his usual mildness , when , observing that his companion had already gone downstairs , he prepared to follow him .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 10]: ` You are not going , Mr Pinch ? '
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 3]: said Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 8]: ` Thank you , ' answered Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 6]: Do n't come down . '
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 19]: ` Do you know that I should like one little word in private with you Mr Pinch ? '
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 6]: said Tigg , following him .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 16]: ` One minute of your company in the skittle-ground would very much relieve my mind .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 7]: Might I beseech that favour ? '
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 17]: ` Oh , certainly , ' replied Tom , ` if you really wish it . '
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 40]: So he accompanied Mr Tigg to the retreat in question ; on arriving at which place that gentleman took from his hat what seemed to be the fossil remains of an antediluvian pocket-handkerchief , and wiped his eyes therewith .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 21]: ` You have not beheld me this day , ' said Mr Tigg , ` in a favourable light . '
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 15]: ` Do n't mention that , ' said Tom , ' I beg . '
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 11]: ` But you have NOT , ' cried Tigg . '
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 7]: I must persist in that opinion .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 55]: If you could have seen me , Mr Pinch , at the head of my regiment on the coast of Africa , charging in the form of a hollow square , with the women and children and the regimental plate-chest in the centre , you would not have known me for the same man .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 9]: You would have respected me , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 32]: Tom had certain ideas of his own upon the subject of glory ; and consequently he was not quite so much excited by this picture as Mr Tigg could have desired .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 6]: ` But no matter ! '
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 4]: said that gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 21]: ` The school-boy writing home to his parents and describing the milk-and-water , said `` This is indeed weakness . ''
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 19]: I repeat that assertion in reference to myself at the present moment ; and I ask your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 10]: Sir , you have seen my friend Slyme ? '
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 9]: ` No doubt , ' said Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 13]: ` Sir , you have been impressed by my friend Slyme ? '
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 19]: ` Not very pleasantly , I must say , ' answered Tom , after a little hesitation . '
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 35]: I am grieved but not surprised , ' cried Mr Tigg , detaining him with both hands , ` to hear that you have come to that conclusion ; for it is my own .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 19]: But , Mr Pinch , though I am a rough and thoughtless man , I can honour Mind .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 8]: I honour Mind in following my friend .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 35]: To you of all men , Mr Pinch , I have a right to make appeal on Mind 's behalf , when it has not the art to push its fortune in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 38]: And so , sir -- not for myself , who have no claim upon you , but for my crushed , my sensitive and independent friend , who has -- I ask the loan of three half-crowns .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 17]: I ask you for the loan of three half-crowns , distinctly , and without a blush .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 9]: I ask it , almost as a right .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 28]: And when I add that they will be returned by post , this week , I feel that you will blame me for that sordid stipulation . '
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 25]: Mr Pinch took from his pocket an old-fashioned red-leather purse with a steel clasp , which had probably once belonged to his deceased grandmother .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 8]: It held one half-sovereign and no more .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 9]: All Tom 's worldly wealth until next quarter-day .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 4]: ` Stay ! '
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 12]: cried Mr Tigg , who had watched this proceeding keenly . '
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 20]: I was just about to say , that for the convenience of posting you had better make it gold .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 3]: Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 21]: A general direction , I suppose , to Mr Pinch at Mr Pecksniff 's -- will that find you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 10]: ` That 'll find me , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 16]: ` You had better put Esquire to Mr Pecksniff 's name , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 15]: Direct to me , you know , at Seth Pecksniff 's , Esquire . '
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 25]: ` At Seth Pecksniff 's , Esquire , ' repeated Mr Tigg , taking an exact note of it with a stump of pencil .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 10]: ` We said this week , I believe ? '
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 12]: ` Yes ; or Monday will do , ' observed Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 10]: ` No , no , I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 10]: Monday will NOT do , ' said Mr Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 14]: ` If we stipulated for this week , Saturday is the latest day .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 8]: Did we stipulate for this week ? '
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 20]: ` Since you are so particular about it , ' said Tom , ' I think we did . '
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 39]: Mr Tigg added this condition to his memorandum ; read the entry over to himself with a severe frown ; and that the transaction might be the more correct and business-like , appended his initials to the whole .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 26]: That done , he assured Mr Pinch that everything was now perfectly regular ; and , after squeezing his hand with great fervour , departed .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 31]: Tom entertained enough suspicion that Martin might possibly turn this interview into a jest , to render him desirous to avoid the company of that young gentleman for the present .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 47]: With this view he took a few turns up and down the skittle-ground , and did not re-enter the house until Mr Tigg and his friend had quitted it , and the new pupil and Mark were watching their departure from one of the windows . '
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 36]: I was just a-saying , sir , that if one could live by it , ' observed Mark , pointing after their late guests , ` that would be the sort of service for me .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 15]: Waiting on such individuals as them would be better than grave-digging , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 16]: ` And staying here would be better than either , Mark , ' replied Tom .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 16]: ` So take my advice , and continue to swim easily in smooth water . '
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 17]: ` It 's too late to take it now , sir , ' said Mark . '
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 9]: I have broke it to her , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 7]: I am off to-morrow morning . '
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 4]: ` Off ! '
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 10]: cried Mr Pinch , ` where to ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 10]: I shall go up to London , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 6]: ` What to be ? '
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 4]: asked Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 8]: I do n't know yet , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 21]: Nothing turned up that day I opened my mind to you , as was at all likely to suit me .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 26]: All them trades I thought of was a deal too jolly ; there was no credit at all to be got in any of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 13]: I must look for a private service , I suppose , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 18]: I might be brought out strong , perhaps , in a serious family , Mr Pinch . '
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 19]: ` Perhaps you might come out rather too strong for a serious family 's taste , Mark . '
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 7]: ` That 's possible , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 61]: If I could get into a wicked family , I might do myself justice ; but the difficulty is to make sure of one 's ground , because a young man ca n't very well advertise that he wants a place , and wages a n't so much an object as a wicked sitivation ; can he , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 19]: ` Why , no , ' said Mr Pinch , ' I do n't think he can . '
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 46]: ` An envious family , ' pursued Mark , with a thoughtful face ; ` or a quarrelsome family , or a malicious family , or even a good out-and-out mean family , would open a field of action as I might do something in .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 29]: The man as would have suited me of all other men was that old gentleman as was took ill here , for he really was a trying customer .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 20]: Howsever , I must wait and see what turns up , sir ; and hope for the worst . '
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 9]: ` You are determined to go then ? '
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 4]: said Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 36]: ` My box is gone already , sir , by the waggon , and I 'm going to walk on to-morrow morning , and get a lift by the day coach when it overtakes me .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 23]: So I wish you good-bye , Mr Pinch -- and you too , sir -- and all good luck and happiness ! '
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 12]: They both returned his greeting laughingly , and walked home arm-in-arm .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 29]: Mr Pinch imparting to his new friend , as they went , such further particulars of Mark Tapley 's whimsical restlessness as the reader is already acquainted with .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 53]: In the meantime Mark , having a shrewd notion that his mistress was in very low spirits , and that he could not exactly answer for the consequences of any lengthened TETE -- A -- TETE in the bar , kept himself obstinately out of her way all the afternoon and evening .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 50]: In this piece of generalship he was very much assisted by the great influx of company into the taproom ; for the news of his intention having gone abroad , there was a perfect throng there all the evening , and much drinking of healths and clinking of mugs .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 37]: At length the house was closed for the night ; and there being now no help for it , Mark put the best face he could upon the matter , and walked doggedly to the bar-door .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 18]: ` If I look at her , ' said Mark to himself , ` I 'm done .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 9]: I feel that I 'm a-going fast . '
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 12]: ` You have come at last , ' said Mrs Lupin .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 9]: Aye , Mark said : There he was .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 12]: ` And you are determined to leave us , Mark ? '
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 4]: cried Mrs Lupin .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 21]: ` Why , yes ; I am , ' said Mark ; keeping his eyes hard upon the floor . '
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 27]: I thought , ' pursued the landlady , with a most engaging hesitation , ` that you had been -- fond -- of the Dragon ? '
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 9]: ` So I am , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 25]: ` Then , ' pursued the hostess -- and it really was not an unnatural inquiry -- ` why do you desert it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 44]: But as he gave no manner of answer to this question ; not even on its being repeated ; Mrs Lupin put his money into his hand , and asked him -- not unkindly , quite the contrary -- what he would take ?
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 16]: It is proverbial that there are certain things which flesh and blood can not bear .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 46]: Such a question as this , propounded in such a manner , at such a time , and by such a person , proved -LRB- at least , as far as , Mark 's flesh and blood were concerned -RRB- to be one of them .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 59]: He looked up in spite of himself directly ; and having once looked up , there was no looking down again ; for of all the tight , plump , buxom , bright-eyed , dimple-faced landladies that ever shone on earth , there stood before him then , bodily in that bar , the very pink and pineapple .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 62]: ` Why , I tell you what , ' said Mark , throwing off all his constraint in an instant and seizing the hostess round the waist -- at which she was not at all alarmed , for she knew what a good young man he was -- ` if I took what I liked most , I should take you .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 15]: If I only thought what was best for me , I should take you .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 27]: If I took what nineteen young fellows in twenty would be glad to take , and would take at any price , I should take you .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 35]: Yes , I should , ' cried Mr Tapley , shaking his head expressively enough , and looking -LRB- in a momentary state of forgetfulness -RRB- rather hard at the hostess 's ripe lips .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 12]: ` And no man would n't wonder if I did ! '
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 7]: Mrs Lupin said he amazed her .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 10]: She was astonished how he could say such things .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 8]: She had never thought it of him .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 13]: ` Why , I never thought if of myself till now ! '
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 16]: said Mark , raising his eyebrows with a look of the merriest possible surprise . '
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 39]: I always expected we should part , and never have no explanation ; I meant to do it when I come in here just now ; but there 's something about you , as makes a man sensible .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 48]: Then let us have a word or two together ; letting it be understood beforehand , ' he added this in a grave tone , to prevent the possibility of any mistake , ` that I 'm not a-going to make no love , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 25]: There was for just one second a shade , though not by any means a dark one , on the landlady 's open brow .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 16]: But it passed off instantly , in a laugh that came from her very heart .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 7]: ` Oh , very good ! '
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 21]: she said ; ` if there is to be no love-making , you had better take your arm away . '
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 8]: ` Lord , why should I ! '
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 3]: cried Mark .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 7]: ` It 's quite innocent . '
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 21]: ` Of course it 's innocent , ' returned the hostess , ` or I should n't allow it . '
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 5]: ` Very well ! '
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 3]: said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 7]: ` Then let it be . '
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 34]: There was so much reason in this that the landlady laughed again , suffered it to remain , and bade him say what he had to say , and be quick about it .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 10]: But he was an impudent fellow , she added .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 4]: ` Ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 7]: I almost think I am ! '
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 11]: cried Mark , ` though I never thought so before .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 9]: Why , I can say anything to-night ! '
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 31]: ` Say what you 're going to say if you please , and be quick , ' returned the landlady , ` for I want to get to bed . '
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 36]: ` Why , then , my dear good soul , ' said Mark , ` and a kinder woman than you are never drawed breath -- let me see the man as says she did !
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 18]: -- what would be the likely consequence of us two being -- ' ` Oh nonsense ! '
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 4]: cried Mrs Lupin .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 10]: ` Do n't talk about that any more . '
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 23]: ` No , no , but it a n't nonsense , ' said Mark ; ` and I wish you 'd attend .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 12]: What would be the likely consequence of us two being married ?
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 27]: If I ca n't be content and comfortable in this here lively Dragon now , is it to be looked for as I should be then ?
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 4]: By no means .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 3]: Very good .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 57]: Then you , even with your good humour , would be always on the fret and worrit , always uncomfortable in your own mind , always a-thinking as you was getting too old for my taste , always a-picturing me to yourself as being chained up to the Dragon door , and wanting to break away .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 26]: I do n't know that it would be so , ' said Mark , ` but I do n't know that it might n't be .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 11]: I am a roving sort of chap , I know .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 6]: I 'm fond of change .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 32]: I 'm always a-thinking that with my good health and spirits it would be more creditable in me to be jolly where there 's things a-going on to make one dismal .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 23]: It may be a mistake of mine you see , but nothing short of trying how it acts will set it right .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 71]: Then a n't it best that I should go ; particular when your free way has helped me out to say all this , and we can part as good friends as we have ever been since first I entered this here noble Dragon , which , ' said Mr Tapley in conclusion , ` has my good word and my good wish to the day of my death ! '
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 26]: The hostess sat quite silent for a little time , but she very soon put both her hands in Mark 's and shook them heartily .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 27]: ` For you are a good man , ' she said ; looking into his face with a smile , which was rather serious for her .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 24]: ` And I do believe have been a better friend to me to-night than ever I have had in all my life . '
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 16]: as to that , you know , ' said Mark , ` that 's nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 7]: But love my heart alive ! '
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 35]: he added , looking at her in a sort of rapture , ` if you ARE that way disposed , what a lot of suitable husbands there is as you may drive distracted ! '
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 45]: She laughed again at this compliment ; and , once more shaking him by both hands , and bidding him , if he should ever want a friend , to remember her , turned gayly from the little bar and up the Dragon staircase .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 33]: ` Humming a tune as she goes , ' said Mark , listening , ` in case I should think she 's at all put out , and should be made down-hearted .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 14]: Come , here 's some credit in being jolly , at last ! '
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 23]: With that piece of comfort , very ruefully uttered , he went , in anything but a jolly manner , to bed .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 13]: He rose early next morning , and was a-foot soon after sunrise .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 65]: But it was of no use ; the whole place was up to see Mark Tapley off ; the boys , the dogs , the children , the old men , the busy people and the idlers ; there they were , all calling out ` Good-b ` ye , Mark , ' after their own manner , and all sorry he was going .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 29]: Somehow he had a kind of sense that his old mistress was peeping from her chamber-window , but he could n't make up his mind to look back .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 12]: ` Good-b ` ye one , good-b ` ye all ! '
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 25]: cried Mark , waving his hat on the top of his walking-stick , as he strode at a quick pace up the little street .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 8]: ` Hearty chaps them wheelwrights -- hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 17]: Here 's the butcher 's dog a-coming out of the garden -- down , old fellow !
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 14]: And Mr Pinch a-going to his organ -- good-b ` ye , sir !
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 14]: And the terrier-bitch from over the way -- hie , then , lass !
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 21]: And children enough to hand down human natur to the latest posterity -- good-b ` ye , boys and girls !
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 8]: There 's some credit in it now .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 8]: I 'm a-coming out strong at last .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 17]: These are the circumstances that would try a ordinary mind ; but I 'm uncommon jolly .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 15]: Not quite as jolly as I could wish to be , but very near .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 4]: Good-b ` ye !
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 5]: good-b ` ye ! '
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 69]: CHAPTER EIGHT ACCOMPANIES MR PECKSNIFF AND HIS CHARMING DAUGHTERS TO THE CITY OF LONDON ; AND RELATES WHAT FELL OUT UPON THEIR WAY THITHER When Mr Pecksniff and the two young ladies got into the heavy coach at the end of the lane , they found it empty , which was a great comfort ; particularly as the outside was quite full and the passengers looked very frosty .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 56]: For as Mr Pecksniff justly observed -- when he and his daughters had burrowed their feet deep in the straw , wrapped themselves to the chin , and pulled up both windows -- it is always satisfactory to feel , in keen weather , that many other people are not as warm as you are .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 29]: And this , he said , was quite natural , and a very beautiful arrangement ; not confined to coaches , but extending itself into many social ramifications .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 37]: ` For ' -LRB- he observed -RRB- , ` if every one were warm and well-fed , we should lose the satisfaction of admiring the fortitude with which certain conditions of men bear cold and hunger .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 60]: And if we were no better off than anybody else , what would become of our sense of gratitude ; which , ' said Mr Pecksniff with tears in his eyes , as he shook his fist at a beggar who wanted to get up behind , ` is one of the holiest feelings of our common nature . '
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 27]: His children heard with becoming reverence these moral precepts from the lips of their father , and signified their acquiescence in the same , by smiles .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 41]: That he might the better feed and cherish that sacred flame of gratitude in his breast , Mr Pecksniff remarked that he would trouble his eldest daughter , even in this early stage of their journey , for the brandy-bottle .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 15]: And from the narrow neck of that stone vessel he imbibed a copious refreshment .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 6]: ` What are we ? '
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 8]: said Mr Pecksniff , ` but coaches ?
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 14]: Some of us are slow coaches ' -- ` Goodness , Pa ! '
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 3]: cried Charity .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 28]: ` Some of us , I say , ' resumed her parent with increased emphasis , ` are slow coaches ; some of us are fast coaches .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 13]: Our passions are the horses ; and rampant animals too -- ! '
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 13]: ` Really , Pa , ' cried both the daughters at once .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 6]: ` How very unpleasant . '
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 41]: ` And rampant animals too ' repeated Mr Pecksniff with so much determination , that he may be said to have exhibited , at the moment a sort of moral rampancy himself ; ' -- and Virtue is the drag .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 17]: We start from The Mother 's Arms , and we run to The Dust Shovel . '
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 17]: When he had said this , Mr Pecksniff , being exhausted , took some further refreshment .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 34]: When he had done that , he corked the bottle tight , with the air of a man who had effectually corked the subject also ; and went to sleep for three stages .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 31]: The tendency of mankind when it falls asleep in coaches , is to wake up cross ; to find its legs in its way ; and its corns an aggravation .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 80]: Mr Pecksniff not being exempt from the common lot of humanity found himself , at the end of his nap , so decidedly the victim of these infirmities , that he had an irresistible inclination to visit them upon his daughters ; which he had already begun to do in the shape of divers random kicks , and other unexpected motions of his shoes , when the coach stopped , and after a short delay the door was opened .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 15]: ` Now mind , ' said a thin sharp voice in the dark . '
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 23]: I and my son go inside , because the roof is full , but you agree only to charge us outside prices .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 11]: It 's quite understood that we wo n't pay more .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 4]: Is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 11]: ` All right , sir , ' replied the guard .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 8]: ` Is there anybody inside now ? '
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 4]: inquired the voice .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 9]: ` Three passengers , ' returned the guard .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 24]: ` Then I ask the three passengers to witness this bargain , if they will be so good , ' said the voice .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 13]: ` My boy , I think we may safely get in . '
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 37]: In pursuance of which opinion , two people took their seats in the vehicle , which was solemnly licensed by Act of Parliament to carry any six persons who could be got in at the door .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 6]: ` That was lucky ! '
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 11]: whispered the old man , when they moved on again .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 13]: ` And a great stroke of policy in you to observe it .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 6]: He , he , he !
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 7]: We could n't have gone outside .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 9]: I should have died of the rheumatism ! '
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 38]: Whether it occurred to the dutiful son that he had in some degree over-reached himself by contributing to the prolongation of his father 's days ; or whether the cold had effected his temper ; is doubtful .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 56]: But he gave his father such a nudge in reply , that that good old gentleman was taken with a cough which lasted for full five minutes without intermission , and goaded Mr Pecksniff to that pitch of irritation , that he said at last -- and very suddenly : ` There is no room !
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 19]: There is really no room in this coach for any gentleman with a cold in his head ! '
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 24]: ` Mine , ' said the old man , after a moment 's pause , ` is upon my chest , Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 45]: The voice and manner , together , now that he spoke out ; the composure of the speaker ; the presence of his son ; and his knowledge of Mr Pecksniff ; afforded a clue to his identity which it was impossible to mistake .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 3]: ` Hem !
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 21]: I thought , ' said Mr Pecksniff , returning to his usual mildness , ` that I addressed a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 38]: I find that I address a relative , Mr Anthony Chuzzlewit and his son Mr Jonas -- for they , my dear children , are our travelling companions -- will excuse me for an apparently harsh remark .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 21]: It is not MY desire to wound the feelings of any person with whom I am connected in family bonds .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 22]: I may be a Hypocrite , ' said Mr Pecksniff , cuttingly ; ` but I am not a Brute . '
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 6]: ` Pooh , pooh ! '
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 5]: said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 8]: ` What signifies that word , Pecksniff ?
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 2]: Hypocrite !
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 7]: why , we are all hypocrites .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 9]: We were all hypocrites t ` other day .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 22]: I am sure I felt that to be agreed upon among us , or I should n't have called you one .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 16]: We should not have been there at all , if we had not been hypocrites .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 26]: The only difference between you and the rest was -- shall I tell you the difference between you and the rest now , Pecksniff ? '
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 14]: ` If you please , my good sir ; if you please . '
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 60]: ` Why , the annoying quality in YOU , is , ' said the old man , ` that you never have a confederate or partner in YOUR juggling ; you would deceive everybody , even those who practise the same art ; and have a way with you , as if you -- he , he , he !
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 8]: -- as if you really believed yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 45]: I 'd lay a handsome wager now , ' said the old man , ` if I laid wagers , which I do n't and never did , that you keep up appearances by a tacit understanding , even before your own daughters here .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 24]: Now I , when I have a business scheme in hand , tell Jonas what it is , and we discuss it openly .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 8]: You 're not offended , Pecksniff ? '
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 8]: ` Offended , my good sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 17]: cried that gentleman , as if he had received the highest compliments that language could convey .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 11]: ` Are you travelling to London , Mr Pecksniff ? '
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 4]: asked the son .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 12]: ` Yes , Mr Jonas , we are travelling to London .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 16]: We shall have the pleasure of your company all the way , I trust ? '
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 14]: ecod , you had better ask father that , ' said Jonas . '
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 9]: I am not a-going to commit myself . '
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 16]: Mr Pecksniff was , as a matter of course , greatly entertained by this retort .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 109]: His mirth having subsided , Mr Jonas gave him to understand that himself and parent were in fact travelling to their home in the metropolis ; and that , since the memorable day of the great family gathering , they had been tarrying in that part of the country , watching the sale of certain eligible investments , which they had had in their copartnership eye when they came down ; for it was their custom , Mr Jonas said , whenever such a thing was practicable , to kill two birds with one stone , and never to throw away sprats , but as bait for whales .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 75]: When he had communicated to Mr Pecksniff these pithy scraps of intelligence , he said , ` That if it was all the same to him , he would turn him over to father , and have a chat with the gals ; ' and in furtherance of this polite scheme , he vacated his seat adjoining that gentleman , and established himself in the opposite corner , next to the fair Miss Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 20]: The education of Mr Jonas had been conducted from his cradle on the strictest principles of the main chance .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 29]: The very first word he learnt to spell was ` gain , ' and the second -LRB- when he got into two syllables -RRB- , ` money . '
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 29]: But for two results , which were not clearly foreseen perhaps by his watchful parent in the beginning , his training may be said to have been unexceptionable .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 31]: One of these flaws was , that having been long taught by his father to over-reach everybody , he had imperceptibly acquired a love of over-reaching that venerable monitor himself .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 74]: The other , that from his early habits of considering everything as a question of property , he had gradually come to look , with impatience , on his parent as a certain amount of personal estate , which had no right whatever to be going at large , but ought to be secured in that particular description of iron safe which is commonly called a coffin , and banked in the grave .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 6]: ` Well , cousin ! '
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 26]: said Mr Jonas -- ` Because we ARE cousins , you know , a few times removed -- so you 're going to London ? '
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 21]: Miss Mercy replied in the affirmative , pinching her sister 's arm at the same time , and giggling excessively .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 10]: ` Lots of beaux in London , cousin ! '
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 9]: said Mr Jonas , slightly advancing his elbow .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 6]: ` Indeed , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 5]: cried the young lady .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 14]: ` They wo n't hurt us , sir , I dare say . '
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 32]: And having given him this answer with great demureness she was so overcome by her own humour , that she was fain to stifle her merriment in her sister 's shawl .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 18]: ` Merry , ' cried that more prudent damsel , ` really I am ashamed of you .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 7]: How can you go on so ?
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 5]: You wild thing ! '
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 13]: At which Miss Merry only laughed the more , of course . '
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 21]: I saw a wildness in her eye , t ` other day , ' said Mr Jonas , addressing Charity .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 10]: ` But you 're the one to sit solemn !
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 11]: I say -- You were regularly prim , cousin ! '
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 5]: The old-fashioned fright ! '
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 7]: cried Merry , in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 14]: ` Cherry my dear , upon my word you must sit next him .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 18]: I shall die outright if he talks to me any more ; I shall , positively ! '
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 31]: To prevent which fatal consequence , the buoyant creature skipped out of her seat as she spoke , and squeezed her sister into the place from which she had risen .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 13]: ` Do n't mind crowding me , ' cried Mr Jonas . '
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 8]: I like to be crowded by gals .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 8]: Come a little closer , cousin . '
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 12]: ` No , thank you , sir , ' said Charity .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 27]: ` There 's that other one a-laughing again , ' said Mr Jonas ; ` she 's a-laughing at my father , I should n't wonder .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 20]: If he puts on that old flannel nightcap of his , I do n't know what she 'll do !
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 9]: Is that my father a-snoring , Pecksniff ? '
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 7]: ` Yes , Mr Jonas . '
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 13]: ` Tread upon his foot , will you be so good ? '
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 5]: said the young gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 11]: ` The foot next you 's the gouty one . '
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 44]: Mr Pecksniff hesitating to perform this friendly office , Mr Jonas did it himself ; at the same time crying : ` Come , wake up , father , or you 'll be having the nightmare , and screeching out , I know .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 11]: -- Do you ever have the nightmare , cousin ? '
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 16]: he asked his neighbour , with characteristic gallantry , as he dropped his voice again .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 7]: ` Sometimes , ' answered Charity .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 5]: ` Not often . '
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 14]: ` The other one , ' said Mr Jonas , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 10]: ` Does SHE ever have the nightmare ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 9]: I do n't know , ' replied Charity .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 8]: ` You had better ask her . '
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 17]: ` She laughs so , ' said Jonas ; ` there 's no talking to her .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 9]: Only hark how she 's a-going on now !
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 9]: You 're the sensible one , cousin ! '
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 6]: ` Tut , tut ! '
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 3]: cried Charity .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 4]: But you are !
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 6]: You know you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 12]: ` Mercy is a little giddy , ' said Miss Charity .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 9]: But she 'll sober down in time . '
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 22]: ` It 'll be a very long time , then , if she does at all , ' rejoined her cousin .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 9]: ` Take a little more room . ' '
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 11]: I am afraid of crowding you , ' said Charity .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 46]: But she took it notwithstanding ; and after one or two remarks on the extreme heaviness of the coach , and the number of places it stopped at , they fell into a silence which remained unbroken by any member of the party until supper-time .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 68]: Although Mr Jonas conducted Charity to the hotel and sat himself beside her at the board , it was pretty clear that he had an eye to ` the other one ' also , for he often glanced across at Mercy , and seemed to draw comparisons between the personal appearance of the two , which were not unfavourable to the superior plumpness of the younger sister .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 51]: He allowed himself no great leisure for this kind of observation , however , being busily engaged with the supper , which , as he whispered in his fair companion 's ear , was a contract business , and therefore the more she ate , the better the bargain was .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 48]: His father and Mr Pecksniff , probably acting on the same wise principle , demolished everything that came within their reach , and by that means acquired a greasy expression of countenance , indicating contentment , if not repletion , which it was very pleasant to contemplate .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 58]: When they could eat no more , Mr Pecksniff and Mr Jonas subscribed for two sixpenny-worths of hot brandy-and-water , which the latter gentleman considered a more politic order than one shillingsworth ; there being a chance of their getting more spirit out of the innkeeper under this arrangement than if it were all in one glass .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 55]: Having swallowed his share of the enlivening fluid , Mr Pecksniff , under pretence of going to see if the coach were ready , went secretly to the bar , and had his own little bottle filled , in order that he might refresh himself at leisure in the dark coach without being observed .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 21]: These arrangements concluded , and the coach being ready , they got into their old places and jogged on again .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 48]: But before he composed himself for a nap , Mr Pecksniff delivered a kind of grace after meat , in these words : ` The process of digestion , as I have been informed by anatomical friends , is one of the most wonderful works of nature .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 46]: I do not know how it may be with others , but it is a great satisfaction to me to know , when regaling on my humble fare , that I am putting in motion the most beautiful machinery with which we have any acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 15]: I really feel at such times as if I was doing a public service .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 53]: When I have wound myself up , if I may employ such a term , ' said Mr Pecksniff with exquisite tenderness , ` and know that I am Going , I feel that in the lesson afforded by the works within me , I am a Benefactor to my Kind ! '
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 33]: As nothing could be added to this , nothing was said ; and Mr Pecksniff , exulting , it may be presumed , in his moral utility , went to sleep again .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 12]: The rest of the night wore away in the usual manner .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 43]: Mr Pecksniff and Old Anthony kept tumbling against each other and waking up much terrified , or crushed their heads in opposite corners of the coach and strangely tattooed the surface of their faces -- Heaven knows how -- in their sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 18]: The coach stopped and went on , and went on and stopped , times out of number .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 55]: Passengers got up and passengers got down , and fresh horses came and went and came again , with scarcely any interval between each team as it seemed to those who were dozing , and with a gap of a whole night between every one as it seemed to those who were broad awake .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 31]: At length they began to jolt and rumble over horribly uneven stones , and Mr Pecksniff looking out of window said it was to-morrow morning , and they were there .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 57]: Very soon afterwards the coach stopped at the office in the city ; and the street in which it was situated was already in a bustle , that fully bore out Mr Pecksniff 's words about its being morning , though for any signs of day yet appearing in the sky it might have been midnight .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 68]: There was a dense fog too ; as if it were a city in the clouds , which they had been travelling to all night up a magic beanstalk ; and there was a thick crust upon the pavement like oilcake ; which , one of the outsides -LRB- mad , no doubt -RRB- said to another -LRB- his keeper , of course -RRB- , was Snow .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 147]: Taking a confused leave of Anthony and his son , and leaving the luggage of himself and daughters at the office to be called for afterwards , Mr Pecksniff , with one of the young ladies under each arm , dived across the street , and then across other streets , and so up the queerest courts , and down the strangest alleys and under the blindest archways , in a kind of frenzy ; now skipping over a kennel , now running for his life from a coach and horses ; now thinking he had lost his way , now thinking he had found it ; now in a state of the highest confidence , now despondent to the last degree , but always in a great perspiration and flurry ; until at length they stopped in a kind of paved yard near the Monument .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 45]: That is to say , Mr Pecksniff told them so ; for as to anything they could see of the Monument , or anything else but the buildings close at hand , they might as well have been playing blindman 's buff at Salisbury .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 60]: Mr Pecksniff looked about him for a moment , and then knocked at the door of a very dingy edifice , even among the choice collection of dingy edifices at hand ; on the front of which was a little oval board like a tea-tray , with this inscription -- ` Commercial Boarding -- House : M. Todgers . '
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 32]: It seemed that M. Todgers was not up yet , for Mr Pecksniff knocked twice and rang thrice , without making any impression on anything but a dog over the way .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 76]: At last a chain and some bolts were withdrawn with a rusty noise , as if the weather had made the very fastenings hoarse , and a small boy with a large red head , and no nose to speak of , and a very dirty Wellington boot on his left arm , appeared ; who -LRB- being surprised -RRB- rubbed the nose just mentioned with the back of a shoe-brush , and said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 7]: ` Still a-bed my man ? '
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 4]: asked Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 5]: ` Still a-bed ! '
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 5]: replied the boy . '
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 7]: I wish they wos still a-bed .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 14]: They 're very noisy a-bed ; all calling for their boots at once .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 21]: I thought you was the Paper , and wondered why you did n't shove yourself through the grating as usual .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 6]: What do you want ? '
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 28]: Considering his years , which were tender , the youth may be said to have preferred this question sternly , and in something of a defiant manner .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 39]: But Mr Pecksniff , without taking umbrage at his bearing put a card in his hand , and bade him take that upstairs , and show them in the meanwhile into a room where there was a fire .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 24]: ` Or if there 's one in the eating parlour , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ' I can find it myself . '
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 86]: So he led his daughters , without waiting for any further introduction , into a room on the ground-floor , where a table-cloth -LRB- rather a tight and scanty fit in reference to the table it covered -RRB- was already spread for breakfast ; displaying a mighty dish of pink boiled beef ; an instance of that particular style of loaf which is known to housekeepers as a slack-baked , crummy quartern ; a liberal provision of cups and saucers ; and the usual appendages .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 93]: Inside the fender were some half-dozen pairs of shoes and boots , of various sizes , just cleaned and turned with the soles upwards to dry ; and a pair of short black gaiters , on one of which was chalked -- in sport , it would appear , by some gentleman who had slipped down for the purpose , pending his toilet , and gone up again -- ` Jinkins 's Particular , ' while the other exhibited a sketch in profile , claiming to be the portrait of Jinkins himself .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 31]: M. Todgers 's Commercial Boarding -- House was a house of that sort which is likely to be dark at any time ; but that morning it was especially dark .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 60]: There was an odd smell in the passage , as if the concentrated essence of all the dinners that had been cooked in the kitchen since the house was built , lingered at the top of the kitchen stairs to that hour , and like the Black Friar in Don Juan , ` would n't be driven away . '
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 31]: In particular , there was a sensation of cabbage ; as if all the greens that had ever been boiled there , were evergreens , and flourished in immortal strength .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 19]: The parlour was wainscoted , and communicated to strangers a magnetic and instinctive consciousness of rats and mice .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 24]: The staircase was very gloomy and very broad , with balustrades so thick and heavy that they would have served for a bridge .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 66]: In a sombre corner on the first landing , stood a gruff old giant of a clock , with a preposterous coronet of three brass balls on his head ; whom few had ever seen -- none ever looked in the face -- and who seemed to continue his heavy tick for no other reason than to warn heedless people from running into him accidentally .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 19]: It had not been papered or painted , had n't Todgers 's , within the memory of man .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 10]: It was very black , begrimed , and mouldy .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 65]: And , at the top of the staircase , was an old , disjointed , rickety , ill-favoured skylight , patched and mended in all kinds of ways , which looked distrustfully down at everything that passed below , and covered Todgers 's up as if it were a sort of human cucumber-frame , and only people of a peculiar growth were reared there .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 39]: Mr Pecksniff and his fair daughters had not stood warming themselves at the fire ten minutes , when the sound of feet was heard upon the stairs , and the presiding deity of the establishment came hurrying in .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 58]: M. Todgers was a lady , rather a bony and hard-featured lady , with a row of curls in front of her head , shaped like little barrels of beer ; and on the top of it something made of net -- you could n't call it a cap exactly -- which looked like a black cobweb .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 22]: She had a little basket on her arm , and in it a bunch of keys that jingled as she came .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 44]: In her other hand she bore a flaming tallow candle , which , after surveying Mr Pecksniff for one instant by its light , she put down upon the table , to the end that she might receive him with the greater cordiality .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 5]: ` Mr Pecksniff ! '
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 4]: cried Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 5]: ` Welcome to London !
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 18]: Who would have thought of such a visit as this , after so -- dear , dear !
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 5]: -- so many years !
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 9]: How do you DO , Mr Pecksniff ? '
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 22]: ` As well as ever ; and as glad to see you , as ever ; ' Mr Pecksniff made response .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 13]: ` Why , you are younger than you used to be ! '
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 9]: ` YOU are , I am sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 4]: said Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 9]: ` You 're not a bit changed . '
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 9]: ` What do you say to this ? '
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 13]: cried Mr Pecksniff , stretching out his hand towards the young ladies .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 9]: ` Does this make me no older ? '
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 6]: ` Not your daughters ! '
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 11]: exclaimed the lady , raising her hands and clasping them .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 8]: ` Oh , no , Mr Pecksniff !
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 8]: Your second , and her bridesmaid ! '
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 19]: Mr Pecksniff smiled complacently ; shook his head ; and said , ` My daughters , Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 5]: Merely my daughters . '
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 26]: sighed the good lady , ' I must believe you , for now I look at 'em I think I should have known 'em anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 14]: My dear Miss Pecksniffs , how happy your Pa has made me ! '
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 40]: She hugged them both ; and being by this time overpowered by her feelings or the inclemency of the morning , jerked a little pocket handkerchief out of the little basket , and applied the same to her face .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 29]: ` Now , my good madam , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ' I know the rules of your establishment , and that you only receive gentlemen boarders .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 30]: But it occurred to me , when I left home , that perhaps you would give my daughters house room , and make an exception in their favour . '
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 4]: ` Perhaps ? '
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 5]: cried Mrs Todgers ecstatically .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 5]: ` Perhaps ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 18]: I may say then , that I was sure you would , ' said Mr Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 28]: I know that you have a little room of your own , and that they can be comfortable there , without appearing at the general table . '
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 5]: ` Dear girls ! '
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 5]: said Mrs Todgers . '
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 9]: I must take that liberty once more . '
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 21]: Mrs Todgers meant by this that she must embrace them once more , which she accordingly did with great ardour .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 85]: But the truth was that the house being full with the exception of one bed , which would now be occupied by Mr Pecksniff , she wanted time for consideration ; and so much time too -LRB- for it was a knotty point how to dispose of them -RRB- , that even when this second embrace was over , she stood for some moments gazing at the sisters , with affection beaming in one eye , and calculation shining out of the other . '
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 18]: I think I know how to arrange it , ' said Mrs Todgers , at length . '
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 15]: A sofa bedstead in the little third room which opens from my own parlour .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 8]: -- Oh , you dear girls ! '
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 75]: Thereupon she embraced them once more , observing that she could not decide which was most like their poor mother -LRB- which was highly probable , seeing that she had never beheld that lady -RRB- , but that she rather thought the youngest was ; and then she said that as the gentlemen would be down directly , and the ladies were fatigued with travelling , would they step into her room at once ?
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 46]: It was on the same floor ; being , in fact , the back parlour ; and had , as Mrs Todgers said , the great advantage -LRB- in London -RRB- of not being overlooked ; as they would see when the fog cleared off .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 28]: Nor was this a vainglorious boast , for it commanded at a perspective of two feet , a brown wall with a black cistern on the top .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 32]: The sleeping apartment designed for the young ladies was approached from this chamber by a mightily convenient little door , which would only open when fallen against by a strong person .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 21]: It commanded from a similar point of sight another angle of the wall , and another side of the cistern .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 11]: ` Not the damp side , ' said Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 8]: ` THAT is Mr Jinkins 's . '
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 63]: In the first of these sanctuaries a fire was speedily kindled by the youthful porter , who , whistling at his work in the absence of Mrs Todgers -LRB- not to mention his sketching figures on his corduroys with burnt firewood -RRB- , and being afterwards taken by that lady in the fact , was dismissed with a box on his ears .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 37]: Having prepared breakfast for the young ladies with her own hands , she withdrew to preside in the other room ; where the joke at Mr Jinkins 's expense seemed to be proceeding rather noisily . '
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 27]: I wo n't ask you yet , my dears , ' said Mr Pecksniff , looking in at the door , ` how you like London .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 4]: Shall I ? '
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 12]: ` We have n't seen much of it , Pa ! '
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 3]: cried Merry .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 10]: ` Nothing , I hope , ' said Cherry .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 6]: -LRB- Both very miserably . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 13]: ` Indeed , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` that 's true .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 13]: We have our pleasure , and our business too , before us .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 5]: All in good time .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 6]: All in good time ! '
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 40]: Whether Mr Pecksniff 's business in London was as strictly professional as he had given his new pupil to understand , we shall see , to adopt that worthy man 's phraseology , ` all in good time . '
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 35]: CHAPTER NINE TOWN AND TODGER 'S Surely there never was , in any other borough , city , or hamlet in the world , such a singular sort of a place as Todgers 's .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 79]: And surely London , to judge from that part of it which hemmed Todgers 's round and hustled it , and crushed it , and stuck its brick-and-mortar elbows into it , and kept the air from it , and stood perpetually between it and the light , was worthy of Todgers 's , and qualified to be on terms of close relationship and alliance with hundreds and thousands of the odd family to which Todgers 's belonged .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 17]: You could n't walk about Todgers 's neighbourhood , as you could in any other neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 33]: You groped your way for an hour through lanes and byways , and court-yards , and passages ; and you never once emerged upon anything that might be reasonably called a street .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 76]: A kind of resigned distraction came over the stranger as he trod those devious mazes , and , giving himself up for lost , went in and out and round about and quietly turned back again when he came to a dead wall or was stopped by an iron railing , and felt that the means of escape might possibly present themselves in their own good time , but that to anticipate them was hopeless .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 59]: Instances were known of people who , being asked to dine at Todgers 's , had travelled round and round for a weary time , with its very chimney-pots in view ; and finding it , at last , impossible of attainment , had gone home again with a gentle melancholy on their spirits , tranquil and uncomplaining .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 22]: Nobody had ever found Todgers 's on a verbal direction , though given within a few minutes ' walk of it .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 71]: Cautious emigrants from Scotland or the North of England had been known to reach it safely , by impressing a charity-boy , town-bred , and bringing him along with them ; or by clinging tenaciously to the postman ; but these were rare exceptions , and only went to prove the rule that Todgers 's was in a labyrinth , whereof the mystery was known but to a chosen few .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 47]: Several fruit-brokers had their marts near Todgers 's ; and one of the first impressions wrought upon the stranger 's senses was of oranges -- of damaged oranges -- with blue and green bruises on them , festering in boxes , or mouldering away in cellars .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 58]: All day long , a stream of porters from the wharves beside the river , each bearing on his back a bursting chest of oranges , poured slowly through the narrow passages ; while underneath the archway by the public-house , the knots of those who rested and regaled within , were piled from morning until night .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 24]: Strange solitary pumps were found near Todgers 's hiding themselves for the most part in blind alleys , and keeping company with fire-ladders .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 33]: There were churches also by dozens , with many a ghostly little churchyard , all overgrown with such straggling vegetation as springs up spontaneously from damp , and graves , and rubbish .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 80]: In some of these dingy resting-places which bore much the same analogy to green churchyards , as the pots of earth for mignonette and wall-flower in the windows overlooking them did to rustic gardens , there were trees ; tall trees ; still putting forth their leaves in each succeeding year , with such a languishing remembrance of their kind -LRB- so one might fancy , looking on their sickly boughs -RRB- as birds in cages have of theirs .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 80]: Here , paralysed old watchmen guarded the bodies of the dead at night , year after year , until at last they joined that solemn brotherhood ; and , saving that they slept below the ground a sounder sleep than even they had ever known above it , and were shut up in another kind of box , their condition can hardly be said to have undergone any material change when they , in turn , were watched themselves .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 100]: Among the narrow thoroughfares at hand , there lingered , here and there , an ancient doorway of carved oak , from which , of old , the sounds of revelry and feasting often came ; but now these mansions , only used for storehouses , were dark and dull , and , being filled with wool , and cotton , and the like -- such heavy merchandise as stifles sound and stops the throat of echo -- had an air of palpable deadness about them which , added to their silence and desertion , made them very grim .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 128]: In like manner , there were gloomy courtyards in these parts , into which few but belated wayfarers ever strayed , and where vast bags and packs of goods , upward or downward bound , were for ever dangling between heaven and earth from lofty cranes There were more trucks near Todgers 's than you would suppose whole city could ever need ; not active trucks , but a vagabond race , for ever lounging in the narrow lanes before their masters ' doors and stopping up the pass ; so that when a stray hackney-coach or lumbering waggon came that way , they were the cause of such an uproar as enlivened the whole neighbourhood , and made the bells in the next churchtower vibrate again .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 80]: In the throats and maws of dark no-thoroughfares near Todgers 's , individual wine-merchants and wholesale dealers in grocery-ware had perfect little towns of their own ; and , deep among the foundations of these buildings , the ground was undermined and burrowed out into stables , where cart-horses , troubled by rats , might be heard on a quiet Sunday rattling their halters , as disturbed spirits in tales of haunted houses are said to clank their chains .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 50]: To tell of half the queer old taverns that had a drowsy and secret existence near Todgers 's , would fill a goodly book ; while a second volume no less capacious might be devoted to an account of the quaint old guests who frequented their dimly lighted parlours .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 20]: These were , in general , ancient inhabitants of that region ; born , and bred there from boyhood .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 30]: who had long since become wheezy and asthmatical , and short of breath , except in the article of story-telling ; in which respect they were still marvellously long-winded .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 86]: These gentry were much opposed to steam and all new-fangled ways , and held ballooning to be sinful , and deplored the degeneracy of the times ; which that particular member of each little club who kept the keys of the nearest church , professionally , always attributed to the prevalence of dissent and irreligion ; though the major part of the company inclined to the belief that virtue went out with hair-powder , and that Old England 's greatness had decayed amain with barbers .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 39]: As to Todgers 's itself -- speaking of it only as a house in that neighbourhood , and making no reference to its merits as a commercial boarding establishment -- it was worthy to stand where it did .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 74]: There was one staircase-window in it , at the side of the house , on the ground floor ; which tradition said had not been opened for a hundred years at least , and which , abutting on an always dirty lane , was so begrimed and coated with a century 's mud , that no one pane of glass could possibly fall out , though all were cracked and broken twenty times .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 98]: But the grand mystery of Todgers 's was the cellarage , approachable only by a little back door and a rusty grating ; which cellarage within the memory of man had had no connection with the house , but had always been the freehold property of somebody else , and was reported to be full of wealth ; though in what shape -- whether in silver , brass , or gold , or butts of wine , or casks of gun-powder -- was matter of profound uncertainty and supreme indifference to Todgers 's and all its inmates .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 10]: The top of the house was worthy of notice .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 49]: There was a sort of terrace on the roof , with posts and fragments of rotten lines , once intended to dry clothes upon ; and there were two or three tea-chests out there , full of earth , with forgotten plants in them , like old walking-sticks .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 68]: Whoever climbed to this observatory , was stunned at first from having knocked his head against the little door in coming out ; and after that , was for the moment choked from having looked perforce , straight down the kitchen chimney ; but these two stages over , there were things to gaze at from the top of Todgers 's , well worth your seeing too .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 63]: For first and foremost , if the day were bright , you observed upon the house-tops , stretching far away , a long dark path ; the shadow of the Monument ; and turning round , the tall original was close beside you , with every hair erect upon his golden head , as if the doings of the city frightened him .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 21]: Then there were steeples , towers , belfries , shining vanes , and masts of ships ; a very forest .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 10]: Gables , housetops , garret-windows , wilderness upon wilderness .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 11]: Smoke and noise enough for all the world at once .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 45]: After the first glance , there were slight features in the midst of this crowd of objects , which sprung out from the mass without any reason , as it were , and took hold of the attention whether the spectator would or no .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 39]: Thus , the revolving chimney-pots on one great stack of buildings seemed to be turning gravely to each other every now and then , and whispering the result of their separate observation of what was going on below .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 27]: Others , of a crook-backed shape , appeared to be maliciously holding themselves askew , that they might shut the prospect out and baffle Todgers 's .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 40]: The man who was mending a pen at an upper window over the way , became of paramount importance in the scene , and made a blank in it , ridiculously disproportionate in its extent , when he retired .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 28]: The gambols of a piece of cloth upon the dyer 's pole had far more interest for the moment than all the changing motion of the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 98]: Yet even while the looker-on felt angry with himself for this , and wondered how it was , the tumult swelled into a roar ; the hosts of objects seemed to thicken and expand a hundredfold , and after gazing round him , quite scared , he turned into Todgers 's again , much more rapidly than he came out ; and ten to one he told M. Todgers afterwards that if he had n't done so , he would certainly have come into the street by the shortest cut ; that is to say , head-foremost .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 71]: So said the two Miss Pecksniffs , when they retired with Mrs Todgers from this place of espial , leaving the youthful porter to close the door and follow them downstairs ; who , being of a playful temperament , and contemplating with a delight peculiar to his sex and time of life , any chance of dashing himself into small fragments , lingered behind to walk upon the parapet .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 66]: It being the second day of their stay in London , the Miss Pecksniffs and Mrs Todgers were by this time highly confidential , insomuch that the last-named lady had already communicated the particulars of three early disappointments of a tender nature ; and had furthermore possessed her young friends with a general summary of the life , conduct , and character of Mr Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 31]: Who , it seemed , had cut his matrimonial career rather short , by unlawfully running away from his happiness , and establishing himself in foreign countries as a bachelor .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 33]: ` Your pa was once a little particular in his attentions , my dears , ' said Mrs Todgers , ` but to be your ma was too much happiness denied me .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 13]: You 'd hardly know who this was done for , perhaps ? '
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 36]: She called their attention to an oval miniature , like a little blister , which was tacked up over the kettle-holder , and in which there was a dreamy shadowing forth of her own visage .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 8]: ` It 's a speaking likeness ! '
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 6]: cried the two Miss Pecksniffs .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 37]: ` It was considered so once , ' said Mrs Todgers , warming herself in a gentlemanly manner at the fire ; ` but I hardly thought you would have known it , my loves . '
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 7]: They would have known it anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 27]: If they could have met with it in the street , or seen it in a shop window , they would have cried ` Good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 4]: Mrs Todgers ! '
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 25]: ` Presiding over an establishment like this , makes sad havoc with the features , my dear Miss Pecksniffs , ' said Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 22]: ` The gravy alone , is enough to add twenty years to one 's age , I do assure you . '
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 5]: ` Lor ' ! '
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 6]: cried the two Miss Pecksniffs .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 25]: ` The anxiety of that one item , my dears , ' said Mrs Todgers , ` keeps the mind continually upon the stretch .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 18]: There is no such passion in human nature , as the passion for gravy among commercial gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 29]: It 's nothing to say a joint wo n't yield -- a whole animal would n't yield -- the amount of gravy they expect each day at dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 28]: And what I have undergone in consequence , ' cried Mrs Todgers , raising her eyes and shaking her head , ` no one would believe ! '
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 9]: ` Just like Mr Pinch , Merry ! '
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 3]: said Charity .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 13]: ` We have always noticed it in him , you remember ? '
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 23]: ` Yes , my dear , ' giggled Merry , ` but we have never given it him , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 77]: ` You , my dears , having to deal with your pa 's pupils who ca n't help themselves , are able to take your own way , ' said Mrs Todgers ; ` but in a commercial establishment , where any gentleman may say any Saturday evening , `` Mrs Todgers , this day week we part , in consequence of the cheese , '' it is not so easy to preserve a pleasant understanding .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 39]: Your pa was kind enough , ' added the good lady , ` to invite me to take a ride with you to-day ; and I think he mentioned that you were going to call upon Miss Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 16]: Any relation to the gentleman you were speaking of just now , Miss Pecksniff ? '
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 22]: ` For goodness sake , Mrs Todgers , ' interposed the lively Merry , ` do n't call him a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 8]: My dear Cherry , Pinch a gentleman !
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 4]: The idea ! '
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 9]: ` What a wicked girl you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 10]: cried Mrs Todgers , embracing her with great affection .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 11]: ` You are quite a quiz , I do declare !
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 21]: My dear Miss Pecksniff , what a happiness your sister 's spirits must be to your pa and self ! '
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 25]: ` He 's the most hideous , goggle-eyed creature , Mrs Todgers , in existence , ' resumed Merry : ` quite an ogre .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 11]: The ugliest , awkwardest frightfullest being , you can imagine .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 15]: This is his sister , so I leave you to suppose what SHE is .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 14]: I shall be obliged to laugh outright , I know I shall ! '
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 16]: cried the charming girl , ' I never shall be able to keep my countenance .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 27]: The notion of a Miss Pinch presuming to exist at all is sufficient to kill one , but to see her -- oh my stars ! '
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 24]: Mrs Todgers laughed immensely at the dear love 's humour , and declared she was quite afraid of her , that she was .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 6]: She was so very severe .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 6]: ` Who is severe ? '
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 7]: cried a voice at the door .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 16]: ` There is no such thing as severity in our family , I hope ! '
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 23]: And then Mr Pecksniff peeped smilingly into the room , and said , ` May I come in , Mrs Todgers ? '
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 37]: Mrs Todgers almost screamed , for the little door of communication between that room and the inner one being wide open , there was a full disclosure of the sofa bedstead in all its monstrous impropriety .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 47]: But she had the presence of mind to close this portal in the twinkling of an eye ; and having done so , said , though not without confusion , ` Oh yes , Mr Pecksniff , you can come in , if you please . '
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 13]: ` How are we to-day , ' said Mr Pecksniff , jocosely .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 7]: ` and what are our plans ?
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 12]: Are we ready to go and see Tom Pinch 's sister ?
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 5]: Poor Thomas Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 29]: ` Are we ready , ' returned Mrs Todgers , nodding her head with mysterious intelligence , ` to send a favourable reply to Mr Jinkins 's round-robin ?
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 10]: That 's the first question , Mr Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 12]: ` Why Mr Jinkins 's robin , my dear madam ? '
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 33]: asked Mr Pecksniff , putting one arm round Mercy , and the other round Mrs Todgers , whom he seemed , in the abstraction of the moment , to mistake for Charity .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 7]: ` Why Mr Jinkins 's ? '
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 26]: ` Because he began to get it up , and indeed always takes the lead in the house , ' said Mrs Todgers , playfully .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 8]: ` That 's why , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 15]: ` Jinkins is a man of superior talents , ' observed Mr Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 9]: I have conceived a great regard for Jinkins .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 28]: I take Jinkins 's desire to pay polite attention to my daughters , as an additional proof of the friendly feeling of Jinkins , Mrs Todgers . '
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 35]: ` Well now , ' returned that lady , ` having said so much , you must say the rest , Mr Pecksniff ; so tell the dear young ladies all about it . '
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 74]: With these words she gently eluded Mr Pecksniff 's grasp , and took Miss Charity into her own embrace ; though whether she was impelled to this proceeding solely by the irrepressible affection she had conceived for that young lady , or whether it had any reference to a lowering , not to say distinctly spiteful expression which had been visible in her face for some moments , has never been exactly ascertained .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 92]: Be this as it may , Mr Pecksniff went on to inform his daughters of the purport and history of the round-robin aforesaid , which was in brief , that the commercial gentlemen who helped to make up the sum and substance of that noun of multitude signifying many , called Todgers 's , desired the honour of their presence at the general table , so long as they remained in the house , and besought that they would grace the board at dinner-time next day , the same being Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 58]: He further said , that Mrs Todgers being a consenting party to this invitation , he was willing , for his part , to accept it ; and so left them that he might write his gracious answer , the while they armed themselves with their best bonnets for the utter defeat and overthrow of Miss Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 27]: Tom Pinch 's sister was governess in a family , a lofty family ; perhaps the wealthiest brass and copper founders ' family known to mankind .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 38]: They lived at Camberwell ; in a house so big and fierce , that its mere outside , like the outside of a giant 's castle , struck terror into vulgar minds and made bold persons quail .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 45]: There was a great front gate ; with a great bell , whose handle was in itself a note of admiration ; and a great lodge ; which being close to the house , rather spoilt the look-out certainly but made the look-in tremendous .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 94]: At this entry , a great porter kept constant watch and ward ; and when he gave the visitor high leave to pass , he rang a second great bell , responsive to whose note a great footman appeared in due time at the great halldoor , with such great tags upon his liveried shoulder that he was perpetually entangling and hooking himself among the chairs and tables , and led a life of torment which could scarcely have been surpassed , if he had been a blue-bottle in a world of cobwebs .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 21]: To this mansion Mr Pecksniff , accompanied by his daughters and Mrs Todgers , drove gallantly in a one-horse fly .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 94]: The foregoing ceremonies having been all performed , they were ushered into the house ; and so , by degrees , they got at last into a small room with books in it , where Mr Pinch 's sister was at that moment instructing her eldest pupil ; to wit , a premature little woman of thirteen years old , who had already arrived at such a pitch of whalebone and education that she had nothing girlish about her , which was a source of great rejoicing to all her relations and friends .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 7]: ` Visitors for Miss Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 4]: said the footman .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 51]: He must have been an ingenious young man , for he said it very cleverly ; with a nice discrimination between the cold respect with which he would have announced visitors to the family , and the warm personal interest with which he would have announced visitors to the cook .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 7]: ` Visitors for Miss Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 22]: Miss Pinch rose hastily ; with such tokens of agitation as plainly declared that her list of callers was not numerous .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 28]: At the same time , the little pupil became alarmingly upright , and prepared herself to take mental notes of all that might be said and done .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 49]: For the lady of the establishment was curious in the natural history and habits of the animal called Governess , and encouraged her daughters to report thereon whenever occasion served ; which was , in reference to all parties concerned , very laudable , improving , and pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 23]: It is a melancholy fact ; but it must be related , that Mr Pinch 's sister was not at all ugly .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 33]: On the contrary , she had a good face ; a very mild and prepossessing face ; and a pretty little figure -- slight and short , but remarkable for its neatness .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 81]: There was something of her brother , much of him indeed , in a certain gentleness of manner , and in her look of timid trustfulness ; but she was so far from being a fright , or a dowdy , or a horror , or anything else , predicted by the two Miss Pecksniffs , that those young ladies naturally regarded her with great indignation , feeling that this was by no means what they had come to see .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 53]: Miss Mercy , as having the larger share of gaiety , bore up the best against this disappointment , and carried it off , in outward show at least , with a titter ; but her sister , not caring to hide her disdain , expressed it pretty openly in her looks .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 34]: As to Mrs Todgers , she leaned on Mr Pecksniff 's arm and preserved a kind of genteel grimness , suitable to any state of mind , and involving any shade of opinion .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 31]: ` Do n't be alarmed , Miss Pinch , ' said Mr Pecksniff , taking her hand condescendingly in one of his , and patting it with the other . '
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 20]: I have called to see you , in pursuance of a promise given to your brother , Thomas Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 13]: My name -- compose yourself , Miss Pinch -- is Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 73]: The good man emphasised these words as though he would have said , ` You see in me , young person , the benefactor of your race ; the patron of your house ; the preserver of your brother , who is fed with manna daily from my table ; and in right of whom there is a considerable balance in my favour at present standing in the books beyond the sky .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 16]: But I have no pride , for I can afford to do without it ! '
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 14]: The poor girl felt it all as if it had been Gospel truth .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 22]: Her brother writing in the fullness of his simple heart , had often told her so , and how much more !
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 20]: As Mr Pecksniff ceased to speak , she hung her head , and dropped a tear upon his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 9]: ` Oh very well , Miss Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 20]: thought the sharp pupil , ` crying before strangers , as if you did n't like the situation ! '
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 19]: ` Thomas is well , ' said Mr Pecksniff ; ` and sends his love and this letter .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 47]: I can not say , poor fellow , that he will ever be distinguished in our profession ; but he has the will to do well , which is the next thing to having the power ; and , therefore , we must bear with him .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 4]: Eh ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 51]: I know he has the will , sir , ' said Tom Pinch 's sister , ` and I know how kindly and considerately you cherish it , for which neither he nor I can ever be grateful enough , as we very often say in writing to each other .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 27]: The young ladies too , ' she added , glancing gratefully at his two daughters , ' I know how much we owe to them . '
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 34]: ` My dears , ' said Mr Pecksniff , turning to them with a smile : ` Thomas 's sister is saying something you will be glad to hear , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 13]: ` We ca n't take any merit to ourselves , papa ! '
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 28]: cried Cherry , as they both apprised Tom Pinch 's sister , with a curtsey , that they would feel obliged if she would keep her distance .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 38]: ` Mr Pinch 's being so well provided for is owing to you alone , and we can only say how glad we are to hear that he is as grateful as he ought to be . '
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 9]: ` Oh very well , Miss Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 5]: thought the pupil again .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 14]: ` Got a grateful brother , living on other people 's kindness ! '
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 76]: ` It was very kind of you , ' said Tom Pinch 's sister , with Tom 's own simplicity and Tom 's own smile , ` to come here ; very kind indeed ; though how great a kindness you have done me in gratifying my wish to see you , and to thank you with my own lips , you , who make so light of benefits conferred , can scarcely think . '
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 15]: ` Very grateful ; very pleasant ; very proper , ' murmured Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 96]: ` It makes me happy too , ' said Ruth Pinch , who now that her first surprise was over , had a chatty , cheerful way with her , and a single-hearted desire to look upon the best side of everything , which was the very moral and image of Tom ; ` very happy to think that you will be able to tell him how more than comfortably I am situated here , and how unnecessary it is that he should ever waste a regret on my being cast upon my own resources .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 3]: Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 54]: So long as I heard that he was happy , and he heard that I was , ' said Tom 's sister , ` we could both bear , without one impatient or complaining thought , a great deal more than ever we have had to endure , I am very certain . '
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 24]: And if ever the plain truth were spoken on this occasionally false earth , Tom 's sister spoke it when she said that .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 17]: cried Mr Pecksniff whose eyes had in the meantime wandered to the pupil ; ` certainly .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 12]: And how do YOU do , my very interesting child ? '
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 17]: ` Quite well , I thank you , sir , ' replied that frosty innocent . '
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 19]: A sweet face this , my dears , ' said Mr Pecksniff , turning to his daughters . '
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 5]: A charming manner ! '
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 36]: Both young ladies had been in ecstasies with the scion of a wealthy house -LRB- through whom the nearest road and shortest cut to her parents might be supposed to lie -RRB- from the first .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 14]: Mrs Todgers vowed that anything one quarter so angelic she had never seen .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 36]: ` She wanted but a pair of wings , a dear , ' said that good woman , ` to be a young syrup ' -- meaning , possibly , young sylph , or seraph .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 50]: ` If you will give that to your distinguished parents , my amiable little friend , ' said Mr Pecksniff , producing one of his professional cards , ` and will say that I and my daughters -- ' ` And Mrs Todgers , pa , ' said Merry .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 136]: ` And Mrs Todgers , of London , ' added Mr Pecksniff ; ` that I , and my daughters , and Mrs Todgers , of London , did not intrude upon them , as our object simply was to take some notice of Miss Pinch , whose brother is a young man in my employment ; but that I could not leave this very chaste mansion , without adding my humble tribute , as an Architect , to the correctness and elegance of the owner 's taste , and to his just appreciation of that beautiful art to the cultivation of which I have devoted a life , and to the promotion of whose glory and advancement I have sacrified a -- a fortune -- I shall be very much obliged to you . '
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 42]: ` Missis 's compliments to Miss Pinch , ' said the footman , suddenly appearing , and speaking in exactly the same key as before , ` and begs to know wot my young lady is a-learning of just now . '
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 11]: said Mr Pecksniff , ` Here is the young man .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 6]: HE will take the card .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 11]: With my compliments , if you please , young man .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 9]: My dears , we are interrupting the studies .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 5]: Let us go . '
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 94]: Some confusion was occasioned for an instant by Mrs Todgers 's unstrapping her little flat hand-basket , and hurriedly entrusting the ` young man ' with one of her own cards , which , in addition to certain detailed information relative to the terms of the commercial establishment , bore a foot-note to the effect that M. T. took that opportunity of thanking those gentlemen who had honoured her with their favours , and begged they would have the goodness , if satisfied with the table , to recommend her to their friends .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 23]: But Mr Pecksniff , with admirable presence of mind , recovered this document , and buttoned it up in his own pocket .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 39]: Then he said to Miss Pinch -- with more condescension and kindness than ever , for it was desirable the footman should expressly understand that they were not friends of hers , but patrons : ` Good morning .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 2]: Good-bye .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 4]: God bless you !
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 12]: You may depend upon my continued protection of your brother Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 11]: Keep your mind quite at ease , Miss Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 17]: ` Thank you , ' said Tom 's sister heartily ; ' a thousand times . '
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 16]: ` Not at all , ' he retorted , patting her gently on the head .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 6]: ` Do n't mention it .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 9]: You will make me angry if you do .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 12]: My sweet child ' -- to the pupil -- ` farewell !
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 46]: That fairy creature , ' said Mr Pecksniff , looking in his pensive mood hard at the footman , as if he meant him , ` has shed a vision on my path , refulgent in its nature , and not easily to be obliterated .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 8]: My dears , are you ready ? '
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 15]: They were not quite ready yet , for they were still caressing the pupil .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 34]: But they tore themselves away at length ; and sweeping past Miss Pinch with each a haughty inclination of the head and a curtsey strangled in its birth , flounced into the passage .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 57]: The young man had rather a long job in showing them out ; for Mr Pecksniff 's delight in the tastefulness of the house was such that he could not help often stopping -LRB- particularly when they were near the parlour door -RRB- and giving it expression , in a loud voice and very learned terms .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 41]: Indeed , he delivered , between the study and the hall , a familiar exposition of the whole science of architecture as applied to dwelling-houses , and was yet in the freshness of his eloquence when they reached the garden .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 86]: ` If you look , ' said Mr Pecksniff , backing from the steps , with his head on one side and his eyes half-shut that he might the better take in the proportions of the exterior : ` If you look , my dears , at the cornice which supports the roof , and observe the airiness of its construction , especially where it sweeps the southern angle of the building , you will feel with me -- How do you do , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 7]: I hope you 're well ? '
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 49]: Interrupting himself with these words , he very politely bowed to a middle-aged gentleman at an upper window , to whom he spoke -- not because the gentleman could hear him -LRB- for he certainly could not -RRB- , but as an appropriate accompaniment to his salutation . '
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 30]: I have no doubt , my dears , ' said Mr Pecksniff , feigning to point out other beauties with his hand , ` that this is the proprietor .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 8]: I should be glad to know him .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 6]: It might lead to something .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 9]: Is he looking this way , Charity ? '
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 9]: ` He is opening the window pa ! '
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 6]: ` Ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 5]: cried Mr Pecksniff softly .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 4]: ` All right !
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 7]: He has found I 'm professional .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 12]: He heard me inside just now , I have no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 4]: Do n't look !
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 18]: With regard to the fluted pillars in the portico , my dears -- ' ` Hallo ! '
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 4]: cried the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 7]: ` Sir , your servant ! '
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 10]: said Mr Pecksniff , taking off his hat . '
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 9]: I am proud to make your acquaintance . '
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 10]: ` Come off the grass , will you ! '
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 5]: roared the gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 19]: I beg your pardon , sir , ' said Mr Pecksniff , doubtful of his having heard aright .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 6]: ` Did you -- ? '
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 7]: ` Come off the grass ! '
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 6]: repeated the gentleman , warmly .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 15]: ` We are unwilling to intrude , sir , ' Mr Pecksniff smilingly began .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 15]: ` But you ARE intruding , ' returned the other , ` unwarrantably intruding .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 2]: Trespassing .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 10]: You see a gravel walk , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 9]: What do you think it 's meant for ?
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 5]: Open the gate there !
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 6]: Show that party out ! '
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 12]: With that he clapped down the window again , and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 32]: Mr Pecksniff put on his hat , and walked with great deliberation and in profound silence to the fly , gazing at the clouds as he went , with great interest .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 66]: After helping his daughters and Mrs Todgers into that conveyance , he stood looking at it for some moments , as if he were not quite certain whether it was a carriage or a temple ; but having settled this point in his mind , he got into his place , spread his hands out on his knees , and smiled upon the three beholders .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 14]: But his daughters , less tranquil-minded , burst into a torrent of indignation .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 14]: This came , they said , of cherishing such creatures as the Pinches .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 9]: This came of lowering themselves to their level .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 25]: This came of putting themselves in the humiliating position of seeming to know such bold , audacious , cunning , dreadful girls as that .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 5]: They had expected this .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 20]: They had predicted it to Mrs Todgers , as she -LRB- Todgers -RRB- could depone , that very morning .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 49]: To this , they added , that the owner of the house , supposing them to be Miss Pinch 's friends , had acted , in their opinion , quite correctly , and had done no more than , under such circumstances , might reasonably have been expected .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 39]: To that they added -LRB- with a trifling inconsistency -RRB- , that he was a brute and a bear ; and then they merged into a flood of tears , which swept away all wandering epithets before it .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 82]: Perhaps Miss Pinch was scarcely so much to blame in the matter as the Seraph , who , immediately on the withdrawal of the visitors , had hastened to report them at head-quarters , with a full account of their having presumptuously charged her with the delivery of a message afterwards consigned to the footman ; which outrage , taken in conjunction with Mr Pecksniff 's unobtrusive remarks on the establishment , might possibly have had some share in their dismissal .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 79]: Poor Miss Pinch , however , had to bear the brunt of it with both parties ; being so severely taken to task by the Seraph 's mother for having such vulgar acquaintances , that she was fain to retire to her own room in tears , which her natural cheerfulness and submission , and the delight of having seen Mr Pecksniff , and having received a letter from her brother , were at first insufficient to repress .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 49]: As to Mr Pecksniff , he told them in the fly , that a good action was its own reward ; and rather gave them to understand , that if he could have been kicked in such a cause , he would have liked it all the better .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 63]: But this was no comfort to the young ladies , who scolded violently the whole way back , and even exhibited , more than once , a keen desire to attack the devoted Mrs Todgers ; on whose personal appearance , but particularly on whose offending card and hand-basket , they were secretly inclined to lay the blame of half their failure .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 60]: Todgers 's was in a great bustle that evening , partly owing to some additional domestic preparations for the morrow , and partly to the excitement always inseparable in that house from Saturday night , when every gentleman 's linen arrived at a different hour in its own little bundle , with his private account pinned on the outside .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 50]: There was always a great clinking of pattens downstairs , too , until midnight or so , on Saturdays ; together with a frequent gleaming of mysterious lights in the area ; much working at the pump ; and a constant jangling of the iron handle of the pail .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 39]: Shrill altercations from time to time arose between Mrs Todgers and unknown females in remote back kitchens ; and sounds were occasionally heard , indicative of small articles of iron mongery and hardware being thrown at the boy .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 123]: It was the custom of that youth on Saturdays , to roll up his shirt sleeves to his shoulders , and pervade all parts of the house in an apron of coarse green baize ; moreover , he was more strongly tempted on Saturdays than on other days -LRB- it being a busy time -RRB- , to make excursive bolts into the neighbouring alleys when he answered the door , and there to play at leap-frog and other sports with vagrant lads , until pursued and brought back by the hair of his head or the lobe of his ear ; thus he was quite a conspicuous feature among the peculiar incidents of the last day in the week at Todgers 's .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 70]: He was especially so on this particular Saturday evening , and honoured the Miss Pecksniffs with a deal of notice ; seldom passing the door of Mrs Todgers 's private room , where they sat alone before the fire , working by the light of a solitary candle , without putting in his head and greeting them with some such compliments as , ` There you are agin ! '
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 7]: ` A n't it nice ? '
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 7]: -- and similar humorous attentions . '
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 26]: I say , ' he whispered , stopping in one of his journeys to and fro , ` young ladies , there 's soup to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 6]: She 's a-making it now .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 8]: A n't she a-putting in the water ?
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 6]: not at all neither ! '
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 16]: In the course of answering another knock , he thrust in his head again . '
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 3]: I say !
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 5]: There 's fowls to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 4]: Not skinny ones .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 4]: Oh no ! '
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 14]: Presently he called through the key-hole : ` There 's a fish to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 3]: Just come .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 8]: Do n't eat none of him ! '
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 10]: And , with this special warning , vanished again .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 39]: By-and-bye , he returned to lay the cloth for supper ; it having been arranged between Mrs Todgers and the young ladies , that they should partake of an exclusive veal-cutlet together in the privacy of that apartment .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 67]: He entertained them on this occasion by thrusting the lighted candle into his mouth , and exhibiting his face in a state of transparency ; after the performance of which feat , he went on with his professional duties ; brightening every knife as he laid it on the table , by breathing on the blade and afterwards polishing the same on the apron already mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 31]: When he had completed his preparations , he grinned at the sisters , and expressed his belief that the approaching collation would be of ` rather a spicy sort . '
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 14]: ` Will it be long , before it 's ready , Bailey ? '
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 3]: asked Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 12]: ` No , ' said Bailey , ` it IS cooked .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 22]: When I come up , she was dodging among the tender pieces with a fork , and eating of 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 42]: But he had scarcely achieved the utterance of these words , when he received a manual compliment on the head , which sent him staggering against the wall ; and Mrs Todgers , dish in hand , stood indignantly before him .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 7]: ` Oh you little villain ! '
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 4]: said that lady .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 9]: ` Oh you bad , false boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 23]: ` No worse than yerself , ' retorted Bailey , guarding his head , on a principle invented by Mr Thomas Cribb .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 3]: Come now !
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 8]: Do that again , will yer ? '
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 26]: ` He 's the most dreadful child , ' said Mrs Todgers , setting down the dish , ' I ever had to deal with .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 29]: The gentlemen spoil him to that extent , and teach him such things , that I 'm afraid nothing but hanging will ever do him any good . '
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 6]: ` Wo n't it ! '
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 3]: cried Bailey .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 16]: Wot do you go a-lowerin the table-beer for then , and destroying my constitooshun ? '
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 18]: ` Go downstairs , you vicious boy , ' said Mrs Todgers , holding the door open .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 6]: ` Do you hear me ?
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 4]: Go along ! '
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 50]: After two or three dexterous feints , he went , and was seen no more that night , save once , when he brought up some tumblers and hot water , and much disturbed the two Miss Pecksniffs by squinting hideously behind the back of the unconscious Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 45]: Having done this justice to his wounded feelings , he retired underground ; where , in company with a swarm of black beetles and a kitchen candle , he employed his faculties in cleaning boots and brushing clothes until the night was far advanced .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 23]: Benjamin was supposed to be the real name of this young retainer but he was known by a great variety of names .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 59]: Benjamin , for instance , had been converted into Uncle Ben , and that again had been corrupted into Uncle ; which , by an easy transition , had again passed into Barnwell , in memory of the celebrated relative in that degree who was shot by his nephew George , while meditating in his garden at Camberwell .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 60]: The gentlemen at Todgers 's had a merry habit , too , of bestowing upon him , for the time being , the name of any notorious malefactor or minister ; and sometimes when current events were flat they even sought the pages of history for these distinctions ; as Mr Pitt , Young Brownrigg , and the like .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 66]: At the period of which we write , he was generally known among the gentlemen as Bailey junior ; a name bestowed upon him in contradistinction , perhaps , to Old Bailey ; and possibly as involving the recollection of an unfortunate lady of the same name , who perished by her own hand early in life , and has been immortalised in a ballad .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 45]: The usual Sunday dinner-hour at Todgers 's was two o'clock -- a suitable time , it was considered for all parties ; convenient to Mrs Todgers , on account of the bakers ; and convenient to the gentlemen with reference to their afternoon engagements .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 43]: But on the Sunday which was to introduce the two Miss Pecksniffs to a full knowledge of Todgers 's and its society , the dinner was postponed until five , in order that everything might be as genteel as the occasion demanded .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 62]: When the hour drew nigh , Bailey junior , testifying great excitement , appeared in a complete suit of cast-off clothes several sizes too large for him , and in particular , mounted a clean shirt of such extraordinary magnitude , that one of the gentlemen -LRB- remarkable for his ready wit -RRB- called him ` collars ' on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 60]: At about a quarter before five , a deputation , consisting of Mr Jinkins , and another gentleman , whose name was Gander , knocked at the door of Mrs Todgers 's room , and , being formally introduced to the two Miss Pecksniffs by their parent who was in waiting , besought the honour of conducting them upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 42]: The drawing-room at Todgers 's was out of the common style ; so much so indeed , that you would hardly have taken it to be a drawingroom , unless you were told so by somebody who was in the secret .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 21]: It was floor-clothed all over ; and the ceiling , including a great beam in the middle , was papered .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 63]: Besides the three little windows , with seats in them , commanding the opposite archway , there was another window looking point blank , without any compromise at all about it into Jinkins 's bedroom ; and high up , all along one side of the wall was a strip of panes of glass , two-deep , giving light to the staircase .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 59]: There were the oddest closets possible , with little casements in them like eight-day clocks , lurking in the wainscot and taking the shape of the stairs ; and the very door itself -LRB- which was painted black -RRB- had two great glass eyes in its forehead , with an inquisitive green pupil in the middle of each .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 7]: Here the gentlemen were all assembled .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 12]: There was a general cry of ` Hear , hear ! '
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 6]: and ` Bravo Jink ! '
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 33]: when Mr Jinkins appeared with Charity on his arm ; which became quite rapturous as Mr Gander followed , escorting Mercy , and Mr Pecksniff brought up the rear with Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 6]: Then the presentations took place .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 113]: They included a gentleman of a sporting turn , who propounded questions on jockey subjects to the editors of Sunday papers , which were regarded by his friends as rather stiff things to answer ; and they included a gentleman of a theatrical turn , who had once entertained serious thoughts of ` coming out , ' but had been kept in by the wickedness of human nature ; and they included a gentleman of a debating turn , who was strong at speech-making ; and a gentleman of a literary turn , who wrote squibs upon the rest , and knew the weak side of everybody 's character but his own .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 51]: There was a gentleman of a vocal turn , and a gentleman of a smoking turn , and a gentleman of a convivial turn ; some of the gentlemen had a turn for whist , and a large proportion of the gentlemen had a strong turn for billiards and betting .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 42]: They had all , it may be presumed , a turn for business ; being all commercially employed in one way or other ; and had , every one in his own way , a decided turn for pleasure to boot .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 27]: Mr Jinkins was of a fashionable turn ; being a regular frequenter of the Parks on Sundays , and knowing a great many carriages by sight .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 22]: He spoke mysteriously , too , of splendid women , and was suspected of having once committed himself with a Countess .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 53]: Mr Gander was of a witty turn being indeed the gentleman who had originated the sally about ` collars ; ' which sparkling pleasantry was now retailed from mouth to mouth , under the title of Gander 's Last , and was received in all parts of the room with great applause .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 24]: Mr Jinkins it may be added , was much the oldest of the party ; being a fish-salesman 's book-keeper , aged forty .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 29]: He was the oldest boarder also ; and in right of his double seniority , took the lead in the house , as Mrs Todgers had already said .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 58]: There was considerable delay in the production of dinner , and poor Mrs Todgers , being reproached in confidence by Jinkins , slipped in and out , at least twenty times to see about it ; always coming back as though she had no such thing upon her mind , and had n't been out at all .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 77]: But there was no hitch in the conversation nevertheless ; for one gentleman , who travelled in the perfumery line , exhibited an interesting nick-nack , in the way of a remarkable cake of shaving soap which he had lately met with in Germany ; and the gentleman of a literary turn repeated -LRB- by desire -RRB- some sarcastic stanzas he had recently produced on the freezing of the tank at the back of the house .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 35]: These amusements , with the miscellaneous conversation arising out of them , passed the time splendidly , until dinner was announced by Bailey junior in these terms : ` The wittles is up ! '
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 40]: On which notice they immediately descended to the banquet-hall ; some of the more facetious spirits in the rear taking down gentlemen as if they were ladies , in imitation of the fortunate possessors of the two Miss Pecksniffs .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 57]: Mr Pecksniff said grace -- a short and pious grace , involving a blessing on the appetites of those present , and committing all persons who had nothing to eat , to the care of Providence ; whose business -LRB- so said the grace , in effect -RRB- it clearly was , to look after them .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 61]: This done , they fell to with less ceremony than appetite ; the table groaning beneath the weight , not only of the delicacies whereof the Miss Pecksniffs had been previously forewarned , but of boiled beef , roast veal , bacon , pies and abundance of such heavy vegetables as are favourably known to housekeepers for their satisfying qualities .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 27]: Besides which , there were bottles of stout , bottles of wine , bottles of ale , and divers other strong drinks , native and foreign .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 47]: All this was highly agreeable to the two Miss Pecksniffs , who were in immense request ; sitting one on either hand of Mr Jinkins at the bottom of the table ; and who were called upon to take wine with some new admirer every minute .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 48]: They had hardly ever felt so pleasant , and so full of conversation , in their lives ; Mercy , in particular , was uncommonly brilliant , and said so many good things in the way of lively repartee that she was looked upon as a prodigy .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 32]: ` In short , ' as that young lady observed , ` they felt now , indeed , that they were in London , and for the first time too . '
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 73]: Their young friend Bailey sympathized in these feelings to the fullest extent , and , abating nothing of his patronage , gave them every encouragement in his power ; favouring them , when the general attention was diverted from his proceedings , with many nods and winks and other tokens of recognition , and occasionally touching his nose with a corkscrew , as if to express the Bacchanalian character of the meeting .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 44]: In truth , perhaps even the spirits of the two Miss Pecksniffs , and the hungry watchfulness of Mrs Todgers , were less worthy of note than the proceedings of this remarkable boy , whom nothing disconcerted or put out of his way .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 50]: If any piece of crockery , a dish or otherwise , chanced to slip through his hands -LRB- which happened once or twice -RRB- , he let it go with perfect good breeding , and never added to the painful emotions of the company by exhibiting the least regret .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 87]: Nor did he , by hurrying to and fro , disturb the repose of the assembly , as many well-trained servants do ; on the contrary , feeling the hopelessness of waiting upon so large a party , he left the gentlemen to help themselves to what they wanted , and seldom stirred from behind Mr Jinkins 's chair , where , with his hands in his pockets , and his legs planted pretty wide apart , he led the laughter , and enjoyed the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 5]: The dessert was splendid .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 4]: No waiting either .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 43]: The pudding-plates had been washed in a little tub outside the door while cheese was on , and though they were moist and warm with friction , still there they were again , up to the mark , and true to time .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 21]: Quarts of almonds ; dozens of oranges ; pounds of raisins ; stacks of biffins ; soup-plates full of nuts .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 12]: -- Oh , Todgers 's could do it when it chose !
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 3]: mind that .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 64]: Then more wine came on ; red wines and white wines ; and a large china bowl of punch , brewed by the gentleman of a convivial turn , who adjured the Miss Pecksniffs not to be despondent on account of its dimensions , as there were materials in the house for the decoction of half a dozen more of the same size .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 7]: Good gracious , how they laughed !
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 44]: How they coughed when they sipped it , because it was so strong ; and how they laughed again when somebody vowed that but for its colour it might have been mistaken , in regard of its innocuous qualities , for new milk !
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 8]: What a shout of ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 44]: burst from the gentlemen when they pathetically implored Mr Jinkins to suffer them to qualify it with hot water ; and how blushingly , by little and little , did each of them drink her whole glassful , down to its very dregs !
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 6]: Now comes the trying time .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 19]: The sun , as Mr Jinkins says -LRB- gentlemanly creature , Jinkins -- never at a loss ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 8]: , is about to leave the firmament .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 5]: ` Miss Pecksniff ! '
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 12]: says Mrs Todgers , softly , ` will you -- ? '
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 11]: ` Oh dear , no more , Mrs Todgers . '
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 13]: Mrs Todgers rises ; the two Miss Pecksniffs rise ; all rise .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 9]: Miss Mercy Pecksniff looks downward for her scarf .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 4]: Where is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 8]: Dear me , where CAN it be ?
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 21]: Sweet girl , she has it on ; not on her fair neck , but loose upon her flowing figure .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 6]: A dozen hands assist her .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 5]: She is all confusion .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 10]: The youngest gentleman in company thirsts to murder Jinkins .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 10]: She skips and joins her sister at the door .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 12]: Her sister has her arm about the waist of Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 8]: She winds her arm around her sister .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 6]: Diana , what a picture !
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 11]: The last things visible are a shape and a skip .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 10]: ` Gentlemen , let us drink the ladies ! '
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 5]: The enthusiasm is tremendous .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 26]: The gentleman of a debating turn rises in the midst , and suddenly lets loose a tide of eloquence which bears down everything before it .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 15]: He is reminded of a toast -- a toast to which they will respond .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 22]: There is an individual present ; he has him in his eye ; to whom they owe a debt of gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 9]: He repeats it -- a debt of gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 18]: Their rugged natures have been softened and ameliorated that day , by the society of lovely woman .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 23]: There is a gentleman in company whom two accomplished and delightful females regard with veneration , as the fountain of their existence .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 22]: Yes , when yet the two Miss Pecksniffs lisped in language scarce intelligible , they called that individual ` Father ! '
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 5]: There is great applause .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 13]: He gives them ` Mr Pecksniff , and God bless him ! '
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 14]: They all shake hands with Mr Pecksniff , as they drink the toast .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 33]: The youngest gentleman in company does so with a thrill ; for he feels that a mysterious influence pervades the man who claims that being in the pink scarf for his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 7]: What saith Mr Pecksniff in reply ?
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 12]: Or rather let the question be , What leaves he unsaid ?
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 2]: Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 12]: More punch is called for , and produced , and drunk .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 5]: Enthusiasm mounts still higher .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 10]: Every man comes out freely in his own character .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 8]: The gentleman of a theatrical turn recites .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 9]: The vocal gentleman regales them with a song .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 12]: Gander leaves the Gander of all former feasts whole leagues behind .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 7]: HE rises to propose a toast .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 9]: It is , The Father of Todgers 's .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 24]: It is their common friend Jink -- it is old Jink , if he may call him by that familiar and endearing appellation .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 10]: The youngest gentleman in company utters a frantic negative .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 17]: He wo n't have it -- he ca n't bear it -- it must n't be .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 8]: But his depth of feeling is misunderstood .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 14]: He is supposed to be a little elevated ; and nobody heeds him .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 8]: Mr Jinkins thanks them from his heart .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 15]: It is , by many degrees , the proudest day in his humble career .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 23]: When he looks around him on the present occasion , he feels that he wants words in which to express his gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 6]: One thing he will say .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 36]: He hopes it has been shown that Todgers 's can be true to itself ; and that , an opportunity arising , it can come out quite as strong as its neighbours -- perhaps stronger .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 30]: He reminds them , amidst thunders of encouragement , that they have heard of a somewhat similar establishment in Cannon Street ; and that they have heard it praised .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 77]: He wishes to draw no invidious comparisons ; he would be the last man to do it ; but when that Cannon Street establishment shall be able to produce such a combination of wit and beauty as has graced that board that day , and shall be able to serve up -LRB- all things considered -RRB- such a dinner as that of which they have just partaken , he will be happy to talk to it .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 12]: Until then , gentlemen , he will stick to Todgers 's .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 9]: More punch , more enthusiasm , more speeches .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 14]: Everybody 's health is drunk , saving the youngest gentleman 's in company .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 21]: He sits apart , with his elbow on the back of a vacant chair , and glares disdainfully at Jinkins .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 25]: Gander , in a convulsing speech , gives them the health of Bailey junior ; hiccups are heard ; and a glass is broken .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 12]: Mr Jinkins feels that it is time to join the ladies .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 11]: He proposes , as a final sentiment , Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 8]: She is worthy to be remembered separately .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 4]: Hear , hear .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 9]: So she is ; no doubt of it .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 24]: They all find fault with her at other times ; but every man feels now , that he could die in her defence .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 45]: They go upstairs , where they are not expected so soon ; for Mrs Todgers is asleep , Miss Charity is adjusting her hair , and Mercy , who has made a sofa of one of the window-seats is in a gracefully recumbent attitude .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 35]: She is rising hastily , when Mr Jinkins implores her , for all their sakes , not to stir ; she looks too graceful and too lovely , he remarks , to be disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 25]: She laughs , and yields , and fans herself , and drops her fan , and there is a rush to pick it up .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 55]: Being now installed , by one consent , as the beauty of the party , she is cruel and capricious , and sends gentlemen on messages to other gentlemen , and forgets all about them before they can return with the answer , and invents a thousand tortures , rending their hearts to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 8]: Bailey brings up the tea and coffee .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 23]: There is a small cluster of admirers round Charity ; but they are only those who can not get near her sister .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 34]: The youngest gentleman in company is pale , but collected , and still sits apart ; for his spirit loves to hold communion with itself , and his soul recoils from noisy revellers .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 10]: She has a consciousness of his presence and adoration .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 12]: He sees it flashing sometimes in the corner of her eye .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 15]: Have a care , Jinkins , ere you provoke a desperate man to frenzy !
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 20]: Mr Pecksniff had followed his younger friends upstairs , and taken a chair at the side of Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 34]: He had also spilt a cup of coffee over his legs without appearing to be aware of the circumstance ; nor did he seem to know that there was muffin on his knee .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 12]: ` And how have they used you downstairs , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 4]: asked the hostess .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 32]: ` Their conduct has been such , my dear madam , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` as I can never think of without emotion , or remember without a tear .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 6]: Oh , Mrs Todgers ! '
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 5]: ` My goodness ! '
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 4]: exclaimed that lady .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 13]: ` How low you are in your spirits , sir ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 31]: I am a man , my dear madam , ' said Mr Pecksniff , shedding tears and speaking with an imperfect articulation , ` but I am also a father .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 6]: I am also a widower .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 22]: My feelings , Mrs Todgers , will not consent to be entirely smothered , like the young children in the Tower .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 26]: They are grown up , and the more I press the bolster on them , the more they look round the corner of it . '
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 44]: He suddenly became conscious of the bit of muffin , and stared at it intently ; shaking his head the while , in a forlorn and imbecile manner , as if he regarded it as his evil genius , and mildly reproached it .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 26]: ` She was beautiful , Mrs Todgers , ' he said , turning his glazed eye again upon her , without the least preliminary notice .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 8]: ` She had a small property . '
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 14]: ` So I have heard , ' cried Mrs Todgers with great sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 21]: ` Those are her daughters , ' said Mr Pecksniff , pointing out the young ladies , with increased emotion .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 8]: Mrs Todgers had no doubt about it .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 15]: ` Mercy and Charity , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` Charity and Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 8]: Not unholy names , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 5]: ` Mr Pecksniff ! '
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 4]: cried Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 6]: ` What a ghastly smile !
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 7]: Are you ill , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 24]: He pressed his hand upon her arm , and answered in a solemn manner , and a faint voice , ` Chronic . '
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 4]: ` Cholic ? '
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 6]: cried the frightened Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 10]: ` Chron-ic , ' he repeated with some difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 3]: ` Chron-ic .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 4]: A chronic disorder .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 8]: I have been its victim from childhood .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 9]: It is carrying me to my grave . '
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 5]: ` Heaven forbid ! '
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 4]: cried Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 16]: ` Yes , it is , ' said Mr Pecksniff , reckless with despair . '
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 11]: I am rather glad of it , upon the whole .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 9]: You are like her , Mrs Todgers . '
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 13]: ` Do n't squeeze me so tight , pray , Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 10]: If any of the gentlemen should notice us . '
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 10]: ` For her sake , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 10]: ` Permit me -- in honour of her memory .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 10]: For the sake of a voice from the tomb .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 8]: You are VERY like her Mrs Todgers !
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 7]: What a world this is ! '
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 7]: Indeed you may say that ! '
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 4]: cried Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 21]: ` I 'm afraid it is a vain and thoughtless world , ' said Mr Pecksniff , overflowing with despondency .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 7]: ` These young people about us .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 8]: what sense have they of their responsibilities ?
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 2]: None .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 10]: Give me your other hand , Mrs Todgers . '
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 13]: The lady hesitated , and said ` she did n't like . '
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 11]: ` Has a voice from the grave no influence ? '
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 9]: said Mr Pecksniff , with , dismal tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 5]: ` This is irreligious !
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 5]: My dear creature . '
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 4]: urged Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 7]: ` Really you must n't . '
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 11]: ` It 's not me , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 19]: ` Do n't suppose it 's me ; it 's the voice ; it 's her voice . '
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 51]: Mrs Pecksniff deceased , must have had an unusually thick and husky voice for a lady , and rather a stuttering voice , and to say the truth somewhat of a drunken voice , if it had ever borne much resemblance to that in which Mr Pecksniff spoke just then .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 9]: But perhaps this was delusion on his part .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 22]: ` It has been a day of enjoyment , Mrs Todgers , but still it has been a day of torture .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 8]: It has reminded me of my loneliness .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 8]: What am I in the world ? '
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 13]: ` An excellent gentleman , Mr Pecksniff , ' said Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 13]: ` There is consolation in that too , ' cried Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 5]: ` Am I ? '
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 19]: ` There is no better man living , ' said Mrs Todgers , ' I am sure . '
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 13]: Mr Pecksniff smiled through his tears , and slightly shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 14]: ` You are very good , ' he said , ` thank you .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 17]: It is a great happiness to me , Mrs Todgers , to make young people happy .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 10]: The happiness of my pupils is my chief object .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 5]: I dote upon 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 9]: They dote upon me too -- sometimes . '
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 8]: ` Always , ' said Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 38]: ` When they say they have n't improved , ma'am , ' whispered Mr Pecksniff , looking at her with profound mystery , and motioning to her to advance her ear a little closer to his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 21]: ` When they say they have n't improved , ma'am , and the premium was too high , they lie !
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 29]: I should n't wish it to be mentioned ; you will understand me ; but I say to you as to an old friend , they lie . '
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 8]: ` Base wretches they must be ! '
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 4]: said Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 13]: ` Madam , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` you are right .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 7]: I respect you for that observation .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 6]: A word in your ear .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 5]: To Parents and Guardians .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 9]: This is in confidence , Mrs Todgers ? '
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 8]: ` The strictest , of course ! '
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 4]: cried that lady .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 11]: ` To Parents and Guardians , ' repeated Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 44]: ` An eligible opportunity now offers , which unites the advantages of the best practical architectural education with the comforts of a home , and the constant association with some , who , however humble their sphere and limited their capacity -- observe !
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 10]: -- are not unmindful of their moral responsibilities . '
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 56]: Mrs Todgers looked a little puzzled to know what this might mean , as well she might ; for it was , as the reader may perchance remember , Mr Pecksniff 's usual form of advertisement when he wanted a pupil ; and seemed to have no particular reference , at present , to anything .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 17]: But Mr Pecksniff held up his finger as a caution to her not to interrupt him .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 32]: ` Do you know any parent or guardian , Mrs Todgers , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` who desires to avail himself of such an opportunity for a young gentleman ?
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 6]: An orphan would be preferred .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 14]: Do you know of any orphan with three or four hundred pound ? '
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 9]: Mrs Todgers reflected , and shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 41]: ` When you hear of an orphan with three or four hundred pound , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` let that dear orphan 's friends apply , by letter post-paid , to S. P. , Post Office , Salisbury .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 9]: I do n't know who he is exactly .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 23]: Do n't be alarmed , Mrs Todgers , ' said Mr Pecksniff , falling heavily against her ; ` Chronic -- chronic !
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 12]: Let 's have a little drop of something to drink . '
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 9]: ` Bless my life , Miss Pecksniffs ! '
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 16]: cried Mrs Todgers , aloud , ` your dear pa 's took very poorly ! '
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 33]: Mr Pecksniff straightened himself by a surprising effort , as every one turned hastily towards him ; and standing on his feet , regarded the assembly with a look of ineffable wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 22]: Gradually it gave place to a smile ; a feeble , helpless , melancholy smile ; bland , almost to sickliness .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 15]: ` Do not repine , my friends , ' said Mr Pecksniff , tenderly .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 7]: ` Do not weep for me .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 5]: It is chronic . '
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 22]: And with these words , after making a futile attempt to pull off his shoes , he fell into the fireplace .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 12]: The youngest gentleman in company had him out in a second .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 21]: Yes , before a hair upon his head was singed , he had him on the hearth-rug -- her father !
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 6]: She was almost beside herself .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 5]: So was her sister .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 5]: Jinkins consoled them both .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 5]: They all consoled them .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 38]: Everybody had something to say , except the youngest gentleman in company , who with a noble self-devotion did the heavy work , and held up Mr Pecksniff 's head without being taken notice of by anybody .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 15]: At last they gathered round , and agreed to carry him upstairs to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 16]: The youngest gentleman in company was rebuked by Jinkins for tearing Mr Pecksniff 's coat !
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 4]: Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 4]: But no matter .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 14]: They carried him upstairs , and crushed the youngest gentleman at every step .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 27]: His bedroom was at the top of the house , and it was a long way ; but they got him there in course of time .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 16]: He asked them frequently on the road for a little drop of something to drink .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 5]: It seemed an idiosyncrasy .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 11]: The youngest gentleman in company proposed a draught of water .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 10]: Mr Pecksniff called him opprobious names for the suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 37]: Jinkins and Gander took the rest upon themselves , and made him as comfortable as they could , on the outside of his bed ; and when he seemed disposed to sleep , they left him .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 30]: But before they had all gained the bottom of the staircase , a vision of Mr Pecksniff , strangely attired , was seen to flutter on the top landing .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 17]: He desired to collect their sentiments , it seemed , upon the nature of human life .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 26]: ` My friends , ' cried Mr Pecksniff , looking over the banisters , ` let us improve our minds by mutual inquiry and discussion .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 5]: Let us be moral .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 5]: Let us contemplate existence .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 5]: Where is Jinkins ? '
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 8]: ` Here , ' cried that gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 11]: ` Go to bed again ' ` To bed ! '
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 4]: said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 3]: ` Bed !
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 25]: 'T is the voice of the sluggard , I hear him complain , you have woke me too soon , I must slumber again .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 25]: If any young orphan will repeat the remainder of that simple piece from Doctor Watts 's collection , an eligible opportunity now offers . '
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 3]: Nobody volunteered .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 15]: ` This is very soothing , ' said Mr Pecksniff , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 4]: ` Extremely so .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 9]: Cool and refreshing ; particularly to the legs !
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 15]: The legs of the human subject , my friends , are a beautiful production .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 21]: Compare them with wooden legs , and observe the difference between the anatomy of nature and the anatomy of art .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 53]: Do you know , ' said Mr Pecksniff , leaning over the banisters , with an odd recollection of his familiar manner among new pupils at home , ` that I should very much like to see Mrs Todgers 's notion of a wooden leg , if perfectly agreeable to herself ! '
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 32]: As it appeared impossible to entertain any reasonable hopes of him after this speech , Mr Jinkins and Mr Gander went upstairs again , and once more got him into bed .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 37]: But they had not descended to the second floor before he was out again ; nor , when they had repeated the process , had they descended the first flight , before he was out again .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 56]: In a word , as often as he was shut up in his own room , he darted out afresh , charged with some new moral sentiment , which he continually repeated over the banisters , with extraordinary relish , and an irrepressible desire for the improvement of his fellow creatures that nothing could subdue .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 40]: Under these circumstances , when they had got him into bed for the thirtieth time or so , Mr Jinkins held him , while his companion went downstairs in search of Bailey junior , with whom he presently returned .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 46]: That youth having been apprised of the service required of him , was in great spirits , and brought up a stool , a candle , and his supper ; to the end that he might keep watch outside the bedroom door with tolerable comfort .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 59]: When he had completed his arrangements , they locked Mr Pecksniff in , and left the key on the outside ; charging the young page to listen attentively for symptoms of an apoplectic nature , with which the patient might be troubled , and , in case of any such presenting themselves , to summon them without delay .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 35]: To which Mr Bailey modestly replied that ` he hoped he knowed wot o'clock it wos in gineral , and did n't date his letters to his friends from Todgers 's for nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 33]: CHAPTER TEN CONTAINING STRANGE MATTER , ON WHICH MANY EVENTS IN THIS HISTORY MAY , FOR THEIR GOOD OR EVIL INFLUENCE , CHIEFLY DEPEND But Mr Pecksniff came to town on business .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 5]: Had he forgotten that ?
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 28]: Was he always taking his pleasure with Todgers 's jovial brood , unmindful of the serious demands , whatever they might be , upon his calm consideration ?
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 13]: Time and tide will wait for no man , saith the adage .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 11]: But all men have to wait for time and tide .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 29]: That tide which , taken at the flood , would lead Seth Pecksniff on to fortune , was marked down in the table , and about to flow .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 53]: No idle Pecksniff lingered far inland , unmindful of the changes of the stream ; but there , upon the water 's edge , over his shoes already , stood the worthy creature , prepared to wallow in the very mud , so that it slid towards the quarter of his hope .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 11]: The trustfulness of his two fair daughters was beautiful indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 32]: They had that firm reliance on their parent 's nature , which taught them to feel certain that in all he did he had his purpose straight and full before him .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 20]: And that its noble end and object was himself , which almost of necessity included them , they knew .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 8]: The devotion of these maids was perfect .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 26]: Their filial confidence was rendered the more touching , by their having no knowledge of their parent 's real designs , in the present instance .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 29]: All that they knew of his proceedings was , that every morning , after the early breakfast , he repaired to the post office and inquired for letters .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 30]: That task performed , his business for the day was over ; and he again relaxed , until the rising of another sun proclaimed the advent of another post .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 9]: This went on for four or five days .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 48]: At length , one morning , Mr Pecksniff returned with a breathless rapidity , strange to observe in him , at other times so calm ; and , seeking immediate speech with his daughters , shut himself up with them in private conference for two whole hours .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 52]: Of all that passed in this period , only the following words of Mr Pecksniff 's utterance are known : ` How he has come to change so very much -LRB- if it should turn out as I expect , that he has -RRB- , we need n't stop to inquire .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 18]: My dears , I have my thoughts upon the subject , but I will not impart them .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 15]: It is enough that we will not be proud , resentful , or unforgiving .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 10]: If he wants our friendship he shall have it .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 9]: We know our duty , I hope ! '
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 40]: That same day at noon , an old gentleman alighted from a hackney-coach at the post-office , and , giving his name , inquired for a letter addressed to himself , and directed to be left till called for .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 8]: It had been lying there some days .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 19]: The superscription was in Mr Pecksniff 's hand , and it was sealed with Mr Pecksniff 's seal .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 32]: It was very short , containing indeed nothing more than an address ` with Mr Pecksniff 's respectful , and -LRB- not withstanding what has passed -RRB- sincerely affectionate regards . '
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 35]: The old gentleman tore off the direction -- scattering the rest in fragments to the winds -- and giving it to the coachman , bade him drive as near that place as he could .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 28]: In pursuance of these instructions he was driven to the Monument ; where he again alighted , and dismissed the vehicle , and walked towards Todgers 's .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 111]: Though the face , and form , and gait of this old man , and even his grip of the stout stick on which he leaned , were all expressive of a resolution not easily shaken , and a purpose -LRB- it matters little whether right or wrong , just now -RRB- such as in other days might have survived the rack , and had its strongest life in weakest death ; still there were grains of hesitation in his mind , which made him now avoid the house he sought , and loiter to and fro in a gleam of sunlight , that brightened the little churchyard hard by .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 66]: There may have been , in the presence of those idle heaps of dust among the busiest stir of life , something to increase his wavering ; but there he walked , awakening the echoes as he paced up and down , until the church clock , striking the quarters for the second time since he had been there , roused him from his meditation .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 28]: Shaking off his incertitude as the air parted with the sound of the bells , he walked rapidly to the house , and knocked at the door .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 32]: Mr Pecksniff was seated in the landlady 's little room , and his visitor found him reading -- by an accident ; he apologised for it -- an excellent theological work .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 20]: There were cake and wine upon a little table -- by another accident , for which he also apologised .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 31]: Indeed he said , he had given his visitor up , and was about to partake of that simple refreshment with his children , when he knocked at the door .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 7]: ` Your daughters are well ? '
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 11]: said old Martin , laying down his hat and stick .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 18]: Mr Pecksniff endeavoured to conceal his agitation as a father when he answered Yes , they were .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 11]: They were good girls , he said , very good .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 24]: He would not venture to recommend Mr Chuzzlewit to take the easy-chair , or to keep out of the draught from the door .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 20]: If he made any such suggestion , he would expose himself , he feared , to most unjust suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 28]: He would , therefore , content himself with remarking that there was an easy-chair in the room , and that the door was far from being air-tight .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 22]: This latter imperfection , he might perhaps venture to add , was not uncommonly to be met with in old houses .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 52]: The old man sat down in the easy-chair , and after a few moments ' silence , said : ` In the first place , let me thank you for coming to London so promptly , at my almost unexplained request ; I need scarcely add , at my cost . '
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 10]: ` At YOUR cost , my good sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 11]: cried Mr Pecksniff , in a tone of great surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 23]: ` It is not , ' said Martin , waving his hand impatiently , ` my habit to put my -- well !
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 13]: my relatives -- to any personal expense to gratify my caprices . '
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 8]: ` Caprices , my good sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 22]: cried Mr Pecksniff ` That is scarcely the proper word either , in this instance , ' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 5]: You are right . '
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 20]: Mr Pecksniff was inwardly very much relieved to hear it , though he did n't at all know why .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 9]: ` You are right , ' repeated Martin .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 7]: ` It is not a caprice .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 13]: It is built up on reason , proof , and cool comparison .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 4]: Caprices never are .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 9]: Moreover , I am not a capricious man .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 5]: I never was . '
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 10]: ` Most assuredly not , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 7]: ` How do you know ? '
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 5]: returned the other quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 10]: ` You are to begin to know it now .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 13]: You are to test and prove it , in time to come .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 22]: You and yours are to find that I can be constant , and am not to be diverted from my end .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 5]: Do you hear ? '
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 9]: ` Perfectly , ' said Mr Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 49]: I very much regret , ' Martin resumed , looking steadily at him , and speaking in a slow and measured tone ; ' I very much regret that you and I held such a conversation together , as that which passed between us at our last meeting .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 24]: I very much regret that I laid open to you what were then my thoughts of you , so freely as I did .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 42]: The intentions that I bear towards you now are of another kind ; deserted by all in whom I have ever trusted ; hoodwinked and beset by all who should help and sustain me ; I fly to you for refuge .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 69]: I confide in you to be my ally ; to attach yourself to me by ties of Interest and Expectation ' -- he laid great stress upon these words , though Mr Pecksniff particularly begged him not to mention it ; ` and to help me to visit the consequences of the very worst species of meanness , dissimulation , and subtlety , on the right heads . '
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 6]: ` My noble sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 10]: cried Mr Pecksniff , catching at his outstretched hand .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 12]: ` And YOU regret the having harboured unjust thoughts of me !
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 7]: YOU with those grey hairs ! '
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 35]: ` Regrets , ' said Martin , ` are the natural property of grey hairs ; and I enjoy , in common with all other men , at least my share of such inheritance .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 6]: And so enough of that .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 10]: I regret having been severed from you so long .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 25]: If I had known you sooner , and sooner used you as you well deserve , I might have been a happier man . '
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 15]: Mr Pecksniff looked up to the ceiling , and clasped his hands in rapture .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 14]: ` Your daughters , ' said Martin , after a short silence . '
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 6]: I do n't know them .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 6]: Are they like you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 38]: ` In the nose of my eldest and the chin of my youngest , Mr Chuzzlewit , ' returned the widower , ` their sainted parent -LRB- not myself , their mother -RRB- lives again . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 13]: I do n't mean in person , ' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 7]: ` Morally , morally . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 17]: Tis not for me to say , ' retorted Mr Pecksniff with a gentle smile . '
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 10]: I have done my best , sir . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 19]: I could wish to see them , ' said Martin ; ` are they near at hand ? '
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 30]: They were , very near ; for they had in fact been listening at the door from the beginning of this conversation until now , when they precipitately retired .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 42]: Having wiped the signs of weakness from his eyes , and so given them time to get upstairs , Mr Pecksniff opened the door , and mildly cried in the passage , ` My own darlings , where are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 8]: ` Here , my dear pa ! '
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 7]: replied the distant voice of Charity .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 29]: ` Come down into the back parlour , if you please , my love , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` and bring your sister with you . '
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 27]: ` Yes , my dear pa , ' cried Merry ; and down they came directly -LRB- being all obedience -RRB- , singing as they came .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 20]: Nothing could exceed the astonishment of the two Miss Pecksniffs when they found a stranger with their dear papa .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 18]: Nothing could surpass their mute amazement when he said , ` My children , Mr Chuzzlewit ! '
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 46]: But when he told them that Mr Chuzzlewit and he were friends , and that Mr Chuzzlewit had said such kind and tender words as pierced his very heart , the two Miss Pecksniffs cried with one accord , ` Thank Heaven for this ! '
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 9]: and fell upon the old man 's neck .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 74]: And when they had embraced him with such fervour of affection that no words can describe it , they grouped themselves about his chair , and hung over him , as figuring to themselves no earthly joy like that of ministering to his wants , and crowding into the remainder of his life , the love they would have diffused over their whole existence , from infancy , if he -- dear obdurate !
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 10]: -- had but consented to receive the precious offering .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 20]: The old man looked attentively from one to the other , and then at Mr Pecksniff , several times .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 64]: ` What , ' he asked of Mr Pecksniff , happening to catch his eye in its descent ; for until now it had been piously upraised , with something of that expression which the poetry of ages has attributed to a domestic bird , when breathing its last amid the ravages of an electric storm : ` What are their names ? '
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 47]: Mr Pecksniff told him , and added , rather hastily ; his caluminators would have said , with a view to any testamentary thoughts that might be flitting through old Martin 's mind ; ` Perhaps , my dears , you had better write them down .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 17]: Your humble autographs are of no value in themselves , but affection may prize them . '
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 18]: ` Affection , ' said the old man , ` will expend itself on the living originals .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 28]: Do not trouble yourselves , my girls , I shall not so easily forget you , Charity and Mercy , as to need such tokens of remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 3]: Cousin ! '
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 4]: ` Sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 7]: said Mr Pecksniff , with alacrity .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 8]: ` Do you never sit down ? '
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 22]: ` Why -- yes -- occasionally , sir , ' said Mr Pecksniff , who had been standing all this time .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 8]: ` Will you do so now ? '
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 28]: ` Can you ask me , ' returned Mr Pecksniff , slipping into a chair immediately , ` whether I will do anything that you desire ? '
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 30]: ` You talk confidently , ' said Martin , ` and you mean well ; but I fear you do n't know what an old man 's humours are .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 52]: You do n't know what it is to be required to court his likings and dislikings ; to adapt yourself to his prejudices ; to do his bidding , be it what it may ; to bear with his distrusts and jealousies ; and always still be zealous in his service .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 38]: When I remember how numerous these failings are in me , and judge of their occasional enormity by the injurious thoughts I lately entertained of you , I hardly dare to claim you for my friend . '
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 21]: ` My worthy sir , ' returned his relative , ` how CAN you talk in such a painful strain !
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 50]: What was more natural than that you should make one slight mistake , when in all other respects you were so very correct , and have had such reason -- such very sad and undeniable reason -- to judge of every one about you in the worst light ! '
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 8]: ` True , ' replied the other .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 9]: ` You are very lenient with me . '
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 45]: ` We always said , my girls and I , ' cried Mr Pecksniff with increasing obsequiousness , ` that while we mourned the heaviness of our misfortune in being confounded with the base and mercenary , still we could not wonder at it .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 7]: My dears , you remember ? '
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 3]: Oh vividly !
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 4]: A thousand times !
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 11]: ` We uttered no complaint , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 29]: ` Occasionally we had the presumption to console ourselves with the remark that Truth would in the end prevail , and Virtue be triumphant ; but not often .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 7]: My loves , you recollect ? '
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 2]: Recollect !
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 5]: Could he doubt it !
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 8]: Dearest pa , what strange unnecessary questions !
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 52]: ` And when I saw you , ' resumed Mr Pecksniff , with still greater deference , ` in the little , unassuming village where we take the liberty of dwelling , I said you were mistaken in me , my dear sir ; that was all , I think ? '
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 54]: ` No -- not all , ' said Martin , who had been sitting with his hand upon his brow for some time past , and now looked up again ; ` you said much more , which , added to other circumstances that have come to my knowledge , opened my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 17]: You spoke to me , disinterestedly , on behalf of -- I need n't name him .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 7]: You know whom I mean . '
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 35]: Trouble was expressed in Mr Pecksniff 's visage , as he pressed his hot hands together , and replied , with humility , ` Quite disinterestedly , sir , I assure you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 15]: I know it , ' said old Martin , in his quiet way . '
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 6]: I am sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 4]: I said so .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 53]: It was disinterested too , in you , to draw that herd of harpies off from me , and be their victim yourself ; most other men would have suffered them to display themselves in all their rapacity , and would have striven to rise , by contrast , in my estimation .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 18]: You felt for me , and drew them off , for which I owe you many thanks .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 18]: Although I left the place , I know what passed behind my back , you see ! '
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 8]: ` You amaze me , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 9]: cried Mr Pecksniff ; which was true enough .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 19]: ` My knowledge of your proceedings , ' said the old man , does not stop at this .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 10]: You have a new inmate in your house . '
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 15]: ` Yes , sir , ' rejoined the architect , ' I have . '
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 9]: ` He must quit it ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 7]: ` For -- for yours ? '
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 9]: asked Mr Pecksniff , with a quavering mildness .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 14]: ` For any shelter he can find , ' the old man answered .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 8]: ` He has deceived you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 11]: I hope not ' said Mr Pecksniff , eagerly . '
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 4]: I trust not .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 11]: I have been extremely well disposed towards that young man .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 17]: I hope it can not be shown that he has forfeited all claim to my protection .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 13]: Deceit -- deceit , my dear Mr Chuzzlewit , would be final .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 17]: I should hold myself bound , on proof of deceit , to renounce him instantly . '
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 41]: The old man glanced at both his fair supporters , but especially at Miss Mercy , whom , indeed , he looked full in the face , with a greater demonstration of interest than had yet appeared in his features .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 27]: His gaze again encountered Mr Pecksniff , as he said , composedly : ` Of course you know that he has made his matrimonial choice ? '
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 5]: ` Oh dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 21]: cried Mr Pecksniff , rubbing his hair up very stiff upon his head , and staring wildly at his daughters .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 7]: ` This is becoming tremendous ! '
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 7]: ` You know the fact ? '
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 17]: repeated Martin ` Surely not without his grandfather 's consent and approbation my dear sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 4]: cried Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 7]: ` Do n't tell me that .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 19]: For the honour of human nature , say you 're not about to tell me that ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 13]: I thought he had suppressed it , ' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 24]: The indignation felt by Mr Pecksniff at this terrible disclosure , was only to be equalled by the kindling anger of his daughters .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 47]: Had they taken to their hearth and home a secretly contracted serpent ; a crocodile , who had made a furtive offer of his hand ; an imposition on society ; a bankrupt bachelor with no effects , trading with the spinster world on false pretences !
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 48]: And oh , to think that he should have disobeyed and practised on that sweet , that venerable gentleman , whose name he bore ; that kind and tender guardian ; his more than father -- to say nothing at all of mother -- horrible , horrible !
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 13]: To turn him out with ignominy would be treatment much too good .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 11]: Was there nothing else that could be done to him ?
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 9]: Had he incurred no legal pains and penalties ?
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 22]: Could it be that the statutes of the land were so remiss as to have affixed no punishment to such delinquency ?
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 10]: Monster ; how basely had they been deceived ! '
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 29]: I am glad to find you second me so warmly , ' said the old man holding up his hand to stay the torrent of their wrath . '
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 19]: I will not deny that it is a pleasure to me to find you so full of zeal .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 10]: We will consider that topic as disposed of . '
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 29]: ` No , my dear sir , ' cried Mr Pecksniff , ` not as disposed of , until I have purged my house of this pollution . '
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 17]: ` That will follow , ' said the old man , ` in its own time .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 8]: I look upon that as done . '
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 17]: ` You are very good , sir , ' answered Mr Pecksniff , shaking his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 6]: ` You do me honour .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 13]: You MAY look upon it as done , I assure you . '
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 20]: ` There is another topic , ' said Martin , ` on which I hope you will assist me .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 7]: You remember Mary , cousin ? '
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 26]: ` The young lady that I mentioned to you , my dears , as having interested me so very much , ' remarked Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 10]: ` Excuse my interrupting you , sir . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 7]: I told you her history ? '
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 5]: said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 18]: ` Which I also mentioned , you will recollect , my dears , ' cried Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 16]: ` Silly girls , Mr Chuzzlewit -- quite moved by it , they were ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 7]: ` Why , look now ! '
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 31]: said Martin , evidently pleased ; ' I feared I should have had to urge her case upon you , and ask you to regard her favourably for my sake .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 8]: But I find you have no jealousies !
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 11]: You have no cause for any , to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 17]: She has nothing to gain from me , my dears , and she knows it . '
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 21]: The two Miss Pecksniffs murmured their approval of this wise arrangement , and their cordial sympathy with its interesting object .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 33]: ` If I could have anticipated what has come to pass between us four , ' said the old man thoughfully ; ` but it is too late to think of that .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 20]: You would receive her courteously , young ladies , and be kind to her , if need were ? '
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 18]: Where was the orphan whom the two Miss Pecksniffs would not have cherished in their sisterly bosom !
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 35]: But when that orphan was commended to their care by one on whom the dammed-up love of years was gushing forth , what exhaustless stores of pure affection yearned to expend themselves upon her !
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 54]: An interval ensued , during which Mr Chuzzlewit , in an absent frame of mind , sat gazing at the ground , without uttering a word ; and as it was plain that he had no desire to be interrupted in his meditations , Mr Pecksniff and his daughters were profoundly silent also .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 34]: During the whole of the foregoing dialogue , he had borne his part with a cold , passionless promptitude , as though he had learned and painfully rehearsed it all a hundred times .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 24]: Even when his expressions were warmest and his language most encouraging , he had retained the same manner , without the least abatement .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 38]: But now there was a keener brightness in his eye , and more expression in his voice , as he said , awakening from his thoughtful mood : ` You know what will be said of this ?
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 5]: Have you reflected ? '
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 10]: ` Said of what , my dear sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 4]: Mr Pecksniff asked .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 9]: ` Of this new understanding between us . '
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 40]: Mr Pecksniff looked benevolently sagacious , and at the same time far above all earthly misconstruction , as he shook his head , and observed that a great many things would be said of it , no doubt . '
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 10]: A great many , ' rejoined the old man .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 32]: ` Some will say that I dote in my old age ; that illness has shaken me ; that I have lost all strength of mind , and have grown childish .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 6]: You can bear that ? '
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 25]: Mr Pecksniff answered that it would be dreadfully hard to bear , but he thought he could , if he made a great effort .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 63]: ` Others will say -- I speak of disappointed , angry people only -- that you have lied and fawned , and wormed yourself through dirty ways into my favour ; by such concessions and such crooked deeds , such meannesses and vile endurances , as nothing could repay ; no , not the legacy of half the world we live in .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 6]: You can bear that ? '
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 28]: Mr Pecksniff made reply that this would be also very hard to bear , as reflecting , in some degree , on the discernment of Mr Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 27]: Still he had a modest confidence that he could sustain the calumny , with the help of a good conscience , and that gentleman 's friendship .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 73]: ` With the great mass of slanderers , ' said old Martin , leaning back in his chair , ` the tale , as I clearly foresee , will run thus : That to mark my contempt for the rabble whom I despised , I chose from among them the very worst , and made him do my will , and pampered and enriched him at the cost of all the rest .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 99]: That , after casting about for the means of a punishment which should rankle in the bosoms of these kites the most , and strike into their gall , I devised this scheme at a time when the last link in the chain of grateful love and duty , that held me to my race , was roughly snapped asunder ; roughly , for I loved him well ; roughly , for I had ever put my trust in his affection ; roughly , for that he broke it when I loved him most -- God help me !
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 18]: -- and he without a pang could throw me off , while I clung about his heart !
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 32]: Now , ' said the old man , dismissing this passionate outburst as suddenly as he had yielded to it , ` is your mind made up to bear this likewise ?
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 21]: Lay your account with having it to bear , and put no trust in being set right by me . '
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 117]: ` My dear Mr Chuzzlewit , ' cried Pecksniff in an ecstasy , ` for such a man as you have shown yourself to be this day ; for a man so injured , yet so very humane ; for a man so -- I am at a loss what precise term to use -- yet at the same time so remarkably -- I do n't know how to express my meaning ; for such a man as I have described , I hope it is no presumption to say that I , and I am sure I may add my children also -LRB- my dears , we perfectly agree in this , I think ? -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 7]: , would bear anything whatever ! '
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 7]: ` Enough , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 9]: ` You can charge no consequences on me .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 7]: When do you retire home ? '
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 9]: ` Whenever you please , my dear sir .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 8]: To-night if you desire it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 15]: I desire nothing , ' returned the old man , ` that is unreasonable .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 6]: Such a request would be .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 14]: Will you be ready to return at the end of this week ? '
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 25]: The very time of all others that Mr Pecksniff would have suggested if it had been left to him to make his own choice .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 27]: As to his daughters -- the words , ` Let us be at home on Saturday , dear pa , ' were actually upon their lips .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 27]: ` Your expenses , cousin , ' said Martin , taking a folded slip of paper from his pocketbook , ` may possibly exceed that amount .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 18]: If so , let me know the balance that I owe you , when we next meet .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 22]: It would be useless if I told you where I live just now ; indeed , I have no fixed abode .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 9]: When I have , you shall know it .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 27]: You and your daughters may expect to see me before long ; in the meantime I need not tell you that we keep our own confidence .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 13]: What you will do when you get home is understood between us .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 19]: Give me no account of it at any time ; and never refer to it in any way .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 7]: I ask that as a favour .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 26]: I am commonly a man of few words , cousin ; and all that need be said just now is said , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 14]: ` One glass of wine -- one morsel of this homely cake ? '
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 9]: cried Mr Pecksniff , venturing to detain him .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 6]: ` My dears -- ! '
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 8]: The sisters flew to wait upon him .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 5]: ` Poor girls ! '
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 4]: said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 11]: ` You will excuse their agitation , my dear sir .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 7]: They are made up of feeling .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 13]: A bad commodity to go through the world with , Mr Chuzzlewit !
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 21]: My youngest daughter is almost as much of a woman as my eldest , is she not , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 7]: ` Which IS the youngest ? '
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 5]: asked the old man .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 12]: ` Mercy , by five years , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 14]: ` We sometimes venture to consider her rather a fine figure , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 20]: Speaking as an artist , I may perhaps be permitted to suggest that its outline is graceful and correct .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 52]: I am naturally , ' said Mr Pecksniff , drying his hands upon his handkerchief , and looking anxiously in his cousin 's face at almost every word , ` proud , if I may use the expression , to have a daughter who is constructed on the best models . '
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 13]: ` She seems to have a lively disposition , ' observed Martin .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 4]: said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 6]: ` That is quite remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 22]: You have defined her character , my dear sir , as correctly as if you had known her from her birth .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 6]: She HAS a lively disposition .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 19]: I assure you , my dear sir , that in our unpretending home her gaiety is delightful . '
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 10]: ` No doubt , ' returned the old man .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 42]: ` Charity , upon the other hand , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` is remarkable for strong sense , and for rather a deep tone of sentiment , if the partiality of a father may be excused in saying so .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 10]: A wonderful affection between them , my dear sir !
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 7]: Allow me to drink your health .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 5]: Bless you ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 26]: I little thought , ' retorted Martin , ` but a month ago , that I should be breaking bread and pouring wine with you .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 6]: I drink to you . '
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 22]: Not at all abashed by the extraordinary abruptness with which these latter words were spoken , Mr Pecksniff thanked him devoutly .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 24]: ` Now let me go , ' said Martin , putting down the wine when he had merely touched it with his lips .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 8]: ` My dears , good morning ! '
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 74]: But this distant form of farewell was by no means tender enough for the yearnings of the young ladies , who again embraced him with all their hearts -- with all their arms at any rate -- to which parting caresses their new-found friend submitted with a better grace than might have been expected from one who , not a moment before , had pledged their parent in such a very uncomfortable manner .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 58]: These endearments terminated , he took a hasty leave of Mr Pecksniff and withdrew , followed to the door by both father and daughters , who stood there kissing their hands and beaming with affection until he disappeared ; though , by the way , he never once looked back , after he had crossed the threshold .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 52]: When they returned into the house , and were again alone in Mrs Todgers 's room , the two young ladies exhibited an unusual amount of gaiety ; insomuch that they clapped their hands , and laughed , and looked with roguish aspects and a bantering air upon their dear papa .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 44]: This conduct was so very unaccountable , that Mr Pecksniff -LRB- being singularly grave himself -RRB- could scarcely choose but ask them what it meant ; and took them to task , in his gentle manner , for yielding to such light emotions .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 29]: ` If it was possible to divine any cause for this merriment , even the most remote , ' he said , ' I should not reprove you .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 15]: But when you can have none whatever -- oh , really , really ! '
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 68]: This admonition had so little effect on Mercy , that she was obliged to hold her handkerchief before her rosy lips , and to throw herself back in her chair , with every demonstration of extreme amusement ; which want of duty so offended Mr Pecksniff that he reproved her in set terms , and gave her his parental advice to correct herself in solitude and contemplation .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 36]: But at that juncture they were disturbed by the sound of voices in dispute ; and as it proceeded from the next room , the subject matter of the altercation quickly reached their ears . '
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 6]: I do n't care that !
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 44]: Mrs Todgers , ' said the young gentleman who had been the youngest gentleman in company on the day of the festival ; ' I do n't care THAT , ma'am , ' said he , snapping his fingers , ` for Jinkins .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 8]: Do n't suppose I do . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 15]: I am quite certain you do n't , sir , ' replied Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 16]: ` You have too independent a spirit , I know , to yield to anybody .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 4]: And quite right .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 13]: There is no reason why you should give way to any gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 10]: Everybody must be well aware of that . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 32]: I should think no more of admitting daylight into the fellow , ' said the youngest gentleman , in a desperate voice , ` than if he was a bulldog . '
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 50]: Mrs Todgers did not stop to inquire whether , as a matter of principle , there was any particular reason for admitting daylight even into a bulldog , otherwise than by the natural channel of his eyes , but she seemed to wring her hands , and she moaned .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 13]: ` Let him be careful , ' said the youngest gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 5]: I give him warning .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 13]: No man shall step between me and the current of my vengeance .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 44]: I know a Cove -- ' he used that familiar epithet in his agitation but corrected himself by adding , ' a gentleman of property , I mean -- who practices with a pair of pistols -LRB- fellows too -RRB- of his own .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 24]: If I am driven to borrow 'em , and to send at friend to Jinkins , a tragedy will get into the papers .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 5]: That 's all . '
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 6]: Again Mrs Todgers moaned . '
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 29]: I have borne this long enough , ' said the youngest gentleman but now my soul rebels against it , and I wo n't stand it any longer .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 35]: I left home originally , because I had that within me which would n't be domineered over by a sister ; and do you think I 'm going to be put down by HIM ?
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 3]: No . '
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 35]: ` It is very wrong in Mr Jinkins ; I know it is perfectly inexcusable in Mr Jinkins , if he intends it , ' observed Mrs Todgers ` If he intends it ! '
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 5]: cried the youngest gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 12]: ` Do n't he interrupt and contradict me on every occasion ?
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 23]: Does he ever fail to interpose himself between me and anything or anybody that he sees I have set my mind upon ?
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 20]: Does he make a point of always pretending to forget me , when he 's pouring out the beer ?
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 26]: Does he make bragging remarks about his razors , and insulting allusions to people who have no necessity to shave more than once a week ?
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 6]: But let him look out !
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 19]: He 'll find himself shaved , pretty close , before long , and so I tell him . '
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 25]: The young gentleman was mistaken in this closing sentence , inasmuch as he never told it to Jinkins , but always to Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 18]: ` However , ' he said , ` these are not proper subjects for ladies ' ears .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 22]: All I 've got to say to you , Mrs Todgers , is , a week 's notice from next Saturday .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 13]: The same house ca n't contain that miscreant and me any longer .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 17]: If we get over the intermediate time without bloodshed , you may think yourself pretty fortunate .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 9]: I do n't myself expect we shall . '
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 6]: ` Dear , dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 15]: cried Mrs Todgers , ` what would I have given to have prevented this ?
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 15]: To lose you , sir , would be like losing the house 's right-hand .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 20]: So popular as you are among the gentlemen ; so generally looked up to ; and so much liked !
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 21]: I do hope you 'll think better of it ; if on nobody else 's account , on mine . '
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 13]: ` There 's Jinkins , ' said the youngest gentleman , moodily .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 4]: ` Your favourite .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 19]: He 'll console you , and the gentlemen too , for the loss of twenty such as me .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 8]: I 'm not understood in this house .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 6]: I never have been . '
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 12]: ` Do n't run away with that opinion , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 11]: cried Mrs Todgers , with a show of honest indignation .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 19]: ` Do n't make such a charge as that against the establishment , I must beg of you .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 12]: It is not so bad as that comes to , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 26]: Make any remark you please against the gentlemen , or against me ; but do n't say you 're not understood in this house . '
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 16]: ` I 'm not treated as if I was , ' said the youngest gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 20]: ` There you make a great mistake , sir , ' returned Mrs Todgers , in the same strain .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 17]: ` As many of the gentlemen and I have often said , you are too sensitive .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 6]: That 's where it is .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 15]: You are of too susceptible a nature ; it 's in your spirit . '
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 5]: The young gentleman coughed .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 40]: ` And as , ' said Mrs Todgers , ` as to Mr Jinkins , I must beg of you , if we ARE to part , to understand that I do n't abet Mr Jinkins by any means .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 4]: Far from it .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 44]: I could wish that Mr Jinkins would take a lower tone in this establishment , and would not be the means of raising differences between me and gentlemen that I can much less bear to part with than I could with Mr Jinkins .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 29]: Mr Jinkins is not such a boarder , sir , ' added Mrs Todgers , ` that all considerations of private feeling and respect give way before him .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 9]: Quite the contrary , I assure you . '
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 71]: The young gentleman was so much mollified by these and similar speeches on the part of Mrs Todgers , that he and that lady gradually changed positions ; so that she became the injured party , and he was understood to be the injurer ; but in a complimentary , not in an offensive sense ; his cruel conduct being attributable to his exalted nature , and to that alone .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 32]: So , in the end , the young gentleman withdrew his notice , and assured Mrs Todgers of his unalterable regard ; and having done so , went back to business .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 8]: ` Goodness me , Miss Pecksniffs ! '
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 46]: cried that lady , as she came into the back room , and sat wearily down , with her basket on her knees , and her hands folded upon it , ` what a trial of temper it is to keep a house like this !
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 11]: You must have heard most of what has just passed .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 9]: Now did you ever hear the like ? '
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 4]: ` Never ! '
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 6]: said the two Miss Pecksniffs .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 29]: ` Of all the ridiculous young fellows that ever I had to deal with , ' resumed Mrs Todgers , ` that is the most ridiculous and unreasonable .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 17]: Mr Jinkins is hard upon him sometimes , but not half as hard as he deserves .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 22]: To mention such a gentleman as Mr Jinkins in the same breath with HIM -- you know it 's too much !
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 20]: And yet he 's as jealous of him , bless you , as if he was his equal . '
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 34]: The young ladies were greatly entertained by Mrs Todgers 's account , no less than with certain anecdotes illustrative of the youngest gentleman 's character , which she went on to tell them .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 46]: But Mr Pecksniff looked quite stern and angry ; and when she had concluded , said in a solemn voice : ` Pray , Mrs Todgers , if I may inquire , what does that young gentleman contribute towards the support of these premises ? '
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 19]: ` Why , sir , for what HE has , he pays about eighteen shillings a week ! '
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 4]: said Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 7]: ` Eighteen shillings a week ! '
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 4]: repeated Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 18]: ` Taking one week with another ; as near that as possible , ' said Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 20]: Mr Pecksniff rose from his chair , folded his arms , looked at her , and shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 53]: ` And do you mean to say , ma'am -- is it possible , Mrs Todgers -- that for such a miserable consideration as eighteen shillings a week , a female of your understanding can so far demean herself as to wear a double face , even for an instant ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 21]: I am forced to keep things on the square if I can , sir , ' faltered Mrs Todgers . '
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 19]: I must preserve peace among them , and keep my connection together , if possible , Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 7]: The profit is very small . '
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 5]: ` The profit ! '
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 11]: cried that gentleman , laying great stress upon the word .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 7]: ` The profit , Mrs Todgers !
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 5]: You amaze me ! '
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 11]: He was so severe , that Mrs Todgers shed tears .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 5]: ` The profit ! '
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 4]: repeated Mr pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 6]: ` The profit of dissimulation !
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 15]: To worship the golden calf of Baal , for eighteen shillings a week ! '
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 26]: ` Do n't in your own goodness be too hard upon me , Mr Pecksniff , ' cried Mrs Todgers , taking out her handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 7]: ` Oh Calf , Calf ! '
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 5]: cried Mr Pecksniff mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 7]: ` Oh , Baal , Baal !
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 7]: oh my friend , Mrs Todgers !
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 23]: To barter away that precious jewel , self-esteem , and cringe to any mortal creature -- for eighteen shillings a week ! '
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 36]: He was so subdued and overcome by the reflection , that he immediately took down his hat from its peg in the passage , and went out for a walk , to compose his feelings .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 37]: Anybody passing him in the street might have known him for a good man at first sight ; for his whole figure teemed with a consciousness of the moral homily he had read to Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 5]: Eighteen shillings a week !
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 11]: Just , most just , thy censure , upright Pecksniff !
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 74]: Had it been for the sake of a ribbon , star , or garter ; sleeves of lawn , a great man 's smile , a seat in parliament , a tap upon the shoulder from a courtly sword ; a place , a party , or a thriving lie , or eighteen thousand pounds , or even eighteen hundred ; -- but to worship the golden calf for eighteen shillings a week !
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 5]: oh pitiful , pitiful !
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 145]: CHAPTER ELEVEN WHEREIN A CERTAIN GENTLEMAN BECOMES PARTICULAR IN HIS ATTENTIONS TO A CERTAIN LADY ; AND MORE COMING EVENTS THAN ONE , CAST THEIR SHADOWS BEFORE The family were within two or three days of their departure from Mrs Todgers 's , and the commercial gentlemen were to a man despondent and not to be comforted , because of the approaching separation , when Bailey junior , at the jocund time of noon , presented himself before Miss Charity Pecksniff , then sitting with her sister in the banquet chamber , hemming six new pocket-handkerchiefs for Mr Jinkins ; and having expressed a hope , preliminary and pious , that he might be blest , gave her in his pleasant way to understand that a visitor attended to pay his respects to her , and was at that moment waiting in the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 71]: Perhaps this last announcement showed in a more striking point of view than many lengthened speeches could have done , the trustfulness and faith of Bailey 's nature ; since he had , in fact , last seen the visitor on the door-mat , where , after signifying to him that he would do well to go upstairs , he had left him to the guidance of his own sagacity .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 66]: Hence it was at least an even chance that the visitor was then wandering on the roof of the house , or vainly seeking to extricate himself from the maze of bedrooms ; Todgers 's being precisely that kind of establishment in which an unpiloted stranger is pretty sure to find himself in some place where he least expects and least desires to be . '
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 6]: A gentleman for me ! '
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 15]: cried Charity , pausing in her work ; ` my gracious , Bailey ! '
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 3]: said Bailey .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 10]: ` It IS my gracious , a n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 14]: Would n't I be gracious neither , not if I wos him ! '
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 65]: The remark was rendered somewhat obscure in itself , by reason -LRB- as the reader may have observed -RRB- of a redundancy of negatives ; but accompanied by action expressive of a faithful couple walking arm-in-arm towards a parochial church , mutually exchanging looks of love , it clearly signified this youth 's conviction that the caller 's purpose was of an amorous tendency .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 17]: Miss Charity affected to reprove so great a liberty ; but she could not help smiling .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 10]: He was a strange boy , to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 15]: There was always some ground of probability and likelihood mingled with his absurd behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 7]: That was the best of it !
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 17]: ` But I do n't know any gentlemen , Bailey , ' said Miss Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 10]: I think you must have made a mistake . '
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 21]: Mr Bailey smiled at the extreme wildness of such a supposition , and regarded the young ladies with unimpaired affability .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 15]: ` My dear Merry , ' said Charity , ` who CAN it be ?
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 5]: Is n't it odd ?
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 12]: I have a great mind not to go to him really .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 8]: So very strange , you know ! '
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 45]: The younger sister plainly considered that this appeal had its origin in the pride of being called upon and asked for ; and that it was intended as an assertion of superiority , and a retaliation upon her for having captured the commercial gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 42]: Therefore , she replied , with great affection and politeness , that it was , no doubt , very strange indeed ; and that she was totally at a loss to conceive what the ridiculous person unknown could mean by it .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 7]: ` Quite impossible to divine ! '
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 26]: said Charity , with some sharpness , ` though still , at the same time , you need n't be angry , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 14]: ` Thank you , ' retorted Merry , singing at her needle . '
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 12]: I am quite aware of that , my love . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 16]: I am afraid your head is turned , you silly thing , ' said Cherry .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 30]: ` Do you know , my dear , ' said Merry , with engaging candour , ` that I have been afraid of that , myself , all along !
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 23]: So much incense and nonsense , and all the rest of it , is enough to turn a stronger head than mine .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 31]: What a relief it must be to you , my dear , to be so very comfortable in that respect , and not to be worried by those odious men !
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 9]: How do you do it , Cherry ? '
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 77]: This artless inquiry might have led to turbulent results , but for the strong emotions of delight evinced by Bailey junior , whose relish in the turn the conversation had lately taken was so acute , that it impelled and forced him to the instantaneous performance of a dancing step , extremely difficult in its nature , and only to be achieved in a moment of ecstasy , which is commonly called The Frog 's Hornpipe .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 31]: A manifestation so lively , brought to their immediate recollection the great virtuous precept , ` Keep up appearances whatever you do , ' in which they had been educated .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 50]: They forbore at once , and jointly signified to Mr Bailey that if he should presume to practice that figure any more in their presence , they would instantly acquaint Mrs Todgers with the fact , and would demand his condign punishment , at the hands of that lady .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 59]: The young gentleman having expressed the bitterness of his contrition by affecting to wipe away scalding tears with his apron , and afterwards feigning to wring a vast amount of water from that garment , held the door open while Miss Charity passed out ; and so that damsel went in state upstairs to receive her mysterious adorer .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 20]: By some strange occurrence of favourable circumstances he had found out the drawing-room , and was sitting there alone .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 6]: ` Ah , cousin ! '
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 8]: ` Here I am , you see .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 11]: You thought I was lost , I 'll be bound .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 10]: how do you find yourself by this time ? '
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 17]: Miss Charity replied that she was quite well , and gave Mr Jonas Chuzzlewit her hand .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 24]: ` That 's right , ' said Mr Jonas , ` and you 've got over the fatigues of the journey have you ?
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 3]: I say .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 7]: How 's the other one ? '
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 17]: ` My sister is very well , I believe , ' returned the young lady . '
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 12]: I have not heard her complain of any indisposition , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 14]: Perhaps you would like to see her , and ask her yourself ? '
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 7]: ` No , no cousin ! '
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 12]: said Mr Jonas , sitting down beside her on the window-seat .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 8]: ` Do n't be in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 10]: There 's no occasion for that , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 8]: What a cruel girl you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 21]: ` It 's impossible for YOU to know , ' said Cherry , ` whether I am or not . '
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 13]: ` Well , perhaps it is , ' said Mr Jonas . '
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 10]: I say -- Did you think I was lost ?
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 9]: You have n't told me that . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 13]: I did n't think at all about it , ' answered Cherry .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 7]: ` Did n't you though ? '
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 9]: said Jonas , pondering upon this strange reply .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 8]: ` Did the other one ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 29]: I am sure it 's impossible for me to say what my sister may , or may not have thought on such a subject , ' cried Cherry .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 16]: ` She never said anything to me about it , one way or other . '
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 9]: ` Did n't she laugh about it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 3]: inquired Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 12]: She did n't even laugh about it , ' answered Charity .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 14]: ` She 's a terrible one to laugh , a n't she ? '
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 7]: said Jonas , lowering his voice .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 10]: ` She is very lively , ' said Cherry .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 16]: ` Liveliness is a pleasant thing -- when it do n't lead to spending money .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 5]: A n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 4]: asked Mr Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 26]: ` Very much so , indeed , ' said Cherry , with a demureness of manner that gave a very disinterested character to her assent .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 25]: ` Such liveliness as yours I mean , you know , ' observed Mr Jonas , as he nudged her with his elbow . '
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 18]: I should have come to see you before , but I did n't know where you was .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 11]: How quick you hurried off , that morning ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 15]: I was amenable to my papa 's directions , ' said Miss Charity . '
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 25]: I wish he had given me his direction , ' returned her cousin , ` and then I should have found you out before .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 23]: Why , I should n't have found you even now , if I had n't met him in the street this morning .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 9]: What a sleek , sly chap he is !
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 11]: Just like a tomcat , a n't he ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 24]: I must trouble you to have the goodness to speak more respectfully of my papa , Mr Jonas , ' said Charity . '
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 15]: I ca n't allow such a tone as that , even in jest . '
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 27]: ` Ecod , you may say what you like of MY father , then , and so I give you leave , ' said Jonas . '
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 17]: I think it 's liquid aggravation that circulates through his veins , and not regular blood .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 12]: How old should you think my father was , cousin ? '
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 20]: ` Old , no doubt , ' replied Miss Charity ; ` but a fine old gentleman . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 6]: A fine old gentleman ! '
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 13]: repeated Jonas , giving the crown of his hat an angry knock .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 15]: It 's time he was thinking of being drawn out a little finer too .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 7]: Why , he 's eighty ! '
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 7]: ` Is he , indeed ? '
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 5]: said the young lady .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 37]: ` And ecod , ' cried Jonas , ` now he 's gone so far without giving in , I do n't see much to prevent his being ninety ; no , nor even a hundred .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 19]: Why , a man with any feeling ought to be ashamed of being eighty , let alone more .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 24]: Where 's his religion , I should like to know , when he goes flying in the face of the Bible like that ?
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 31]: Threescore-and-ten 's the mark , and no man with a conscience , and a proper sense of what 's expected of him , has any business to live longer . '
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 20]: Is any one surprised at Mr Jonas making such a reference to such a book for such a purpose ?
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 23]: Does any one doubt the old saw , that the Devil -LRB- being a layman -RRB- quotes Scripture for his own ends ?
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 40]: If he will take the trouble to look about him , he may find a greater number of confirmations of the fact in the occurrences of any single day , than the steam-gun can discharge balls in a minute .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 34]: ` But there 's enough of my father , ' said Jonas ; ` it 's of no use to go putting one 's self out of the way by talking about HIM .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 36]: I called to ask you to come and take a walk , cousin , and see some of the sights ; and to come to our house afterwards , and have a bit of something .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 18]: Pecksniff will most likely look in in the evening , he says , and bring you home .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 37]: See , here 's his writing ; I made him put it down this morning when he told me he should n't be back before I came here ; in case you would n't believe me .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 9]: There 's nothing like proof , is there ?
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 4]: Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 14]: I say -- you 'll bring the other one , you know ! '
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 25]: Miss Charity cast her eyes upon her father 's autograph , which merely said -- ` Go , my children , with your cousin .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 37]: Let there be union among us when it is possible ; ' and after enough of hesitation to impart a proper value to her consent , withdrew to prepare her sister and herself for the excursion .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 34]: She soon returned , accompanied by Miss Mercy , who was by no means pleased to leave the brilliant triumphs of Todgers 's for the society of Mr Jonas and his respected father .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 4]: ` Aha ! '
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 3]: cried Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 9]: ` There you are , are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 28]: ` Yes , fright , ' said Mercy , ` here I am ; and I would much rather be anywhere else , I assure you . '
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 12]: ` You do n't mean that , ' cried Mr Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 8]: ` You ca n't , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 6]: It is n't possible . '
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 16]: ` You can have what opinion you like , fright , ' retorted Mercy . '
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 23]: I am content to keep mine ; and mine is that you are a very unpleasant , odious , disagreeable person . '
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 13]: Here she laughed heartily , and seemed to enjoy herself very much .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 10]: ` Oh , you 're a sharp gal ! '
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 4]: said Mr Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 14]: ` She 's a regular teaser , a n't she , cousin ? '
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 84]: Miss Charity replied in effect , that she was unable to say what the habits and propensities of a regular teaser might be ; and that even if she possessed such information , it would ill become her to admit the existence of any creature with such an unceremonious name in her family ; far less in the person of a beloved sister ; ` whatever , ' added Cherry with an angry glance , ` whatever her real nature may be . '
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 45]: ` Well , my dear , ' said Merry , ` the only observation I have to make is , that if we do n't go out at once , I shall certainly take my bonnet off again , and stay at home . '
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 34]: This threat had the desired effect of preventing any farther altercation , for Mr Jonas immediately proposed an adjournment , and the same being carried unanimously , they departed from the house straightway .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 55]: On the doorstep , Mr Jonas gave an arm to each cousin ; which act of gallantry being observed by Bailey junior , from the garret window , was by him saluted with a loud and violent fit of coughing , to which paroxysm he was still the victim when they turned the corner .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 70]: Mr Jonas inquired in the first instance if they were good walkers and being answered , ` Yes , ' submitted their pedestrian powers to a pretty severe test ; for he showed them as many sights , in the way of bridges , churches , streets , outsides of theatres , and other free spectacles , in that one forenoon , as most people see in a twelvemonth .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 60]: It was observable in this gentleman , that he had an insurmountable distaste to the insides of buildings , and that he was perfectly acquainted with the merits of all shows , in respect of which there was any charge for admission , which it seemed were every one detestable , and of the very lowest grade of merit .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 51]: He was so thoroughly possessed with this opinion , that when Miss Charity happened to mention the circumstance of their having been twice or thrice to the theatre with Mr Jinkins and party , he inquired , as a matter of course , ` where the orders came from ? '
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 63]: and being told that Mr Jinkins and party paid , was beyond description entertained , observing that ` they must be nice flats , certainly ; ' and often in the course of the walk , bursting out again into a perfect convulsion of laughter at the surpassing silliness of those gentlemen , and -LRB- doubtless -RRB- at his own superior wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 41]: When they had been out for some hours and were thoroughly fatigued , it being by that time twilight , Mr Jonas intimated that he would show them one of the best pieces of fun with which he was acquainted .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 26]: This joke was of a practical kind , and its humour lay in taking a hackney-coach to the extreme limits of possibility for a shilling .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 28]: Happily it brought them to the place where Mr Jonas dwelt , or the young ladies might have rather missed the point and cream of the jest .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 120]: The old-established firm of Anthony Chuzzlewit and Son , Manchester Warehousemen , and so forth , had its place of business in a very narrow street somewhere behind the Post Office ; where every house was in the brightest summer morning very gloomy ; and where light porters watered the pavement , each before his own employer 's premises , in fantastic patterns , in the dog-days ; and where spruce gentlemen with their hands in the pockets of symmetrical trousers , were always to be seen in warm weather , contemplating their undeniable boots in dusty warehouse doorways ; which appeared to be the hardest work they did , except now and then carrying pens behind their ears .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 68]: A dim , dirty , smoky , tumble-down , rotten old house it was , as anybody would desire to see ; but there the firm of Anthony Chuzzlewit and Son transacted all their business and their pleasure too , such as it was ; for neither the young man nor the old had any other residence , or any care or thought beyond its narrow limits .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 35]: Business , as may be readily supposed , was the main thing in this establishment ; insomuch indeed that it shouldered comfort out of doors , and jostled the domestic arrangements at every turn .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 86]: Thus in the miserable bedrooms there were files of moth-eaten letters hanging up against the walls ; and linen rollers , and fragments of old patterns , and odds and ends of spoiled goods , strewed upon the ground ; while the meagre bedsteads , washing-stands , and scraps of carpet , were huddled away into corners as objects of secondary consideration , not to be thought of but as disagreeable necessities , furnishing no profit , and intruding on the one affair of life .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 56]: The single sitting-room was on the same principle , a chaos of boxes and old papers , and had more counting-house stools in it than chairs ; not to mention a great monster of a desk straddling over the middle of the floor , and an iron safe sunk into the wall above the fireplace .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 54]: The solitary little table for purposes of refection and social enjoyment , bore as fair a proportion to the desk and other business furniture , as the graces and harmless relaxations of life had ever done , in the persons of the old man and his son , to their pursuit of wealth .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 34]: It was meanly laid out now for dinner ; and in a chair before the fire sat Anthony himself , who rose to greet his son and his fair cousins as they entered .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 59]: An ancient proverb warns us that we should not expect to find old heads upon young shoulders ; to which it may be added that we seldom meet with that unnatural combination , but we feel a strong desire to knock them off ; merely from an inherent love we have of seeing things in their right places .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 67]: It is not improbable that many men , in no wise choleric by nature , felt this impulse rising up within them , when they first made the acquaintance of Mr Jonas ; but if they had known him more intimately in his own house , and had sat with him at his own board , it would assuredly have been paramount to all other considerations .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 6]: ` Well , ghost ! '
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 12]: said Mr Jonas , dutifully addressing his parent by that title .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 8]: ` Is dinner nearly ready ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 12]: I should think it was , ' rejoined the old man .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 9]: ` What 's the good of that ? '
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 5]: rejoined the son . '
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 6]: I should think it was .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 6]: I want to know . '
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 11]: I do n't know for certain , ' said Anthony .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 17]: ` You do n't know for certain , ' rejoined his son in a lower tone .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 12]: You do n't know anything for certain , YOU do n't .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 6]: Give me your candle here .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 8]: I want it for the gals . '
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 65]: Anthony handed him a battered old office candlestick , with which Mr Jonas preceded the young ladies to the nearest bedroom , where he left them to take off their shawls and bonnets ; and returning , occupied himself in opening a bottle of wine , sharpening the carving-knife , and muttering compliments to his father , until they and the dinner appeared together .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 40]: The repast consisted of a hot leg of mutton with greens and potatoes ; and the dishes having been set upon the table by a slipshod old woman , they were left to enjoy it after their own manner .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 18]: ` Bachelor 's Hall , you know , cousin , ' said Mr Jonas to Charity . '
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 22]: I say -- the other one will be having a laugh at this when she gets home , wo n't she ?
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 20]: Here ; you sit on the right side of me , and I 'll have her upon the left .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 9]: Other one , will you come here ? '
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 34]: ` You 're such a fright , ' replied Mercy , ` that I know I shall have no appetite if I sit so near you ; but I suppose I must . '
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 7]: ` A n't she lively ? '
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 14]: whispered Mr Jonas to the elder sister , with his favourite elbow emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 9]: ` Oh I really do n't know ! '
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 7]: replied Miss Pecksniff , tartly . '
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 11]: I am tired of being asked such ridiculous questions . '
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 13]: ` What 's that precious old father of mine about now ? '
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 23]: said Mr Jonas , seeing that his parent was travelling up and down the room instead of taking his seat at table .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 8]: ` What are you looking for ? '
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 14]: ` I 've lost my glasses , Jonas , ' said old Anthony .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 12]: ` Sit down without your glasses , ca n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 4]: returned his son .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 24]: ` You do n't eat or drink out of 'em , I think ; and where 's that sleepy-headed old Chuffey got to !
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 4]: Now , stupid .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 9]: you know your name , do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 18]: It would seem that he did n't , for he did n't come until the father called .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 40]: As he spoke , the door of a small glass office , which was partitioned off from the rest of the room , was slowly opened , and a little blear-eyed , weazen-faced , ancient man came creeping out .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 62]: He was of a remote fashion , and dusty , like the rest of the furniture ; he was dressed in a decayed suit of black ; with breeches garnished at the knees with rusty wisps of ribbon , the very paupers of shoestrings ; on the lower portion of his spindle legs were dingy worsted stockings of the same colour .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 26]: He looked as if he had been put away and forgotten half a century before , and somebody had just found him in a lumber-closet .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 55]: Such as he was , he came slowly creeping on towards the table , until at last he crept into the vacant chair , from which , as his dim faculties became conscious of the presence of strangers , and those strangers ladies , he rose again , apparently intending to make a bow .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 49]: But he sat down once more without having made it , and breathing on his shrivelled hands to warm them , remained with his poor blue nose immovable above his plate , looking at nothing , with eyes that saw nothing , and a face that meant nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 14]: Take him in that state , and he was an embodiment of nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 3]: Nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 22]: ` Our clerk , ' said Mr Jonas , as host and master of the ceremonies : ` Old Chuffey . '
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 6]: ` Is he deaf ? '
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 7]: inquired one of the young ladies .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 11]: ` No , I do n't know that he is .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 12]: He a n't deaf , is he , father ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 14]: I never heard him say he was , ' replied the old man .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 4]: ` Blind ? '
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 5]: inquired the young ladies .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 5]: ` N -- no .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 16]: I never understood that he was at all blind , ' said Jonas , carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 14]: ` You do n't consider him so , do you , father ? '
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 8]: ` Certainly not , ' replied Anthony .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 8]: ` What is he , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 55]: ` Why , I 'll tell you what he is , ' said Mr Jonas , apart to the young ladies , ` he 's precious old , for one thing ; and I a n't best pleased with him for that , for I think my father must have caught it of him .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 31]: He 's a strange old chap , for another , ' he added in a louder voice , ` and do n't understand any one hardly , but HIM ! '
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 20]: He pointed to his honoured parent with the carving-fork , in order that they might know whom he meant .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 6]: ` How very strange ! '
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 4]: cried the sisters .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 40]: ` Why , you see , ' said Mr Jonas , ` he 's been addling his old brains with figures and book-keeping all his life ; and twenty years ago or so he went and took a fever .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 44]: All the time he was out of his head -LRB- which was three weeks -RRB- he never left off casting up ; and he got to so many million at last that I do n't believe he 's ever been quite right since .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 19]: We do n't do much business now though , and he a n't a bad clerk . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 9]: A very good one , ' said Anthony .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 28]: He a n't a dear one at all events , ' observed Jonas ; ` and he earns his salt , which is enough for our look-out .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 27]: I was telling you that he hardly understands any one except my father ; he always understands him , though , and wakes up quite wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 13]: He 's been used to his ways so long , you see !
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 42]: Why , I 've seen him play whist , with my father for a partner ; and a good rubber too ; when he had no more notion what sort of people he was playing against , than you have . '
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 7]: ` Has he no appetite ? '
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 3]: asked Merry .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 18]: ` Oh , yes , ' said Jonas , plying his own knife and fork very fast .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 9]: ` He eats -- when he 's helped .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 53]: But he do n't care whether he waits a minute or an hour , as long as father 's here ; so when I 'm at all sharp set , as I am to-day , I come to him after I 've taken the edge off my own hunger , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 11]: Now , Chuffey , stupid , are you ready ? '
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 4]: Chuffey remained immovable .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 22]: ` Always a perverse old file , he was , ' said Mr Jonas , coolly helping himself to another slice .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 7]: ` Ask him , father . '
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 11]: ` Are you ready for your dinner , Chuffey ? '
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 45]: asked the old man ` Yes , yes , ' said Chuffey , lighting up into a sentient human creature at the first sound of the voice , so that it was at once a curious and quite a moving sight to see him .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 5]: ` Yes , yes .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 6]: Quite ready , Mr Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 5]: Quite ready , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 10]: All ready , all ready , all ready . '
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 37]: With that he stopped , smilingly , and listened for some further address ; but being spoken to no more , the light forsook his face by little and little , until he was nothing again .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 28]: ` He 'll be very disagreeable , mind , ' said Jonas , addressing his cousins as he handed the old man 's portion to his father .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 11]: ` He always chokes himself when it a n't broth .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 6]: Look at him , now !
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 16]: Did you ever see a horse with such a wall-eyed expression as he 's got ?
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 29]: If it had n't been for the joke of it I would n't have let him come in to-day ; but I thought he 'd amuse you . '
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 31]: The poor old subject of this humane speech was , happily for himself , as unconscious of its purport as of most other remarks that were made in his presence .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 68]: But the mutton being tough , and his gums weak , he quickly verified the statement relative to his choking propensities , and underwent so much in his attempts to dine , that Mr Jonas was infinitely amused ; protesting that he had seldom seen him better company in all his life , and that he was enough to make a man split his sides with laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 40]: Indeed , he went so far as to assure the sisters , that in this point of view he considered Chuffey superior to his own father ; which , as he significantly added , was saying a great deal .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 36]: It was strange enough that Anthony Chuzzlewit , himself so old a man , should take a pleasure in these gibings of his estimable son at the expense of the poor shadow at their table .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 32]: But he did , unquestionably ; though not so much -- to do him justice -- with reference to their ancient clerk , as in exultation at the sharpness of Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 45]: For the same reason that young man 's coarse allusions , even to himself , filled him with a stealthy glee ; causing him to rub his hands and chuckle covertly , as if he said in his sleeve , ' I taught him .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 4]: I trained him .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 8]: This is the heir of my bringing-up .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 14]: Sly , cunning , and covetous , he 'll not squander my money .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 23]: I worked for this ; I hoped for this ; it has been the great end and aim of my life . '
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 15]: What a noble end and aim it was to contemplate in the attainment truly !
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 30]: But there be some who manufacture idols after the fashion of themselves , and fail to worship them when they are made ; charging their deformity on outraged nature .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 9]: Anthony was better than these at any rate .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 52]: Chuffey boggled over his plate so long , that Mr Jones , losing patience , took it from him at last with his own hands , and requested his father to signify to that venerable person that he had better ` peg away at his bread ; ' which Anthony did .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 6]: ` Aye , aye ! '
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 28]: cried the old man , brightening up as before , when this was communicated to him in the same voice , ` quite right , quite right .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 9]: He 's your own son , Mr Chuzzlewit !
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 7]: Bless him for a sharp lad !
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 7]: Bless him , bless him ! '
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 43]: Mr Jonas considered this so particularly childish -LRB- perhaps with some reason -RRB- , that he only laughed the more , and told his cousins that he was afraid one of these fine days , Chuffey would be the death of him .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 49]: The cloth was then removed , and the bottle of wine set upon the table , from which Mr Jonas filled the young ladies ' glasses , calling on them not to spare it , as they might be certain there was plenty more where that came from .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 32]: But he added with some haste after this sally that it was only his joke , and they would n't suppose him to be in earnest , he was sure . '
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 12]: I shall drink , ' said Anthony , ` to Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 6]: Your father , my dears .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 6]: A clever man , Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 4]: A wary man !
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 7]: A hypocrite , though , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 7]: A hypocrite , girls , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 6]: Well , so he is .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 8]: Now , among friends , he is .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 19]: I do n't think the worse of him for that , unless it is that he overdoes it .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 8]: You may overdo anything , my darlings .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 6]: You may overdo even hypocrisy .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 4]: Ask Jonas ! '
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 20]: ` You ca n't overdo taking care of yourself , ' observed that hopeful gentleman with his mouth full .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 10]: ` Do you hear that , my dears ? '
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 6]: cried Anthony , quite enraptured .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 5]: ` Wisdom , wisdom !
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 6]: A good exception , Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 9]: It 's not easy to overdo that . '
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 20]: ` Except , ' whispered Mr Jonas to his favourite cousin , ` except when one lives too long .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 4]: Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 10]: Tell the other one that -- I say ! '
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 6]: ` Good gracious me ! '
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 8]: said Cherry , in a petulant manner .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 16]: ` You can tell her yourself , if you wish , ca n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 15]: ` She seems to make such game of one , ' replied Mr Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 11]: ` Then why need you trouble yourself about her ? '
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 4]: said Charity . '
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 13]: I am sure she does n't trouble herself much about you . '
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 7]: ` Do n't she though ? '
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 3]: asked Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 15]: ` Good gracious me , need I tell you that she do n't ? '
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 5]: returned the young lady .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 35]: Mr Jonas made no verbal rejoinder , but he glanced at Mercy with an odd expression in his face ; and said THAT would n't break his heart , she might depend upon it .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 30]: Then he looked on Charity with even greater favour than before , and besought her , as his polite manner was , to ` come a little closer . '
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 22]: ` There 's another thing that 's not easily overdone , father , ' remarked Jonas , after a short silence .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 6]: ` What 's that ? '
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 10]: asked the father ; grinning already in anticipation . '
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 8]: A bargain , ' said the son .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 20]: ` Here 's the rule for bargains -- `` Do other men , for they would do you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 7]: That 's the true business precept .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 6]: All others are counterfeits . '
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 58]: The delighted father applauded this sentiment to the echo ; and was so much tickled by it , that he was at the pains of imparting the same to his ancient clerk , who rubbed his hands , nodded his palsied head , winked his watery eyes , and cried in his whistling tones , ` Good !
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 2]: good !
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 20]: Your own son , Mr Chuzzlewit ' with every feeble demonstration of delight that he was capable of making .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 36]: But this old man 's enthusiasm had the redeeming quality of being felt in sympathy with the only creature to whom he was linked by ties of long association , and by his present helplessness .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 50]: And if there had been anybody there , who cared to think about it , some dregs of a better nature unawakened , might perhaps have been descried through that very medium , melancholy though it was , yet lingering at the bottom of the worn-out cask called Chuffey .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 68]: As matters stood , nobody thought or said anything upon the subject ; so Chuffey fell back into a dark corner on one side of the fireplace , where he always spent his evenings , and was neither seen nor heard again that night ; save once , when a cup of tea was given him , in which he was seen to soak his bread mechanically .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 29]: There was no reason to suppose that he went to sleep at these seasons , or that he heard , or saw , or felt , or thought .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 41]: He remained , as it were , frozen up -- if any term expressive of such a vigorous process can be applied to him -- until he was again thawed for the moment by a word or touch from Anthony .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 52]: Miss Charity made tea by desire of Mr Jonas , and felt and looked so like the lady of the house that she was in the prettiest confusion imaginable ; the more so from Mr Jonas sitting close beside her , and whispering a variety of admiring expressions in her ear .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 48]: Miss Mercy , for her part , felt the entertainment of the evening to be so distinctly and exclusively theirs , that she silently deplored the commercial gentlemen -- at that moment , no doubt , wearying for her return -- and yawned over yesterday 's newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 31]: As to Anthony , he went to sleep outright , so Jonas and Cherry had a clear stage to themselves as long as they chose to keep possession of it .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 72]: When the tea-tray was taken away , as it was at last , Mr Jonas produced a dirty pack of cards , and entertained the sisters with divers small feats of dexterity : whereof the main purpose of every one was , that you were to decoy somebody into laying a wager with you that you could n't do it ; and were then immediately to win and pocket his money .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 29]: Mr Jonas informed them that these accomplishments were in high vogue in the most intellectual circles , and that large amounts were constantly changing hands on such hazards .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 57]: And it may be remarked that he fully believed this ; for there is a simplicity of cunning no less than a simplicity of innocence ; and in all matters where a lively faith in knavery and meanness was required as the ground-work of belief , Mr Jonas was one of the most credulous of men .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 20]: His ignorance , which was stupendous , may be taken into account , if the reader pleases , separately .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 40]: This fine young man had all the inclination to be a profligate of the first water , and only lacked the one good trait in the common catalogue of debauched vices -- open-handedness -- to be a notable vagabond .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 54]: But there his griping and penurious habits stepped in ; and as one poison will sometimes neutralise another , when wholesome remedies would not avail , so he was restrained by a bad passion from quaffing his full measure of evil , when virtue might have sought to hold him back in vain .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 42]: By the time he had unfolded all the peddling schemes he knew upon the cards , it was growing late in the evening ; and Mr Pecksniff not making his appearance , the young ladies expressed a wish to return home .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 75]: But this , Mr Jonas , in his gallantry , would by no means allow , until they had partaken of some bread and cheese and porter ; and even then he was excessively unwilling to allow them to depart ; often beseeching Miss Charity to come a little closer , or to stop a little longer , and preferring many other complimentary petitions of that nature in his own hospitable and earnest way .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 49]: When all his efforts to detain them were fruitless , he put on his hat and greatcoat preparatory to escorting them to Todgers 's ; remarking that he knew they would rather walk thither than ride ; and that for his part he was quite of their opinion .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 8]: ` Good night , ' said Anthony .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 14]: ` Good night ; remember me to -- ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 4]: -- to Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 19]: Take care of your cousin , my dears ; beware of Jonas ; he 's a dangerous fellow .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 11]: Do n't quarrel for him , in any case ! '
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 7]: ` Oh , the creature ! '
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 3]: cried Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 8]: ` The idea of quarrelling for HIM !
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 14]: You may take him , Cherry , my love , all to yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 10]: I make you a present of my share . '
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 12]: I 'm a sour grape , am I , cousin ? '
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 3]: said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 23]: Miss Charity was more entertained by this repartee than one would have supposed likely , considering its advanced age and simple character .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 49]: But in her sisterly affection she took Mr Jonas to task for leaning so very hard upon a broken reed , and said that he must not be so cruel to poor Merry any more , or she -LRB- Charity -RRB- would positively be obliged to hate him .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 33]: Mercy , who really had her share of good humour , only retorted with a laugh ; and they walked home in consequence without any angry passages of words upon the way .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 60]: Mr Jonas being in the middle , and having a cousin on each arm , sometimes squeezed the wrong one ; so tightly too , as to cause her not a little inconvenience ; but as he talked to Charity in whispers the whole time , and paid her great attention , no doubt this was an accidental circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 85]: When they arrived at Todgers 's , and the door was opened , Mercy broke hastily from them , and ran upstairs ; but Charity and Jonas lingered on the steps talking together for more than five minutes ; so , as Mrs Todgers observed next morning , to a third party , ` It was pretty clear what was going on THERE , and she was glad of it , for it really was high time that Miss Pecksniff thought of settling . '
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 83]: And now the day was coming on , when that bright vision which had burst on Todgers 's so suddenly , and made a sunshine in the shady breast of Jinkins , was to be seen no more ; when it was to be packed , like a brown paper parcel , or a fish-basket , or an oyster barrel or a fat gentleman , or any other dull reality of life , in a stagecoach and carried down into the country .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 46]: ` Never , my dear Miss Pecksniffs , ' said Mrs Todgers , when they retired to rest on the last night of their stay , ` never have I seen an establishment so perfectly broken-hearted as mine is at this present moment of time .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 26]: I do n't believe the gentlemen will be the gentlemen they were , or anything like it -- no , not for weeks to come .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 14]: You have a great deal to answer for , both of you . '
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 19]: They modestly disclaimed any wilful agency in this disastrous state of things , and regretted it very much .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 12]: ` Your pious pa , too , ' said Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 6]: ` There 's a loss !
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 17]: My dear Miss Pecksniffs , your pa is a perfect missionary of peace and love . '
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 29]: Entertaining an uncertainty as to the particular kind of love supposed to be comprised in Mr Pecksniff 's mission , the young ladies received the compliment rather coldly .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 55]: ` If I dared , ' said Mrs Todgers , perceiving this , ` to violate a confidence which has been reposed in me , and to tell you why I must beg of you to leave the little door between your room and mine open tonight , I think you would be interested .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 25]: But I must n't do it , for I promised Mr Jinkins faithfully , that I would be as silent as the tomb . '
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 5]: ` Dear Mrs Todgers !
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 6]: What can you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 78]: ` Why , then , my sweet Miss Pecksniffs , ' said the lady of the house ; ` my own loves , if you will allow me the privilege of taking that freedom on the eve of our separation , Mr Jinkins and the gentlemen have made up a little musical party among themselves , and DO intend , in the dead of this night , to perform a serenade upon the stairs outside the door .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 60]: I could have wished , I own , ' said Mrs Todgers , with her usual foresight , ` that it had been fixed to take place an hour or two earlier ; because when gentlemen sit up late they drink , and when they drink they 're not so musical , perhaps , as when they do n't .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 28]: But this is the arrangement ; and I know you will be gratified , my dear Miss Pecksniffs , by such a mark of their attention . '
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 30]: The young ladies were at first so much excited by the news , that they vowed they could n't think of going to bed until the serenade was over .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 51]: But half an hour of cool waiting so altered their opinion that they not only went to bed , but fell asleep ; and were , moreover , not ecstatically charmed to be awakened some time afterwards by certain dulcet strains breaking in upon the silent watches of the night .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 7]: It was very affecting -- very .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 13]: Nothing more dismal could have been desired by the most fastidious taste .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 28]: The gentleman of a vocal turn was head mute , or chief mourner ; Jinkins took the bass ; and the rest took anything they could get .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 10]: The youngest gentleman blew his melancholy into a flute .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 16]: He did n't blow much out of it , but that was all the better .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 49]: If the two Miss Pecksniffs and Mrs Todgers had perished by spontaneous combustion , and the serenade had been in honour of their ashes , it would have been impossible to surpass the unutterable despair expressed in that one chorus , ` Go where glory waits thee ! '
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 32]: It was a requiem , a dirge , a moan , a howl , a wail , a lament , an abstract of everything that is sorrowful and hideous in sound .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 11]: The flute of the youngest gentleman was wild and fitful .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 11]: It came and went in gusts , like the wind .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 55]: For a long time together he seemed to have left off , and when it was quite settled by Mrs Todgers and the young ladies that , overcome by his feelings , he had retired in tears , he unexpectedly turned up again at the very top of the tune , gasping for breath .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 6]: He was a tremendous performer .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 35]: There was no knowing where to have him ; and exactly when you thought he was doing nothing at all , then was he doing the very thing that ought to astonish you most .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 31]: There were several of these concerted pieces ; perhaps two or three too many , though that , as Mrs Todgers said , was a fault on the right side .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 43]: But even then , even at that solemn moment , when the thrilling sounds may be presumed to have penetrated into the very depths of his nature , if he had any depths , Jinkins could n't leave the youngest gentleman alone .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 27]: He asked him distinctly , before the second song began -- as a personal favour too , mark the villain in that -- not to play .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 10]: Yes ; he said so ; not to play .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 15]: The breathing of the youngest gentleman was heard through the key-hole of the door .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 5]: He DID N'T play .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 14]: What vent was a flute for the passions swelling up within his breast ?
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 10]: A trombone would have been a world too mild .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 6]: The serenade approached its close .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 7]: Its crowning interest was at hand .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 25]: The gentleman of a literary turn had written a song on the departure of the ladies , and adapted it to an old tune .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 23]: They all joined , except the youngest gentleman in company , who , for the reasons aforesaid , maintained a fearful silence .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 36]: The song -LRB- which was of a classical nature -RRB- invoked the oracle of Apollo , and demanded to know what would become of Todgers 's when CHARITY and MERCY were banished from its walls .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 27]: The oracle delivered no opinion particularly worth remembering , according to the not infrequent practice of oracles from the earliest ages down to the present time .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 49]: In the absence of enlightenment on that subject , the strain deserted it , and went on to show that the Miss Pecksniffs were nearly related to Rule Britannia , and that if Great Britain had n't been an island , there could have been no Miss Pecksniffs .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 25]: And being now on a nautical tack , it closed with this verse : ` All hail to the vessel of Pecksniff the sire !
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 24]: And favouring breezes to fan ; While Tritons flock round it , and proudly admire The architect , artist , and man ! '
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 40]: As they presented this beautiful picture to the imagination , the gentlemen gradually withdrew to bed to give the music the effect of distance ; and so it died away , and Todgers 's was left to its repose .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 71]: Mr Bailey reserved his vocal offering until the morning , when he put his head into the room as the young ladies were kneeling before their trunks , packing up , and treated them to an imitation of the voice of a young dog in trying circumstances ; when that animal is supposed by persons of a lively fancy , to relieve his feelings by calling for pen and ink .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 25]: ` Well , young ladies , ' said the youth , ` so you 're a-going home , are you , worse luck ? '
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 14]: ` Yes , Bailey , we 're going home , ' returned Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 17]: ` A n't you a-going to leave none of 'em a lock of your hair ? '
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 4]: inquired the youth .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 10]: ` It 's real , a n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 13]: They laughed at this , and told him of course it was .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 11]: ` Oh , is it of course , though ? '
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 4]: said Bailey . '
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 6]: I know better than that .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 4]: Hers a n't .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 16]: Why , I see it hanging up once , on that nail by the winder .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 19]: Besides , I have gone behind her at dinner-time and pulled it ; and she never know 'd .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 12]: I say , young ladies , I 'm a-going to leave .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 16]: I a n't a-going to stand being called names by her , no longer . '
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 33]: Miss Mercy inquired what his plans for the future might be ; in reply to whom Mr Bailey intimated that he thought of going either into top-boots , or into the army .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 6]: ` Into the army ! '
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 9]: cried the young ladies , with a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 7]: said Bailey , ` why not ?
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 9]: There 's a many drummers in the Tower .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 6]: I 'm acquainted with 'em .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 13]: Do n't their country set a valley on 'em , mind you !
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 5]: Not at all ! '
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 13]: ` You 'll be shot , I see , ' observed Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 10]: cried Mr Bailey , ` wot if I am ?
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 14]: There 's something gamey in it , young ladies , a n't there ?
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 37]: I 'd sooner be hit with a cannon-ball than a rolling-pin , and she 's always a-catching up something of that sort , and throwing it at me , when the gentlemans ' appetites is good .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 25]: Wot , ' said Mr Bailey , stung by the recollection of his wrongs , ` wot , if they DO consume the per-vishuns .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 10]: It a n't MY fault , is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 12]: ` Surely no one says it is , ' said Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 7]: ` Do n't they though ? '
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 4]: retorted the youth .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 2]: oh !
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 8]: No one may n't say it is !
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 7]: but some one knows it is .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 15]: But I a n't a-going to have every rise in prices wisited on me .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 13]: I a n't a-going to be killed because the markets is dear .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 5]: I wo n't stop .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 61]: And therefore , ' added Mr Bailey , relenting into a smile , ` wotever you mean to give me , you 'd better give me all at once , becos if ever you come back agin , I sha n't be here ; and as to the other boy , HE wo n't deserve nothing , I know . '
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 73]: The young ladies , on behalf of Mr Pecksniff and themselves , acted on this thoughtful advice ; and in consideration of their private friendship , presented Mr Bailey with a gratuity so liberal that he could hardly do enough to show his gratitude ; which found but an imperfect vent , during the remainder of the day , in divers secret slaps upon his pocket , and other such facetious pantomime .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 68]: Nor was it confined to these ebullitions ; for besides crushing a bandbox , with a bonnet in it , he seriously damaged Mr Pecksniff 's luggage , by ardently hauling it down from the top of the house ; and in short evinced , by every means in his power , a lively sense of the favours he had received from that gentleman and his family .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 50]: Mr Pecksniff and Mr Jinkins came home to dinner arm-in-arm ; for the latter gentleman had made half-holiday on purpose ; thus gaining an immense advantage over the youngest gentleman and the rest , whose time , as it perversely chanced , was all bespoke , until the evening .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 27]: The bottle of wine was Mr Pecksniff 's treat , and they were very sociable indeed ; though full of lamentations on the necessity of parting .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 34]: While they were in the midst of their enjoyment , old Anthony and his son were announced ; much to the surprise of Mr Pecksniff , and greatly to the discomfiture of Jinkins .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 39]: ` Come to say good-bye , you see , ' said Anthony , in a low voice , to Mr Pecksniff , as they took their seats apart at the table , while the rest conversed among themselves .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 13]: ` Where 's the use of a division between you and me ?
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 22]: We are the two halves of a pair of scissors , when apart , Pecksniff ; but together we are something .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 3]: Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 19]: ` Unanimity , my good sir , ' rejoined Mr Pecksniff , ` is always delightful . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 28]: I do n't know about that , ' said the old man , ` for there are some people I would rather differ from than agree with .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 9]: But you know my opinion of you . '
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 34]: Mr Pecksniff , still having ` hypocrite ' in his mind , only replied by a motion of his head , which was something between an affirmative bow , and a negative shake .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 7]: ` Complimentary , ' said Anthony .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 7]: ` Complimentary , upon my word .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 25]: It was an involuntary tribute to your abilities , even at the time ; and it was not a time to suggest compliments either .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 18]: But we agreed in the coach , you know , that we quite understood each other . '
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 6]: ` Oh , quite ! '
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 22]: assented Mr Pecksniff , in a manner which implied that he himself was misunderstood most cruelly , but would not complain .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 29]: Anthony glanced at his son as he sat beside Miss Charity , and then at Mr Pecksniff , and then at his son again , very many times .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 46]: It happened that Mr Pecksniff 's glances took a similar direction ; but when he became aware of it , he first cast down his eyes , and then closed them ; as if he were determined that the old man should read nothing there .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 13]: ` Jonas is a shrewd lad , ' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 21]: ` He appears , ' rejoined Mr Pecksniff in his most candid manner , ` to be very shrewd . '
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 10]: ` And careful , ' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 14]: ` And careful , I have no doubt , ' returned Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 5]: ` Look ye ! '
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 7]: said Anthony in his ear . '
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 10]: I think he is sweet upon you daughter . '
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 43]: ` Tut , my good sir , ' said Mr Pecksniff , with his eyes still closed ; ` young people -- young people -- a kind of cousins , too -- no more sweetness than is in that , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 20]: ` Why , there is very little sweetness in that , according to our experience , ' returned Anthony .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 10]: ` Is n't there a trifle more here ? '
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 10]: ` Impossible to say , ' rejoined Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 4]: ` Quite impossible !
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 5]: You surprise me . '
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 15]: ` Yes , I know that , ' said the old man , drily .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 20]: ` It may last ; I mean the sweetness , not the surprise ; and it may die off .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 34]: Supposing it should last , perhaps -LRB- you having feathered your nest pretty well , and I having done the same -RRB- , we might have a mutual interest in the matter . '
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 17]: Mr Pecksniff , smiling gently , was about to speak , but Anthony stopped him . '
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 9]: I know what you are going to say .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 5]: It 's quite unnecessary .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 41]: You have never thought of this for a moment ; and in a point so nearly affecting the happiness of your dear child , you could n't , as a tender father , express an opinion ; and so forth .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 5]: Yes , quite right .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 4]: And like you !
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 102]: But it seems to me , my dear Pecksniff , ' added Anthony , laying his hand upon his sleeve , ` that if you and I kept up the joke of pretending not to see this , one of us might possibly be placed in a position of disadvantage ; and as I am very unwilling to be that party myself , you will excuse my taking the liberty of putting the matter beyond a doubt thus early ; and having it distinctly understood , as it is now , that we do see it , and do know it .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 6]: Thank you for your attention .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 20]: We are now upon an equal footing ; which is agreeable to us both , I am sure . '
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 60]: He rose as he spoke ; and giving Mr Pecksniff a nod of intelligence , moved away from him to where the young people were sitting ; leaving that good man somewhat puzzled and discomfited by such very plain dealing , and not quite free from a sense of having been foiled in the exercise of his familiar weapons .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 37]: But the night-coach had a punctual character , and it was time to join it at the office ; which was so near at hand that they had already sent their luggage and arranged to walk .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 25]: Thither the whole party repaired , therefore , after no more delay than sufficed for the equipment of the Miss Pecksniffs and Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 45]: They found the coach already at its starting-place , and the horses in ; there , too , were a large majority of the commercial gentlemen , including the youngest , who was visibly agitated , and in a state of deep mental dejection .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 28]: Nothing could equal the distress of Mrs Todgers in parting from the young ladies , except the strong emotions with which she bade adieu to Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 68]: Never surely was a pocket-handkerchief taken in and out of a flat reticule so often as Mrs Todgers 's was , as she stood upon the pavement by the coach-door supported on either side by a commercial gentleman ; and by the sight of the coach-lamps caught such brief snatches and glimpses of the good man 's face , as the constant interposition of Mr Jinkins allowed .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 24]: For Jinkins , to the last the youngest gentleman 's rock a-head in life , stood upon the coachstep talking to the ladies .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 69]: Upon the other step was Mr Jonas , who maintained that position in right of his cousinship ; whereas the youngest gentleman , who had been first upon the ground , was deep in the booking-office among the black and red placards , and the portraits of fast coaches , where he was ignominiously harassed by porters , and had to contend and strive perpetually with heavy baggage .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 71]: This false position , combined with his nervous excitement , brought about the very consummation and catastrophe of his miseries ; for when in the moment of parting he aimed a flower , a hothouse flower that had cost money , at the fair hand of Mercy , it reached , instead , the coachman on the box , who thanked him kindly , and stuck it in his buttonhole .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 12]: They were off now ; and Todgers 's was alone again .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 20]: The two young ladies , leaning back in their separate corners , resigned themselves to their own regretful thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 54]: But Mr Pecksniff , dismissing all ephemeral considerations of social pleasure and enjoyment , concentrated his meditations on the one great virtuous purpose before him , of casting out that ingrate and deceiver , whose presence yet troubled his domestic hearth , and was a sacrilege upon the altars of his household gods .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 26]: CHAPTER TWELVE WILL BE SEEN IN THE LONG RUN , IF NOT IN THE SHORT ONE , TO CONCERN MR PINCH AND OTHERS , NEARLY .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 9]: MR PECKSNIFF ASSERTS THE DIGNITY OF OUTRAGED VIRTUE .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 36]: YOUNG MARTIN CHUZZLEWIT FORMS A DESPERATE RESOLUTION Mr Pinch and Martin , little dreaming of the stormy weather that impended , made themselves very comfortable in the Pecksniffian halls , and improved their friendship daily .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 66]: Martin 's facility , both of invention and execution , being remarkable , the grammar-school proceeded with great vigour ; and Tom repeatedly declared , that if there were anything like certainty in human affairs , or impartiality in human judges , a design so new and full of merit could not fail to carry off the first prize when the time of competition arrived .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 27]: Without being quite so sanguine himself , Martin had his hopeful anticipations too ; and they served to make him brisk and eager at his task .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 55]: ` If I should turn out a great architect , Tom , ' said the new pupil one day , as he stood at a little distance from his drawing , and eyed it with much complacency , ` I 'll tell you what should be one of the things I 'd build . '
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 4]: ` Aye ! '
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 4]: ` What ? '
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 7]: ` Why , your fortune . '
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 15]: said Tom Pinch , quite as much delighted as if the thing were done .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 5]: ` Would you though ?
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 9]: How kind of you to say so . '
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 43]: ` I 'd build it up , Tom , ' returned Martin , ` on such a strong foundation , that it should last your life -- aye , and your children 's lives too , and their children 's after them .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 8]: I 'd be your patron , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 8]: I 'd take you under my protection .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 33]: Let me see the man who should give the cold shoulder to anybody I chose to protect and patronise , if I were at the top of the tree , Tom ! '
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 28]: ` Now , I do n't think , ' said Mr Pinch , ` upon my word , that I was ever more gratified than by this .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 6]: I really do n't . '
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 50]: I mean what I say , ' retorted Martin , with a manner as free and easy in its condescension to , not to say in its compassion for , the other , as if he were already First Architect in ordinary to all the Crowned Heads in Europe .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 6]: ` I 'd do it .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 8]: I 'd provide for you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 26]: I am afraid , ' said Tom , shaking his head , ` that I should be a mighty awkward person to provide for . '
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 6]: ` Pooh , pooh ! '
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 3]: rejoined Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 5]: ` Never mind that .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 41]: If I took it in my head to say , `` Pinch is a clever fellow ; I approve of Pinch ; '' I should like to know the man who would venture to put himself in opposition to me .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 19]: Besides , confound it , Tom , you could be useful to me in a hundred ways . '
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 24]: ` If I were not useful in one or two , it should n't be for want of trying , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 63]: ` For instance , ' pursued Martin , after a short reflection , ` you 'd be a capital fellow , now , to see that my ideas were properly carried out ; and to overlook the works in their progress before they were sufficiently advanced to be very interesting to ME ; and to take all that sort of plain sailing .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 37]: Then you 'd be a splendid fellow to show people over my studio , and to talk about Art to 'em , when I could n't be bored myself , and all that kind of thing .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 38]: For it would be devilish creditable , Tom -LRB- I 'm quite in earnest , I give you my word -RRB- , to have a man of your information about one , instead of some ordinary blockhead .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 9]: Oh , I 'd take care of you .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 10]: You 'd be useful , rely upon it ! '
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 48]: To say that Tom had no idea of playing first fiddle in any social orchestra , but was always quite satisfied to be set down for the hundred and fiftieth violin in the band , or thereabouts , is to express his modesty in very inadequate terms .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 12]: He was much delighted , therefore , by these observations . '
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 17]: I should be married to her then , Tom , of course , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 47]: What was that which checked Tom Pinch so suddenly , in the high flow of his gladness ; bringing the blood into his honest cheeks , and a remorseful feeling to his honest heart , as if he were unworthy of his friend 's regard ? '
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 33]: I should be married to her then , ' said Martin , looking with a smile towards the light ; ` and we should have , I hope , children about us .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 11]: They 'd be very fond of you , Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 8]: But not a word said Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 21]: The words he would have uttered died upon his lips , and found a life more spiritual in self-denying thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 24]: ` All the children hereabouts are fond of you , Tom , and mine would be , of course , ' pursued Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 11]: ` Perhaps I might name one of 'em after you .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 4]: Tom , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 7]: Well , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 7]: Tom 's not a bad name .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 4]: Thomas Pinch Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 17]: T. P. C. on his pinafores -- no objection to that , I should say ? '
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 8]: Tom cleared his throat , and smiled .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 15]: ` SHE would like you , Tom , I know , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 4]: ` Aye ! '
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 7]: cried Tom Pinch , faintly . '
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 42]: I can tell exactly what she would think of you , ' said Martin leaning his chin upon his hand , and looking through the window-glass as if he read there what he said ; ' I know her so well .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 32]: She would smile , Tom , often at first when you spoke to her , or when she looked at you -- merrily too -- but you would n't mind that .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 8]: A brighter smile you never saw . '
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 10]: ` No , no , ' said Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 7]: I would n't mind that . '
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 24]: ` She would be as tender with you , Tom , ' said Martin , ` as if you were a child yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 16]: So you are almost , in some things , a n't you , Tom ? '
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 7]: Mr Pinch nodded his entire assent .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 90]: ` She would always be kind and good-humoured , and glad to see you , ' said Martin ; ` and when she found out exactly what sort of fellow you were -LRB- which she 'd do very soon -RRB- , she would pretend to give you little commissions to execute , and to ask little services of you , which she knew you were burning to render ; so that when she really pleased you most , she would try to make you think you most pleased her .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 43]: She would take to you uncommonly , Tom ; and would understand you far more delicately than I ever shall ; and would often say , I know , that you were a harmless , gentle , well-intentioned , good fellow . '
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 6]: How silent Tom Pinch was !
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 41]: ` In honour of old time , ' said Martin , ` and of her having heard you play the organ in this damp little church down here -- for nothing too -- we will have one in the house .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 26]: I shall build an architectural music-room on a plan of my own , and it 'll look rather knowing in a recess at one end .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 54]: There you shall play away , Tom , till you tire yourself ; and , as you like to do so in the dark , it shall BE dark ; and many 's the summer evening she and I will sit and listen to you , Tom ; be sure of that ! '
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 78]: It may have required a stronger effort on Tom Pinch 's part to leave the seat on which he sat , and shake his friend by both hands , with nothing but serenity and grateful feeling painted on his face ; it may have required a stronger effort to perform this simple act with a pure heart , than to achieve many and many a deed to which the doubtful trumpet blown by Fame has lustily resounded .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 41]: Doubtful , because from its long hovering over scenes of violence , the smoke and steam of death have clogged the keys of that brave instrument ; and it is not always that its notes are either true or tuneful .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 81]: ` It 's a proof of the kindness of human nature , ' said Tom , characteristically putting himself quite out of sight in the matter , ` that everybody who comes here , as you have done , is more considerate and affectionate to me than I should have any right to hope , if I were the most sanguine creature in the world ; or should have any power to express , if I were the most eloquent .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 5]: It really overpowers me .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 39]: But trust me , ' said Tom , ` that I am not ungrateful -- that I never forget -- and that if I can ever prove the truth of my words to you , I will . '
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 26]: ` That 's all right , ' observed Martin , leaning back in his chair with a hand in each pocket , and yawning drearily .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 34]: ` Very fine talking , Tom ; but I 'm at Pecksniff 's , I remember , and perhaps a mile or so out of the high-road to fortune just at this minute .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 16]: So you 've heard again this morning from what 's his name , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 7]: ` Who may that be ? '
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 19]: asked Tom , seeming to enter a mild protest on behalf of the dignity of an absent person .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 4]: ` YOU know .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 4]: What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 3]: Northkey . '
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 15]: ` Westlock , ' rejoined Tom , in rather a louder tone than usual .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 11]: to be sure , ' said Martin , ` Westlock .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 16]: I knew it was something connected with a point of the compass and a door .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 6]: and what says Westlock ? '
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 18]: he has come into his property , ' answered Tom , nodding his head , and smiling .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 12]: ` He 's a lucky dog , ' said Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 7]: I wish it were mine instead .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 12]: Is that all the mystery you were to tell me ? '
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 12]: ` No , ' said Tom ; ` not all . '
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 7]: ` What 's the rest ? '
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 3]: asked Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 34]: ` For the matter of that , ' said Tom , ` it 's no mystery , and you wo n't think much of it ; but it 's very pleasant to me .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 17]: John always used to say when he was here , `` Mark my words , Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 24]: When my father 's executors cash up '' -- he used strange expressions now and then , but that was his way . '
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 23]: ` Cash-up 's a very good expression , ' observed Martin , ` when other people do n't apply it to you .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 11]: -- What a slow fellow you are , Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 25]: ` Yes , I am I know , ' said Tom ; ` but you 'll make me nervous if you tell me so .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 23]: I 'm afraid you have put me out a little now , for I forget what I was going to say . '
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 15]: ` When John 's father 's executors cashed up , ' said Martin impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 15]: ` Oh yes , to be sure , ' cried Tom ; ` yes .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 26]: `` Then , '' says John , `` I 'll give you a dinner , Pinch , and come down to Salisbury on purpose . ''
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 48]: Now , when John wrote the other day -- the morning Pecksniff left , you know -- he said his business was on the point of being immediately settled , and as he was to receive his money directly , when could I meet him at Salisbury ?
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 39]: I wrote and said , any day this week ; and I told him besides , that there was a new pupil here , and what a fine fellow you were , and what friends we had become .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 58]: Upon which John writes back this letter ' -- Tom produced it -- ` fixes to-morrow ; sends his compliments to you ; and begs that we three may have the pleasure of dining together ; not at the house where you and I were , either ; but at the very first hotel in the town .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 6]: Read what he says . '
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 22]: ` Very well , ' said Martin , glancing over it with his customary coolness ; ` much obliged to him .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 5]: I 'm agreeable . '
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 33]: Tom could have wished him to be a little more astonished , a little more pleased , or in some form or other a little more interested in such a great event .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 30]: But he was perfectly self-possessed ; and falling into his favourite solace of whistling , took another turn at the grammar-school , as if nothing at all had happened .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 95]: Mr Pecksniff 's horse being regarded in the light of a sacred animal , only to be driven by him , the chief priest of that temple , or by some person distinctly nominated for the time being to that high office by himself , the two young men agreed to walk to Salisbury ; and so , when the time came , they set off on foot ; which was , after all , a better mode of travelling than in the gig , as the weather was very cold and very dry .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 2]: Better !
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 34]: A rare strong , hearty , healthy walk -- four statute miles an hour -- preferable to that rumbling , tumbling , jolting , shaking , scraping , creaking , villanous old gig ?
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 11]: Why , the two things will not admit of comparison .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 15]: It is an insult to the walk , to set them side by side .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 52]: Where is an instance of a gig having ever circulated a man 's blood , unless when , putting him in danger of his neck , it awakened in his veins and in his ears , and all along his spine , a tingling heat , much more peculiar than agreeable ?
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 57]: When did a gig ever sharpen anybody 's wits and energies , unless it was when the horse bolted , and , crashing madly down a steep hill with a stone wall at the bottom , his desperate circumstances suggested to the only gentleman left inside , some novel and unheard-of mode of dropping out behind ?
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 5]: Better than the gig !
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 28]: The air was cold , Tom ; so it was , there was no denying it ; but would it have been more genial in the gig ?
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 39]: The blacksmith 's fire burned very bright , and leaped up high , as though it wanted men to warm ; but would it have been less tempting , looked at from the clammy cushions of a gig ?
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 91]: The wind blew keenly , nipping the features of the hardy wight who fought his way along ; blinding him with his own hair if he had enough to it , and wintry dust if he had n't ; stopping his breath as though he had been soused in a cold bath ; tearing aside his wrappings-up , and whistling in the very marrow of his bones ; but it would have done all this a hundred times more fiercely to a man in a gig , would n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 5]: A fig for gigs !
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 5]: Better than the gig !
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 15]: When were travellers by wheels and hoofs seen with such red-hot cheeks as those ?
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 9]: when were they so good-humouredly and merrily bloused ?
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 58]: when did their laughter ring upon the air , as they turned them round , what time the stronger gusts came sweeping up ; and , facing round again as they passed by , dashed on , in such a glow of ruddy health as nothing could keep pace with , but the high spirits it engendered ?
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 5]: Better than the gig !
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 15]: Why , here is a man in a gig coming the same way now .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 34]: Look at him as he passes his whip into his left hand , chafes his numbed right fingers on his granite leg , and beats those marble toes of his upon the foot-board .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 23]: Who would exchange this rapid hurry of the blood for yonder stagnant misery , though its pace were twenty miles for one ?
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 5]: Better than the gig !
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 13]: No man in a gig could have such interest in the milestones .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 21]: No man in a gig could see , or feel , or think , like merry users of their legs .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 31]: How , as the wind sweeps on , upon these breezy downs , it tracks its flight in darkening ripples on the grass , and smoothest shadows on the hills !
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 27]: Look round and round upon this bare bleak plain , and see even here , upon a winter 's day , how beautiful the shadows are !
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 11]: it is the nature of their kind to be so .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 29]: The loveliest things in life , Tom , are but shadows ; and they come and go , and change and fade away , as rapidly as these !
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 36]: Another mile , and then begins a fall of snow , making the crow , who skims away so close above the ground to shirk the wind , a blot of ink upon the landscape .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 56]: But though it drives and drifts against them as they walk , stiffening on their skirts , and freezing in the lashes of their eyes , they would n't have it fall more sparingly , no , not so much as by a single flake , although they had to go a score of miles .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 4]: And , lo !
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 13]: the towers of the Old Cathedral rise before them , even now !
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 92]: and by-and-bye they come into the sheltered streets , made strangely silent by their white carpet ; and so to the Inn for which they are bound ; where they present such flushed and burning faces to the cold waiter , and are so brimful of vigour , that he almost feels assaulted by their presence ; and , having nothing to oppose to the attack -LRB- being fresh , or rather stale , from the blazing fire in the coffee-room -RRB- , is quite put out of his pale countenance .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 4]: A famous Inn !
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 58]: the hall a very grove of dead game , and dangling joints of mutton ; and in one corner an illustrious larder , with glass doors , developing cold fowls and noble joints , and tarts wherein the raspberry jam coyly withdrew itself , as such a precious creature should , behind a lattice work of pastry .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 129]: And behold , on the first floor , at the court-end of the house , in a room with all the window-curtains drawn , a fire piled half-way up the chimney , plates warming before it , wax candles gleaming everywhere , and a table spread for three , with silver and glass enough for thirty -- John Westlock ; not the old John of Pecksniff 's , but a proper gentleman ; looking another and a grander person , with the consciousness of being his own master and having money in the bank ; and yet in some respects the old John too , for he seized Tom Pinch by both his hands the instant he appeared , and fairly hugged him , in his cordial welcome .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 13]: ` And this , ' said John , ` is Mr Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 9]: I am very glad to see him ! '
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 23]: -- John had an off-hand manner of his own ; so they shook hands warmly , and were friends in no time .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 34]: ` Stand off a moment , Tom , ' cried the old pupil , laying one hand on each of Mr Pinch 's shoulders , and holding him out at arm 's length .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 7]: ` Let me look at you !
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 4]: Just the same !
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 6]: Not a bit changed ! '
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 24]: ` Why , it 's not so very long ago , you know , ' said Tom Pinch , ` after all . '
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 12]: ` It seems an age to me , ' cried John .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 14]: ` and so it ought to seem to you , you dog . '
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 49]: And then he pushed Tom down into the easiest chair , and clapped him on the back so heartily , and so like his old self in their old bedroom at old Pecksniff 's that it was a toss-up with Tom Pinch whether he should laugh or cry .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 12]: Laughter won it ; and they all three laughed together . '
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 23]: I have ordered everything for dinner , that we used to say we 'd have , Tom , ' observed John Westlock .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 4]: said Tom Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 5]: ` Have you ? '
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 3]: ` Everything .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 14]: Do n't laugh , if you can help it , before the waiters .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 9]: I could n't when I was ordering it .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 7]: It 's like a dream . '
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 63]: John was wrong there , because nobody ever dreamed such soup as was put upon the table directly afterwards ; or such fish ; or such side-dishes ; or such a top and bottom ; or such a course of birds and sweets ; or in short anything approaching the reality of that entertainment at ten-and-sixpence a head , exclusive of wines .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 30]: As to THEM , the man who can dream such iced champagne , such claret , port , or sherry , had better go to bed and stop there .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 56]: But perhaps the finest feature of the banquet was , that nobody was half so much amazed by everything as John himself , who in his high delight was constantly bursting into fits of laughter , and then endeavouring to appear preternaturally solemn , lest the waiters should conceive he was n't used to it .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 96]: Some of the things they brought him to carve , were such outrageous practical jokes , though , that it was impossible to stand it ; and when Tom Pinch insisted , in spite of the deferential advice of an attendant , not only on breaking down the outer wall of a raised pie with a tablespoon , but on trying to eat it afterwards , John lost all dignity , and sat behind the gorgeous dish-cover at the head of the table , roaring to that extent that he was audible in the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 72]: Nor had he the least objection to laugh at himself , as he demonstrated when they had all three gathered round the fire and the dessert was on the table ; at which period the head waiter inquired with respectful solicitude whether that port , being a light and tawny wine , was suited to his taste , or whether he would wish to try a fruity port with greater body .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 38]: To this John gravely answered that he was well satisfied with what he had , which he esteemed , as one might say , a pretty tidy vintage ; for which the waiter thanked him and withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 34]: And then John told his friends , with a broad grin , that he supposed it was all right , but he did n't know ; and went off into a perfect shout .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 40]: They were very merry and full of enjoyment the whole time , but not the least pleasant part of the festival was when they all three sat about the fire , cracking nuts , drinking wine and talking cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 47]: It happened that Tom Pinch had a word to say to his friend the organist 's assistant , and so deserted his warm corner for a few minutes at this season , lest it should grow too late ; leaving the other two young men together .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 44]: They drank his health in his absence , of course ; and John Westlock took that opportunity of saying , that he had never had even a peevish word with Tom during the whole term of their residence in Mr Pecksniff 's house .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 22]: This naturally led him to dwell upon Tom 's character , and to hint that Mr Pecksniff understood it pretty well .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 38]: He only hinted this , and very distantly ; knowing that it pained Tom Pinch to have that gentleman disparaged , and thinking it would be as well to leave the new pupil to his own discoveries .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 22]: ` It 's impossible to like Pinch better than I do , or to do greater justice to his good qualities .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 11]: He is the most willing fellow I ever saw . '
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 17]: ` He 's rather too willing , ' observed John , who was quick in observation .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 10]: ` It 's quite a fault in him . '
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 9]: ` So it is , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 4]: ` Very true .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 34]: There was a fellow only a week or so ago -- a Mr Tigg -- who borrowed all the money he had , on a promise to repay it in a few days .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 29]: It was but half a sovereign , to be sure ; but it 's well it was no more , for he 'll never see it again . '
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 5]: ` Poor fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 13]: said John , who had been very attentive to these few words .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 23]: ` Perhaps you have not had an opportunity of observing that , in his own pecuniary transactions , Tom 's proud . '
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 7]: ` You do n't say so !
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 6]: No , I have n't .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 5]: What do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 6]: Wo n't he borrow ? '
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 6]: John Westlock shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 16]: ` That 's very odd , ' said Martin , setting down his empty glass .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 12]: ` He 's a strange compound , to be sure . '
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 23]: ` As to receiving money as a gift , ' resumed John Westlock ; ' I think he 'd die first . '
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 12]: ` He 's made up of simplicity , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 5]: ` Help yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 64]: ` You , however , ' pursued John , filling his own glass , and looking at his companion with some curiosity , ` who are older than the majority of Mr Pecksniff 's assistants , and have evidently had much more experience , understand him , I have no doubt , and see how liable he is to be imposed upon . '
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 23]: ` Certainly , ' said Martin , stretching out his legs , and holding his wine between his eye and the light .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 7]: ` Mr Pecksniff knows that too .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 5]: So do his daughters .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 3]: Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 9]: John Westlock smiled , but made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 14]: ` By the bye , ' said Martin , ` that reminds me .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 7]: What 's your opinion of Pecksniff ?
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 6]: How did he use you ?
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 8]: What do you think of him now ?
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 13]: -- Coolly , you know , when it 's all over ? '
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 10]: ` Ask Pinch , ' returned the old pupil .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 13]: ` He knows what my sentiments used to be upon the subject .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 10]: They are not changed , I assure you . '
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 19]: ` No , no , ' said Martin , ` I 'd rather have them from you . '
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 15]: ` But Pinch says they are unjust , ' urged John with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 2]: well !
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 27]: Then I know what course they take beforehand , ' said Martin ; ` and , therefore , you can have no delicacy in speaking plainly .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 8]: Do n't mind me , I beg .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 10]: I do n't like him I tell you frankly .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 15]: I am with him because it happens from particular circumstances to suit my convenience .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 30]: I have some ability , I believe , in that way ; and the obligation , if any , will most likely be on his side and not mine .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 20]: At the lowest mark , the balance will be even , and there 'll be no obligation at all .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 17]: So you may talk to me , as if I had no connection with him . '
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 15]: ` If you press me to give my opinion -- ' returned John Westlock .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 10]: ` Yes , I do , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 8]: ` You 'll oblige me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 26]: -- I should say , ' resumed the other , ` that he is the most consummate scoundrel on the face of the earth . '
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 8]: said Martin , as coolly as ever .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 7]: ` That 's rather strong . '
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 43]: ` Not stronger than he deserves , ' said John ; ` and if he called upon me to express my opinion of him to his face , I would do so in the very same terms , without the least qualification .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 110]: His treatment of Pinch is in itself enough to justify them ; but when I look back upon the five years I passed in that house , and remember the hyprocrisy , the knavery , the meannesses , the false pretences , the lip service of that fellow , and his trading in saintly semblances for the very worst realities ; when I remember how often I was the witness of all this and how often I was made a kind of party to it , by the fact of being there , with him for my teacher ; I swear to you that I almost despise myself . '
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 12]: Martin drained his glass , and looked at the fire . '
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 49]: I do n't mean to say that is a right feeling , ' pursued John Westlock ` because it was no fault of mine ; and I can quite understand -- you for instance , fully appreciating him , and yet being forced by circumstances to remain there .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 83]: I tell you simply what my feeling is ; and even now , when , as you say , it 's all over ; and when I have the satisfaction of knowing that he always hated me , and we always quarrelled , and I always told him my mind ; even now , I feel sorry that I did n't yield to an impulse I often had , as a boy , of running away from him and going abroad . '
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 5]: ` Why abroad ? '
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 10]: asked Martin , turning his eyes upon the speaker .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 25]: ` In search , ' replied John Westlock , shrugging his shoulders , ` of the livelihood I could n't have earned at home .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 9]: There would have been something spirited in that .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 4]: But , come !
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 11]: Fill your glass , and let us forget him . '
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 11]: ` As soon as you please , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 21]: ` In reference to myself and my connection with him , I have only to repeat what I said before .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 54]: I have taken my own way with him so far , and shall continue to do so , even more than ever ; for the fact is , to tell you the truth , that I believe he looks to me to supply his defects , and could n't afford to lose me .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 11]: I had a notion of that in first going there .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 4]: Your health ! '
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 9]: ` Thank you , ' returned young Westlock .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 3]: ` Yours .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 15]: And may the new pupil turn out as well as you can desire ! '
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 6]: ` What new pupil ? '
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 34]: ` The fortunate youth , born under an auspicious star , ' returned John Westlock , laughing ; ` whose parents , or guardians , are destined to be hooked by the advertisement .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 11]: Do n't you know that he has advertised again ? '
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 5]: ` Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 11]: I read it just before dinner in the old newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 15]: I know it to be his ; having some reason to remember the style .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 2]: Hush !
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 4]: Here 's Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 33]: Strange , is it not , that the more he likes Pecksniff -LRB- if he can like him better than he does -RRB- , the greater reason one has to like HIM ?
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 14]: Not a word more , or we shall spoil his whole enjoyment . '
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 60]: Tom entered as the words were spoken , with a radiant smile upon his face ; and rubbing his hands , more from a sense of delight than because he was cold -LRB- for he had been running fast -RRB- , sat down in his warm corner again , and was as happy as only Tom Pinch could be .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 13]: There is no other simile that will express his state of mind .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 34]: ` And so , ' he said , when he had gazed at his friend for some time in silent pleasure , ` so you really are a gentleman at last , John .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 7]: Well , to be sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 16]: ` Trying to be , Tom ; trying to be , ' he rejoined good-humouredly .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 16]: ` There is no saying what I may turn out , in time . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 15]: I suppose you would n't carry your own box to the mail now ? '
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 18]: said Tom Pinch , smiling ; ` although you lost it altogether by not taking it . '
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 6]: ` Would n't I ? '
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 3]: retorted John .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 11]: ` That 's all you know about it , Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 22]: It must be a very heavy box that I would n't carry to get away from Pecksniff 's , Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 13]: cried Pinch , turning to Martin , ' I told you so .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 12]: The great fault in his character is his injustice to Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 12]: You must n't mind a word he says on that subject .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 7]: His prejudice is most extraordinary . '
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 39]: ` The absence of anything like prejudice on Tom 's part , you know , ' said John Westlock , laughing heartily , as he laid his hand on Mr Pinch 's shoulder , ` is perfectly wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 35]: If one man ever had a profound knowledge of another , and saw him in a true light , and in his own proper colours , Tom has that knowledge of Mr Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 12]: ` Why , of course I have , ' cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 13]: ` That 's exactly what I have so often said to you .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 33]: If you knew him as well as I do -- John , I 'd give almost any money to bring that about -- you 'd admire , respect , and reverence him .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 6]: You could n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 13]: Oh , how you wounded his feelings when you went away ! '
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 37]: ` If I had known whereabout his feelings lay , ' retorted young Westlock , ` I 'd have done my best , Tom , with that end in view , you may depend upon it .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 48]: But as I could n't wound him in what he has not , and in what he knows nothing of , except in his ability to probe them to the quick in other people , I am afraid I can lay no claim to your compliment . '
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 52]: Mr Pinch , being unwilling to protract a discussion which might possibly corrupt Martin , forbore to say anything in reply to this speech ; but John Westlock , whom nothing short of an iron gag would have silenced when Mr Pecksniff 's merits were once in question , continued notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 4]: ` HIS feelings !
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 8]: Oh , he 's a tender-hearted man .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 3]: HIS feelings !
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 17]: Oh , he 's a considerate , conscientious , self-examining , moral vagabond , he is !
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 3]: HIS feelings !
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 9]: -- what 's the matter , Tom ? '
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 19]: Mr Pinch was by this time erect upon the hearth-rug , buttoning his coat with great energy . '
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 14]: I ca n't bear it , ' said Tom , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 5]: I really can not .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 7]: You must excuse me , John .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 43]: I have a great esteem and friendship for you ; I love you very much ; and have been perfectly charmed and overjoyed to-day , to find you just the same as ever ; but I can not listen to this . '
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 25]: ` Why , it 's my old way , Tom ; and you say yourself that you are glad to find me unchanged . '
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 11]: ` Not in this respect , ' said Tom Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 8]: ` You must excuse me , John .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 10]: I can not , really ; I will not .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 14]: It 's very wrong ; you should be more guarded in your expressions .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 27]: It was bad enough when you and I used to be alone together , but under existing circumstances , I ca n't endure it , really .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 7]: I can not , indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 7]: ` You are quite right ! '
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 9]: exclaimed the other , exchanging looks with Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 9]: ` and I am quite wrong , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 14]: I do n't know how the deuce we fell on this unlucky theme .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 10]: I beg your pardon with all my heart . '
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 36]: ` You have a free and manly temper , I know , ' said Pinch ; ` and therefore , your being so ungenerous in this one solitary instance , only grieves me the more .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 12]: It 's not my pardon you have to ask , John .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 9]: You have done ME nothing but kindnesses . '
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 10]: Pecksniff 's pardon then , ' said young Westlock .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 7]: ` Anything Tom , or anybody .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 8]: Pecksniff 's pardon -- will that do ?
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 2]: Here !
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 8]: let us drink Pecksniff 's health ! '
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 19]: ` Thank you , ' cried Tom , shaking hands with him eagerly , and filling a bumper .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 15]: ` Thank you ; I 'll drink it with all my heart , John .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 11]: Mr Pecksniff 's health , and prosperity to him ! '
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 31]: John Westlock echoed the sentiment , or nearly so ; for he drank Mr Pecksniff 's health , and Something to him -- but what , was not quite audible .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 27]: The general unanimity being then completely restored , they drew their chairs closer round the fire , and conversed in perfect harmony and enjoyment until bed-time .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 42]: No slight circumstance , perhaps , could have better illustrated the difference of character between John Westlock and Martin Chuzzlewit , than the manner in which each of the young men contemplated Tom Pinch , after the little rupture just described .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 22]: There was a certain amount of jocularity in the looks of both , no doubt , but there all resemblance ceased .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 32]: The old pupil could not do enough to show Tom how cordially he felt towards him , and his friendly regard seemed of a graver and more thoughtful kind than before .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 73]: The new one , on the other hand , had no impulse but to laugh at the recollection of Tom 's extreme absurdity ; and mingled with his amusement there was something slighting and contemptuous , indicative , as it appeared , of his opinion that Mr Pinch was much too far gone in simplicity to be admitted as the friend , on serious and equal terms , of any rational man .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 36]: John Westlock , who did nothing by halves , if he could help it , had provided beds for his two guests in the hotel ; and after a very happy evening , they retired .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 47]: Mr Pinch was sitting on the side of his bed with his cravat and shoes off , ruminating on the manifold good qualities of his old friend , when he was interrupted by a knock at his chamber door , and the voice of John himself .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 13]: ` You 're not asleep yet , are you , Tom ? '
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 6]: ` Bless you , no !
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 16]: not I. I was thinking of you , ' replied Tom , opening the door .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 6]: ` Come in . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 47]: I am not going to detail you , ' said John ; ` but I have forgotten all the evening a little commission I took upon myself ; and I am afraid I may forget it again , if I fail to discharge it at once .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 12]: You know a Mr Tigg , Tom , I believe ? '
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 4]: ` Tigg ! '
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 3]: ` Tigg !
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 10]: The gentleman who borrowed some money of me ? '
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 8]: ` Exactly , ' said John Westlock .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 17]: ` He begged me to present his compliments , and to return it with many thanks .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 4]: Here it is .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 21]: I suppose it 's a good one , but he is rather a doubtful kind of customer , Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 28]: Mr Pinch received the little piece of gold with a face whose brightness might have shamed the metal ; and said he had no fear about that .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 22]: He was glad , he added , to find Mr Tigg so prompt and honourable in his dealings ; very glad .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 23]: ` Why , to tell you the truth , Tom , ' replied his friend , ` he is not always so .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 26]: If you 'll take my advice , you 'll avoid him as much as you can , in the event of your encountering him again .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 29]: And by no means , Tom -- pray bear this in mind , for I am very serious -- by no means lend him money any more . '
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 6]: ` Aye , aye ! '
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 9]: said Tom , with his eyes wide open .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 37]: ` He is very far from being a reputable acquaintance , ' returned young Westlock ; ` and the more you let him know you think so , the better for you , Tom . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 26]: I say , John , ' quoth Mr Pinch , as his countenance fell , and he shook his head in a dejected manner . '
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 11]: I hope you are not getting into bad company . '
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 10]: ` No , no , ' he replied laughing .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 10]: ` Do n't be uneasy on that score . '
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 29]: ` Oh , but I AM uneasy , ' said Tom Pinch ; ' I ca n't help it , when I hear you talking in that way .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 21]: If Mr Tigg is what you describe him to be , you have no business to know him , John .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 22]: You may laugh , but I do n't consider it by any means a laughing matter , I assure you . '
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 14]: ` No , no , ' returned his friend , composing his features .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 4]: ` Quite right .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 7]: It is not , certainly . '
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 38]: ` You know , John , ' said Mr Pinch , ` your very good nature and kindness of heart make you thoughtless , and you ca n't be too careful on such a point as this .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 34]: Upon my word , if I thought you were falling among bad companions , I should be quite wretched , for I know how difficult you would find it to shake them off .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 25]: I would much rather have lost this money , John , than I would have had it back again on such terms . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 60]: I tell you , my dear good old fellow , ' cried his friend , shaking him to and fro with both hands , and smiling at him with a cheerful , open countenance , that would have carried conviction to a mind much more suspicious than Tom 's ; ' I tell you there is no danger . '
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 18]: cried Tom , ' I am glad to hear it ; I am overjoyed to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 15]: I am sure there is not , when you say so in that manner .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 19]: You wo n't take it ill , John , that I said what I did just now ! '
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 4]: ` Ill ! '
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 22]: said the other , giving his hand a hearty squeeze ; ` why what do you think I am made of ?
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 30]: Mr Tigg and I are not on such an intimate footing that you need be at all uneasy , I give you my solemn assurance of that , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 7]: You are quite comfortable now ? '
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 7]: ` Quite , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 9]: ` Then once more , good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 5]: ` Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 25]: cried Tom ; ` and such pleasant dreams to you as should attend the sleep of the best fellow in the world ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 22]: -- Except Pecksniff , ' said his friend , stopping at the door for a moment , and looking gayly back .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 17]: ` Except Pecksniff , ' answered Tom , with great gravity ; ` of course . '
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 64]: And thus they parted for the night ; John Westlock full of light-heartedness and good humour , and poor Tom Pinch quite satisfied ; though still , as he turned over on his side in bed , he muttered to himself , ' I really do wish , for all that , though , that he was n't acquainted with Mr Tigg . '
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 36]: They breakfasted together very early next morning , for the two young men desired to get back again in good season ; and John Westlock was to return to London by the coach that day .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 32]: As he had some hours to spare , he bore them company for three or four miles on their walk , and only parted from them at last in sheer necessity .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 48]: The parting was an unusually hearty one , not only as between him and Tom Pinch , but on the side of Martin also , who had found in the old pupil a very different sort of person from the milksop he had prepared himself to expect .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 20]: Young Westlock stopped upon a rising ground , when he had gone a little distance , and looked back .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 16]: They were walking at a brisk pace , and Tom appeared to be talking earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 21]: Martin had taken off his greatcoat , the wind being now behind them , and carried it upon his arm .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 33]: As he looked , he saw Tom relieve him of it , after a faint resistance , and , throwing it upon his own , encumber himself with the weight of both .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 50]: This trivial incident impressed the old pupil mightily , for he stood there , gazing after them , until they were hidden from his view ; when he shook his head , as if he were troubled by some uneasy reflection , and thoughtfully retraced his steps to Salisbury .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 47]: In the meantime , Martin and Tom pursued their way , until they halted , safe and sound , at Mr Pecksniff 's house , where a brief epistle from that good gentleman to Mr Pinch announced the family 's return by that night 's coach .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 42]: As it would pass the corner of the lane at about six o'clock in the morning , Mr Pecksniff requested that the gig might be in waiting at the finger-post about that time , together with a cart for the luggage .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 29]: And to the end that he might be received with the greater honour , the young men agreed to rise early , and be upon the spot themselves .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 12]: It was the least cheerful day they had yet passed together .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 33]: Martin was out of spirits and out of humour , and took every opportunity of comparing his condition and prospects with those of young Westlock ; much to his own disadvantage always .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 25]: This mood of his depressed Tom ; and neither that morning 's parting , nor yesterday 's dinner , helped to mend the matter .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 18]: So the hours dragged on heavily enough ; and they were glad to go to bed early .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 45]: They were not quite so glad to get up again at half-past four o'clock , in all the shivering discomfort of a dark winter 's morning ; but they turned out punctually , and were at the finger-post full half-an-hour before the appointed time .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 68]: It was not by any means a lively morning , for the sky was black and cloudy , and it rained hard ; but Martin said there was some satisfaction in seeing that brute of a horse -LRB- by this , he meant Mr Pecksniff 's Arab steed -RRB- getting very wet ; and that he rejoiced , on his account , that it rained so fast .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 83]: From this it may be inferred that Martin 's spirits had not improved , as indeed they had not ; for while he and Mr Pinch stood waiting under a hedge , looking at the rain , the gig , the cart , and its reeking driver , he did nothing but grumble ; and , but that it is indispensable to any dispute that there should be two parties to it , he would certainly have picked a quarrel with Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 55]: At length the noise of wheels was faintly audible in the distance and presently the coach came splashing through the mud and mire with one miserable outside passenger crouching down among wet straw , under a saturated umbrella ; and the coachman , guard , and horses , in a fellowship of dripping wretchedness .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 16]: Immediately on its stopping , Mr Pecksniff let down the window-glass and hailed Tom Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 7]: ` Dear me , Mr Pinch !
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 14]: Is it possible that you are out upon this very inclement morning ? '
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 21]: ` Yes , sir , ' cried Tom , advancing eagerly , ` Mr Chuzzlewit and I , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 19]: said Mr Pecksniff , looking not so much at Martin as at the spot on which he stood .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 2]: Indeed .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 18]: Do me the favour to see to the trunks , if you please , Mr Pinch . '
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 53]: Then Mr Pecksniff descended , and helped his daughters to alight ; but neighter he nor the young ladies took the slightest notice of Martin , who had advanced to offer his assistance , but was repulsed by Mr Pecksniff 's standing immediately before his person , with his back towards him .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 31]: In the same manner , and in profound silence , Mr Pecksniff handed his daughters into the gig ; and following himself and taking the reins , drove off home .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 55]: Lost in astonishment , Martin stood staring at the coach , and when the coach had driven away , at Mr Pinch , and the luggage , until the cart moved off too ; when he said to Tom : ` Now will you have the goodness to tell me what THIS portends ? '
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 4]: ` What ? '
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 3]: asked Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 6]: ` This fellow 's behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 7]: Mr Pecksniff 's , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 5]: You saw it ? '
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 10]: Indeed I did not , ' cried Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 8]: I was busy with the trunks . '
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 10]: ` It is no matter , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 3]: ` Come !
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 7]: Let us make haste back ! '
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 22]: And without another word started off at such a pace , that Tom had some difficulty in keeping up with him .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 40]: He had no care where he went , but walked through little heaps of mud and little pools of water with the utmost indifference ; looking straight before him , and sometimes laughing in a strange manner within himself .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 52]: Tom felt that anything he could say would only render him the more obstinate , and therefore trusted to Mr Pecksniff 's manner when they reached the house , to remove the mistaken impression under which he felt convinced so great a favourite as the new pupil must unquestionably be labouring .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 78]: But he was not a little amazed himself , when they did reach it , and entered the parlour where Mr Pecksniff was sitting alone before the fire , drinking some hot tea , to find that instead of taking favourable notice of his relative and keeping him , Mr Pinch , in the background , he did exactly the reverse , and was so lavish in his attentions to Tom , that Tom was thoroughly confounded .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 20]: ` Take some tea , Mr Pinch -- take some tea , ' said Pecksniff , stirring the fire .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 9]: ` You must be very cold and damp .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 16]: Pray take some tea , and come into a warm place , Mr Pinch . '
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 49]: Tom saw that Martin looked at Mr Pecksniff as though he could have easily found it in his heart to give HIM an invitation to a very warm place ; but he was quite silent , and standing opposite that gentleman at the table , regarded him attentively .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 11]: ` Take a chair , Pinch , ' said Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 9]: ` Take a chair , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 13]: How have things gone on in our absence , Mr Pinch ? '
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 19]: ` You -- you will be very much pleased with the grammar-school , sir , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 7]: ` It 's nearly finished . '
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 34]: ` If you will have the goodness , Mr Pinch , ' said Pecksniff , waving his hand and smiling , ` we will not discuss anything connected with that question at present .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 11]: What have YOU been doing , Thomas , humph ? '
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 31]: Mr Pinch looked from master to pupil , and from pupil to master , and was so perplexed and dismayed that he wanted presence of mind to answer the question .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 46]: In this awkward interval , Mr Pecksniff -LRB- who was perfectly conscious of Martin 's gaze , though he had never once glanced towards him -RRB- poked the fire very much , and when he could n't do that any more , drank tea assiduously .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 44]: ` Now , Mr Pecksniff , ' said Martin at last , in a very quiet voice , ` if you have sufficiently refreshed and recovered yourself , I shall be glad to hear what you mean by this treatment of me . '
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 36]: ` And what , ' said Mr Pecksniff , turning his eyes on Tom Pinch , even more placidly and gently than before , ` what have YOU been doing , Thomas , humph ? '
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 35]: When he had repeated this inquiry , he looked round the walls of the room as if he were curious to see whether any nails had been left there by accident in former times .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 51]: Tom was almost at his wit 's end what to say between the two , and had already made a gesture as if he would call Mr Pecksniff 's attention to the gentleman who had last addressed him , when Martin saved him further trouble , by doing so himself .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 44]: ` Mr Pecksniff , ' he said , softly rapping the table twice or thrice , and moving a step or two nearer , so that he could have touched him with his hand ; ` you heard what I said just now .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 11]: Do me the favour to reply , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 22]: I ask you ' -- he raised his voice a little here -- ` what you mean by this ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 31]: I will talk to you , sir , ' said Mr Pecksniff in a severe voice , as he looked at him for the first time , ` presently . '
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 16]: ` You are very obliging , ' returned Martin ; ` presently will not do .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 12]: I must trouble you to talk to me at once . '
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 24]: Mr Pecksniff made a feint of being deeply interested in his pocketbook , but it shook in his hands ; he trembled so .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 12]: ` Now , ' retorted Martin , rapping the table again .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 3]: ` Now .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 5]: Presently will not do .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 3]: Now ! '
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 9]: ` Do you threaten me , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 4]: cried Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 43]: Martin looked at him , and made no answer ; but a curious observer might have detected an ominous twitching at his mouth , and perhaps an involuntary attraction of his right hand in the direction of Mr Pecksniff 's cravat . '
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 32]: I lament to be obliged to say , sir , ' resumed Mr Pecksniff , ` that it would be quite in keeping with your character if you did threaten me .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 5]: You have deceived me .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 15]: You have imposed upon a nature which you knew to be confiding and unsuspicious .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 28]: You have obtained admission , sir , ' said Mr Pecksniff , rising , ` to this house , on perverted statements and on false pretences . '
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 14]: ` Go on , ' said Martin , with a scornful smile . '
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 5]: I understand you now .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 4]: What more ? '
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 32]: ` Thus much more , sir , ' cried Mr Pecksniff , trembling from head to foot , and trying to rub his hands , as though he were only cold .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 27]: ` Thus much more , if you force me to publish your shame before a third party , which I was unwilling and indisposed to do .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 84]: This lowly roof , sir , must not be contaminated by the presence of one who has deceived , and cruelly deceived , an honourable , beloved , venerated , and venerable gentleman ; and who wisely suppressed that deceit from me when he sought my protection and favour , knowing that , humble as I am , I am an honest man , seeking to do my duty in this carnal universe , and setting my face against all vice and treachery .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 64]: I weep for your depravity , sir , ' said Mr Pecksniff ; ' I mourn over your corruption , I pity your voluntary withdrawal of yourself from the flowery paths of purity and peace ; ' here he struck himself upon his breast , or moral garden ; ` but I can not have a leper and a serpent for an inmate .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 20]: Go forth , ' said Mr Pecksniff , stretching out his hand : ` go forth , young man !
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 11]: Like all who know you , I renounce you ! '
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 18]: With what intention Martin made a stride forward at these words , it is impossible to say .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 75]: It is enough to know that Tom Pinch caught him in his arms , and that , at the same moment , Mr Pecksniff stepped back so hastily , that he missed his footing , tumbled over a chair , and fell in a sitting posture on the ground ; where he remained without an effort to get up again , with his head in a corner , perhaps considering it the safest place .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 8]: ` Let me go , Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 7]: cried Martin , shaking him away .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 7]: ` Why do you hold me ?
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 16]: Do you think a blow could make him a more abject creature than he is ?
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 22]: Do you think that if I spat upon him , I could degrade him to a lower level than his own ?
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 4]: Look at him .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 7]: Look at him , Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 6]: Mr Pinch involuntarily did so .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 55]: Mr Pecksniff sitting , as has been already mentioned , on the carpet , with his head in an acute angle of the wainscot , and all the damage and detriment of an uncomfortable journey about him , was not exactly a model of all that is prepossessing and dignified in man , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 20]: Still he WAS Pecksniff ; it was impossible to deprive him of that unique and paramount appeal to Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 24]: And he returned Tom 's glance , as if he would have said , ` Aye , Mr Pinch , look at me !
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 4]: Here I am !
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 29]: You know what the Poet says about an honest man ; and an honest man is one of the few great works that can be seen for nothing !
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 6]: Look at me ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 55]: I tell you , ' said Martin , ` that as he lies there , disgraced , bought , used ; a cloth for dirty hands , a mat for dirty feet , a lying , fawning , servile hound , he is the very last and worst among the vermin of the world .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 6]: And mark me , Pinch !
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 20]: The day will come -- he knows it ; see it written on his face , while I speak !
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 24]: -- when even you will find him out , and will know him as I do , and as he knows I do .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 4]: HE renounce ME !
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 18]: Cast your eyes on the Renouncer , Pinch , and be the wiser for the recollection ! '
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 29]: He pointed at him as he spoke , with unutterable contempt , and flinging his hat upon his head , walked from the room and from the house .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 26]: He went so rapidly that he was already clear of the village , when he heard Tom Pinch calling breathlessly after him in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 4]: what now ? '
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 8]: he said , when Tom came up .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 6]: ` Dear , dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 9]: cried Tom , ` are you going ? '
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 4]: ` Going ! '
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 3]: he echoed .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 5]: ` Going ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 33]: I did n't so much mean that , as were you going now at once -- in this bad weather -- on foot -- without your clothes -- with no money ? '
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 13]: ` Yes , ' he answered sternly , ' I am . '
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 5]: ` And where ? '
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 9]: ` Oh where will you go ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 9]: I do n't know , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 6]: ` Yes , I do .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 7]: I 'll go to America ! '
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 15]: ` No , no , ' cried Tom , in a kind of agony .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 6]: ` Do n't go there .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 4]: Pray do n't .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 5]: Think better of it .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 9]: Do n't be so dreadfully regardless of yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 7]: Do n't go to America ! '
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 11]: ` My mind is made up , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 6]: ` Your friend was right .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 6]: I 'll go to America .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 7]: God bless you , Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 5]: ` Take this ! '
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 13]: cried Tom , pressing a book upon him in great agitation . '
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 14]: I must make haste back , and ca n't say anything I would .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 5]: Heaven be with you .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 9]: Look at the leaf I have turned down .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 5]: Good-bye , good-bye ! '
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 25]: The simple fellow wrung him by the hand , with tears stealing down his cheeks ; and they parted hurriedly upon their separate ways .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 86]: CHAPTER THIRTEEN SHOWING WHAT BECAME OF MARTIN AND HIS DESPARATE RESOLVE , AFTER HE LEFT MR PECKSNIFF 'S HOUSE ; WHAT PERSONS HE ENCOUNTERED ; WHAT ANXIETIES HE SUFFERED ; AND WHAT NEWS HE HEARD Carrying Tom Pinch 's book quite unconsciously under his arm , and not even buttoning his coat as a protection against the heavy rain , Martin went doggedly forward at the same quick pace , until he had passed the finger-post , and was on the high road to London .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 39]: He slackened very little in his speed even then , but he began to think , and look about him , and to disengage his senses from the coil of angry passions which hitherto had held them prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 25]: It must be confessed that , at that moment , he had no very agreeable employment either for his moral or his physical perceptions .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 35]: The day was dawning from a patch of watery light in the east , and sullen clouds came driving up before it , from which the rain descended in a thick , wet mist .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 40]: It streamed from every twig and bramble in the hedge ; made little gullies in the path ; ran down a hundred channels in the road ; and punched innumerable holes into the face of every pond and gutter .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 25]: It fell with an oozy , slushy sound among the grass ; and made a muddy kennel of every furrow in the ploughed fields .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 9]: No living creature was anywhere to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 28]: The prospect could hardly have been more desolate if animated nature had been dissolved in water , and poured down upon the earth again in that form .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 17]: The range of view within the solitary traveller was quite as cheerless as the scene without .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 48]: Friendless and penniless ; incensed to the last degree ; deeply wounded in his pride and self-love ; full of independent schemes , and perfectly destitute of any means of realizing them ; his most vindictive enemy might have been satisfied with the extent of his troubles .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 27]: To add to his other miseries , he was by this time sensible of being wet to the skin , and cold at his very heart .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 32]: In this deplorable condition he remembered Mr Pinch 's book ; more because it was rather troublesome to carry , than from any hope of being comforted by that parting gift .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 39]: He looked at the dingy lettering on the back , and finding it to be an odd volume of the ` Bachelor of Salamanca , ' in the French tongue , cursed Tom Pinch 's folly twenty times .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 69]: He was on the point of throwing it away , in his ill-humour and vexation , when he bethought himself that Tom had referred him to a leaf , turned down ; and opening it at that place , that he might have additional cause of complaint against him for supposing that any cold scrap of the Bachelor 's wisdom could cheer him in such circumstances , found !
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 5]: -- Well , well !
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 8]: not much , but Tom 's all .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 3]: The half-sovereign .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 18]: He had wrapped it hastily in a piece of paper , and pinned it to the leaf .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 18]: These words were scrawled in pencil on the inside : ' I do n't want it indeed .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 15]: I should not know what to do with it if I had it . '
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 20]: There are some falsehoods , Tom , on which men mount , as on bright wings , towards Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 30]: There are some truths , cold bitter taunting truths , wherein your worldly scholars are very apt and punctual , which bind men down to earth with leaden chains .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 44]: Who would not rather have to fan him , in his dying hour , the lightest feather of a falsehood such as thine , than all the quills that have been plucked from the sharp porcupine , reproachful truth , since time began !
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 17]: Martin felt keenly for himself , and he felt this good deed of Tom 's keenly .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 44]: After a few minutes it had the effect of raising his spirits , and reminding him that he was not altogether destitute , as he had left a fair stock of clothes behind him , and wore a gold hunting-watch in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 49]: He found a curious gratification , too , in thinking what a winning fellow he must be to have made such an impression on Tom ; and in reflecting how superior he was to Tom ; and how much more likely to make his way in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 45]: Animated by these thoughts , and strengthened in his design of endeavouring to push his fortune in another country , he resolved to get to London as a rallying-point , in the best way he could ; and to lose no time about it .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 54]: He was ten good miles from the village made illustrious by being the abiding-place of Mr Pecksniff , when he stopped to breakfast at a little roadside alehouse ; and resting upon a high-backed settle before the fire , pulled off his coat , and hung it before the cheerful blaze to dry .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 112]: It was a very different place from the last tavern in which he had regaled ; boasting no greater extent of accommodation than the brick-floored kitchen yielded ; but the mind so soon accommodates itself to the necessities of the body , that this poor waggoner 's house-of-call , which he would have despised yesterday , became now quite a choice hotel ; while his dish of eggs and bacon , and his mug of beer , were not by any means the coarse fare he had supposed , but fully bore out the inscription on the window-shutter , which proclaimed those viands to be ` Good entertainment for Travellers . '
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 28]: He pushed away his empty plate ; and with a second mug upon the hearth before him , looked thoughtfully at the fire until his eyes ached .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 66]: Then he looked at the highly-coloured scripture pieces on the walls , in little black frames like common shaving-glasses , and saw how the Wise Men -LRB- with a strong family likeness among them -RRB- worshipped in a pink manger ; and how the Prodigal Son came home in red rags to a purple father , and already feasted his imagination on a sea-green calf .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 54]: Then he glanced through the window at the falling rain , coming down aslant upon the sign-post over against the house , and overflowing the horse-trough ; and then he looked at the fire again , and seemed to descry a double distant London , retreating among the fragments of the burning wood .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 76]: He had repeated this process in just the same order , many times , as if it were a matter of necessity , when the sound of wheels called his attention to the window out of its regular turn ; and there he beheld a kind of light van drawn by four horses , and laden , as well as he could see -LRB- for it was covered in -RRB- , with corn and straw .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 37]: The driver , who was alone , stopped at the door to water his team , and presently came stamping and shaking the wet off his hat and coat , into the room where Martin sat .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 19]: He was a red-faced burly young fellow ; smart in his way , and with a good-humoured countenance .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 39]: As he advanced towards the fire he touched his shining forehead with the forefinger of his stiff leather glove , by way of salutation ; and said -LRB- rather unnecessarily -RRB- that it was an uncommon wet day .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 9]: ` Very wet , ' said Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 13]: I do n't know as ever I see a wetter . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 9]: I never felt one , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 46]: The driver glanced at Martin 's soiled dress , and his damp shirt-sleeves , and his coat hung up to dry ; and said , after a pause , as he warmed his hands : ` You have been caught in it , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 9]: ` Yes , ' was the short reply .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 7]: ` Out riding , maybe ? '
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 24]: said the driver ' I should have been , if I owned a horse ; but I do n't , ' returned Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 10]: ` That 's bad , ' said the driver .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 10]: ` And may be worse , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 49]: Now the driver said ` That 's bad , ' not so much because Martin did n't own a horse , as because he said he did n't with all the reckless desperation of his mood and circumstances , and so left a great deal to be inferred .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 62]: Martin put his hands in his pockets and whistled when he had retorted on the driver ; thus giving him to understand that he did n't care a pin for Fortune ; that he was above pretending to be her favourite when he was not ; and that he snapped his fingers at her , the driver , and everybody else .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 22]: The driver looked at him stealthily for a minute or so ; and in the pauses of his warming whistled too .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 14]: At length he asked , as he pointed his thumb towards the road .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 6]: ` Up or down ? '
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 6]: ` Which IS up ? '
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 11]: ` London , of course , ' said the driver .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 8]: ` Up then , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 26]: He tossed his head in a careless manner afterwards , as if he would have added , ` Now you know all about it . '
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 18]: put his hands deeper into his pockets ; changed his tune , and whistled a little louder .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 21]: ` I 'm going up , ' observed the driver ; ` Hounslow , ten miles this side London . '
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 5]: ` Are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 10]: cried Martin , stopping short and looking at him .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 26]: The driver sprinkled the fire with his wet hat until it hissed again and answered , ` Aye , to be sure he was . '
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 17]: ` Why , then , ' said Martin , ` I 'll be plain with you .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 13]: You may suppose from my dress that I have money to spare .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 4]: I have not .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 16]: All I can afford for coach-hire is a crown , for I have but two .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 19]: If you can take me for that , and my waistcoat , or this silk handkerchief , do .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 10]: If you ca n't , leave it alone . '
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 10]: ` Short and sweet , ' remarked the driver .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 6]: ` You want more ? '
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 24]: ` Then I have n't got more , and I ca n't get it , so there 's an end of that . '
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 8]: Whereupon he began to whistle again . '
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 12]: I did n't say I wanted more , did I ? '
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 9]: asked the driver , with something like indignation .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 14]: ` You did n't say my offer was enough , ' rejoined Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 14]: ` Why , how could I , when you would n't let me ?
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 60]: In regard to the waistcoat , I would n't have a man 's waistcoat , much less a gentleman 's waistcoat , on my mind , for no consideration ; but the silk handkerchief 's another thing ; and if you was satisfied when we got to Hounslow , I should n't object to that as a gift . '
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 9]: ` Is it a bargain , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 11]: ` Yes , it is , ' returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 37]: ` Then finish this beer , ' said Martin , handing him the mug , and pulling on his coat with great alacrity ; ` and let us be off as soon as you like . '
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 71]: In two minutes more he had paid his bill , which amounted to a shilling ; was lying at full length on a truss of straw , high and dry at the top of the van , with the tilt a little open in front for the convenience of talking to his new friend ; and was moving along in the right direction with a most satisfactory and encouraging briskness .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 54]: The driver 's name , as he soon informed Martin , was William Simmons , better known as Bill ; and his spruce appearance was sufficiently explained by his connection with a large stage-coaching establishment at Hounslow , whither he was conveying his load from a farm belonging to the concern in Wiltshire .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 42]: He was frequently up and down the road on such errands , he said , and to look after the sick and rest horses , of which animals he had much to relate that occupied a long time in the telling .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 19]: He aspired to the dignity of the regular box , and expected an appointment on the first vacancy .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 41]: He was musical besides , and had a little key-bugle in his pocket , on which , whenever the conversation flagged , he played the first part of a great many tunes , and regularly broke down in the second .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 52]: said Bill , with a sigh , as he drew the back of his hand across his lips , and put this instrument in his pocket , after screwing off the mouth-piece to drain it ; ` Lummy Ned of the Light Salisbury , HE was the one for musical talents .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 5]: He WAS a guard .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 14]: What you may call a Guard ` an Angel , was Ned . '
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 6]: ` Is he dead ? '
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 3]: asked Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 4]: ` Dead ! '
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 9]: replied the other , with a contemptuous emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 4]: ` Not he .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 8]: You wo n't catch Ned a-dying easy .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 4]: No , no .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 7]: He knows better than that . '
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 23]: ` You spoke of him in the past tense , ' observed Martin , ` so I supposed he was no more .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 20]: ` He 's no more in England , ' said Bill , ` if that 's what you mean .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 8]: He went to the U-nited States . '
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 5]: ` Did he ? '
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 7]: asked Martin , with sudden interest .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 4]: ` When ? '
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 13]: ` Five year ago , or then about , ' said Bill .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 44]: ` He had set up in the public line here , and could n't meet his engagements , so he cut off to Liverpool one day , without saying anything about it , and went and shipped himself for the U-nited States . '
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 4]: ` Well ? '
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 27]: as he landed there without a penny to bless himself with , of course they wos very glad to see him in the U-nited States . '
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 7]: asked Martin , with some scorn .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 7]: ` What do I mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 3]: said Bill .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 5]: ` Why , THAT .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 13]: All men are alike in the U-nited States , a n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 17]: It makes no odds whether a man has a thousand pound , or nothing , there .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 14]: Particular in New York , I 'm told , where Ned landed . '
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 8]: ` New York , was it ? '
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 5]: asked Martin , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' said Bill .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 4]: ` New York .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 33]: I know that , because he sent word home that it brought Old York to his mind , quite vivid , in consequence of being so exactly unlike it in every respect .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 56]: I do n't understand what particular business Ned turned his mind to , when he got there ; but he wrote home that him and his friends was always a-singing , Ale Columbia , and blowing up the President , so I suppose it was something in the public line ; or free-and-easy way again .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 8]: Anyhow , he made his fortune . '
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 3]: cried Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 11]: ` Yes , he did , ' said Bill . '
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 19]: I know that , because he lost it all the day after , in six-and-twenty banks as broke .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 29]: He settled a lot of the notes on his father , when it was ascertained that they was really stopped and sent 'em over with a dutiful letter .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 30]: I know that , because they was shown down our yard for the old gentleman 's benefit , that he might treat himself with tobacco in the workus . '
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 24]: ` He was a foolish fellow not to take care of his money when he had it , ' said Martin , indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 41]: ` There you 're right , ' said Bill , ` especially as it was all in paper , and he might have took care of it so very easy , by folding it up in a small parcel . '
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 21]: Martin said nothing in reply , but soon afterwards fell asleep , and remained so for an hour or more .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 81]: When he awoke , finding it had ceased to rain , he took his seat beside the driver , and asked him several questions ; as how long had the fortunate guard of the Light Salisbury been in crossing the Atlantic ; at what time of the year had he sailed ; what was the name of the ship in which he made the voyage ; how much had he paid for passage-money ; did he suffer greatly from sea-sickness ?
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 4]: and so forth .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 55]: But on these points of detail his friend was possessed of little or no information ; either answering obviously at random or acknowledging that he had never heard , or had forgotten ; nor , although he returned to the charge very often , could he obtain any useful intelligence on these essential particulars .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 65]: They jogged on all day , and stopped so often -- now to refresh , now to change their team of horses , now to exchange or bring away a set of harness , now on one point of business , and now upon another , connected with the coaching on that line of road -- that it was midnight when they reached Hounslow .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 59]: A little short of the stables for which the van was bound , Martin got down , paid his crown , and forced his silk handkerchief upon his honest friend , notwithstanding the many protestations that he did n't wish to deprive him of it , with which he tried to give the lie to his longing looks .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 53]: That done , they parted company ; and when the van had driven into its own yard and the gates were closed , Martin stood in the dark street , with a pretty strong sense of being shut out , alone , upon the dreary world , without the key of it .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 40]: But in this moment of despondency , and often afterwards , the recollection of Mr Pecksniff operated as a cordial to him ; awakening in his breast an indignation that was very wholesome in nerving him to obstinate endurance .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 16]: Under the influence of this fiery dram he started off for London without more ado .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 32]: Arriving there in the middle of the night , and not knowing where to find a tavern open , he was fain to stroll about the streets and market-places until morning .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 57]: He found himself , about an hour before dawn , in the humbler regions of the Adelphi ; and addressing himself to a man in a fur-cap , who was taking down the shutters of an obscure public-house , informed him that he was a stranger , and inquired if he could have a bed there .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 9]: It happened by good luck that he could .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 32]: Though none of the gaudiest , it was tolerably clean , and Martin felt very glad and grateful when he crept into it , for warmth , rest , and forgetfulness .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 32]: It was quite late in the afternoon when he awoke ; and by the time he had washed and dressed , and broken his fast , it was growing dusk again .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 27]: This was all the better , for it was now a matter of absolute necessity that he should part with his watch to some obliging pawn-broker .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 31]: He would have waited until after dark for this purpose , though it had been the longest day in the year , and he had begun it without a breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 39]: He passed more Golden Balls than all the jugglers in Europe have juggled with , in the course of their united performances , before he could determine in favour of any particular shop where those symbols were displayed .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 70]: In the end he came back to one of the first he had seen , and entering by a side-door in a court , where the three balls , with the legend ` Money Lent , ' were repeated in a ghastly transparency , passed into one of a series of little closets , or private boxes , erected for the accommodation of the more bashful and uninitiated customers .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 17]: He bolted himself in ; pulled out his watch ; and laid it on the counter .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 8]: ` Upon my life and soul ! '
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 37]: said a low voice in the next box to the shopman who was in treaty with him , ` you must make it more ; you must make it a trifle more , you must indeed !
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 28]: You must dispense with one half-quarter of an ounce in weighing out your pound of flesh , my best of friends , and make it two-and-six . '
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 13]: Martin drew back involuntarily , for he knew the voice at once .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 41]: ` You 're always full of your chaff , ' said the shopman , rolling up the article -LRB- which looked like a shirt -RRB- quite as a matter of course , and nibbing his pen upon the counter . '
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 22]: I shall never be full of my wheat , ' said Mr Tigg , ` as long as I come here .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 4]: Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 3]: Not bad !
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 14]: Make it two-and-six , my dear friend , positively for this occasion only .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 6]: Half-a-crown is a delightful coin .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 2]: Two-and-six .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 4]: Going at two-and-six !
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 8]: For the last time at two-and-six ! '
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 20]: ` It 'll never be the last time till it 's quite worn out , ' rejoined the shopman .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 13]: ` It 's grown yellow in the service as it is . '
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 33]: ` Its master has grown yellow in the service , if you mean that , my friend , ' said Mr Tigg ; ` in the patriotic service of an ungrateful country .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 10]: You are making it two-and-six , I think ? '
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 21]: ` I 'm making it , ' returned the shopman , ` what it always has been -- two shillings .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 9]: Same name as usual , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 29]: ` Still the same name , ' said Mr Tigg ; ` my claim to the dormant peerage not being yet established by the House of Lords . '
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 6]: ` The old address ? '
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 30]: ` Not at all , ' said Mr Tigg ; ' I have removed my town establishment from thirty-eight , Mayfair , to number fifteen-hundred-and-forty-two , Park Lane . '
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 23]: ` Come , I 'm not going to put down that , you know , ' said the shopman with a grin .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 17]: ` You may put down what you please , my friend , ' quoth Mr Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 8]: ` The fact is still the same .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 74]: The apartments for the under-butler and the fifth footman being of a most confounded low and vulgar kind at thirty-eight , Mayfair , I have been compelled , in my regard for the feelings which do them so much honour , to take on lease for seven , fourteen , or twenty-one years , renewable at the option of the tenant , the elegant and commodious family mansion , number fifteen-hundred-and-forty-two Park Lane .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 11]: Make it two-and-six , and come and see me ! '
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 24]: The shopman was so highly entertained by this piece of humour that Mr Tigg himself could not repress some little show of exultation .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 43]: It vented itself , in part , in a desire to see how the occupant of the next box received his pleasantry ; to ascertain which he glanced round the partition , and immediately , by the gaslight , recognized Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 51]: I wish I may die , ' said Mr Tigg , stretching out his body so far that his head was as much in Martin 's little cell as Martin 's own head was , ` but this is one of the most tremendous meetings in Ancient or Modern History !
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 4]: How are you ?
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 9]: What is the news from the agricultural districts ?
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 8]: How are our friends the P. 's ?
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 4]: Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 20]: David , pay particular attention to this gentleman immediately , as a friend of mine , I beg . '
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 3]: ` Here !
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 23]: Please to give me the most you can for this , ' said Martin , handing the watch to the shopman . '
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 6]: I want money sorely . '
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 8]: ` He wants money , sorely ! '
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 7]: cried Mr Tigg with excessive sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 22]: ` David , will you have the goodness to do your very utmost for my friend , who wants money sorely .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 12]: You will deal with my friend as if he were myself .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 81]: A gold hunting-watch , David , engine-turned , capped and jewelled in four holes , escape movement , horizontal lever , and warranted to perform correctly , upon my personal reputation , who have observed it narrowly for many years , under the most trying circumstances ' -- here he winked at Martin , that he might understand this recommendation would have an immense effect upon the shopman ; ` what do you say , David , to my friend ?
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 14]: Be very particular to deserve my custom and recommendation , David . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 21]: I can lend you three pounds on this , if you like ' said the shopman to Martin , confidentially .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 6]: ` It is very old-fashioned .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 7]: I could n't say more . '
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 12]: ` And devilish handsome , too , ' cried Mr Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 12]: ` Two-twelve-six for the watch , and seven-and-six for personal regard .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 13]: I am gratified ; it may be weakness , but I am .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 5]: Three pounds will do .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 4]: We take it .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 20]: The name of my friend is Smivey : Chicken Smivey , of Holborn , twenty-six-and-a-half B : lodger . '
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 34]: Here he winked at Martin again , to apprise him that all the forms and ceremonies prescribed by law were now complied with , and nothing remained but the receipt for the money .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 48]: In point of fact , this proved to be the case , for Martin , who had no resource but to take what was offered him , signified his acquiescence by a nod of his head , and presently came out with the cash in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 35]: He was joined in the entry by Mr Tigg , who warmly congratulated him , as he took his arm and accompanied him into the street , on the successful issue of the negotiation .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 20]: ` As for my part in the same , ' said Mr Tigg , ` do n't mention it .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 14]: Do n't compliment me , for I ca n't bear it ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 20]: I have no such intention , I assure you , ' retorted Martin , releasing his arm and stopping .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 11]: ` You oblige me very much ' said Mr Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 5]: ` Thank you . '
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 30]: ` Now , sir , ' observed Martin , biting his lip , ` this is a large town , and we can easily find different ways in it .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 16]: If you will show me which is your way , I will take another . '
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 37]: Mr Tigg was about to speak , but Martin interposed : ' I need scarcely tell you , after what you have just seen , that I have nothing to bestow upon your friend Mr Slyme .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 23]: And it is quite as unnecessary for me to tell you that I do n't desire the honour of your company . '
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 12]: ` Stop ' cried Mr Tigg , holding out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 3]: ` Hold !
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 31]: There is a most remarkably long-headed , flowing-bearded , and patriarchal proverb , which observes that it is the duty of a man to be just before he is generous .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 11]: Be just now , and you can be generous presently .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 9]: Do not confuse me with the man Slyme .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 19]: Do not distinguish the man Slyme as a friend of mine , for he is no such thing .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 16]: I have been compelled , sir , to abandon the party whom you call Slyme .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 12]: I have no knowledge of the party whom you call Slyme .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 36]: I am , sir , ' said Mr Tigg , striking himself upon the breast , ' a premium tulip , of a very different growth and cultivation from the cabbage Slyme , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 37]: ` It matters very little to me , ' said Martin coolly , ` whether you have set up as a vagabond on your own account , or are still trading on behalf of Mr Slyme .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 9]: I wish to hold no correspondence with you .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 54]: In the devil 's name , man ' said Martin , scarcely able , despite his vexation , to repress a smile as Mr Tigg stood leaning his back against the shutters of a shop window , adjusting his hair with great composure , ` will you go one way or other ? '
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 64]: ` You will allow me to remind you , sir , ' said Mr Tigg , with sudden dignity , ` that you -- not I -- that you -- I say emphatically , YOU -- have reduced the proceedings of this evening to a cold and distant matter of business , when I was disposed to place them on a friendly footing .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 44]: It being made a matter of business , sir , I beg to say that I expect a trifle -LRB- which I shall bestow in charity -RRB- as commission upon the pecuniary advance , in which I have rendered you my humble services .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 35]: After the terms in which you have addressed me , sir , ' concluded Mr Tigg , ` you will not insult me , if you please , by offering more than half-a-crown . '
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 16]: Martin drew that piece of money from his pocket , and tossed it towards him .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 32]: Mr Tigg caught it , looked at it to assure himself of its goodness , spun it in the air after the manner of a pieman , and buttoned it up .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 69]: Finally , he raised his hat an inch or two from his head with a military air , and , after pausing a moment with deep gravity , as to decide in which direction he should go , and to what Earl or Marquis among his friends he should give the preference in his next call , stuck his hands in his skirt-pockets and swaggered round the corner .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 19]: Martin took the directly opposite course ; and so , to his great content , they parted company .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 29]: It was with a bitter sense of humiliation that he cursed , again and again , the mischance of having encountered this man in the pawnbroker 's shop .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 58]: The only comfort he had in the recollection was , Mr Tigg 's voluntary avowal of a separation between himself and Slyme , that would at least prevent his circumstances -LRB- so Martin argued -RRB- from being known to any member of his family , the bare possibility of which filled him with shame and wounded pride .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 92]: Abstractedly there was greater reason , perhaps , for supposing any declaration of Mr Tigg 's to be false , than for attaching the least credence to it ; but remembering the terms on which the intimacy between that gentleman and his bosom friend had subsisted , and the strong probability of Mr Tigg 's having established an independent business of his own on Mr Slyme 's connection , it had a reasonable appearance of probability ; at all events , Martin hoped so ; and that went a long way .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 73]: His first step , now that he had a supply of ready money for his present necessities , was , to retain his bed at the public-house until further notice , and to write a formal note to Tom Pinch -LRB- for he knew Pecksniff would see it -RRB- requesting to have his clothes forwarded to London by coach , with a direction to be left at the office until called for .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 78]: These measures taken , he passed the interval before the box arrived -- three days -- in making inquiries relative to American vessels , at the offices of various shipping-agents in the city ; and in lingering about the docks and wharves , with the faint hope of stumbling upon some engagement for the voyage , as clerk or supercargo , or custodian of something or somebody , which would enable him to procure a free passage .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 44]: But finding , soon , that no such means of employment were likely to present themselves , and dreading the consequences of delay , he drew up a short advertisement , stating what he wanted , and inserted it in the leading newspapers .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 45]: Pending the receipt of the twenty or thirty answers which he vaguely expected , he reduced his wardrobe to the narrowest limits consistent with decent respectability , and carried the overplus at different times to the pawnbroker 's shop , for conversion into money .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 61]: And it was strange , very strange , even to himself , to find how , by quick though almost imperceptible degrees , he lost his delicacy and self-respect , and gradually came to do that as a matter of course , without the least compunction , which but a few short days before had galled him to the quick .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 52]: The first time he visited the pawnbroker 's , he felt on his way there as if every person whom he passed suspected whither he was going ; and on his way back again , as if the whole human tide he stemmed , knew well where he had come from .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 11]: When did he care to think of their discernment now !
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 82]: In his first wanderings up and down the weary streets , he counterfeited the walk of one who had an object in his view ; but soon there came upon him the sauntering , slipshod gait of listless idleness , and the lounging at street-corners , and plucking and biting of stray bits of straw , and strolling up and down the same place , and looking into the same shop-windows , with a miserable indifference , fifty times a day .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 100]: At first , he came out from his lodging with an uneasy sense of being observed -- even by those chance passers-by , on whom he had never looked before , and hundreds to one would never see again -- issuing in the morning from a public-house ; but now , in his comings-out and goings-in he did not mind to lounge about the door , or to stand sunning himself in careless thought beside the wooden stem , studded from head to heel with pegs , on which the beer-pots dangled like so many boughs upon a pewter-tree .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 17]: And yet it took but five weeks to reach the lowest round of this tall ladder !
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 98]: Oh , moralists , who treat of happiness and self-respect , innate in every sphere of life , and shedding light on every grain of dust in God 's highway , so smooth below your carriage-wheels , so rough beneath the tread of naked feet , bethink yourselves in looking on the swift descent of men who HAVE lived in their own esteem , that there are scores of thousands breathing now , and breathing thick with painful toil , who in that high respect have never lived at all , nor had a chance of life !
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 101]: Go ye , who rest so placidly upon the sacred Bard who had been young , and when he strung his harp was old , and had never seen the righteous forsaken , or his seed begging their bread ; go , Teachers of content and honest pride , into the mine , the mill , the forge , the squalid depths of deepest ignorance , and uttermost abyss of man 's neglect , and say can any hopeful plant spring up in air so foul that it extinguishes the soul 's bright torch as fast as it is kindled !
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 4]: And , oh !
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 25]: ye Pharisees of the nineteen hundredth year of Christian Knowledge , who soundingly appeal to human nature , see that it be human first .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 24]: Take heed it has not been transformed , during your slumber and the sleep of generations , into the nature of the Beasts !
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 3]: Five weeks !
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 13]: Of all the twenty or thirty answers , not one had come .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 42]: His money -- even the additional stock he had raised from the disposal of his spare clothes -LRB- and that was not much , for clothes , though dear to buy , are cheap to pawn -RRB- -- was fast diminishing .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 6]: Yet what could he do ?
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 48]: At times an agony came over him in which he darted forth again , though he was but newly home , and , returning to some place where he had been already twenty times , made some new attempt to gain his end , but always unsuccessfully .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 25]: He was years and years too old for a cabin-boy , and years upon years too inexperienced to be accepted as a common seaman .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 61]: His dress and manner , too , militated fatally against any such proposal as the latter ; and yet he was reduced to making it ; for even if he could have contemplated the being set down in America totally without money , he had not enough left now for a steerage passage and the poorest provisions upon the voyage .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 46]: It is an illustration of a very common tendency in the mind of man , that all this time he never once doubted , one may almost say the certainty of doing great things in the New World , if he could only get there .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 80]: In proportion as he became more and more dejected by his present circumstances , and the means of gaining America receded from his grasp , the more he fretted himself with the conviction that that was the only place in which he could hope to achieve any high end , and worried his brain with the thought that men going there in the meanwhile might anticipate him in the attainment of those objects which were dearest to his heart .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 34]: He often thought of John Westlock , and besides looking out for him on all occasions , actually walked about London for three days together for the express purpose of meeting with him .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 52]: But although he failed in this ; and although he would not have scrupled to borrow money of him ; and although he believed that John would have lent it ; yet still he could not bring his mind to write to Pinch and inquire where he was to be found .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 64]: For although , as we have seen , he was fond of Tom after his own fashion , he could not endure the thought -LRB- feeling so superior to Tom -RRB- of making him the stepping-stone to his fortune , or being anything to him but a patron ; and his pride so revolted from the idea that it restrained him even now .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 24]: It might have yielded , however ; and no doubt must have yielded soon , but for a very strange and unlooked-for occurrence .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 61]: The five weeks had quite run out , and he was in a truly desperate plight , when one evening , having just returned to his lodging , and being in the act of lighting his candle at the gas jet in the bar before stalking moodily upstairs to his own room , his landlord called him by his name .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 52]: Now as he had never told it to the man , but had scrupulously kept it to himself , he was not a little startled by this ; and so plainly showed his agitation that the landlord , to reassure him , said ` it was only a letter . ' '
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 4]: A letter ! '
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 3]: cried Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 22]: ` For Mr Martin Chuzzlewit , ' said the landlord , reading the superscription of one he held in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 3]: ` Noon .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 3]: Chief office .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 3]: Paid . '
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 13]: Martin took it from him , thanked him , and walked upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 17]: It was not sealed , but pasted close ; the handwriting was quite unknown to him .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 32]: He opened it and found enclosed , without any name , address , or other inscription or explanation of any kind whatever , a Bank of England note for Twenty Pounds .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 109]: To say that he was perfectly stunned with astonishment and delight ; that he looked again and again at the note and the wrapper ; that he hurried below stairs to make quite certain that the note was a good note ; and then hurried up again to satisfy himself for the fiftieth time that he had not overlooked some scrap of writing on the wrapper ; that he exhausted and bewildered himself with conjectures ; and could make nothing of it but that there the note was , and he was suddenly enriched ; would be only to relate so many matters of course to no purpose .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 44]: The final upshot of the business at that time was , that he resolved to treat himself to a comfortable but frugal meal in his own chamber ; and having ordered a fire to be kindled , went out to purchase it forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 26]: He bought some cold beef , and ham , and French bread , and butter , and came back with his pockets pretty heavily laden .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 69]: It was somewhat of a damping circumstance to find the room full of smoke , which was attributable to two causes ; firstly , to the flue being naturally vicious and a smoker ; and secondly , to their having forgotten , in lighting the fire , an odd sack or two and some trifles , which had been put up the chimney to keep the rain out .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 46]: They had already remedied this oversight , however ; and propped up the window-sash with a bundle of firewood to keep it open ; so that except in being rather inflammatory to the eyes and choking to the lungs , the apartment was quite comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 56]: Martin was in no vein to quarrel with it , if it had been in less tolerable order , especially when a gleaming pint of porter was set upon the table , and the servant-girl withdrew , bearing with her particular instructions relative to the production of something hot when he should ring the bell .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 34]: The cold meat being wrapped in a playbill , Martin laid the cloth by spreading that document on the little round table with the print downwards , and arranging the collation upon it .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 44]: The foot of the bed , which was very close to the fire , answered for a sideboard ; and when he had completed these preparations , he squeezed an old arm-chair into the warmest corner , and sat down to enjoy himself .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 84]: He had begun to eat with great appetite , glancing round the room meanwhile with a triumphant anticipation of quitting it for ever on the morrow , when his attention was arrested by a stealthy footstep on the stairs , and presently by a knock at his chamber door , which , although it was a gentle knock enough , communicated such a start to the bundle of firewood , that it instantly leaped out of window , and plunged into the street .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 11]: ` More coals , I suppose , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 5]: ` Come in ! '
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 21]: ` It a n't a liberty , sir , though it seems so , ' rejoined a man 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 6]: ` Your servant , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 9]: Hope you 're pretty well , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 27]: Martin stared at the face that was bowing in the doorway , perfectly remembering the features and expression , but quite forgetting to whom they belonged .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 10]: ` Tapley , sir , ' said his visitor .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 27]: ` Him as formerly lived at the Dragon , sir , and was forced to leave in consequence of a want of jollity , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 6]: ` To be sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 3]: cried Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 10]: ` Why , how did you come here ? '
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 17]: ` Right through the passage , and up the stairs , sir , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 12]: ` How did you find me out , I mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 3]: asked Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 66]: ` Why , sir , ' said Mark , ` I 've passed you once or twice in the street , if I 'm not mistaken ; and when I was a-looking in at the beef-and-ham shop just now , along with a hungry sweep , as was very much calculated to make a man jolly , sir -- I see you a-buying that . '
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 18]: Martin reddened as he pointed to the table , and said , somewhat hastily : ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 4]: What then ? '
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 35]: ` Why , then , sir , ' said Mark , ' I made bold to foller ; and as I told 'em downstairs that you expected me , I was let up . '
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 17]: ` Are you charged with any message , that you told them you were expected ? '
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 3]: inquired Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 13]: ` No , sir , I a n't , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 17]: ` That was what you may call a pious fraud , sir , that was . '
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 42]: Martin cast an angry look at him ; but there was something in the fellow 's merry face , and in his manner -- which with all its cheerfulness was far from being obtrusive or familiar -- that quite disarmed him .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 21]: He had lived a solitary life too , for many weeks , and the voice was pleasant in his ear .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 15]: ` Tapley , ' he said , ` I 'll deal openly with you .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 38]: From all I can judge and from all I have heard of you through Pinch , you are not a likely kind of fellow to have been brought here by impertinent curiosity or any other offensive motive .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 3]: Sit down .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 8]: I 'm glad to see you . '
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 9]: ` Thankee , sir , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 8]: ` I 'd as lieve stand . '
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 21]: `` If you do n't sit down , ' retorted Martin , ` I 'll not talk to you . '
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 10]: ` Very good , sir , ' observed Mark .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 9]: ` Your will 's a law , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 14]: Down it is ; ' and he sat down accordingly upon the bedstead .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 14]: ` Help yourself , ' said Martin , handing him the only knife .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 9]: ` Thankee , sir , ' rejoined Mark .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 7]: ` After you 've done . '
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 19]: ` If you do n't take it now , you 'll not have any , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 10]: ` Very good , sir , ' rejoined Mark .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 11]: ` That being your desire -- now it is . '
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 12]: With which reply he gravely helped himself and went on eating .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 24]: Martin having done the like for a short time in silence , said abruptly : ` What are you doing in London ? '
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 11]: ` Nothing at all , sir , ' rejoined Mark .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 6]: ` How 's that ? '
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 4]: asked Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 9]: I want a place , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 12]: ` I 'm sorry for you , ' said Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 12]: -- To attend upon a single gentleman , ' resumed Mark .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 9]: ` If from the country the more desirable .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 5]: Makeshifts would be preferred .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 5]: Wages no object . '
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 35]: He said this so pointedly , that Martin stopped in his eating , and said : ` If you mean me -- ' ` Yes , I do , sir , ' interposed Mark .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 20]: ` Then you may judge from my style of living here , of my means of keeping a man-servant .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 10]: Besides , I am going to America immediately . '
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 43]: ` Well , sir , ' returned Mark , quite unmoved by this intelligence ` from all that ever I heard about it , I should say America is a very likely sort of place for me to be jolly in ! '
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 18]: Again Martin looked at him angrily ; and again his anger melted away in spite of himself .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 47]: ` Lord bless you , sir , ' said Mark , ` what is the use of us a-going round and round , and hiding behind the corner , and dodging up and down , when we can come straight to the point in six words ?
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 12]: I 've had my eye upon you any time this fortnight .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 13]: I see well enough there 's a screw loose in your affairs .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 25]: I know 'd well enough the first time I see you down at the Dragon that it must be so , sooner or later .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 92]: Now , sir here am I , without a sitiwation ; without any want of wages for a year to come ; for I saved up -LRB- I did n't mean to do it , but I could n't help it -RRB- at the Dragon -- here am I with a liking for what 's wentersome , and a liking for you , and a wish to come out strong under circumstances as would keep other men down ; and will you take me , or will you leave me ? '
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 8]: ` How can I take you ? '
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 3]: cried Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 19]: ` When I say take , ' rejoined Mark , ' I mean will you let me go ?
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 21]: and when I say will you let me go , I mean will you let me go along with you ?
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 9]: for go I will , somehow or another .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 25]: Now that you 've said America , I see clear at once , that that 's the place for me to be jolly in .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 28]: Therefore , if I do n't pay my own passage in the ship you go in , sir , I 'll pay my own passage in another .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 42]: And mark my words , if I go alone it shall be , to carry out the principle , in the rottenest , craziest , leakingest tub of a wessel that a place can be got in for love or money .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 37]: So if I 'm lost upon the way , sir , there 'll be a drowned man at your door -- and always a-knocking double knocks at it , too , or never trust me ! '
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 10]: ` This is mere folly , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 10]: ` Very good , sir , ' returned Mark .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 33]: ` I 'm glad to hear it , because if you do n't mean to let me go , you 'll be more comfortable , perhaps , on account of thinking so .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 6]: Therefore I contradict no gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 50]: But all I say is , that if I do n't emigrate to America in that case , in the beastliest old cockle-shell as goes out of port , I 'm -- ' ` You do n't mean what you say , I 'm sure , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 10]: ` Yes I do , ' cried Mark . '
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 11]: I tell you I know better , ' rejoined Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 18]: ` Very good , sir , ' said Mark , with the same air of perfect satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 20]: ` Let it stand that way at present , sir , and wait and see how it turns out .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 7]: Why , love my heart alive !
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 40]: the only doubt I have is , whether there 's any credit in going with a gentleman like you , that 's as certain to make his way there as a gimlet is to go through soft deal . '
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 17]: This was touching Martin on his weak point , and having him at a great advantage .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 34]: He could not help thinking , either , what a brisk fellow this Mark was , and how great a change he had wrought in the atmosphere of the dismal little room already .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 26]: ` Why , certainly , Mark , ' he said , ' I have hopes of doing well there , or I should n't go .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 12]: I may have the qualifications for doing well , perhaps . '
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 13]: ` Of course you have , sir , ' returned Mark Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 6]: ` Everybody knows that . '
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 69]: ` You see , ' said Martin , leaning his chin upon his hand , and looking at the fire , ` ornamental architecture applied to domestic purposes , can hardly fail to be in great request in that country ; for men are constantly changing their residences there , and moving further off ; and it 's clear they must have houses to live in . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 36]: I should say , sir , ' observed Mark , ` that that 's a state of things as opens one of the jolliest look-outs for domestic architecture that ever I heerd tell on . '
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 27]: Martin glanced at him hastily , not feeling quite free from a suspicion that this remark implied a doubt of the successful issue of his plans .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 31]: But Mr Tapley was eating the boiled beef and bread with such entire good faith and singleness of purpose expressed in his visage that he could not but be satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 13]: Another doubt arose in his mind however , as this one disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 36]: He produced the blank cover in which the note had been enclosed , and fixing his eyes on Mark as he put it in his hands , said : ` Now tell me the truth .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 8]: Do you know anything about that ? '
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 73]: Mark turned it over and over ; held it near his eyes ; held it away from him at arm 's length ; held it with the superscription upwards and with the superscription downwards ; and shook his head with such a genuine expression of astonishment at being asked the question , that Martin said , as he took it from him again : ` No , I see you do n't .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 4]: How should you !
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 18]: Though , indeed , your knowing about it would not be more extraordinary than its being here .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 52]: Come , Tapley , ' he added , after a moment 's thought , ` I 'll trust you with my history , such as it is , and then you 'll see more clearly what sort of fortunes you would link yourself to , if you followed me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 28]: I beg your pardon , sir , ' said Mark ; ` but afore you enter upon it will you take me if I choose to go ?
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 68]: Will you turn off me -- Mark Tapley -- formerly of the Blue Dragon , as can be well recommended by Mr Pinch , and as wants a gentleman of your strength of mind to look up to ; or will you , in climbing the ladder as you 're certain to get to the top of , take me along with you at a respectful dutance ?
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 21]: Now , sir , ' said Mark , ` it 's of very little importance to you , I know .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 28]: there 's the difficulty ; but it 's of very great importance to me , and will you be so good as to consider of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 34]: If this were meant as a second appeal to Martin 's weak side , founded on his observation of the effect of the first , Mr Tapley was a skillful and shrewd observer .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 46]: Whether an intentional or an accidental shot , it hit the mark fully for Martin , relenting more and more , said with a condescension which was inexpressibly delicious to him , after his recent humiliation : ` We 'll see about it , Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 13]: You shall tell me in what disposition you find yourself to-morrow . '
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 19]: ` Then , sir , ' said Mark , rubbing his hands , ` the job 's done .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 9]: Go on , sir , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 6]: I 'm all attention . '
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 39]: Throwing himself back in his arm-chair , and looking at the fire , with now and then a glance at Mark , who at such times nodded his head sagely , to express his profound interest and attention .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 27]: Martin ran over the chief points in his history , to the same effect as he had related them , weeks before , to Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 43]: But he adapted them , according to the best of his judgment , to Mr Tapley 's comprehension ; and with that view made as light of his love affair as he could , and referred to it in very few words .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 65]: But here he reckoned without his host ; for Mark 's interest was keenest in this part of the business , and prompted him to ask sundry questions in relation to it ; for which he apologised as one in some measure privileged to do so , from having seen -LRB- as Martin explained to him -RRB- the young lady at the Blue Dragon .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 32]: ` And a young lady as any gentleman ought to feel more proud of being in love with , ' said Mark , energetically , ` do n't draw breath . '
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 3]: ` Aye !
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 19]: You saw her when she was not happy , ' said Martin , gazing at the fire again .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 53]: ` If you had seen her in the old times , indeed -- ' ` Why , she certainly was a little down-hearted , sir , and something paler in her colour than I could have wished , ' said Mark , ` but none the worse in her looks for that .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 15]: I think she seemed better , sir , after she come to London . '
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 28]: Martin withdrew his eyes from the fire ; stared at Mark as if he thought he had suddenly gone mad ; and asked him what he meant .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 12]: ` No offence intended , sir , ' urged Mark . '
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 25]: I do n't mean to say she was any the happier without you ; but I thought she was a-looking better , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 14]: ` Do you mean to tell me she has been in London ? '
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 12]: asked Martin , rising hurriedly , and pushing back his chair .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 20]: ` Of course I do , ' said Mark , rising too , in great amazement from the bedstead .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 14]: ` Do you mean to tell me she is in London now ? '
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 6]: ` Most likely , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 11]: I mean to say she was a week ago . '
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 7]: ` And you know where ? '
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 4]: ` Yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 3]: cried Mark .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 5]: Do n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 6]: ` My good fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 24]: exclaimed Martin , clutching him by both arms , ' I have never seen her since I left my grandfather 's house . '
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 6]: ` Why , then ! '
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 80]: cried Mark , giving the little table such a blow with his clenched fist that the slices of beef and ham danced upon it , while all his features seemed , with delight , to be going up into his forehead , and never coming back again any more , ` if I a n't your nat ` ral born servant , hired by Fate , there a n't such a thing in natur ' as a Blue Dragon .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 38]: when I was a-rambling up and down a old churchyard in the City , getting myself into a jolly state , did n't I see your grandfather a-toddling to and fro for pretty nigh a mortal hour !
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 50]: Did n't I watch him into Todgers 's commercial boarding-house , and watch him out , and watch him home to his hotel , and go and tell him as his was the service for my money , and I had said so , afore I left the Dragon !
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 25]: Was n't the young lady a-sitting with him then , and did n't she fall a-laughing in a manner as was beautiful to see !
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 61]: Did n't your grandfather say , `` Come back again next week , '' and did n't I go next week ; and did n't he say that he could n't make up his mind to trust nobody no more ; and therefore would n't engage me , but at the same time stood something to drink as was handsome !
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 31]: Why , ' cried Mr Tapley , with a comical mixture of delight and chagrin , ` where 's the credit of a man 's being jolly under such circumstances !
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 13]: Who could help it , when things come about like this ! '
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 36]: For some moments Martin stood gazing at him , as if he really doubted the evidence of his senses , and could not believe that Mark stood there , in the body , before him .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 29]: At length he asked him whether , if the young lady were still in London , he thought he could contrive to deliver a letter to her secretly .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 8]: ` Do I think I can ? '
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 3]: cried Mark .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 5]: ` THINK I can ?
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 7]: Here , sit down , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 7]: Write it out , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 54]: With that he cleared the table by the summary process of tilting everything upon it into the fireplace ; snatched some writing materials from the mantel-shelf ; set Martin 's chair before them ; forced him down into it ; dipped a pen into the ink ; and put it in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 7]: ` Cut away , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 3]: cried Mark .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 7]: ` Make it strong , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 8]: Let it be wery pinted , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 5]: Do I think so ?
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 5]: I should think so .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 7]: Go to work , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 64]: Martin required no further adjuration , but went to work at a great rate ; while Mr Tapley , installing himself without any more formalities into the functions of his valet and general attendant , divested himself of his coat , and went on to clear the fireplace and arrange the room ; talking to himself in a low voice the whole time .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 36]: ` Jolly sort of lodgings , ' said Mark , rubbing his nose with the knob at the end of the fire-shovel , and looking round the poor chamber ; ` that 's a comfort .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 9]: The rain 's come through the roof too .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 5]: That a n't bad .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 19]: A lively old bedstead , I 'll be bound ; popilated by lots of wampires , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 7]: my spirits is a-getting up again .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 6]: An uncommon ragged nightcap this .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 5]: A very good sign .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 5]: We shall do yet !
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 31]: Here , Jane , my dear , ' calling down the stairs , ` bring up that there hot tumbler for my master as was a-mixing when I come in .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 10]: That 's right , sir , ' to Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 12]: ` Go at it as if you meant it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 10]: Be very tender , sir , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 11]: You ca n't make it too strong , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 54]: CHAPTER FOURTEEN IN WHICH MARTIN BIDS ADIEU TO THE LADY OF HIS LOVE ; AND HONOURS AN OBSCURE INDIVIDUAL WHOSE FORTUNE HE INTENDS TO MAKE BY COMMENDING HER TO HIS PROTECTION The letter being duly signed , sealed , and delivered , was handed to Mark Tapley , for immediate conveyance if possible .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 98]: And he succeeded so well in his embassy as to be enabled to return that same night , just as the house was closing , with the welcome intelligence that he had sent it upstairs to the young lady , enclosed in a small manuscript of his own , purporting to contain his further petition to be engaged in Mr Chuzzlewit 's service ; and that she had herself come down and told him , in great haste and agitation , that she would meet the gentleman at eight o'clock to-morrow morning in St. James 's Park .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 73]: It was then agreed between the new master and the new man , that Mark should be in waiting near the hotel in good time , to escort the young lady to the place of appointment ; and when they had parted for the night with this understanding , Martin took up his pen again ; and before he went to bed wrote another letter , whereof more will be seen presently .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 36]: He was up before daybreak , and came upon the Park with the morning , which was clad in the least engaging of the three hundred and sixty-five dresses in the wardrobe of the year .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 41]: It was raw , damp , dark , and dismal ; the clouds were as muddy as the ground ; and the short perspective of every street and avenue was closed up by the mist as by a filthy curtain .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 24]: ` Fine weather indeed , ' Martin bitterly soliloquised , ` to be wandering up and down here in , like a thief !
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 20]: Fine weather indeed , for a meeting of lovers in the open air , and in a public walk !
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 25]: I need be departing , with all speed , for another country ; for I have come to a pretty pass in this ! '
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 36]: He might perhaps have gone on to reflect that of all mornings in the year , it was not the best calculated for a young lady 's coming forth on such an errand , either .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 35]: But he was stopped on the road to this reflection , if his thoughts tended that way , by her appearance at a short distance , on which he hurried forward to meet her .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 27]: Her squire , Mr Tapley , at the same time fell discreetly back , and surveyed the fog above him with an appearance of attentive interest .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 9]: ` My dear Martin , ' said Mary .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 58]: ` My dear Mary , ' said Martin ; and lovers are such a singular kind of people that this is all they did say just then , though Martin took her arm , and her hand too , and they paced up and down a short walk that was least exposed to observation , half-a-dozen times .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 43]: ` If you have changed at all , my love , since we parted , ' said Martin at length , as he looked upon her with a proud delight , ` it is only to be more beautiful than ever ! '
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 102]: Had she been of the common metal of love-worn young ladies , she would have denied this in her most interesting manner ; and would have told him that she knew she had become a perfect fright ; or that she had wasted away with weeping and anxiety ; or that she was dwindling gently into an early grave ; or that her mental sufferings were unspeakable ; or would , either by tears or words , or a mixture of both , have furnished him with some other information to that effect , and made him as miserable as possible .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 106]: But she had been reared up in a sterner school than the minds of most young girls are formed in ; she had had her nature strengthened by the hands of hard endurance and necessity ; had come out from her young trials constant , self-denying , earnest , and devoted ; had acquired in her maidenhood -- whether happily in the end , for herself or him , is foreign to our present purpose to inquire -- something of that nobler quality of gentle hearts which is developed often by the sorrows and struggles of matronly years , but often by their lessons only .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 97]: Unspoiled , unpampered in her joys or griefs ; with frank and full , and deep affection for the object of her early love ; she saw in him one who for her sake was an outcast from his home and fortune , and she had no more idea of bestowing that love upon him in other than cheerful and sustaining words , full of high hope and grateful trustfulness , than she had of being unworthy of it , in her lightest thought or deed , for any base temptation that the world could offer .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 21]: ` What change is there in YOU , Martin , ' she replied ; ` for that concerns me nearest ?
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 12]: You look more anxious and more thoughtful than you used . '
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 72]: ` Why , as to that , my love , ' said Martin as he drew her waist within his arm , first looking round to see that there were no observers near , and beholding Mr Tapley more intent than ever on the fog ; ` it would be strange if I did not ; for my life -- especially of late -- has been a hard one . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 11]: I know it must have been , ' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 13]: ` When have I forgotten to think of it and you ? '
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 11]: ` Not often , I hope , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 8]: ` Not often , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 37]: Not often , I have some right to expect , Mary ; for I have undergone a great deal of vexation and privation , and I naturally look for that return , you know . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 15]: A very , very poor return , ' she answered with a fainter smile .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 12]: ` But you have it , and will have it always .
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 27]: You have paid a dear price for a poor heart , Martin ; but it is at least your own , and a true one . '
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 27]: ` Of course I feel quite certain of that , ' said Martin , ` or I should n't have put myself in my present position .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 17]: And do n't say a poor heart , Mary , for I say a rich one .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 29]: Now , I am about to break a design to you , dearest , which will startle you at first , but which is undertaken for your sake .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 25]: I am going , ' he added slowly , looking far into the deep wonder of her bright dark eyes , ` abroad . '
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 6]: ` Abroad , Martin ! '
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 5]: ` Only to America .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 3]: See now .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 6]: How you droop directly ! '
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 54]: ` If I do , or , I hope I may say , if I did , ' she answered , raising her head after a short silence , and looking once more into his face , ` it was for grief to think of what you are resolved to undergo for me .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 47]: I would not venture to dissuade you , Martin ; but it is a long , long distance ; there is a wide ocean to be crossed ; illness and want are sad calamities in any place , but in a foreign country dreadful to endure .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 8]: Have you thought of all this ? '
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 6]: ` Thought of it ! '
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 25]: cried Martin , abating , in his fondness -- and he WAS very fond of her -- hardly an iota of his usual impetuosity .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 7]: ` What am I to do ?
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 15]: It 's very well to say , `` Have I thought of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 53]: my love ; but you should ask me in the same breath , have I thought of starving at home ; have I thought of doing porter 's work for a living ; have I thought of holding horses in the streets to earn my roll of bread from day to day ?
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 38]: Come , come , ' he added , in a gentler tone , ` do not hang down your head , my dear , for I need the encouragement that your sweet face alone can give me .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 6]: Why , that 's well !
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 8]: Now you are brave again . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 15]: I am endeavouring to be , ' she answered , smiling through her tears .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 21]: ` Endeavouring to be anything that 's good , and being it , is , with you , all one .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 9]: Do n't I know that of old ? '
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 5]: cried Martin , gayly .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 3]: ` So !
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 4]: That 's famous !
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 22]: Now I can tell you all my plans as cheerfully as if you were my little wife already , Mary . '
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 20]: She hung more closely on his arm , and looking upwards in his face , bade him speak on .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 33]: ` You see , ' said Martin , playing with the little hand upon his wrist , ` that my attempts to advance myself at home have been baffled and rendered abortive .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 18]: I will not say by whom , Mary , for that would give pain to us both .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 5]: But so it is .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 18]: Have you heard him speak of late of any relative of mine or his , called Pecksniff ?
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 13]: Only tell me what I ask you , no more . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 20]: I have heard , to my surprise , that he is a better man than was supposed . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 8]: I thought so , ' interrupted Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 29]: ` And that it is likely we may come to know him , if not to visit and reside with him and -- I think -- his daughters .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 11]: He HAS daughters , has he , love ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 10]: A pair of them , ' Martin answered . '
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 4]: A precious pair !
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 7]: Gems of the first water ! '
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 5]: You are jesting ! '
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 26]: ` There is a sort of jesting which is very much in earnest , and includes some pretty serious disgust , ' said Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 35]: I jest in reference to Mr Pecksniff -LRB- at whose house I have been living as his assistant , and at whose hands I have received insult and injury -RRB- , in that vein .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 48]: Whatever betides , or however closely you may be brought into communication with this family , never forget that , Mary ; and never for an instant , whatever appearances may seem to contradict me , lose sight of this assurance -- Pecksniff is a scoundrel . '
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 4]: ` Indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 13]: ` In thought , and in deed , and in everything else .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 18]: A scoundrel from the topmost hair of his head , to the nethermost atom of his heel .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 31]: Of his daughters I will only say that , to the best of my knowledge and belief , they are dutiful young ladies , and take after their father closely .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 23]: This is a digression from the main point , and yet it brings me to what I was going to say . '
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 53]: He stopped to look into her eyes again , and seeing , in a hasty glance over his shoulder , that there was no one near , and that Mark was still intent upon the fog , not only looked at her lips , too , but kissed them into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 96]: ` Now I am going to America , with great prospects of doing well , and of returning home myself very soon ; it may be to take you there for a few years , but , at all events , to claim you for my wife ; which , after such trials , I should do with no fear of your still thinking it a duty to cleave to him who will not suffer me to live -LRB- for this is true -RRB- , if he can help it , in my own land .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 21]: How long I may be absent is , of course , uncertain ; but it shall not be very long .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 6]: Trust me for that . '
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 20]: ` In the meantime , dear Martin -- ' ` That 's the very thing I am coming to .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 14]: In the meantime you shall hear , constantly , of all my goings-on .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 3]: Thus . '
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 56]: He paused to take from his pocket the letter he had written overnight , and then resumed : ` In this fellow 's employment , and living in this fellow 's house -LRB- by fellow , I mean Mr Pecksniff , of course -RRB- , there is a certain person of the name of Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 32]: Do n't forget ; a poor , strange , simple oddity , Mary ; but thoroughly honest and sincere ; full of zeal ; and with a cordial regard for me .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 23]: Which I mean to return one of these days , by setting him up in life in some way or other . '
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 9]: ` Your old kind nature , Martin ! '
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 14]: said Martin , ` that 's not worth speaking of , my love .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 17]: He 's very grateful and desirous to serve me ; and I am more than repaid .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 36]: Now one night I told this Pinch my history , and all about myself and you ; in which he was not a little interested , I can tell you , for he knows you !
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 55]: Aye , you may look surprised -- and the longer the better for it becomes you -- but you have heard him play the organ in the church of that village before now ; and he has seen you listening to his music ; and has caught his inspiration from you , too ! '
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 7]: ` Was HE the organist ? '
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 4]: cried Mary . '
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 8]: I thank him from my heart ! '
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 21]: ` Yes , he was , ' said Martin , ` and is , and gets nothing for it either .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 8]: There never was such a simple fellow !
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 4]: Quite an infant !
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 14]: But a very good sort of creature , I assure you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 13]: I am sure of that , ' she said with great earnestness .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 6]: ` He must be ! '
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 22]: ` Oh , yes , no doubt at all about it , ' rejoined Martin , in his usual careless way .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 4]: ` He is .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 9]: It has occurred to me -- but stay .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 21]: If I read you what I have written and intend sending to him by post to-night it will explain itself .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 7]: `` My dear Tom Pinch . ''
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 42]: That 's rather familiar perhaps , ' said Martin , suddenly remembering that he was proud when they had last met , ` but I call him my dear Tom Pinch because he likes it , and it pleases him . '
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 12]: ` Very right , and very kind , ' said Mary .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 5]: ` Exactly so ! '
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 3]: cried Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 26]: ` It 's as well to be kind whenever one can ; and , as I said before , he really is an excellent fellow .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 55]: `` My dear Tom Pinch -- I address this under cover to Mrs Lupin , at the Blue Dragon , and have begged her in a short note to deliver it to you without saying anything about it elsewhere ; and to do the same with all future letters she may receive from me .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 54]: My reason for so doing will be at once apparent to you '' -- I do n't know that it will be , by the bye , ' said Martin , breaking off , ` for he 's slow of comprehension , poor fellow ; but he 'll find it out in time .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 31]: My reason simply is , that I do n't want my letters to be read by other people ; and particularly by the scoundrel whom he thinks an angel . '
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 6]: ` Mr Pecksniff again ? '
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 3]: asked Mary .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 17]: ` The same , ' said Martin ' -- will be at once apparent to you .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 71]: I have completed my arrangements for going to America ; and you will be surprised to hear that I am to be accompanied by Mark Tapley , upon whom I have stumbled strangely in London , and who insists on putting himself under my protection ' -- meaning , my love , ' said Martin , breaking off again , ` our friend in the rear , of course . '
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 32]: She was delighted to hear this , and bestowed a kind glance upon Mark , which he brought his eyes down from the fog to encounter and received with immense satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 48]: She said in his hearing , too , that he was a good soul and a merry creature , and would be faithful , she was certain ; commendations which Mr Tapley inwardly resolved to deserve , from such lips , if he died for it . '
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 57]: `` Now , my dear Pinch , '' ' resumed Martin , proceeding with his letter ; ' `` I am going to repose great trust in you , knowing that I may do so with perfect reliance on your honour and secrecy , and having nobody else just now to trust in . '' ' '
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 12]: I do n't think I would say that , Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 5]: ` Would n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 6]: I 'll take that out .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 8]: It 's perfectly true , though . '
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 10]: ` But it might seem ungracious , perhaps . '
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 13]: ` Oh , I do n't mind Pinch , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 13]: ` There 's no occasion to stand on any ceremony with HIM .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 23]: However , I 'll take it out , as you wish it , and make the full stop at `` secrecy . ''
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 3]: Very well !
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 18]: `` I shall not only '' -- this is the letter again , you know . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 5]: I understand . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 59]: `` I shall not only enclose my letters to the young lady of whom I have told you , to your charge , to be forwarded as she may request ; but I most earnestly commit her , the young lady herself , to your care and regard , in the event of your meeting in my absence .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 64]: I have reason to think that the probabilities of your encountering each other -- perhaps very frequently -- are now neither remote nor few ; and although in our position you can do very little to lessen the uneasiness of hers , I trust to you implicitly to do that much , and so deserve the confidence I have reposed in you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 77]: You see , my dear Mary , ' said Martin , ` it will be a great consolation to you to have anybody , no matter how simple , with whom you can speak about ME ; and the very first time you talk to Pinch , you 'll feel at once that there is no more occasion for any embarrassment or hesitation in talking to him , than if he were an old woman . '
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 24]: ` However that may be , ' she returned , smiling , ` he is your friend , and that is enough . '
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 17]: ` Oh , yes , he 's my friend , ' said Martin , ` certainly .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 42]: In fact , I have told him in so many words that we 'll always take notice of him , and protect him ; and it 's a good trait in his character that he 's grateful -- very grateful indeed .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 14]: You 'll like him of all things , my love , I know .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 30]: You 'll observe very much that 's comical and old-fashioned about Pinch , but you need n't mind laughing at him ; for he 'll not care about it .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 9]: He 'll rather like it indeed ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 15]: I do n't think I shall put that to the test , Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 33]: ` You wo n't if you can help it , of course , ' he said , ` but I think you 'll find him a little too much for your gravity .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 98]: However , that 's neither here nor there , and it certainly is not the letter ; which ends thus : `` Knowing that I need not impress the nature and extent of that confidence upon you at any greater length , as it is already sufficiently established in your mind , I will only say , in bidding you farewell and looking forward to our next meeting , that I shall charge myself from this time , through all changes for the better , with your advancement and happiness , as if they were my own .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 6]: You may rely upon that .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 17]: And always believe me , my dear Tom Pinch , faithfully your friend , Martin Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 33]: P.S. -- I enclose the amount which you so kindly '' -- Oh , ' said Martin , checking himself , and folding up the letter , ` that 's nothing ! '
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 22]: At this crisis Mark Tapley interposed , with an apology for remarking that the clock at the Horse Guards was striking .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 34]: ` Which I should n't have said nothing about , sir , ' added Mark , ` if the young lady had n't begged me to be particular in mentioning it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 7]: I did , ' said Mary .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 4]: ` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 5]: You are quite right .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 10]: In another minute I shall be ready to return .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 34]: We have time for a very few words more , dear Martin , and although I had much to say , it must remain unsaid until the happy time of our next meeting .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 9]: Heaven send it may come speedily and prosperously !
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 9]: But I have no fear of that . '
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 4]: ` Fear ! '
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 3]: cried Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 6]: ` Why , who has ?
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 6]: What are a few months ?
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 6]: What is a whole year ?
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 32]: When I come gayly back , with a road through life hewn out before me , then indeed , looking back upon this parting , it may seem a dismal one .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 3]: But now !
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 35]: I swear I would n't have it happen under more favourable auspices , if I could ; for then I should be less inclined to go , and less impressed with the necessity . '
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 5]: ` Yes , yes .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 5]: I feel that too .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 6]: When do you go ? '
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 3]: ` To-night .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 6]: We leave for Liverpool to-night .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 15]: A vessel sails from that port , as I hear , in three days .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 12]: In a month , or less , we shall be there .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 7]: Why , what 's a month !
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 13]: How many months have flown by , since our last parting ! '
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 24]: ` Long to look back upon , ' said Mary , echoing his cheerful tone , ` but nothing in their course ! '
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 6]: ` Nothing at all ! '
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 4]: cried Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 25]: I shall have change of scene and change of place ; change of people , change of manners , change of cares and hopes !
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 6]: Time will wear wings indeed !
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 15]: I can bear anything , so that I have swift action , Mary . '
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 38]: Was he thinking solely of her care for him , when he took so little heed of her share in the separation ; of her quiet monotonous endurance , and her slow anxiety from day to day ?
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 29]: Was there nothing jarring and discordant even in his tone of courage , with this one note ` self ' for ever audible , however high the strain ?
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 5]: Not in her ears .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 13]: It had been better otherwise , perhaps , but so it was .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 40]: She heard the same bold spirit which had flung away as dross all gain and profit for her sake , making light of peril and privation that she might be calm and happy ; and she heard no more .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 26]: That heart where self has found no place and raised no throne , is slow to recognize its ugly presence when it looks upon it .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 46]: As one possessed of an evil spirit was held in old time to be alone conscious of the lurking demon in the breasts of other men , so kindred vices know each other in their hiding-places every day , when Virtue is incredulous and blind .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 7]: ` The quarter 's gone ! '
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 11]: cried Mr Tapley , in a voice of admonition . '
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 12]: I shall be ready to return immediately , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 14]: ` One thing , dear Martin , I am bound to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 84]: You entreated me a few minutes since only to answer what you asked me in reference to one theme , but you should and must know -LRB- otherwise I could not be at ease -RRB- that since that separation of which I was the unhappy occasion , he has never once uttered your name ; has never coupled it , or any faint allusion to it , with passion or reproach ; and has never abated in his kindness to me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 18]: I thank him for that last act , ' said Martin , ` and for nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 28]: Though on consideration I may thank him for his other forbearance also , inasmuch as I neither expect nor desire that he will mention my name again .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 16]: He may once , perhaps -- to couple it with reproach -- in his will .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 7]: Let him , if he please !
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 26]: By the time it reaches me , he will be in his grave ; a satire on his own anger , God help him ! '
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 3]: ` Martin !
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 83]: If you would but sometimes , in some quiet hour ; beside the winter fire ; in the summer air ; when you hear gentle music , or think of Death , or Home , or Childhood ; if you would at such a season resolve to think , but once a month , or even once a year , of him , or any one who ever wronged you , you would forgive him in your heart , I know ! '
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 41]: ` If I believed that to be true , Mary , ' he replied , ' I would resolve at no such time to bear him in my mind ; wishing to spare myself the shame of such a weakness .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 39]: I was not born to be the toy and puppet of any man , far less his ; to whose pleasure and caprice , in return for any good he did me , my whole youth was sacrificed .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 37]: It became between us two a fair exchange -- a barter -- and no more ; and there is no such balance against me that I need throw in a mawkish forgiveness to poise the scale .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 18]: He has forbidden all mention of me to you , I know , ' he added hastily .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 3]: ` Come !
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 5]: Has he not ? '
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 23]: ` That was long ago , ' she returned ; ` immediately after your parting ; before you had left the house .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 8]: He has never done so since . '
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 31]: ` He has never done so since because he has seen no occasion , ' said Martin ; ` but that is of little consequence , one way or other .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 16]: Let all allusion to him between you and me be interdicted from this time forth .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 70]: And therefore , love ' -- he drew her quickly to him , for the time of parting had now come -- ` in the first letter that you write to me through the Post Office , addressed to New York ; and in all the others that you send through Pinch ; remember he has no existence , but has become to us as one who is dead .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 6]: Now , God bless you !
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 35]: This is a strange place for such a meeting and such a parting ; but our next meeting shall be in a better , and our next and last parting in a worse . '
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 11]: ` One other question , Martin , I must ask .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 9]: Have you provided money for this journey ? '
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 5]: ` Have I ? '
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 31]: cried Martin ; it might have been in his pride ; it might have been in his desire to set her mind at ease : ` Have I provided money ?
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 12]: Why , there 's a question for an emigrant 's wife !
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 15]: How could I move on land or sea without it , love ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 6]: I mean , enough . '
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 3]: ` Enough !
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 4]: More than enough .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 6]: Twenty times more than enough .
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 3]: A pocket-full .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 26]: Mark and I , for all essential ends , are quite as rich as if we had the purse of Fortunatus in our baggage . '
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 7]: ` The half-hour 's a-going ! '
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 4]: cried Mr Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 7]: ` Good-bye a hundred times ! '
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 8]: cried Mary , in a trembling voice .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 8]: But how cold the comfort in Good-bye !
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 6]: Mark Tapley knew it perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 17]: Perhaps he knew it from his reading , perhaps from his experience , perhaps from intuition .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 33]: It is impossible to say ; but however he knew it , his knowledge instinctively suggested to him the wisest course of proceeding that any man could have adopted under the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 20]: He was taken with a violent fit of sneezing , and was obliged to turn his head another way .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 20]: In doing which , he , in a manner fenced and screened the lovers into a corner by themselves .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 22]: There was a short pause , but Mark had an undefined sensation that it was a satisfactory one in its way .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 21]: Then Mary , with her veil lowered , passed him with a quick step , and beckoned him to follow .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 20]: She stopped once more before they lost that corner ; looked back ; and waved her hand to Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 37]: He made a start towards them at the moment as if he had some other farewell words to say ; but she only hurried off the faster , and Mr Tapley followed as in duty bound .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 55]: When he rejoined Martin again in his own chamber , he found that gentleman seated moodily before the dusty grate , with his two feet on the fender , his two elbows on his knees , and his chin supported , in a not very ornamental manner , on the palms of his hands .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 6]: ` Well , Mark ! '
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 31]: ` Well , sir , ' said Mark , taking a long breath , ' I see the young lady safe home , and I feel pretty comfortable after it .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 26]: She sent a lot of kind words , sir , and this , ' handing him a ring , ` for a parting keepsake . '
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 4]: ` Diamonds ! '
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 30]: said Martin , kissing it -- let us do him justice , it was for her sake ; not for theirs -- and putting it on his little finger .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 4]: ` Splendid diamonds !
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 9]: My grandfather is a singular character , Mark .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 9]: He must have given her this now . '
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 43]: Mark Tapley knew as well that she had bought it , to the end that that unconscious speaker might carry some article of sterling value with him in his necessity ; as he knew that it was day , and not night .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 58]: Though he had no more acquaintance of his own knowledge with the history of the glittering trinket on Martin 's outspread finger , than Martin himself had , he was as certain that in its purchase she had expended her whole stock of hoarded money , as if he had seen it paid down coin by coin .
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 45]: Her lover 's strange obtuseness in relation to this little incident , promptly suggested to Mark 's mind its real cause and root ; and from that moment he had a clear and perfect insight into the one absorbing principle of Martin 's character .
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 37]: ` She is worthy of the sacrifices I have made , ' said Martin , folding his arms , and looking at the ashes in the stove , as if in resumption of some former thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 6]: ` Well worthy of them .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 24]: No riches ' -- here he stroked his chin and mused -- ` could have compensated for the loss of such a nature .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 33]: Not to mention that in gaining her affection I have followed the bent of my own wishes , and baulked the selfish schemes of others who had no right to form them .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 16]: She is quite worthy -- more than worthy -- of the sacrifices I have made .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 5]: Yes , she is .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 6]: No doubt of it . '
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 28]: These ruminations might or might not have reached Mark Tapley ; for though they were by no means addressed to him , yet they were softly uttered .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 89]: In any case , he stood there , watching Martin with an indescribable and most involved expression on his visage , until that young man roused himself and looked towards him ; when he turned away , as being suddenly intent upon certain preparations for the journey , and , without giving vent to any articulate sound , smiled with surpassing ghastliness , and seemed by a twist of his features and a motion of his lips , to release himself of this word : ` Jolly ! '
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 10]: CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE BURDEN WHEREOF , IS HAIL COLUMBIA !
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 52]: A dark and dreary night ; people nestling in their beds or circling late about the fire ; Want , colder than Charity , shivering at the street corners ; church-towers humming with the faint vibration of their own tongues , but newly resting from the ghostly preachment ` One ! '
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 92]: The earth covered with a sable pall as for the burial of yesterday ; the clumps of dark trees , its giant plumes of funeral feathers , waving sadly to and fro : all hushed , all noiseless , and in deep repose , save the swift clouds that skim across the moon , and the cautious wind , as , creeping after them upon the ground , it stops to listen , and goes rustling on , and stops again , and follows , like a savage on the trail .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 9]: Whither go the clouds and wind so eagerly ?
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 34]: If , like guilty spirits , they repair to some dread conference with powers like themselves , in what wild regions do the elements hold council , or where unbend in terrible disport ?
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 2]: Here !
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 17]: Free from that cramped prison called the earth , and out upon the waste of waters .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 14]: Here , roaring , raging , shrieking , howling , all night long .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 50]: Hither come the sounding voices from the caverns on the coast of that small island , sleeping , a thousand miles away , so quietly in the midst of angry waves ; and hither , to meet them , rush the blasts from unknown desert places of the world .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 45]: Here , in the fury of their unchecked liberty , they storm and buffet with each other , until the sea , lashed into passion like their own , leaps up , in ravings mightier than theirs , and the whole scene is madness .
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 19]: On , on , on , over the countless miles of angry space roll the long heaving billows .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 34]: Mountains and caves are here , and yet are not ; for what is now the one , is now the other ; then all is but a boiling heap of rushing water .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 96]: Pursuit , and flight , and mad return of wave on wave , and savage struggle , ending in a spouting-up of foam that whitens the black night ; incessant change of place , and form , and hue ; constancy in nothing , but eternal strife ; on , on , on , they roll , and darker grows the night , and louder howls the wind , and more clamorous and fierce become the million voices in the sea , when the wild cry goes forth upon the storm ' A ship ! '
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 72]: Onward she comes , in gallant combat with the elements , her tall masts trembling , and her timbers starting on the strain ; onward she comes , now high upon the curling billows , now low down in the hollows of the sea , as hiding for the moment from its fury ; and every storm-voice in the air and water cries more loudly yet , ' A ship ! '
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 71]: Still she comes striving on ; and at her boldness and the spreading cry , the angry waves rise up above each other 's hoary heads to look ; and round about the vessel , far as the mariners on the decks can pierce into the gloom , they press upon her , forcing each other down and starting up , and rushing forward from afar , in dreadful curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 32]: High over her they break ; and round her surge and roar ; and giving place to others , moaningly depart , and dash themselves to fragments in their baffled anger .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 6]: Still she comes onward bravely .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 91]: And though the eager multitude crowd thick and fast upon her all the night , and dawn of day discovers the untiring train yet bearing down upon the ship in an eternity of troubled water , onward she comes , with dim lights burning in her hull , and people there , asleep ; as if no deadly element were peering in at every seam and chink , and no drowned seaman 's grave , with but a plank to cover it , were yawning in the unfathomable depths below .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 40]: Among these sleeping voyagers were Martin and Mark Tapley , who , rocked into a heavy drowsiness by the unaccustomed motion , were as insensible to the foul air in which they lay , as to the uproar without .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 37]: It was broad day when the latter awoke with a dim idea that he was dreaming of having gone to sleep in a four-post bedstead which had turned bottom upwards in the course of the night .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 48]: There was more reason in this too , than in the roasting of eggs ; for the first objects Mr Tapley recognized when he opened his eyes were his own heels -- looking down to him , as he afterwards observed , from a nearly perpendicular elevation .
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 21]: said Mark , getting himself into a sitting posture , after various ineffectual struggles with the rolling of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 17]: ` This is the first time as ever I stood on my head all night . '
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 27]: ` You should n't go to sleep upon the ground with your head to leeward then , ' growled a man in one of the berths .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 8]: ` With my head to WHERE ? '
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 3]: asked Mark .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 7]: The man repeated his previous sentiment .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 25]: ` No , I wo n't another time , ' said Mark , ` when I know whereabouts on the map that country is .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 13]: In the meanwhile I can give you a better piece of advice .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 23]: Do n't you nor any other friend of mine never go to sleep with his head in a ship any more . '
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 24]: The man gave a grunt of discontented acquiescence , turned over in his berth , and drew his blanket over his head . '
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 34]: -- For , ' said Mr Tapley , pursuing the theme by way of soliloquy in a low tone of voice ; ` the sea is as nonsensical a thing as any going .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 9]: It never knows what to do with itself .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 19]: It has n't got no employment for its mind , and is always in a state of vacancy .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 25]: Like them Polar bears in the wild-beast shows as is constantly a-nodding their heads from side to side , it never CAN be quiet .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 10]: Which is entirely owing to its uncommon stupidity . '
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 8]: ` Is that you , Mark ? '
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 8]: asked a faint voice from another berth .
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 91]: ` It 's as much of me as is left , sir , after a fortnight of this work , ' Mr Tapley replied , ` What with leading the life of a fly , ever since I 've been aboard -- for I 've been perpetually holding-on to something or other in a upside-down position -- what with that , sir , and putting a very little into myself , and taking a good deal out of myself , there a n't too much of me to swear by .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 11]: How do you find yourself this morning , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 13]: ` Very miserable , ' said Martin , with a peevish groan .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 3]: ` Ugh .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 7]: This is wretched , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 23]: ` Creditable , ' muttered Mark , pressing one hand upon his aching head and looking round him with a rueful grin .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 7]: ` That 's the great comfort .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 11]: It IS creditable to keep up one 's spirits here .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 6]: Virtue 's its own reward .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 5]: So 's jollity . '
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 57]: Mark was so far right that unquestionably any man who retained his cheerfulness among the steerage accommodations of that noble and fast-sailing line-of-packet ship , ` THE SCREW , ' was solely indebted to his own resources , and shipped his good humour , like his provisions , without any contribution or assistance from the owners .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 114]: A dark , low , stifling cabin , surrounded by berths all filled to overflowing with men , women , and children , in various stages of sickness and misery , is not the liveliest place of assembly at any time ; but when it is so crowded -LRB- as the steerage cabin of the Screw was , every passage out -RRB- , that mattresses and beds are heaped upon the floor , to the extinction of everything like comfort , cleanliness , and decency , it is liable to operate not only as a pretty strong banner against amiability of temper , but as a positive encourager of selfish and rough humours .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 17]: Mark felt this , as he sat looking about him ; and his spirits rose proportionately .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 37]: There were English people , Irish people , Welsh people , and Scotch people there ; all with their little store of coarse food and shabby clothes ; and nearly all with their families of children .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 28]: There were children of all ages ; from the baby at the breast , to the slattern-girl who was as much a grown woman as her mother .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 65]: Every kind of domestic suffering that is bred in poverty , illness , banishment , sorrow , and long travel in bad weather , was crammed into the little space ; and yet was there infinitely less of complaint and querulousness , and infinitely more of mutual assistance and general kindness to be found in that unwholesome ark , than in many brilliant ballrooms .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 14]: Mark looked about him wistfully , and his face brightened as he looked .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 64]: Here an old grandmother was crooning over a sick child , and rocking it to and fro , in arms hardly more wasted than its own young limbs ; here a poor woman with an infant in her lap , mended another little creature 's clothes , and quieted another who was creeping up about her from their scanty bed upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 55]: Here were old men awkwardly engaged in little household offices , wherein they would have been ridiculous but for their good-will and kind purpose ; and here were swarthy fellows -- giants in their way -- doing such little acts of tenderness for those about them , as might have belonged to gentlest-hearted dwarfs .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 37]: The very idiot in the corner who sat mowing there , all day , had his faculty of imitation roused by what he saw about him ; and snapped his fingers to amuse a crying child .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 57]: ` Now , then , ' said Mark , nodding to a woman who was dressing her three children at no great distance from him -- and the grin upon his face had by this time spread from ear to ear -- ` Hand over one of them young ` uns according to custom . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 27]: I wish you 'd get breakfast , Mark , instead of worrying with people who do n't belong to you , ' observed Martin , petulantly .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 8]: ` All right , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 6]: ` SHE 'll do that .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 10]: It 's a fair division of labour , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 11]: I wash her boys , and she makes our tea .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 15]: I never COULD make tea , but any one can wash a boy . '
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 45]: The woman , who was delicate and ill , felt and understood his kindness , as well she might , for she had been covered every night with his greatcoat , while he had for his own bed the bare boards and a rug .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 31]: But Martin , who seldom got up or looked about him , was quite incensed by the folly of this speech , and expressed his dissatisfaction by an impatient groan .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 29]: ` So it is , certainly , ' said Mark , brushing the child 's hair as coolly as if he had been born and bred a barber .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 10]: ` What are you talking about , now ? '
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 3]: asked Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 26]: ` What you said , ' replied Mark ; ` or what you meant , when you gave that there dismal vent to your feelings .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 9]: I quite go along with it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 8]: It IS very hard upon her . '
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 5]: ` What is ? '
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 30]: ` Making the voyage by herself along with these young impediments here , and going such a way at such a time of the year to join her husband .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 48]: If you do n't want to be driven mad with yellow soap in your eye , young man , ' said Mr Tapley to the second urchin , who was by this time under his hands at the basin , ` you 'd better shut it . '
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 9]: ` Where does she join her husband ? '
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 5]: asked Martin , yawning .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 26]: ` Why , I 'm very much afraid , ' said Mr Tapley , in a low voice , ` that she do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 8]: I hope she may n't miss him .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 58]: But she sent her last letter by hand , and it do n't seem to have been very clearly understood between 'em without it , and if she do n't see him a-waving his pocket-handkerchief on the shore , like a pictur out of a song-book , my opinion is , she 'll break her heart . '
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 26]: ` Why , how , in Folly 's name , does the woman come to be on board ship on such a wild-goose venture ! '
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 3]: cried Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 26]: Mr Tapley glanced at him for a moment as he lay prostrate in his berth , and then said , very quietly : ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 3]: How indeed !
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 5]: I ca n't think !
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 32]: He 's been away from her for two year ; she 's been very poor and lonely in her own country ; and has always been a-looking forward to meeting him .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 9]: It 's very strange she should be here .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 3]: Quite amazing !
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 5]: A little mad perhaps !
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 13]: There ca n't be no other way of accounting for it . '
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 29]: Martin was too far gone in the lassitude of sea-sickness to make any reply to these words , or even to attend to them as they were spoken .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 70]: And the subject of their discourse returning at this crisis with some hot tea , effectually put a stop to any resumption of the theme by Mr Tapley ; who , when the meal was over and he had adjusted Martin 's bed , went up on deck to wash the breakfast service , which consisted of two half-pint tin mugs , and a shaving-pot of the same metal .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 56]: It is due to Mark Tapley to state that he suffered at least as much from sea-sickness as any man , woman , or child , on board ; and that he had a peculiar faculty of knocking himself about on the smallest provocation , and losing his legs at every lurch of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 82]: But resolved , in his usual phrase , to ` come out strong ' under disadvantageous circumstances , he was the life and soul of the steerage , and made no more of stopping in the middle of a facetious conversation to go away and be excessively ill by himself , and afterwards come back in the very best and gayest of tempers to resume it , than if such a course of proceeding had been the commonest in the world .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 53]: It can not be said that as his illness wore off , his cheerfulness and good nature increased , because they would hardly admit of augmentation ; but his usefulness among the weaker members of the party was much enlarged ; and at all times and seasons there he was exerting it .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 69]: If a gleam of sun shone out of the dark sky , down Mark tumbled into the cabin , and presently up he came again with a woman in his arms , or half-a-dozen children , or a man , or a bed , or a saucepan , or a basket , or something animate or inanimate , that he thought would be the better for the air .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 169]: If an hour or two of fine weather in the middle of the day tempted those who seldom or never came on deck at other times to crawl into the long-boat , or lie down upon the spare spars , and try to eat , there , in the centre of the group , was Mr Tapley , handing about salt beef and biscuit , or dispensing tastes of grog , or cutting up the children 's provisions with his pocketknife , for their greater ease and comfort , or reading aloud from a venerable newspaper , or singing some roaring old song to a select party , or writing the beginnings of letters to their friends at home for people who could n't write , or cracking jokes with the crew , or nearly getting blown over the side , or emerging , half-drowned , from a shower of spray , or lending a hand somewhere or other ; but always doing something for the general entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 121]: At night , when the cooking-fire was lighted on the deck , and the driving sparks that flew among the rigging , and the clouds of sails , seemed to menace the ship with certain annihilation by fire , in case the elements of air and water failed to compass her destruction ; there , again , was Mr Tapley , with his coat off and his shirt-sleeves turned up to his elbows , doing all kinds of culinary offices ; compounding the strangest dishes ; recognized by every one as an established authority ; and helping all parties to achieve something which , left to themselves , they never could have done , and never would have dreamed of .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 65]: In short , there never was a more popular character than Mark Tapley became , on board that noble and fast-sailing line-of-packet ship , the Screw ; and he attained at last to such a pitch of universal admiration , that he began to have grave doubts within himself whether a man might reasonably claim any credit for being jolly under such exciting circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 31]: ` If this was going to last , ' said Tapley , ` there 'd be no great difference as I can perceive , between the Screw and the Dragon .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 10]: I never am to get credit , I think .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 19]: I begin to be afraid that the Fates is determined to make the world easy to me . '
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 19]: ` Well , Mark , ' said Martin , near whose berth he had ruminated to this effect .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 8]: ` When will this be over ? '
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 22]: ` Another week , they say , sir , ' returned Mark , ` will most likely bring us into port .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 34]: The ship 's a-going along at present , as sensible as a ship can , sir ; though I do n't mean to say as that 's any very high praise . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 13]: I do n't think it is , indeed , ' groaned Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 23]: ` You 'd feel all the better for it , sir , if you was to turn out , ' observed Mark .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 40]: ` And be seen by the ladies and gentlemen on the after-deck , ' returned Martin , with a scronful emphasis upon the words , ` mingling with the beggarly crowd that are stowed away in this vile hole .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 13]: I should be greatly the better for that , no doubt . '
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 88]: ` I 'm thankful that I ca n't say from my own experience what the feelings of a gentleman may be , ' said Mark , ` but I should have thought , sir , as a gentleman would feel a deal more uncomfortable down here than up in the fresh air , especially when the ladies and gentlemen in the after-cabin know just as much about him as he does about them , and are likely to trouble their heads about him in the same proportion .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 10]: I should have thought that , certainly . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 23]: I tell you , then , ' rejoined Martin , ` you would have thought wrong , and do think wrong . '
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 16]: ` Very likely , sir , ' said Mark , with imperturbable good temper . '
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 5]: I often do . '
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 23]: ` As to lying here , ' cried Martin , raising himself on his elbow , and looking angrily at his follower .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 13]: ` Do you suppose it 's a pleasure to lie here ? '
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 31]: ` All the madhouses in the world , ' said Mr Tapley , ` could n't produce such a maniac as the man must be who could think that . '
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 15]: ` Then why are you forever goading and urging me to get up ? '
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 43]: asked Martin , ' I lie here because I do n't wish to be recognized , in the better days to which I aspire , by any purse-proud citizen , as the man who came over with him among the steerage passengers .
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 30]: I lie here because I wish to conceal my circumstances and myself , and not to arrive in a new world badged and ticketed as an utterly poverty-stricken man .
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 21]: If I could have afforded a passage in the after-cabin I should have held up my head with the rest .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 8]: As I could n't I hide it .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 7]: Do you understand that ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 12]: I am very sorry , sir , ' said Mark . '
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 17]: I did n't know you took it so much to heart as this comes to . '
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 13]: ` Of course you did n't know , ' returned his master .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 11]: ` How should you know , unless I told you ?
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 18]: It 's no trial to you , Mark , to make yourself comfortable and to bustle about .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 22]: It 's as natural for you to do so under the circumstances as it is for me not to do so .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 32]: Why , you do n't suppose there is a living creature in this ship who can by possibility have half so much to undergo on board of her as I have ?
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 4]: Do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 24]: he asked , sitting upright in his berth and looking at Mark , with an expression of great earnestness not unmixed with wonder .
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 35]: Mark twisted his face into a tight knot , and with his head very much on one side , pondered upon this question as if he felt it an extremely difficult one to answer .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 66]: He was relieved from his embarrassment by Martin himself , who said , as he stretched himself upon his back again and resumed the book he had been reading : ` But what is the use of my putting such a case to you , when the very essence of what I have been saying is , that you can not by possibility understand it !
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 57]: Make me a little brandy-and-water -- cold and very weak -- and give me a biscuit , and tell your friend , who is a nearer neighbour of ours than I could wish , to try and keep her children a little quieter to-night than she did last night ; that 's a good fellow . '
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 61]: Mr Tapley set himself to obey these orders with great alacrity , and pending their execution , it may be presumed his flagging spirits revived ; inasmuch as he several times observed , below his breath , that in respect of its power of imparting a credit to jollity , the Screw unquestionably had some decided advantages over the Dragon .
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 47]: He also remarked that it was a high gratification to him to reflect that he would carry its main excellence ashore with him , and have it constantly beside him wherever he went ; but what he meant by these consolatory thoughts he did not explain .
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 37]: And now a general excitement began to prevail on board ; and various predictions relative to the precise day , and even the precise hour at which they would reach New York , were freely broached .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 39]: There was infinitely more crowding on deck and looking over the ship 's side than there had been before ; and an epidemic broke out for packing up things every morning , which required unpacking again every night .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 67]: Those who had any letters to deliver , or any friends to meet , or any settled plans of going anywhere or doing anything , discussed their prospects a hundred times a day ; and as this class of passengers was very small , and the number of those who had no prospects whatever was very large , there were plenty of listeners and few talkers .
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 22]: Those who had been ill all along , got well now , and those who had been well , got better .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 63]: An American gentleman in the after-cabin , who had been wrapped up in fur and oilskin the whole passage , unexpectedly appeared in a very shiny , tall , black hat , and constantly overhauled a very little valise of pale leather , which contained his clothes , linen , brushes , shaving apparatus , books , trinkets , and other baggage .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 48]: He likewise stuck his hands deep into his pockets , and walked the deck with his nostrils dilated , as already inhaling the air of Freedom which carries death to all tyrants , and can never -LRB- under any circumstances worth mentioning -RRB- be breathed by slaves .
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 47]: An English gentleman who was strongly suspected of having run away from a bank , with something in his possession belonging to its strong box besides the key , grew eloquent upon the subject of the rights of man , and hummed the Marseillaise Hymn constantly .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 69]: In a word , one great sensation pervaded the whole ship , and the soil of America lay close before them ; so close at last , that , upon a certain starlight night they took a pilot on board , and within a few hours afterwards lay to until the morning , awaiting the arrival of a steamboat in which the passengers were to be conveyed ashore .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 54]: Off she came , soon after it was light next morning , and lying alongside an hour or more -- during which period her very firemen were objects of hardly less interest and curiosity than if they had been so many angels , good or bad -- took all her living freight aboard .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 58]: Among them Mark , who still had his friend and her three children under his close protection ; and Martin , who had once more dressed himself in his usual attire , but wore a soiled , old cloak above his ordinary clothes , until such time as he should separate for ever from his late companions .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 58]: The steamer -- which , with its machinery on deck , looked , as it worked its long slim legs , like some enormously magnified insect or antediluvian monster -- dashed at great speed up a beautiful bay ; and presently they saw some heights , and islands , and a long , flat , straggling city .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 23]: ` And this , ' said Mr Tapley , looking far ahead , ` is the Land of Liberty , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 3]: Very well .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 4]: I 'm agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 13]: Any land will do for me , after so much water ! '
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 37]: CHAPTER SIXTEEN MARTIN DISEMBARKS FROM THAT NOBLE AND FAST -- SAILING LINE -- OF -- PACKET SHIP , ` THE SCREW ' , AT THE PORT OF NEW YORK , IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA .
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 13]: HE MAKES SOME ACQUAINTANCES , AND DINES AT A BOARDING -- HOUSE .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 92]: THE PARTICULARS OF THOSE TRANSACTIONS Some trifling excitement prevailed upon the very brink and margin of the land of liberty ; for an alderman had been elected the day before ; and Party Feeling naturally running rather high on such an exciting occasion , the friends of the disappointed candidate had found it necessary to assert the great principles of Purity of Election and Freedom of opinion by breaking a few legs and arms , and furthermore pursuing one obnoxious gentleman through the streets with the design of hitting his nose .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 101]: These good-humoured little outbursts of the popular fancy were not in themselves sufficiently remarkable to create any great stir , after the lapse of a whole night ; but they found fresh life and notoriety in the breath of the newsboys , who not only proclaimed them with shrill yells in all the highways and byways of the town , upon the wharves and among the shipping , but on the deck and down in the cabins of the steamboat ; which , before she touched the shore , was boarded and overrun by a legion of those young citizens .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 11]: ` Here 's this morning 's New York Sewer ! '
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 3]: cried one .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 10]: ` Here 's this morning 's New York Stabber !
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 8]: Here 's the New York Family Spy !
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 8]: Here 's the New York Private Listener !
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 7]: Here 's the New York Peeper !
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 7]: Here 's the New York Plunderer !
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 8]: Here 's the New York Keyhole Reporter !
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 8]: Here 's the New York Rowdy Journal !
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 8]: Here 's all the New York papers !
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 47]: Here 's full particulars of the patriotic locofoco movement yesterday , in which the whigs was so chawed up ; and the last Alabama gouging case ; and the interesting Arkansas dooel with Bowie knives ; and all the Political , Commercial , and Fashionable News .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 4]: Here they are !
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 4]: Here they are !
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 11]: Here 's the papers , here 's the papers ! '
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 7]: ` Here 's the Sewer ! '
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 3]: cried another .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 8]: ` Here 's the New York Sewer !
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 78]: Here 's some of the twelfth thousand of to-day 's Sewer , with the best accounts of the markets , and all the shipping news , and four whole columns of country correspondence , and a full account of the Ball at Mrs White 's last night , where all the beauty and fashion of New York was assembled ; with the Sewer 's own particulars of the private lives of all the ladies that was there !
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 5]: Here 's the Sewer !
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 13]: Here 's some of the twelfth thousand of the New York Sewer !
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 60]: Here 's the Sewer 's exposure of the Wall Street Gang , and the Sewer 's exposure of the Washington Gang , and the Sewer 's exclusive account of a flagrant act of dishonesty committed by the Secretary of State when he was eight years old ; now communicated , at a great expense , by his own nurse .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 5]: Here 's the Sewer !
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 30]: Here 's the New York Sewer , in its twelfth thousand , with a whole column of New Yorkers to be shown up , and all their names printed !
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 50]: Here 's the Sewer 's article upon the Judge that tried him , day afore yesterday , for libel , and the Sewer 's tribute to the independent Jury that did n't convict him , and the Sewer 's account of what they might have expected if they had !
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 10]: Here 's the Sewer , here 's the Sewer !
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 39]: Here 's the wide-awake Sewer ; always on the lookout ; the leading Journal of the United States , now in its twelfth thousand , and still a-printing off : -- Here 's the New York Sewer ! '
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 31]: ` It is in such enlightened means , ' said a voice almost in Martin 's ear , ` that the bubbling passions of my country find a vent . '
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 63]: Martin turned involuntarily , and saw , standing close at his side , a sallow gentleman , with sunken cheeks , black hair , small twinkling eyes , and a singular expression hovering about that region of his face , which was not a frown , nor a leer , and yet might have been mistaken at the first glance for either .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 32]: Indeed it would have been difficult , on a much closer acquaintance , to describe it in any more satisfactory terms than as a mixed expression of vulgar cunning and conceit .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 28]: This gentleman wore a rather broad-brimmed hat for the greater wisdom of his appearance ; and had his arms folded for the greater impressiveness of his attitude .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 67]: He was somewhat shabbily dressed in a blue surtout reaching nearly to his ankles , short loose trousers of the same colour , and a faded buff waistcoat , through which a discoloured shirt-frill struggled to force itself into notice , as asserting an equality of civil rights with the other portions of his dress , and maintaining a declaration of Independence on its own account .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 62]: His feet , which were of unusually large proportions , were leisurely crossed before him as he half leaned against , half sat upon , the steamboat 's bulwark ; and his thick cane , shod with a mighty ferule at one end and armed with a great metal knob at the other , depended from a line-and-tassel on his wrist .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 54]: Thus attired , and thus composed into an aspect of great profundity , the gentleman twitched up the right-hand corner of his mouth and his right eye simultaneously , and said , once more : ` It is in such enlightened means that the bubbling passions of my country find a vent . '
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 27]: As he looked at Martin , and nobody else was by , Martin inclined his head , and said : ` You allude to -- ? '
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 40]: ` To the Palladium of rational Liberty at home , sir , and the dread of Foreign oppression abroad , ' returned the gentleman , as he pointed with his cane to an uncommonly dirty newsboy with one eye .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 17]: ` To the Envy of the world , sir , and the leaders of Human Civilization .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 43]: Let me ask you sir , ' he added , bringing the ferule of his stick heavily upon the deck with the air of a man who must not be equivocated with , ` how do you like my Country ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 23]: I am hardly prepared to answer that question yet , ' said Martin ` seeing that I have not been ashore . '
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 30]: ` Well , I should expect you were not prepared , sir , ' said the gentleman , ` to behold such signs of National Prosperity as those ? '
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 36]: He pointed to the vessels lying at the wharves ; and then gave a vague flourish with his stick , as if he would include the air and water , generally , in this remark .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 13]: ` Really , ' said Martin , ' I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 6]: I think I was . '
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 17]: The gentleman glanced at him with a knowing look , and said he liked his policy .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 22]: It was natural , he said , and it pleased him as a philosopher to observe the prejudices of human nature .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 54]: ` You have brought , I see , sir , ' he said , turning round towards Martin , and resting his chin on the top of his stick , ` the usual amount of misery and poverty and ignorance and crime , to be located in the bosom of the great Republic .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 4]: Well , sir !
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 11]: let 'em come on in shiploads from the old country .
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 15]: When vessels are about to founder , the rats are said to leave 'em .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 14]: There is considerable of truth , I find , in that remark . '
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 92]: ` The old ship will keep afloat a year or two longer yet , perhaps , ' said Martin with a smile , partly occasioned by what the gentleman said , and partly by his manner of saying it , which was odd enough for he emphasised all the small words and syllables in his discourse , and left the others to take care of themselves ; as if he thought the larger parts of speech could be trusted alone , but the little ones required to be constantly looked after .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 25]: ` Hope is said by the poet , sir , ' observed the gentleman , ` to be the nurse of young Desire . '
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 19]: Martin signified that he had heard of the cardinal virtue in question serving occasionally in that domestic capacity .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 23]: ` She will not rear her infant in the present instance , sir , you 'll find , ' observed the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 9]: ` Time will show , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 19]: The gentleman nodded his head gravely ; and said , ` What is your name , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 4]: Martin told him .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 9]: ` How old are you , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 4]: Martin told him .
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 9]: ` What is your profession , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 6]: Martin told him that also .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 9]: ` What is your destination , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 4]: inquired the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 27]: ` Really , ' said Martin laughing , ' I ca n't satisfy you in that particular , for I do n't know it myself . '
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 4]: ` Yes ? '
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 4]: said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 7]: ` No , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 29]: The gentleman adjusted his cane under his left arm , and took a more deliberate and complete survey of Martin than he had yet had leisure to make .
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 31]: When he had completed his inspection , he put out his right hand , shook Martin 's hand , and said : ` My name is Colonel Diver , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 12]: I am the Editor of the New York Rowdy Journal . '
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 18]: Martin received the communication with that degree of respect which an announcement so distinguished appeared to demand .
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 33]: ` The New York Rowdy Journal , sir , ' resumed the colonel , ` is , as I expect you know , the organ of our aristocracy in this city . '
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 9]: there IS an aristocracy here , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 8]: ` Of what is it composed ? '
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 17]: ` Of intelligence , sir , ' replied the colonel ; ` of intelligence and virtue .
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 14]: And of their necessary consequence in this republic -- dollars , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 38]: Martin was very glad to hear this , feeling well assured that if intelligence and virtue led , as a matter of course , to the acquisition of dollars , he would speedily become a great capitalist .
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 62]: He was about to express the gratification such news afforded him , when he was interrupted by the captain of the ship , who came up at the moment to shake hands with the colonel ; and who , seeing a well-dressed stranger on the deck -LRB- for Martin had thrown aside his cloak -RRB- , shook hands with him also .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 44]: This was an unspeakable relief to Martin , who , in spite of the acknowledged supremacy of Intelligence and virtue in that happy country , would have been deeply mortified to appear before Colonel Diver in the poor character of a steerage passenger .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 7]: ` Well cap ` en ! '
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 4]: said the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 9]: ` Well colonel , ' cried the captain .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 10]: ` You 're looking most uncommon bright , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 16]: I can hardly realise its being you , and that 's a fact . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 9]: A good passage , cap ` en ? '
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 12]: inquired the colonel , taking him aside , ` Well now !
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 33]: It was a pretty spanking run , sir , ' said , or rather sung , the captain , who was a genuine New Englander ; ` con-siderin ' the weather . '
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 4]: ` Yes ? '
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 4]: said the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 10]: It was , sir , ' said the captain .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 19]: ` I 've just now sent a boy up to your office with the passenger-list , colonel . '
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 19]: ` You have n't got another boy to spare , p ` raps , cap ` en ? '
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 13]: said the colonel , in a tone almost amounting to severity . '
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 18]: I guess there air a dozen if you want 'em , colonel , ' said the captain .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 26]: ` One moderate big ` un could convey a dozen champagne , perhaps , ' observed the colonel , musing , ` to my office .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 10]: You said a spanking run , I think ? '
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 12]: ` Well , so I did , ' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 14]: ` It 's very nigh , you know , ' observed the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 14]: ` I 'm glad it was a spanking run , cap ` en .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 12]: Do n't mind about quarts if you 're short of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 15]: The boy can as well bring four-and-twenty pints , and travel twice as once .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 12]: -- A first-rate spanker , cap ` en , was it ?
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 4]: Yes ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 13]: A most e -- tarnal spanker , ' said the skipper . '
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 11]: I admire at your good fortun , cap ` en .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 18]: You might loan me a corkscrew at the same time , and half-a-dozen glasses if you liked .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 54]: However bad the elements combine against my country 's noble packet-ship , the Screw , sir , ' said the colonel , turning to Martin , and drawing a flourish on the surface of the deck with his cane , ` her passage either way is almost certain to eventuate a spanker ! '
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 112]: The captain , who had the Sewer below at that moment , lunching expensively in one cabin , while the amiable Stabber was drinking himself into a state of blind madness in another , took a cordial leave of his friend the colonel , and hurried away to dispatch the champagne ; well knowing -LRB- as it afterwards appeared -RRB- that if he failed to conciliate the editor of the Rowdy Journal , that potentate would denounce him and his ship in large capitals before he was a day older ; and would probably assault the memory of his mother also , who had not been dead more than twenty years .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 48]: The colonel being again left alone with Martin , checked him as he was moving away , and offered in consideration of his being an Englishman , to show him the town and to introduce him , if such were his desire , to a genteel boarding-house .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 40]: But before they entered on these proceedings -LRB- he said -RRB- , he would beseech the honour of his company at the office of the Rowdy Journal , to partake of a bottle of champagne of his own importation .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 24]: All this was so extremely kind and hospitable , that Martin , though it was quite early in the morning , readily acquiesced .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 52]: So , instructing Mark , who was deeply engaged with his friend and her three children , that when he had done assisting them , and had cleared the baggage , he was to wait for further orders at the Rowdy Journal Office , Martin accompanied his new friend on shore .
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 120]: They made their way as they best could through the melancholy crowd of emigrants upon the wharf , who , grouped about their beds and boxes , with the bare ground below them and the bare sky above , might have fallen from another planet , for anything they knew of the country ; and walked for some short distance along a busy street , bounded on one side by the quays and shipping ; and on the other by a long row of staring red-brick storehouses and offices , ornamented with more black boards and white letters , and more white boards and black letters , than Martin had ever seen before , in fifty times the space .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 35]: Presently they turned up a narrow street , and presently into other narrow streets , until at last they stopped before a house whereon was painted in great characters , ` ROWDY JOURNAL . '
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 89]: The colonel , who had walked the whole way with one hand in his breast , his head occasionally wagging from side to side , and his hat thrown back upon his ears , like a man who was oppressed to inconvenience by a sense of his own greatness , led the way up a dark and dirty flight of stairs into a room of similar character , all littered and bestrewn with odds and ends of newspapers and other crumpled fragments , both in proof and manuscript .
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 68]: Behind a mangy old writing-table in this apartment sat a figure with a stump of a pen in its mouth and a great pair of scissors in its right hand , clipping and slicing at a file of Rowdy Journals ; and it was such a laughable figure that Martin had some difficulty in preserving his gravity , though conscious of the close observation of Colonel Diver .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 63]: The individual who sat clipping and slicing as aforesaid at the Rowdy Journals , was a small young gentleman of very juvenile appearance , and unwholesomely pale in the face ; partly , perhaps , from intense thought , but partly , there is no doubt , from the excessive use of tobacco , which he was at that moment chewing vigorously .
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 67]: He wore his shirt-collar turned down over a black ribbon ; and his lank hair , a fragile crop , was not only smoothed and parted back from his brow , that none of the Poetry of his aspect might be lost , but had , here and there , been grubbed up by the roots ; which accounted for his loftiest developments being somewhat pimply .
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 37]: He had that order of nose on which the envy of mankind has bestowed the appellation ` snub , ' and it was very much turned up at the end , as with a lofty scorn .
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 61]: Upon the upper lip of this young gentleman were tokens of a sandy down ; so very , very smooth and scant , that , though encouraged to the utmost , it looked more like a recent trace of gingerbread than the fair promise of a moustache ; and this conjecture , his apparently tender age went far to strengthen .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 7]: He was intent upon his work .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 27]: Every time he snapped the great pair of scissors , he made a corresponding motion with his jaws , which gave him a very terrible appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 31]: Martin was not long in determining within himself that this must be Colonel Diver 's son ; the hope of the family , and future mainspring of the Rowdy Journal .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 56]: Indeed he had begun to say that he presumed this was the colonel 's little boy , and that it was very pleasant to see him playing at Editor in all the guilelessness of childhood , when the colonel proudly interposed and said : ` My War Correspondent , sir -- Mr Jefferson Brick ! '
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 22]: Martin could not help starting at this unexpected announcement , and the consciousness of the irretrievable mistake he had nearly made .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 53]: Mr Brick seemed pleased with the sensation he produced upon the stranger , and shook hands with him , with an air of patronage designed to reassure him , and to let him blow that there was no occasion to be frightened , for he -LRB- Brick -RRB- would n't hurt him .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 22]: ` You have heard of Jefferson Brick , I see , sir , ' quoth the colonel , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 8]: ` England has heard of Jefferson Brick .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 7]: Europe has heard of Jefferson Brick .
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 4]: Let me see .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 9]: When did you leave England , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 9]: ` Five weeks ago , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 26]: ` Five weeks ago , ' repeated the colonel , thoughtfully ; as he took his seat upon the table , and swung his legs .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 35]: ` Now let me ask you , sir which of Mr Brick 's articles had become at that time the most obnoxious to the British Parliament and the Court of Saint James 's ? '
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 43]: ` Upon my word , ' said Martin , ` I -- ' ' I have reason to know , sir , ' interrupted the colonel , ` that the aristocratic circles of your country quail before the name of Jefferson Brick .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 82]: I should like to be informed , sir , from your lips , which of his sentiments has struck the deadliest blow -- ' ` At the hundred heads of the Hydra of Corruption now grovelling in the dust beneath the lance of Reason , and spouting up to the universal arch above us , its sanguinary gore , ' said Mr Brick , putting on a little blue cloth cap with a glazed front , and quoting his last article .
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 14]: ` The libation of freedom , Brick ' -- hinted the colonel . '
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 14]: -- Must sometimes be quaffed in blood , colonel , ' cried Brick .
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 33]: And when he said ` blood , ' he gave the great pair of scissors a sharp snap , as if THEY said blood too , and were quite of his opinion .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 14]: This done , they both looked at Martin , pausing for a reply .
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 44]: ` Upon my life , ' said Martin , who had by this time quite recovered his usual coolness , ' I ca n't give you any satisfactory information about it ; for the truth is that I -- ' ` Stop ! '
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 20]: cried the colonel , glancing sternly at his war correspondent and giving his head one shake after every sentence .
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 11]: ` That you never heard of Jefferson Brick , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 9]: That you never read Jefferson Brick , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 10]: That you never saw the Rowdy Journal , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 17]: That you never knew , sir , of its mighty influence upon the cabinets of Europe .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 3]: Yes ? '
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 16]: ` That 's what I was about to observe , certainly , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 12]: ` Keep cool , Jefferson , ' said the colonel gravely .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 5]: ` Do n't bust !
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 4]: oh you Europeans !
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 12]: After that , let 's have a glass of wine ! '
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 29]: So saying , he got down from the table , and produced , from a basket outside the door , a bottle of champagne , and three glasses .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 36]: ` Mr Jefferson Brick , sir , ' said the colonel , filling Martin 's glass and his own , and pushing the bottle to that gentleman , ` will give us a sentiment . '
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 6]: ` Well , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 19]: cried the war correspondent , ` Since you have concluded to call upon me , I will respond .
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 50]: I will give you , sir , The Rowdy Journal and its brethren ; the well of Truth , whose waters are black from being composed of printers ' ink , but are quite clear enough for my country to behold the shadow of her Destiny reflected in . '
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 6]: ` Hear , hear ! '
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 8]: cried the colonel , with great complacency .
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 16]: ` There are flowery components , sir , in the language of my friend ? '
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 11]: ` Very much so , indeed , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 19]: ` There is to-day 's Rowdy , sir , ' observed the colonel , handing him a paper .
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 21]: ` You 'll find Jefferson Brick at his usual post in the van of human civilization and moral purity . '
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 12]: The colonel was by this time seated on the table again .
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 22]: Mr Brick also took up a position on that same piece of furniture ; and they fell to drinking pretty hard .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 17]: They often looked at Martin as he read the paper , and then at each other .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 27]: When he laid it down , which was not until they had finished a second bottle , the colonel asked him what he thought of it .
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 12]: ` Why , it 's horribly personal , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 16]: The colonel seemed much flattered by this remark ; and said he hoped it was .
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 14]: ` We are independent here , sir , ' said Mr Jefferson Brick .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 8]: ` We do as we like . '
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 37]: ` If I may judge from this specimen , ' returned Martin , ` there must be a few thousands here , rather the reverse of independent , who do as they do n't like . '
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 18]: They yield to the popular mind of the Popular Instructor , sir , ' said the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 53]: ` They rile up , sometimes ; but in general we have a hold upon our citizens , both in public and in private life , which is as much one of the ennobling institutions of our happy country as -- ' ` As nigger slavery itself , ' suggested Mr Brick .
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 11]: ` En -- tirely so , ' remarked the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 55]: ` Pray , ' said Martin , after some hesitation , ` may I venture to ask , with reference to a case I observe in this paper of yours , whether the Popular Instructor often deals in -- I am at a loss to express it without giving you offence -- in forgery ?
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 38]: In forged letters , for instance , ' he pursued , for the colonel was perfectly calm and quite at his ease , ` solemnly purporting to have been written at recent periods by living men ? '
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 6]: ` Well , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 4]: replied the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 9]: ` It does , now and then . '
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 12]: ` And the popular instructed -- what do they do ? '
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 3]: asked Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 9]: ` Buy 'em : ' said the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 15]: Mr Jefferson Brick expectorated and laughed ; the former copiously , the latter approvingly .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 13]: ` Buy 'em by hundreds of thousands , ' resumed the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 14]: ` We are a smart people here , and can appreciate smartness . '
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 8]: ` Is smartness American for forgery ? '
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 3]: asked Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 22]: said the colonel , ' I expect it 's American for a good many things that you call by other names .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 9]: But you ca n't help yourself in Europe .
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 4]: We can . '
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 10]: ` And do , sometimes , ' thought Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 12]: ` You help yourselves with very little ceremony , too ! '
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 48]: ` At all events , whatever name we choose to employ , ' said the colonel , stooping down to roll the third empty bottle into a corner after the other two , ' I suppose the art of forgery was not invented here sir ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 8]: I suppose not , ' replied Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 11]: ` Nor any other kind of smartness I reckon ? '
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 3]: ` Invented !
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 7]: No , I presume not . '
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 32]: said the colonel ; ` then we got it all from the old country , and the old country 's to blame for it , and not the new ` un .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 7]: There 's an end of THAT .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 28]: Now , if Mr Jefferson Brick and you will be so good as to clear , I 'll come out last , and lock the door . '
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 25]: Rightly interpreting this as the signal for their departure , Martin walked downstairs after the war correspondent , who preceded him with great majesty .
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 60]: The colonel following , they left the Rowdy Journal Office and walked forth into the streets ; Martin feeling doubtful whether he ought to kick the colonel for having presumed to speak to him , or whether it came within the bounds of possibility that he and his establishment could be among the boasted usages of that regenerated land .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 37]: It was clear that Colonel Diver , in the security of his strong position , and in his perfect understanding of the public sentiment , cared very little what Martin or anybody else thought about him .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 43]: His high-spiced wares were made to sell , and they sold ; and his thousands of readers could as rationally charge their delight in filth upon him , as a glutton can shift upon his cook the responsibility of his beastly excess .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 68]: Nothing would have delighted the colonel more than to be told that no such man as he could walk in high success the streets of any other country in the world ; for that would only have been a logical assurance to him of the correct adaptation of his labours to the prevailing taste , and of his being strictly and peculiarly a national feature of America .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 30]: They walked a mile or more along a handsome street which the colonel said was called Broadway , and which Mr Jefferson Brick said ` whipped the universe . '
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 88]: Turning , at length , into one of the numerous streets which branched from this main thoroughfare , they stopped before a rather mean-looking house with jalousie blinds to every window ; a flight of steps before the green street-door ; a shining white ornament on the rails on either side like a petrified pineapple , polished ; a little oblong plate of the same material over the knocker whereon the name of ` Pawkins ' was engraved ; and four accidental pigs looking down the area .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 36]: The colonel knocked at this house with the air of a man who lived there ; and an Irish girl popped her head out of one of the top windows to see who it was .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 31]: Pending her journey downstairs , the pigs were joined by two or three friends from the next street , in company with whom they lay down sociably in the gutter .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 7]: ` Is the major indoors ? '
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 8]: inquired the colonel , as he entered .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 9]: ` Is it the master , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 22]: returned the girl , with a hesitation which seemed to imply that they were rather flush of majors in that establishment .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 5]: ` The master ! '
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 14]: said Colonel Diver , stopping short and looking round at his war correspondent .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 11]: The depressing institutions of that British empire , colonel ! '
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 4]: said Jefferson Brick .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 4]: ` Master ! '
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 10]: ` What 's the matter with the word ? '
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 4]: asked Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 49]: I should hope it was never heard in our country , sir ; that 's all , ' said Jefferson Brick ; ` except when it is used by some degraded Help , as new to the blessings of our form of government , as this Help is .
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 7]: There are no masters here . '
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 10]: ` All `` owners , '' are they ? '
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 15]: Mr Jefferson Brick followed in the Rowdy Journal 's footsteps without returning any answer .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 53]: Martin took the same course , thinking as he went , that perhaps the free and independent citizens , who in their moral elevation , owned the colonel for their master , might render better homage to the goddess , Liberty , in nightly dreams upon the oven of a Russian Serf .
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 65]: The colonel led the way into a room at the back of the house upon the ground-floor , light , and of fair dimensions , but exquisitely uncomfortable ; having nothing in it but the four cold white walls and ceiling , a mean carpet , a dreary waste of dining-table reaching from end to end , and a bewildering collection of cane-bottomed chairs .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 49]: In the further region of this banqueting-hall was a stove , garnished on either side with a great brass spittoon , and shaped in itself like three little iron barrels set up on end in a fender , and joined together on the principle of the Siamese Twins .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 54]: Before it , swinging himself in a rocking-chair , lounged a large gentleman with his hat on , who amused himself by spitting alternately into the spittoon on the right hand of the stove , and the spittoon on the left , and then working his way back again in the same order .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 67]: A negro lad in a soiled white jacket was busily engaged in placing on the table two long rows of knives and forks , relieved at intervals by jugs of water ; and as he travelled down one side of this festive board , he straightened with his dirty hands the dirtier cloth , which was all askew , and had not been removed since breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 57]: The atmosphere of this room was rendered intensely hot and stifling by the stove ; but being further flavoured by a sickly gush of soup from the kitchen , and by such remote suggestions of tobacco as lingered within the brazen receptacles already mentioned , it became , to a stranger 's senses , almost insupportable .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 63]: The gentleman in the rocking-chair having his back towards them , and being much engaged in his intellectual pastime , was not aware of their approach until the colonel , walking up to the stove , contributed his mite towards the support of the left-hand spittoon , just as the major -- for it was the major -- bore down upon it .
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 53]: Major Pawkins then reserved his fire , and looking upward , said , with a peculiar air of quiet weariness , like a man who had been up all night -- an air which Martin had already observed both in the colonel and Mr Jefferson Brick -- ` Well , colonel ! '
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 33]: ` Here is a gentleman from England , major , ' the colonel replied , ` who has concluded to locate himself here if the amount of compensation suits him . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 28]: I am glad to see you , sir , ' observed the major , shaking hands with Martin , and not moving a muscle of his face .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 10]: ` You are pretty bright , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 8]: ` Never better , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 13]: ` You are never likely to be , ' returned the major .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 11]: ` You will see the sun shine HERE . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 20]: I think I remember to have seen it shine at home sometimes , ' said Martin , smiling . '
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 9]: I think not , ' replied the major .
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 26]: He said so with a stoical indifference certainly , but still in a tone of firmness which admitted of no further dispute on that point .
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 36]: When he had thus settled the question , he put his hat a little on one side for the greater convenience of scratching his head , and saluted Mr Jefferson Brick with a lazy nod .
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 52]: Major Pawkins -LRB- a gentleman of Pennsylvanian origin -RRB- was distinguished by a very large skull , and a great mass of yellow forehead ; in deference to which commodities it was currently held in bar-rooms and other such places of resort that the major was a man of huge sagacity .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 39]: He was further to be known by a heavy eye and a dull slow manner ; and for being a man of that kind who -- mentally speaking -- requires a deal of room to turn himself in .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 43]: But , in trading on his stock of wisdom , he invariably proceeded on the principle of putting all the goods he had -LRB- and more -RRB- into his window ; and that went a great way with his constituency of admirers .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 37]: It went a great way , perhaps , with Mr Jefferson Brick , who took occasion to whisper in Martin 's ear : ` One of the most remarkable men in our country , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 40]: It must not be supposed , however , that the perpetual exhibition in the market-place of all his stock-in-trade for sale or hire , was the major 's sole claim to a very large share of sympathy and support .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 46]: He was a great politician ; and the one article of his creed , in reference to all public obligations involving the good faith and integrity of his country , was , ` run a moist pen slick through everything , and start fresh . '
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 6]: This made him a patriot .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 9]: In commercial affairs he was a bold speculator .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 51]: In plainer words he had a most distinguished genius for swindling , and could start a bank , or negotiate a loan , or form a land-jobbing company -LRB- entailing ruin , pestilence , and death , on hundreds of families -RRB- , with any gifted creature in the Union .
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 9]: This made him an admirable man of business .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 58]: He could hang about a bar-room , discussing the affairs of the nation , for twelve hours together ; and in that time could hold forth with more intolerable dulness , chew more tobacco , smoke more tobacco , drink more rum-toddy , mint-julep , gin-sling , and cocktail , than any private gentleman of his acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 12]: This made him an orator and a man of the people .
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 46]: In a word , the major was a rising character , and a popular character , and was in a fair way to be sent by the popular party to the State House of New York , if not in the end to Washington itself .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 40]: But as a man 's private prosperity does not always keep pace with his patriotic devotion to public affairs ; and as fraudulent transactions have their downs as well as ups , the major was occasionally under a cloud .
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 23]: Hence , just now Mrs Pawkins kept a boarding-house , and Major Pawkins rather ` loafed ' his time away than otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 24]: ` You have come to visit our country , sir , at a season of great commercial depression , ' said the major .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 11]: ` At an alarming crisis , ' said the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 15]: ` At a period of unprecedented stagnation , ' said Mr Jefferson Brick . '
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 11]: I am sorry to hear that , ' returned Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 12]: ` It 's not likely to last , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 89]: Martin knew nothing about America , or he would have known perfectly well that if its individual citizens , to a man , are to be believed , it always IS depressed , and always IS stagnated , and always IS at an alarming crisis , and never was otherwise ; though as a body they are ready to make oath upon the Evangelists at any hour of the day or night , that it is the most thriving and prosperous of all countries on the habitable globe .
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 12]: ` It 's not likely to last , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 21]: returned the major , ' I expect we shall get along somehow , and come right in the end . '
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 13]: ` We are an elastic country , ' said the Rowdy Journal .
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 13]: ` We are a young lion , ' said Mr Jefferson Brick .
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 15]: ` We have revivifying and vigorous principles within ourselves , ' observed the major .
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 12]: ` Shall we drink a bitter afore dinner , colonel ? '
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 35]: The colonel assenting to this proposal with great alacrity , Major Pawkins proposed an adjournment to a neighbouring bar-room , which , as he observed , was ` only in the next block . '
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 57]: He then referred Martin to Mrs Pawkins for all particulars connected with the rate of board and lodging , and informed him that he would have the pleasure of seeing that lady at dinner , which would soon be ready , as the dinner hour was two o'clock , and it only wanted a quarter now .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 39]: This reminded him that if the bitter were to be taken at all , there was no time to lose ; so he walked off without more ado , and left them to follow if they thought proper .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 51]: When the major rose from his rocking-chair before the stove , and so disturbed the hot air and balmy whiff of soup which fanned their brows , the odour of stale tobacco became so decidedly prevalent as to leave no doubt of its proceeding mainly from that gentleman 's attire .
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 66]: Indeed , as Martin walked behind him to the bar-room , he could not help thinking that the great square major , in his listlessness and langour , looked very much like a stale weed himself ; such as might be hoed out of the public garden , with great advantage to the decent growth of that preserve , and tossed on some congenial dunghill .
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 33]: They encountered more weeds in the bar-room , some of whom -LRB- being thirsty souls as well as dirty -RRB- were pretty stale in one sense , and pretty fresh in another .
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 76]: Among them was a gentleman who , as Martin gathered from the conversation that took place over the bitter , started that afternoon for the Far West on a six months ' business tour , and who , as his outfit and equipment for this journey , had just such another shiny hat and just such another little pale valise as had composed the luggage of the gentleman who came from England in the Screw .
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 47]: They were walking back very leisurely ; Martin arm-in-arm with Mr Jefferson Brick , and the major and the colonel side-by-side before them ; when , as they came within a house or two of the major 's residence , they heard a bell ringing violently .
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 59]: The instant this sound struck upon their ears , the colonel and the major darted off , dashed up the steps and in at the street-door -LRB- which stood ajar -RRB- like lunatics ; while Mr Jefferson Brick , detaching his arm from Martin 's , made a precipitate dive in the same direction , and vanished also .
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 5]: ` Good Heaven ! '
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 3]: thought Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 7]: ` The premises are on fire !
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 7]: It was an alarm bell ! '
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 21]: But there was no smoke to be seen , nor any flame , nor was there any smell of fire .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 54]: As Martin faltered on the pavement , three more gentlemen , with horror and agitation depicted in their faces , came plunging wildly round the street corner ; jostled each other on the steps ; struggled for an instant ; and rushed into the house , a confused heap of arms and legs .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 10]: Unable to bear it any longer , Martin followed .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 32]: Even in his rapid progress he was run down , thrust aside , and passed , by two more gentlemen , stark mad , as it appeared , with fierce excitement .
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 6]: ` Where is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 15]: cried Martin , breathlessly , to a negro whom he encountered in the passage .
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 8]: ` In a eatin room , sa .
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 16]: Kernell , sa , him kep a seat ` side himself , sa . ' '
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 4]: A seat ! '
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 3]: cried Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 8]: ` For a dinnar , sa . '
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 45]: Martin started at him for a moment , and burst into a hearty laugh ; to which the negro , out of his natural good humour and desire to please , so heartily responded , that his teeth shone like a gleam of light .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 31]: ` You 're the pleasantest fellow I have seen yet , ' said Martin clapping him on the back , ` and give me a better appetite than bitters . '
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 44]: With this sentiment he walked into the dining-room and slipped into a chair next the colonel , which that gentleman -LRB- by this time nearly through his dinner -RRB- had turned down in reserve for him , with its back against the table .
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 11]: It was a numerous company -- eighteen or twenty perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 20]: Of these some five or six were ladies , who sat wedged together in a little phalanx by themselves .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 61]: All the knives and forks were working away at a rate that was quite alarming ; very few words were spoken ; and everybody seemed to eat his utmost in self-defence , as if a famine were expected to set in before breakfast time to-morrow morning , and it had become high time to assert the first law of nature .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 66]: The poultry , which may perhaps be considered to have formed the staple of the entertainment -- for there was a turkey at the top , a pair of ducks at the bottom , and two fowls in the middle -- disappeared as rapidly as if every bird had had the use of its wings , and had flown in desperation down a human throat .
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 24]: The oysters , stewed and pickled , leaped from their capacious reservoirs , and slid by scores into the mouths of the assembly .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 20]: The sharpest pickles vanished , whole cucumbers at once , like sugar-plums , and no man winked his eye .
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 13]: Great heaps of indigestible matter melted away as ice before the sun .
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 11]: It was a solemn and an awful thing to see .
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 27]: Dyspeptic individuals bolted their food in wedges ; feeding , not themselves , but broods of nightmares , who were continually standing at livery within them .
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 28]: Spare men , with lank and rigid cheeks , came out unsatisfied from the destruction of heavy dishes , and glared with watchful eyes upon the pastry .
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 15]: What Mrs Pawkins felt each day at dinner-time is hidden from all human knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 6]: But she had one comfort .
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 6]: It was very soon over .
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 60]: When the colonel had finished his dinner , which event took place while Martin , who had sent his plate for some turkey , was waiting to begin , he asked him what he thought of the boarders , who were from all parts of the Union , and whether he would like to know any particulars concerning them .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 22]: ` Pray , ' said Martin , ` who is that sickly little girl opposite , with the tight round eyes ?
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 23]: I do n't see anybody here , who looks like her mother , or who seems to have charge of her . '
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 12]: ` Do you mean the matron in blue , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 7]: asked the colonel , with emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 10]: ` That is Mrs Jefferson Brick , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 24]: ` No , no , ' said Martin , ' I mean the little girl , like a doll ; directly opposite . '
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 6]: ` Well , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 4]: cried the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 8]: ` THAT is Mrs Jefferson Brick . '
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 14]: Martin glanced at the colonel 's face , but he was quite serious .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 5]: ` Bless my soul !
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 16]: I suppose there will be a young Brick then , one of these days ? '
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 15]: ` There are two young Bricks already , sir , ' returned the colonel .
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 19]: The matron looked so uncommonly like a child herself , that Martin could not help saying as much .
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 25]: ` Yes , sir , ' returned the colonel , ` but some institutions develop human natur ; others re -- tard it . '
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 33]: ` Jefferson Brick , ' he observed after a short silence , in commendation of his correspondent , ` is one of the most remarkable men in our country , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 21]: This had passed almost in a whisper , for the distinguished gentleman alluded to sat on Martin 's other hand .
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 69]: ` Pray , Mr Brick , ' said Martin , turning to him , and asking a question more for conversation 's sake than from any feeling of interest in its subject , ` who is that ; ' he was going to say ` young ' but thought it prudent to eschew the word -- ` that very short gentleman yonder , with the red nose ? '
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 14]: ` That is Pro -- fessor Mullit , sir , ' replied Jefferson .
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 11]: ` May I ask what he is professor of ? '
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 3]: asked Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 12]: ` Of education , sir , ' said Jefferson Brick . '
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 8]: A sort of schoolmaster , possibly ? '
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 5]: Martin ventured to observe .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 23]: ` He is a man of fine moral elements , sir , and not commonly endowed , ' said the war correspondent .
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 27]: ` He felt it necessary , at the last election for President , to repudiate and denounce his father , who voted on the wrong interest .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 20]: He has since written some powerful pamphlets , under the signature of `` Suturb , '' or Brutus reversed .
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 15]: He is one of the most remarkable men in our country , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 19]: ` There seem to be plenty of 'em , ' thought Martin , ` at any rate . '
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 66]: Pursuing his inquiries Martin found that there were no fewer than four majors present , two colonels , one general , and a captain , so that he could not help thinking how strongly officered the American militia must be ; and wondering very much whether the officers commanded each other ; or if they did not , where on earth the privates came from .
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 29]: There seemed to be no man there without a title ; for those who had not attained to military honours were either doctors , professors , or reverends .
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 26]: Three very hard and disagreeable gentlemen were on missions from neighbouring States ; one on monetary affairs , one on political , one on sectarian .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 77]: Among the ladies , there were Mrs Pawkins , who was very straight , bony , and silent ; and a wiry-faced old damsel , who held strong sentiments touching the rights of women , and had diffused the same in lectures ; but the rest were strangely devoid of individual traits of character , insomuch that any one of them might have changed minds with the other , and nobody would have found it out .
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 28]: These , by the way , were the only members of the party who did not appear to be among the most remarkable people in the country .
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 39]: Several of the gentlemen got up , one by one , and walked off as they swallowed their last morsel ; pausing generally by the stove for a minute or so to refresh themselves at the brass spittoons .
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 31]: A few sedentary characters , however , remained at table full a quarter of an hour , and did not rise until the ladies rose , when all stood up .
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 7]: ` Where are they going ? '
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 11]: asked Martin , in the ear of Mr Jefferson Brick .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 8]: ` To their bedrooms , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 13]: ` Is there no dessert , or other interval of conversation ? '
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 14]: asked Martin , who was disposed to enjoy himself after his long voyage .
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 22]: ` We are a busy people here , sir , and have no time for that , ' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 40]: So the ladies passed out in single file ; Mr Jefferson Brick and such other married gentlemen as were left , acknowledging the departure of their other halves by a nod ; and there was an end of THEM .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 73]: Martin thought this an uncomfortable custom , but he kept his opinion to himself for the present , being anxious to hear , and inform himself by , the conversation of the busy gentlemen , who now lounged about the stove as if a great weight had been taken off their minds by the withdrawal of the other sex ; and who made a plentiful use of the spittoons and their toothpicks .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 26]: It was rather barren of interest , to say the truth ; and the greater part of it may be summed up in one word .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 2]: Dollars .
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 23]: All their cares , hopes , joys , affections , virtues , and associations , seemed to be melted down into dollars .
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 24]: Whatever the chance contributions that fell into the slow cauldron of their talk , they made the gruel thick and slab with dollars .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 29]: Men were weighed by their dollars , measures gauged by their dollars ; life was auctioneered , appraised , put up , and knocked down for its dollars .
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 16]: The next respectable thing to dollars was any venture having their attainment for its end .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 36]: The more of that worthless ballast , honour and fair-dealing , which any man cast overboard from the ship of his Good Name and Good Intent , the more ample stowage-room he had for dollars .
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 9]: Make commerce one huge lie and mighty theft .
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 32]: Deface the banner of the nation for an idle rag ; pollute it star by star ; and cut out stripe by stripe as from the arm of a degraded soldier .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 5]: Do anything for dollars !
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 7]: What is a flag to THEM !
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 26]: One who rides at all hazards of limb and life in the chase of a fox , will prefer to ride recklessly at most times .
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 7]: So it was with these gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 23]: He was the greatest patriot , in their eyes , who brawled the loudest , and who cared the least for decency .
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 28]: He was their champion who , in the brutal fury of his own pursuit , could cast no stigma upon them for the hot knavery of theirs .
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 63]: Thus , Martin learned in the five minutes ' straggling talk about the stove , that to carry pistols into legislative assemblies , and swords in sticks , and other such peaceful toys ; to seize opponents by the throat , as dogs or rats might do ; to bluster , bully , and overbear by personal assailment ; were glowing deeds .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 48]: Not thrusts and stabs at Freedom , striking far deeper into her House of Life than any sultan 's scimitar could reach ; but rare incense on her altars , having a grateful scent in patriotic nostrils , and curling upward to the seventh heaven of Fame .
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 38]: Once or twice , when there was a pause , Martin asked such questions as naturally occurred to him , being a stranger , about the national poets , the theatre , literature , and the arts .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 64]: But the information which these gentlemen were in a condition to give him on such topics , did not extend beyond the effusions of such master-spirits of the time as Colonel Diver , Mr Jefferson Brick , and others ; renowned , as it appeared , for excellence in the achievement of a peculiar style of broadside essay called ' a screamer . '
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 32]: ` We are a busy people , sir , ' said one of the captains , who was from the West , ` and have no time for reading mere notions .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 27]: We do n't mind 'em if they come to us in newspapers along with almighty strong stuff of another sort , but darn your books . '
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 41]: Here the general , who appeared to grow quite faint at the bare thought of reading anything which was neither mercantile nor political , and was not in a newspaper , inquired ` if any gentleman would drink some ? '
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 29]: Most of the company , considering this a very choice and seasonable idea , lounged out , one by one , to the bar-room in the next block .
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 49]: Thence they probably went to their stores and counting-houses ; thence to the bar-room again , to talk once more of dollars , and enlarge their minds with the perusal and discussion of screamers ; and thence each man to snore in the bosom of his own family .
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 29]: ` Which would seem , ' said Martin , pursuing the current of his own thoughts , ` to be the principal recreation they enjoy in common . '
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 45]: With that , he fell a-musing again on dollars , demagogues , and bar-rooms ; debating within himself whether busy people of this class were really as busy as they claimed to be , or only had an inaptitude for social and domestic pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 33]: It was a difficult question to solve ; and the mere fact of its being strongly presented to his mind by all that he had seen and heard , was not encouraging .
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 32]: He sat down at the deserted board , and becoming more and more despondent , as he thought of all the uncertainties and difficulties of his precarious situation , sighed heavily .
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 63]: Now , there had been at the dinner-table a middle-aged man with a dark eye and a sunburnt face , who had attracted Martin 's attention by having something very engaging and honest in the expression of his features ; but of whom he could learn nothing from either of his neighbours , who seemed to consider him quite beneath their notice .
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 67]: He had taken no part in the conversation round the stove , nor had he gone forth with the rest ; and now , when he heard Martin sigh for the third or fourth time , he interposed with some casual remark , as if he desired , without obtruding himself upon a stranger 's notice , to engage him in cheerful conversation if he could .
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 32]: His motive was so obvious , and yet so delicately expressed , that Martin felt really grateful to him , and showed him so in the manner of his reply . '
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 40]: I will not ask you , ' said this gentleman with a smile , as he rose and moved towards him , ` how you like my country , for I can quite anticipate your feeling on that point .
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 28]: But , as I am an American , and consequently bound to begin with a question , I 'll ask you how you like the colonel ? '
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 27]: ` You are so very frank , ' returned Martin , ` that I have no hesitation in saying I do n't like him at all .
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 52]: Though I must add that I am beholden to him for his civility in bringing me here -- and arranging for my stay , on pretty reasonable terms , by the way , ' he added , remembering that the colonel had whispered him to that effect , before going out .
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 11]: ` Not much beholden , ' said the stranger drily .
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 56]: ` The colonel occasionally boards packet-ships , I have heard , to glean the latest information for his journal ; and he occasionally brings strangers to board here , I believe , with a view to the little percentage which attaches to those good offices ; and which the hostess deducts from his weekly bill .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 10]: I do n't offend you , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 8]: he added , seeing that Martin reddened .
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 20]: ` My dear sir , ' returned Martin , as they shook hands , ` how is that possible !
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 15]: to tell you the truth , I -- am -- ' ` Yes ? '
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 10]: said the gentleman , sitting down beside him . '
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 35]: I am rather at a loss , since I must speak plainly , ' said Martin , getting the better of his hesitation , ` to know how this colonel escapes being beaten . '
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 14]: He has been beaten once or twice , ' remarked the gentleman quietly .
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 36]: ` He is one of a class of men , in whom our own Franklin , so long ago as ten years before the close of the last century , foresaw our danger and disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 68]: Perhaps you do n't know that Franklin , in very severe terms , published his opinion that those who were slandered by such fellows as this colonel , having no sufficient remedy in the administration of this country 's laws or in the decent and right-minded feeling of its people , were justified in retorting on such public nuisances by means of a stout cudgel ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 38]: I was not aware of that , ' said Martin , ` but I am very glad to know it , and I think it worthy of his memory ; especially ' -- here he hesitated again .
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 21]: ` Go on , ' said the other , smiling as if he knew what stuck in Martin 's throat .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 45]: ` Especially , ' pursued Martin , ` as I can already understand that it may have required great courage , even in his time , to write freely on any question which was not a party one in this very free country . '
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 13]: ` Some courage , no doubt , ' returned his new friend .
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 15]: ` Do you think it would require any to do so , now ? '
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 16]: ` Indeed I think it would ; and not a little , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 5]: ` You are right .
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 14]: So very right , that I believe no satirist could breathe this air .
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 18]: If another Juvenal or Swift could rise up among us to-morrow , he would be hunted down .
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 73]: If you have any knowledge of our literature , and can give me the name of any man , American born and bred , who has anatomized our follies as a people , and not as this or that party ; and who has escaped the foulest and most brutal slander , the most inveterate hatred and intolerant pursuit ; it will be a strange name in my ears , believe me .
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 60]: In some cases I could name to you , where a native writer has ventured on the most harmless and good-humoured illustrations of our vices or defects , it has been found necessary to announce , that in a second edition the passage has been expunged , or altered , or explained away , or patched into praise . '
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 10]: ` And how has this been brought about ? '
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 6]: asked Martin , in dismay .
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 26]: ` Think of what you have seen and heard to-day , beginning with the colonel , ' said his friend , ` and ask yourself .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 9]: How THEY came about , is another question .
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 31]: Heaven forbid that they should be samples of the intelligence and virtue of America , but they come uppermost , and in great numbers , and too often represent it .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 5]: Will you walk ? '
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 47]: There was a cordial candour in his manner , and an engaging confidence that it would not be abused ; a manly bearing on his own part , and a simple reliance on the manly faith of a stranger ; which Martin had never seen before .
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 18]: He linked his arm readily in that of the American gentleman , and they walked out together .
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 110]: It was perhaps to men like this , his new companion , that a traveller of honoured name , who trod those shores now nearly forty years ago , and woke upon that soil , as many have done since , to blots and stains upon its high pretensions , which in the brightness of his distant dreams were lost to view , appealed in these words -- ` Oh , but for such , Columbia 's days were done ; Rank without ripeness , quickened without sun , Crude at the surface , rotten at the core , Her fruits would fall before her spring were o'er ! '
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 116]: CHAPTER SEVENTEEN MARTIN ENLARGES HIS CIRCLE OF AQUAINTANCE ; INCREASES HIS STOCK OF WISDOM ; AND HAS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY OF COMPARING HIS OWN EXPERIENCES WITH THOSE OF LUMMY NED OF THE LIGHT SALISBURY , AS RELATED BY HIS FRIEND MR WILLIAM SIMMONS It was characteristic of Martin , that all this while he had either forgotten Mark Tapley as completely as if there had been no such person in existence , or , if for a moment the figure of that gentleman rose before his mental vision , had dismissed it as something by no means of a pressing nature , which might be attended to by-and-bye , and could wait his perfect leisure .
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 77]: But , being now in the streets again , it occurred to him as just coming within the bare limits of possibility that Mr Tapley might , in course of time , grow tired of waiting on the threshold of the Rowdy Journal Office , so he intimated to his new friend , that if they could conveniently walk in that direction , he would be glad to get this piece of business off his mind .
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 48]: ` And speaking of business , ' said Martin , ` may I ask , in order that I may not be behind-hand with questions either , whether your occupation holds you to this city , or like myself , you are a visitor here ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 9]: A visitor , ' replied his friend . '
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 16]: I was `` raised '' in the State of Massachusetts , and reside there still .
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 9]: My home is in a quiet country town .
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 28]: I am not often in these busy places ; and my inclination to visit them does not increase with our better acquaintance , I assure you . '
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 7]: ` You have been abroad ? '
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 8]: asked Martin , ` Oh yes . '
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 30]: ` And , like most people who travel , have become more than ever attached to your home and native country , ' said Martin , eyeing him curiously .
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 12]: ` To my home -- yes , ' rejoined his friend .
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 14]: ` To my native country AS my home -- yes , also . '
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 10]: ` You imply some reservation , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 110]: ` Well , ' returned his new friend , ` if you ask me whether I came back here with a greater relish for my country 's faults ; with a greater fondness for those who claim -LRB- at the rate of so many dollars a day -RRB- to be her friends ; with a cooler indifference to the growth of principles among us in respect of public matters and of private dealings between man and man , the advocacy of which , beyond the foul atmosphere of a criminal trial , would disgrace your own old Bailey lawyers ; why , then I answer plainly , No . '
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 22]: said Martin ; in so exactly the same key as his friend 's No , that it sounded like an echo .
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 145]: ` If you ask me , ' his companion pursued , ` whether I came back here better satisfied with a state of things which broadly divides society into two classes -- whereof one , the great mass , asserts a spurious independence , most miserably dependent for its mean existence on the disregard of humanizing conventionalities of manner and social custom , so that the coarser a man is , the more distinctly it shall appeal to his taste ; while the other , disgusted with the low standard thus set up and made adaptable to everything , takes refuge among the graces and refinements it can bring to bear on private life , and leaves the public weal to such fortune as may betide it in the press and uproar of a general scramble -- then again I answer , No . '
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 8]: And again Martin said ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 37]: in the same odd way as before , being anxious and disconcerted ; not so much , to say the truth , on public grounds , as with reference to the fading prospects of domestic architecture .
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 80]: ` In a word , ' resumed the other , ' I do not find and can not believe and therefore will not allow , that we are a model of wisdom , and an example to the world , and the perfection of human reason , and a great deal more to the same purpose , which you may hear any hour in the day ; simply because we began our political life with two inestimable advantages . '
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 6]: ` What were they ? '
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 3]: asked Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 44]: ` One , that our history commenced at so late a period as to escape the ages of bloodshed and cruelty through which other nations have passed ; and so had all the light of their probation , and none of its darkness .
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 22]: The other , that we have a vast territory , and not -- as yet -- too many people on it .
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 14]: These facts considered , we have done little enough , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 4]: ` Education ? '
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 5]: suggested Martin , faintly .
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 50]: ` Pretty well on that head , ' said the other , shrugging his shoulders , ` still no mighty matter to boast of ; for old countries , and despotic countries too , have done as much , if not more , and made less noise about it .
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 19]: We shine out brightly in comparison with England , certainly ; but hers is a very extreme case .
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 16]: You complimented me on my frankness , you know , ' he added , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 22]: I am not at all astonished at your speaking thus openly when my country is in question , ' returned Martin .
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 15]: ` It is your plain-speaking in reference to your own that surprises me . '
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 56]: ` You will not find it a scarce quality here , I assure you , saving among the Colonel Divers , and Jefferson Bricks , and Major Pawkinses ; though the best of us are something like the man in Goldsmith 's comedy , who would n't suffer anybody but himself to abuse his master .
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 3]: Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 3]: he added .
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 8]: ` Let us talk of something else .
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 27]: You have come here on some design of improving your fortune , I dare say ; and I should grieve to put you out of heart .
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 25]: I am some years older than you , besides ; and may , on a few trivial points , advise you , perhaps . '
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 24]: There was not the least curiosity or impertinence in the manner of this offer , which was open-hearted , unaffected , and good-natured .
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 45]: As it was next to impossible that he should not have his confidence awakened by a deportment so prepossessing and kind , Martin plainly stated what had brought him into those parts , and even made the very difficult avowal that he was poor .
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 64]: He did not say how poor , it must be admitted , rather throwing off the declaration with an air which might have implied that he had money enough for six months , instead of as many weeks ; but poor he said he was , and grateful he said he would be , for any counsel that his friend would give him .
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 47]: It would not have been very difficult for any one to see ; but it was particularly easy for Martin , whose perceptions were sharpened by his circumstances , to discern ; that the stranger 's face grew infinitely longer as the domestic-architecture project was developed .
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 44]: Nor , although he made a great effort to be as encouraging as possible , could he prevent his head from shaking once involuntarily , as if it said in the vulgar tongue , upon its own account , ` No go ! '
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 98]: But he spoke in a cheerful tone , and said , that although there was no such opening as Martin wished , in that city , he would make it matter of immediate consideration and inquiry where one was most likely to exist ; and then he made Martin acquainted with his name , which was Bevan ; and with his profession , which was physic , though he seldom or never practiced ; and with other circumstances connected with himself and family , which fully occupied the time , until they reached the Rowdy Journal Office .
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 47]: Mr Tapley appeared to be taking his ease on the landing of the first floor ; for sounds as of some gentleman established in that region whistling ` Rule Britannia ' with all his might and main , greeted their ears before they reached the house .
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 80]: On ascending to the spot from whence this music proceeded , they found him recumbent in the midst of a fortification of luggage , apparently performing his national anthem for the gratification of a grey-haired black man , who sat on one of the outworks -LRB- a portmanteau -RRB- , staring intently at Mark , while Mark , with his head reclining on his hand , returned the compliment in a thoughtful manner , and whistled all the time .
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 27]: He seemed to have recently dined , for his knife , a casebottle , and certain broken meats in a handkerchief , lay near at hand .
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 58]: He had employed a portion of his leisure in the decoration of the Rowdy Journal door , whereon his own initials now appeared in letters nearly half a foot long , together with the day of the month in smaller type ; the whole surrounded by an ornamental border , and looking very fresh and bold . '
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 13]: I was a ` most afraid you was lost , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 44]: cried Mark , rising , and stopping the tune at that point where Britons generally are supposed to declare -LRB- when it is whistled -RRB- that they never , never , never -- ` Nothing gone wrong , I hope , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 5]: ` No , Mark .
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 6]: Where 's your friend ? '
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 8]: ` The mad woman , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 4]: said Mr Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 8]: she 's all right , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 8]: ` Did she find her husband ? '
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 5]: ` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 14]: Leastways she 's found his remains , ' said Mark , correcting himself .
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 11]: ` The man 's not dead , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 28]: ` Not altogether dead , sir , ' returned Mark ; ` but he 's had more fevers and agues than is quite reconcilable with being alive .
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 22]: When she did n't see him a-waiting for her , I thought she 'd have died herself , I did ! '
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 9]: ` Was he not here , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 6]: ` HE was n't here .
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 45]: There was a feeble old shadow come a-creeping down at last , as much like his substance when she know 'd him , as your shadow when it 's drawn out to its very finest and longest by the sun , is like you .
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 13]: But it was his remains , there 's no doubt about that .
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 21]: She took on with joy , poor thing , as much as if it had been all of him ! '
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 7]: ` Had he bought land ? '
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 4]: asked Mr Bevan .
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 20]: He 'd bought land , ' said Mark , shaking his head , ` and paid for it too .
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 23]: Every sort of nateral advantage was connected with it , the agents said ; and there certainly was ONE , quite unlimited .
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 7]: No end to the water ! '
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 21]: ` It 's a thing he could n't have done without , I suppose , ' observed Martin , peevishly .
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 6]: ` Certainly not , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 15]: There it was , any way ; always turned on , and no water-rate .
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 27]: Independent of three or four slimy old rivers close by , it varied on the farm from four to six foot deep in the dry season .
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 26]: He could n't say how deep it was in the rainy time , for he never had anything long enough to sound it with . '
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 6]: ` Is this true ? '
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 6]: asked Martin of his companion .
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 8]: ` Extremely probable , ' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 12]: ` Some Mississippi or Missouri lot , I dare say . '
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 56]: ` However , ' pursued Mark , ` he came from I-don ` t-know-where-and-all , down to New York here , to meet his wife and children ; and they started off again in a steamboat this blessed afternoon , as happy to be along with each other as if they were going to Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 21]: I should think they was , pretty straight , if I may judge from the poor man 's looks . '
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 30]: ` And may I ask , ' said Martin , glancing , but not with any displeasure , from Mark to the negro , ` who this gentleman is ?
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 6]: Another friend of yours ? '
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 30]: ` Why sir , ' returned Mark , taking him aside , and speaking confidentially in his ear , ` he 's a man of colour , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 40]: ` Do you take me for a blind man , ' asked Martin , somewhat impatiently , ` that you think it necessary to tell me that , when his face is the blackest that ever was seen ? '
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 36]: ` No , no ; when I say a man of colour , ' returned Mark , ' I mean that he 's been one of them as there 's picters of in the shops .
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 36]: A man and a brother , you know , sir , ' said Mr Tapley , favouring his master with a significant indication of the figure so often represented in tracts and cheap prints . '
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 4]: A slave ! '
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 7]: cried Martin , in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 7]: said Mark in the same tone .
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 4]: ` Nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 3]: A slave .
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 66]: Why , when that there man was young -- do n't look at him while I 'm a-telling it -- he was shot in the leg ; gashed in the arm ; scored in his live limbs , like crimped fish ; beaten out of shape ; had his neck galled with an iron collar , and wore iron rings upon his wrists and ankles .
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 9]: The marks are on him to this day .
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 22]: When I was having my dinner just now , he stripped off his coat , and took away my appetite . '
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 6]: ` Is THIS true ? '
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 12]: asked Martin of his friend , who stood beside them . '
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 22]: I have no reason to doubt it , ' he answered , shaking his head ` It very often is . '
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 20]: ` Bless you , ' said Mark , ' I know it is , from hearing his whole story .
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 80]: That master died ; so did his second master from having his head cut open with a hatchet by another slave , who , when he 'd done it , went and drowned himself ; then he got a better one ; in years and years he saved up a little money , and bought his freedom , which he got pretty cheap at last , on account of his strength being nearly gone , and he being ill .
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 5]: Then he come here .
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 26]: And now he 's a-saving up to treat himself , afore he dies , to one small purchase -- it 's nothing to speak of .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 10]: Only his own daughter ; that 's all ! '
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 7]: cried Mr Tapley , becoming excited .
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 5]: ` Liberty for ever !
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 2]: Hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 5]: Hail , Columbia ! '
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 18]: cried Martin , clapping his hand upon his mouth ; ` and do n't be an idiot .
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 7]: What is he doing here ? '
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 15]: ` Waiting to take our luggage off upon a truck , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 71]: ` He 'd have come for it by-and-bye , but I engaged him for a very reasonable charge -LRB- out of my own pocket -RRB- to sit along with me and make me jolly ; and I am jolly ; and if I was rich enough to contract with him to wait upon me once a day , to be looked at , I 'd never be anything else . '
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 45]: The fact may cause a solemn impeachment of Mark 's veracity , but it must be admitted nevertheless , that there was that in his face and manner at the moment , which militated strongly against this emphatic declaration of his state of mind .
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 40]: ` Lord love you , sir , ' he added , ` they 're so fond of Liberty in this part of the globe , that they buy her and sell her and carry her to market with 'em .
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 18]: They 've such a passion for Liberty , that they ca n't help taking liberties with her .
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 9]: That 's what it 's owing to . '
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 14]: ` Very well , ' said Martin , wishing to change the theme .
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 16]: ` Having come to that conclusion , Mark , perhaps you 'll attend to me .
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 15]: The place to which the luggage is to go is printed on this card .
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 7]: Mrs Pawkins 's Boarding House . '
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 10]: ` Mrs Pawkins 's boarding-house , ' repeated Mark .
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 6]: ` Now , Cicero . '
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 7]: ` Is that his name ? '
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 14]: asked Martin ` That 's his name , sir , ' rejoined Mark .
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 41]: And the negro grinning assent from under a leathern portmanteau , than which his own face was many shades deeper , hobbled downstairs with his portion of their worldly goods ; Mark Tapley having already gone before with his share .
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 40]: Martin and his friend followed them to the door below , and were about to pursue their walk , when the latter stopped , and asked , with some hesitation , whether that young man was to be trusted ?
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 3]: ` Mark !
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 3]: oh certainly !
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 4]: with anything . '
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 16]: ` You do n't understand me -- I think he had better go with us .
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 15]: He is an honest fellow , and speaks his mind so very plainly . '
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 31]: ` Why , the fact is , ' said Martin , smiling , ` that being unaccustomed to a free republic , he is used to do so . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 14]: I think he had better go with us , ' returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 9]: ` He may get into some trouble otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 30]: This is not a slave State ; but I am ashamed to say that a spirit of Tolerance is not so common anywhere in these latitudes as the form .
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 19]: We are not remarkable for behaving very temperately to each other when we differ ; but to strangers !
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 13]: no , I really think he had better go with us . '
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 26]: Martin called to him immediately to be of their party ; so Cicero and the truck went one way , and they three went another .
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 38]: They walked about the city for two or three hours ; seeing it from the best points of view , and pausing in the principal streets , and before such public buildings as Mr Bevan pointed out .
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 63]: Night then coming on apace , Martin proposed that they should adjourn to Mrs Pawkins 's establishment for coffee ; but in this he was overruled by his new acquaintance , who seemed to have set his heart on carrying him , though it were only for an hour , to the house of a friend of his who lived hard by .
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 73]: Feeling -LRB- however disinclined he was , being weary -RRB- that it would be in bad taste , and not very gracious , to object that he was unintroduced , when this open-hearted gentleman was so ready to be his sponsor , Martin -- for once in his life , at all events -- sacrificed his own will and pleasure to the wishes of another , and consented with a fair grace .
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 11]: So travelling had done him that much good , already .
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 32]: Mr Bevan knocked at the door of a very neat house of moderate size , from the parlour windows of which , lights were shining brightly into the now dark street .
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 56]: It was quickly opened by a man with such a thoroughly Irish face , that it seemed as if he ought , as a matter of right and principle , to be in rags , and could have no sort of business to be looking cheerfully at anybody out of a whole suit of clothes .
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 64]: Commending Mark to the care of this phenomenon -- for such he may be said to have been in Martin 's eyes -- Mr Bevan led the way into the room which had shed its cheerfulness upon the street , to whose occupants he introduced Mr Chuzzlewit as a gentleman from England , whose acquaintance he had recently had the pleasure to make .
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 41]: They gave him welcome in all courtesy and politeness ; and in less than five minutes ' time he found himself sitting very much at his ease by the fireside , and becoming vastly well acquainted with the whole family .
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 71]: There were two young ladies -- one eighteen ; the other twenty -- both very slender , but very pretty ; their mother , who looked , as Martin thought much older and more faded than she ought to have looked ; and their grandmother , a little sharp-eyed , quick old woman , who seemed to have got past that stage , and to have come all right again .
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 54]: Besides these , there were the young ladies ' father , and the young ladies ' brother ; the first engaged in mercantile affairs ; the second , a student at college ; both , in a certain cordiality of manner , like his own friend , and not unlike him in face .
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 17]: Which was no great wonder , for it soon appeared that he was their near relation .
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 60]: Martin could not help tracing the family pedigree from the two young ladies , because they were foremost in his thoughts ; not only from being , as aforesaid , very pretty , but by reason of their wearing miraculously small shoes , and the thinnest possible silk stockings ; the which their rocking-chairs developed to a distracting extent .
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 54]: There is no doubt that it was a monstrous comfortable circumstance to be sitting in a snug , well-furnished room , warmed by a cheerful fire , and full of various pleasant decorations , including four small shoes , and the like amount of silk stockings , and -- yes , why not ?
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 8]: -- the feet and legs therein enshrined .
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 33]: And there is no doubt that Martin was monstrous well-disposed to regard his position in that light , after his recent experience of the Screw , and of Mrs Pawkins 's boarding-house .
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 48]: The consequence was that he made himself very agreeable indeed ; and by the time the tea and coffee arrived -LRB- with sweet preserves , and cunning tea-cakes in its train -RRB- , was in a highly genial state , and much esteemed by the whole family .
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 14]: Another delightful circumstance turned up before the first cup of tea was drunk .
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 8]: The whole family had been in England .
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 6]: There was a pleasant thing !
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 49]: But Martin was not quite so glad of this , when he found that they knew all the great dukes , lords , viscounts , marquesses , duchesses , knights , and baronets , quite affectionately , and were beyond everything interested in the least particular concerning them .
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 25]: However , when they asked , after the wearer of this or that coronet , and said , ` Was he quite well ? '
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 9]: Martin answered , ` Yes , oh yes .
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 24]: Never better ; ' and when they said , ` his lordship 's mother , the duchess , was she much changed ? '
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 28]: Martin said , ` Oh dear no , they would know her anywhere , if they saw her to-morrow ; ' and so got on pretty well .
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 65]: In like manner when the young ladies questioned him touching the Gold Fish in that Grecian fountain in such and such a nobleman 's conservatory , and whether there were as many as there used to be , he gravely reported , after mature consideration , that there must be at least twice as many ; and as to the exotics , ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 2]: well !
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 161]: it was of no use talking about THEM ; they must be seen to be believed ; ' which improved state of circumstances reminded the family of the splendour of that brilliant festival -LRB- comprehending the whole British Peerage and Court Calendar -RRB- to which they were specially invited , and which indeed had been partly given in their honour ; and recollections of what Mr Norris the father had said to the marquess , and of what Mrs Norris the mother had said to the marchioness , and of what the marquess and marchioness had both said , when they said that upon their words and honours they wished Mr Norris the father and Mrs Norris the mother , and the Misses Norris the daughters , and Mr Norris Junior , the son , would only take up their permanent residence in England , and give them the pleasure of their everlasting friendship , occupied a very considerable time .
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 102]: Martin thought it rather stange , and in some sort inconsistent , that during the whole of these narrations , and in the very meridian of their enjoyment thereof , both Mr Norris the father , and Mr Norris Junior , the son -LRB- who corresponded , every post , with four members of the English Peerage -RRB- , enlarged upon the inestimable advantage of having no such arbitrary distinctions in that enlightened land , where there were no noblemen but nature 's noblemen , and where all society was based on one broad level of brotherly love and natural equality .
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 82]: Indeed , Mr Norris the father gradually expanding into an oration on this swelling theme , was becoming tedious , when Mr Bevan diverted his thoughts by happening to make some causal inquiry relative to the occupier of the next house ; in reply to which , this same Mr Norris the father observed , that ` that person entertained religious opinions of which he could n't approve ; and therefore he had n't the honour of knowing the gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 42]: Mrs Norris the mother added another reason of her own , the same in effect , but varying in words ; to wit , that she believed the people were well enough in their way , but they were not genteel .
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 13]: Another little trait came out , which impressed itself on Martin forcibly .
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 21]: Mr Bevan told them about Mark and the negro , and then it appeared that all the Norrises were abolitionists .
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 34]: It was a great relief to hear this , and Martin was so much encouraged on finding himself in such company , that he expressed his sympathy with the oppressed and wretched blacks .
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 46]: Now , one of the young ladies -- the prettiest and most delicate -- was mightily amused at the earnestness with which he spoke ; and on his craving leave to ask her why , was quite unable for a time to speak for laughing .
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 55]: As soon however as she could , she told him that the negroes were such a funny people , so excessively ludicrous in their manners and appearance , that it was wholly impossible for those who knew them well , to associate any serious ideas with such a very absurd part of the creation .
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 97]: Mr Norris the father , and Mrs Norris the mother , and Miss Norris the sister , and Mr Norris Junior the brother , and even Mrs Norris Senior the grandmother , were all of this opinion , and laid it down as an absolute matter of fact -- as if there were nothing in suffering and slavery , grim enough to cast a solemn air on any human animal ; though it were as ridiculous , physically , as the most grotesque of apes , or morally , as the mildest Nimrod among tuft-hunting republicans !
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 27]: ` In short , ' said Mr Norris the father , settling the question comfortably , ` there is a natural antipathy between the races . '
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 31]: ` Extending , ' said Martin 's friend , in a low voice , ` to the cruellest of tortures , and the bargain and sale of unborn generations . '
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 52]: Mr Norris the son said nothing , but he made a wry face , and dusted his fingers as Hamlet might after getting rid of Yorick 's skull ; just as though he had that moment touched a negro , and some of the black had come off upon his hands .
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 78]: In order that their talk might fall again into its former pleasant channel , Martin dropped the subject , with a shrewd suspicion that it would be a dangerous theme to revive under the best of circumstances ; and again addressed himself to the young ladies , who were very gorgeously attired in very beautiful colours , and had every article of dress on the same extensive scale as the little shoes and the thin silk stockings .
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 127]: This suggested to him that they were great proficients in the French fashions , which soon turned out to be the case , for though their information appeared to be none of the newest , it was very extensive ; and the eldest sister in particular , who was distinguished by a talent for metaphysics , the laws of hydraulic pressure , and the rights of human kind , had a novel way of combining these acquirements and bringing them to bear on any subject from Millinery to the Millennium , both inclusive , which was at once improving and remarkable ; so much so , in short , that it was usually observed to reduce foreigners to a state of temporary insanity in five minutes .
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 29]: Martin felt his reason going ; and as a means of saving himself , besought the other sister -LRB- seeing a piano in the room -RRB- to sing .
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 22]: With this request she willingly complied ; and a bravura concert , solely sustained by the Misses Noriss , presently began .
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 10]: They sang in all languages -- except their own .
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 22]: German , French , Italian , Spanish , Portuguese , Swiss ; but nothing native ; nothing so low as native .
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 26]: For , in this respect , languages are like many other travellers -- ordinary and commonplace enough at home , but ` specially genteel abroad .
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 49]: There is little doubt that in course of time the Misses Norris would have come to Hebrew , if they had not been interrupted by an announcement from the Irishman , who , flinging open the door , cried in a loud voice -- ` Jiniral Fladdock ! '
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 4]: ` My ! '
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 7]: cried the sisters , desisting suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 7]: ` The general come back ! '
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 66]: As they made the exclamation , the general , attired in full uniform for a ball , came darting in with such precipitancy that , hitching his boot in the carpet , and getting his sword between his legs , he came down headlong , and presented a curious little bald place on the crown of his head to the eyes of the astonished company .
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 50]: Nor was this the worst of it ; for being rather corpulent and very tight , the general being down , could not get up again , but lay there writing and doing such things with his boots , as there is no other instance of in military history .
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 18]: Of course there was an immediate rush to his assistance ; and the general was promptly raised .
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 98]: But his uniform was so fearfully and wonderfully made , that he came up stiff and without a bend in him like a dead Clown , and had no command whatever of himself until he was put quite flat upon the soles of his feet , when he became animated as by a miracle , and moving edgewise that he might go in a narrower compass and be in less danger of fraying the gold lace on his epaulettes by brushing them against anything , advanced with a smiling visage to salute the lady of the house .
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 27]: To be sure , it would have been impossible for the family to testify purer delight and joy than at this unlooked-for appearance of General Fladdock !
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 30]: The general was as warmly received as if New York had been in a state of siege and no other general was to be got for love or money .
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 48]: He shook hands with the Norrises three times all round , and then reviewed them from a little distance as a brave commander might , with his ample cloak drawn forward over the right shoulder and thrown back upon the left side to reveal his manly breast .
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 23]: ` And do I then , ' cried the general , ` once again behold the choicest spirits of my country ! '
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 10]: ` Yes , ' said Mr Norris the father .
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 8]: ` Here we are , general . '
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 75]: Then all the Norrises pressed round the general , inquiring how and where he had been since the date of his letter , and how he had enjoyed himself in foreign parts , and particularly and above all , to what extent he had become acquainted with the great dukes , lords , viscounts , marquesses , duchesses , knights , and baronets , in whom the people of those benighted countries had delight .
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 21]: ` Well , then , do n't ask me , ' said the general , holding up his hand . '
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 38]: I was among 'em all the time , and have got public journals in my trunk with my name printed ' -- he lowered his voice and was very impressive here -- ` among the fashionable news .
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 12]: But , oh , the conventionalities of that a-mazing Europe ! '
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 32]: cried Mr Norris the father , giving his head a melancholy shake , and looking towards Martin as though he would say , ' I ca n't deny it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 7]: I would if I could . '
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 13]: ` The limited diffusion of a moral sense in that country ! '
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 4]: exclaimed the general .
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 11]: ` The absence of a moral dignity in man ! '
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 11]: sighed all the Norrises , quite overwhelmed with despondency . '
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 20]: I could n't have realised it , ' pursued the general , ` without being located on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 28]: Norris , your imagination is the imagination of a strong man , but YOU could n't have realised it , without being located on the spot ! '
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 8]: ` Never , ' said Mr Norris .
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 27]: ` The ex-clusiveness , the pride , the form , the ceremony , ' exclaimed the general , emphasizing the article more vigorously at every repetition .
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 40]: ` The artificial barriers set up between man and man ; the division of the human race into court cards and plain cards , of every denomination -- into clubs , diamonds , spades -- anything but heart ! '
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 5]: cried the whole family .
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 7]: ` Too true , general ! '
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 5]: ` But stay ! '
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 12]: cried Mr Norris the father , taking him by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 11]: ` Surely you crossed in the Screw , general ? '
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 9]: so I did , ' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 4]: ` Possible ! '
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 5]: cried the young ladies .
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 5]: ` Only think ! '
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 53]: The general seemed at a loss to understand why his having come home in the Screw should occasion such a sensation , nor did he seem at all clearer on the subject when Mr Norris , introducing him to Martin , said : ' A fellow-passenger of yours , I think ? '
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 5]: ` Of mine ? '
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 8]: exclaimed the general ; ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 51]: He had never seen Martin , but Martin had seen him , and recognized him , now that they stood face to face , as the gentleman who had stuck his hands in his pockets towards the end of the voyage , and walked the deck with his nostrils dilated .
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 5]: Everybody looked at Martin .
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 7]: There was no help for it .
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 6]: The truth must out . '
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 23]: I came over in the same ship as the general , ' said Martin , ` but not in the same cabin .
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 19]: It being necessary for me to observe strict economy , I took my passage in the steerage . '
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 40]: If the general had been carried up bodily to a loaded cannon , and required to let it off that moment , he could not have been in a state of greater consternation than when he heard these words .
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 46]: He , Fladdock -- Fladdock in full militia uniform , Fladdock the General , Fladdock , the caressed of foreign noblemen -- expected to know a fellow who had come over in the steerage of line-of-packet ship , at the cost of four pound ten !
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 24]: And meeting that fellow in the very sanctuary of New York fashion , and nestling in the bosom of the New York aristocracy !
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 9]: He almost laid his hand upon his sword .
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 8]: A death-like stillness fell upon the Norisses .
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 21]: If this story should get wind , their country relation had , by his imprudence , for ever disgraced them .
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 13]: They were the bright particular stars of an exalted New York sphere .
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 39]: There were other fashionable spheres above them , and other fashionable spheres below , and none of the stars in any one of these spheres had anything to say to the stars in any other of these spheres .
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 38]: But , through all the spheres it would go forth that the Norrises , deceived by gentlemanly manners and appearances , had , falling from their high estate , ` received ' a dollarless and unknown man .
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 14]: O guardian eagle of the pure Republic , had they lived for this !
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 21]: ` You will allow me , ' said Martin , after a terrible silence , ` to take my leave .
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 22]: I feel that I am the cause of at least as much embarrassment here , as I have brought upon myself .
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 35]: But I am bound , before I go , to exonerate this gentleman , who , in introducing me to such society , was quite ignorant of my unworthiness , I assure you . '
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 28]: With that he made his bow to the Norrises , and walked out like a man of snow ; very cool externally , but pretty hot within .
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 60]: ` Come , come , ' said Mr Norris the father , looking with a pale face on the assembled circle as Martin closed the door , ` the young man has this night beheld a refinement of social manner , and an easy magnificence of social decoration , to which he is a stranger in his own country .
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 13]: Let us hope it may awake a moral sense within him . '
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 63]: If that peculiarly transatlantic article , a moral sense -- for , if native statesmen , orators , and pamphleteers , are to be believed , America quite monopolises the commodity -- if that peculiarly transatlantic article be supposed to include a benevolent love of all mankind , certainly Martin 's would have borne , just then , a deal of waking .
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 44]: As he strode along the street , with Mark at his heels , his immoral sense was in active operation ; prompting him to the utterance of some rather sanguinary remarks , which it was well for his own credit that nobody overheard .
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 43]: He had so far cooled down , however , that he had begun to laugh at the recollection of these incidents , when he heard another step behind him , and turning round encountered his friend Bevan , quite out of breath .
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 21]: He drew his arm through Martin 's , and entreating him to walk slowly , was silent for some minutes .
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 16]: At length he said : ' I hope you exonerate me in another sense ? '
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 7]: ` How do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 4]: asked Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 15]: I hope you acquit me of intending or foreseeing the termination of our visit .
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 9]: But I scarcely need ask you that . '
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 9]: ` Scarcely indeed , ' said Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 28]: I am the more beholden to you for your kindness , when I find what kind of stuff the good citizens here are made of . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 39]: I reckon , ' his friend returned , ` that they are made of pretty much the same stuff as other folks , if they would but own it , and not set up on false pretences . '
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 14]: ` In good faith , that 's true , ' said Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 38]: I dare say , ' resumed his friend , ` you might have such a scene as that in an English comedy , and not detect any gross improbability or anomaly in the matter of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 6]: ` Yes , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 26]: ` Doubtless it is more ridiculous here than anywhere else , ' said his companion ; ` but our professions are to blame for that .
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 47]: So far as I myself am concerned , I may add that I was perfectly aware from the first that you came over in the steerage , for I had seen the list of passengers , and knew it did not comprise your name . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 13]: I feel more obliged to you than before , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 16]: ` Norris is a very good fellow in his way , ' observed Mr Bevan .
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 5]: ` Is he ? '
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 4]: said Martin drily .
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 4]: ` Oh yes !
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 9]: there are a hundred good points about him .
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 31]: If you or anybody else addressed him as another order of being , and sued to him IN FORMA PAUPERIS , he would be all kindness and consideration . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 22]: I need n't have travelled three thousand miles from home to find such a character as THAT , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 24]: Neither he nor his friend said anything more on the way back ; each appearing to find sufficient occupation in his own thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 44]: The tea , or the supper , or whatever else they called the evening meal , was over when they reached the Major 's ; but the cloth , ornamented with a few additional smears and stains , was still upon the table .
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 40]: At one end of the board Mrs Jefferson Brick and two other ladies were drinking tea ; out of the ordinary course , evidently , for they were bonneted and shawled , and seemed to have just come home .
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 32]: By the light of three flaring candles of different lengths , in as many candlesticks of different patterns , the room showed to almost as little advantage as in broad day .
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 38]: These ladies were all three talking together in a very loud tone when Martin and his friend entered ; but seeing those gentlemen , they stopped directly , and became excessively genteel , not to say frosty .
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 30]: As they went on to exchange some few remarks in whispers , the very water in the teapot might have fallen twenty degrees in temperature beneath their chilling coldness .
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 11]: ` Have you been to meeting , Mrs Brick ? '
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 15]: asked Martin 's friend , with something of a roguish twinkle in his eye .
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 8]: ` To lecture , sir . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 5]: I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 3]: I forgot .
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 11]: You do n't go to meeting , I think ? '
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 23]: Here the lady on the right of Mrs Brick gave a pious cough as much as to say ' I do ! '
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 15]: -- as , indeed , she did nearly every night in the week . '
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 7]: A good discourse , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 8]: asked Mr Bevan , addressing this lady .
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 16]: The lady raised her eyes in a pious manner , and answered ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 30]: She had been much comforted by some good , strong , peppery doctrine , which satisfactorily disposed of all her friends and acquaintances , and quite settled their business .
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 22]: Her bonnet , too , had far outshone every bonnet in the congregation ; so she was tranquil on all accounts .
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 13]: ` What course of lectures are you attending now , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 11]: said Martin 's friend , turning again to Mrs Brick .
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 11]: ` The Philosophy of the Soul , on Wednesdays . '
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 5]: ` On Mondays ? '
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 7]: ` The Philosophy of Crime . '
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 5]: ` On Fridays ? '
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 7]: ` The Philosophy of Vegetables . '
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 20]: ` You have forgotten Thursdays ; the Philosophy of Government , my dear , ' observed the third lady .
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 8]: ` No , ' said Mrs Brick .
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 6]: ` That 's Tuesdays . '
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 6]: ` So it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 4]: cried the lady .
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 12]: ` The Philosophy of Matter on Thursdays , of course . '
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 17]: ` You see , Mr Chuzzlewit , our ladies are fully employed , ' said Bevan .
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 13]: ` Indeed you have reason to say so , ' answered Martin .
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 23]: ` Between these very grave pursuits abroad , and family duties at home , their time must be pretty well engrossed . '
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 41]: Martin stopped here , for he saw that the ladies regarded him with no very great favour , though what he had done to deserve the disdainful expression which appeared in their faces he was at a loss to divine .
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 70]: But on their going upstairs to their bedrooms -- which they very soon did -- Mr Bevan informed him that domestic drudgery was far beneath the exalted range of these Philosophers , and that the chances were a hundred to one that not one of the three could perform the easiest woman 's work for herself , or make the simplest article of dress for any of her children .
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 44]: ` Though whether they might not be better employed with such blunt instruments as knitting-needles than with these edge-tools , ' he said , ` is another question ; but I can answer for one thing -- they do n't often cut themselves .
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 9]: Devotions and lectures are our balls and concerts .
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 27]: They go to these places of resort , as an escape from monotony ; look at each other 's clothes ; and come home again . '
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 17]: ` When you say `` home , '' do you mean a house like this ? '
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 4]: ` Very often .
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 16]: But I see you are tired to death , and will wish you good night .
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 9]: We will discuss your projects in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 20]: You can not but feel already that it is useless staying here , with any hope of advancing them .
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 8]: You will have to go further . '
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 7]: ` And to fare worse ? '
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 8]: said Martin , pursuing the old adage .
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 7]: ` Well , I hope not .
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 19]: But sufficient for the day , you know -- good night ' They shook hands heartily and separated .
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 50]: As soon as Martin was left alone , the excitement of novelty and change which had sustained him through all the fatigues of the day , departed ; and he felt so thoroughly dejected and worn out , that he even lacked the energy to crawl upstairs to bed .
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 19]: In twelve or fifteen hours , how great a change had fallen on his hopes and sanguine plans !
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 47]: New and strange as he was to the ground on which he stood , and to the air he breathed , he could not -- recalling all that he had crowded into that one day -- but entertain a strong misgiving that his enterprise was doomed .
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 30]: Rash and ill-considered as it had often looked on shipboard , but had never seemed on shore , it wore a dismal aspect , now , that frightened him .
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 25]: Whatever thoughts he called up to his aid , they came upon him in depressing and discouraging shapes , and gave him no relief .
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 25]: Even the diamonds on his finger sparkled with the brightness of tears , and had no ray of hope in all their brilliant lustre .
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 82]: He continued to sit in gloomy rumination by the stove , unmindful of the boarders who dropped in one by one from their stores and counting-houses , or the neighbouring bar-rooms , and , after taking long pulls from a great white waterjug upon the sideboard , and lingering with a kind of hideous fascination near the brass spittoons , lounged heavily to bed ; until at length Mark Tapley came and shook him by the arm , supposing him asleep .
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 4]: ` Mark ! '
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 5]: he cried , starting .
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 21]: ` All right , sir , ' said that cheerful follower , snuffing with his fingers the candle he bore .
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 44]: ` It ai n't a very large bed , your ` n , sir ; and a man as was n't thirsty might drink , afore breakfast , all the water you 've got to wash in , and afterwards eat the towel .
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 12]: But you 'll sleep without rocking to-night , sir . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 26]: I feel as if the house were on the sea ' said Martin , staggering when he rose ; ` and am utterly wretched . '
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 17]: ` I 'm as jolly as a sandboy , myself , sir , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 11]: ` But , Lord , I have reason to be !
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 13]: I ought to have been born here ; that 's my opinion .
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 15]: Take care how you go ' -- for they were now ascending the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 18]: ` You recollect the gentleman aboard the Screw as had the very small trunk , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 4]: ` The valise ?
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 3]: Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 28]: ` Well , sir , there 's been a delivery of clean clothes from the wash to-night , and they 're put outside the bedroom doors here .
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 33]: If you take notice as we go up , what a very few shirts there are , and what a many fronts , you 'll penetrate the mystery of his packing . '
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 21]: But Martin was too weary and despondent to take heed of anything , so had no interest in this discovery .
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 103]: Mr Tapley , nothing dashed by his indifference , conducted him to the top of the house , and into the bed-chamber prepared for his reception ; which was a very little narrow room , with half a window in it ; a bedstead like a chest without a lid ; two chairs ; a piece of carpet , such as shoes are commonly tried upon at a ready-made establishment in England ; a little looking-glass nailed against the wall ; and a washing-table , with a jug and ewer , that might have been mistaken for a milk-pot and slop-basin . '
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 17]: I suppose they polish themselves with a dry cloth in this country , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 16]: ` They 've certainly got a touch of the ` phoby , sir . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 34]: I wish you would pull off my boots for me , ' said Martin , dropping into one of the chairs ' I am quite knocked up -- dead beat , Mark . '
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 33]: ` You wo n't say that to-morrow morning , sir , ' returned Mr Tapley ; ` nor even to-night , sir , when you 've made a trial of this . '
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 55]: With which he produced a very large tumbler , piled up to the brim with little blocks of clear transparent ice , through which one or two thin slices of lemon , and a golden liquid of delicious appearance , appealed from the still depths below , to the loving eye of the spectator .
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 8]: ` What do you call this ? '
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 47]: But Mr Tapley made no answer ; merely plunging a reed into the mixture -- which caused a pleasant commotion among the pieces of ice -- and signifying by an expressive gesture that it was to be pumped up through that agency by the enraptured drinker .
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 25]: Martin took the glass with an astonished look ; applied his lips to the reed ; and cast up his eyes once in ecstasy .
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 14]: He paused no more until the goblet was drained to the last drop .
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 6]: ` There , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 52]: said Mark , taking it from him with a triumphant face ; ` if ever you should happen to be dead beat again , when I ai n't in the way , all you 've got to do is to ask the nearest man to go and fetch a cobbler . '
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 9]: ` To go and fetch a cobbler ? '
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 3]: repeated Martin .
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 23]: ` This wonderful invention , sir , ' said Mark , tenderly patting the empty glass , ` is called a cobbler .
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 16]: Sherry cobbler when you name it long ; cobbler , when you name it short .
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 24]: Now you 're equal to having your boots took off , and are , in every particular worth mentioning , another man . '
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 13]: Having delivered himself of this solemn preface , he brought the bootjack .
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 3]: ` Mind !
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 37]: I am not going to relapse , Mark , ' said Martin ; ` but , good Heaven , if we should be left in some wild part of this country without goods or money ! '
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 6]: ` Well , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 39]: replied the imperturbable Tapley ; ` from what we 've seen already , I do n't know whether , under those circumstances , we should n't do better in the wild parts than in the tame ones . '
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 10]: ` Oh , Tom Pinch , Tom Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 39]: said Martin , in a thoughtful tone ; ` what would I give to be again beside you , and able to hear your voice , though it were even in the old bedroom at Pecksniff 's ! '
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 8]: ` Oh , Dragon , Dragon ! '
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 36]: echoed Mark , cheerfully , ` if there war n't any water between you and me , and nothing faint-hearted-like in going back , I do n't know that I might n't say the same .
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 73]: But here am I , Dragon , in New York , America ; and there are you in Wiltshire , Europe ; and there 's a fortune to make , Dragon , and a beautiful young lady to make it for ; and whenever you go to see the Monument , Dragon , you must n't give in on the doorsteps , or you 'll never get up to the top ! '
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 10]: ` Wisely said , Mark , ' cried Martin .
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 7]: ` We must look forward . '
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 46]: ` In all the story-books as ever I read , sir , the people as looked backward was turned into stones , ' replied Mark ; ` and my opinion always was , that they brought it on themselves , and it served 'em right .
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 13]: I wish you good night , sir , and pleasant dreams ! '
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 20]: ` They must be of home , then , ' said Martin , as he lay down in bed .
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 63]: ` So I say , too , ' whispered Mark Tapley , when he was out of hearing and in his own room ; ` for if there do n't come a time afore we 're well out of this , when there 'll be a little more credit in keeping up one 's jollity , I 'm a United Statesman ! '
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 64]: Leaving them to blend and mingle in their sleep the shadows of objects afar off , as they take fantastic shapes upon the wall in the dim light of thought without control , be it the part of this slight chronicle -- a dream within a dream -- as rapidly to change the scene , and cross the ocean to the English shore .
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 25]: CHAPTER EIGHTEEN DOES BUSINESS WITH THE HOUSE OF ANTHONY CHUZZLEWIT AND SON , FROM WHICH ONE OF THE PARTNERS RETIRES UNEXPECTEDLY Change begets change .
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 5]: Nothing propagates so fast .
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 58]: If a man habituated to a narrow circle of cares and pleasures , out of which he seldom travels , step beyond it , though for never so brief a space , his departure from the monotonous scene on which he has been an actor of importance , would seem to be the signal for instant confusion .
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 47]: As if , in the gap he had left , the wedge of change were driven to the head , rending what was a solid mass to fragments , things cemented and held together by the usages of years , burst asunder in as many weeks .
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 28]: The mine which Time has slowly dug beneath familiar objects is sprung in an instant ; and what was rock before , becomes but sand and dust .
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 16]: Most men , at one time or other , have proved this in some degree .
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 32]: The extent to which the natural laws of change asserted their supremacy in that limited sphere of action which Martin had deserted , shall be faithfully set down in these pages .
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 9]: ` What a cold spring it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 25]: whimpered old Anthony , drawing near the evening fire , ` It was a warmer season , sure , when I was young ! '
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 44]: ` You need n't go scorching your clothes into holes , whether it was or not , ' observed the amiable Jonas , raising his eyes from yesterday 's newspaper , ` Broadcloth ai n't so cheap as that comes to . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 5]: A good lad ! '
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 19]: cried the father , breathing on his cold hands , and feebly chafing them against each other . '
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 4]: A prudent lad !
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 11]: He never delivered himself up to the vanities of dress .
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 6]: No , no ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 32]: I do n't know but I would , though , mind you , if I could do it for nothing , ' said his son , as he resumed the paper .
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 5]: chuckled the old man .
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 5]: ` IF , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 8]: -- But it 's very cold . '
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 7]: ` Let the fire be ! '
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 17]: cried Mr Jonas , stopping his honoured parent 's hand in the use of the poker .
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 21]: ` Do you mean to come to want in your old age , that you take to wasting now ? '
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 16]: ` There 's not time for that , Jonas , ' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 7]: ` Not time for what ? '
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 4]: bawled his heir .
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 8]: ` For me to come to want .
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 6]: I wish there was ! '
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 35]: ` You always were as selfish an old blade as need be , ' said Jonas in a voice too low for him to hear , and looking at him with an angry frown .
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 8]: ` You act up to your character .
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 12]: You would n't mind coming to want , would n't you !
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 7]: I dare say you would n't .
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 20]: And your own flesh and blood might come to want too , might they , for anything you cared ?
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 7]: Oh you precious old flint ! '
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 31]: After this dutiful address he took his tea-cup in his hand -- for that meal was in progress , and the father and son and Chuffey were partakers of it .
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 37]: Then , looking steadfastly at his father , and stopping now and then to carry a spoonful of tea to his lips , he proceeded in the same tone , thus : ` Want , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 17]: You 're a nice old man to be talking of want at this time of day .
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 9]: Beginning to talk of want , are you ?
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 5]: Well , I declare !
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 5]: There is n't time ?
Parsing [sent. 6367 len. 7]: No , I should hope not .
Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 20]: But you 'd live to be a couple of hundred if you could ; and after all be discontented .
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 5]: I know you ! '
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 13]: The old man sighed , and still sat cowering before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 26]: Mr Jonas shook his Britannia-metal teaspoon at him , and taking a loftier position , went on to argue the point on high moral grounds .
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 34]: ` If you 're in such a state of mind as that , ' he grumbled , but in the same subdued key , ` why do n't you make over your property ?
Parsing [sent. 6373 len. 20]: Buy an annuity cheap , and make your life interesting to yourself and everybody else that watches the speculation .
Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 9]: But no , that would n't suit YOU .
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 26]: That would be natural conduct to your own son , and you like to be unnatural , and to keep him out of his rights .
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 28]: Why , I should be ashamed of myself if I was you , and glad to hide my head in the what you may call it . '
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 39]: Possibly this general phrase supplied the place of grave , or tomb , or sepulchre , or cemetery , or mausoleum , or other such word which the filial tenderness of Mr Jonas made him delicate of pronouncing .
Parsing [sent. 6378 len. 57]: He pursued the theme no further ; for Chuffey , somehow discovering , from his old corner by the fireside , that Anthony was in the attitude of a listener , and that Jonas appeared to be speaking , suddenly cried out , like one inspired : ` He is your own son , Mr Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 7]: Your own son , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 58]: Old Chuffey little suspected what depth of application these words had , or that , in the bitter satire which they bore , they might have sunk into the old man 's very soul , could he have known what words here hanging on his own son 's lips , or what was passing in his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 15]: But the voice diverted the current of Anthony 's reflections , and roused him .
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 16]: ` Yes , yes , Chuffey , Jonas is a chip of the old block .
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 24]: It is a very old block , now , Chuffey , ' said the old man , with a strange look of discomposure .
Parsing [sent. 6384 len. 18]: ` Precious old , ' assented Jonas ` No , no , no , ' said Chuffey .
Parsing [sent. 6385 len. 6]: ` No , Mr Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 6386 len. 8]: Not old at all , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 10]: He 's worse than ever , you know ! '
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 6]: cried Jonas , quite disgusted .
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 13]: ` Upon my soul , father , he 's getting too bad .
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 8]: Hold your tongue , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6392 len. 8]: ` He says you 're wrong ! '
Parsing [sent. 6393 len. 7]: cried Anthony to the old clerk .
Parsing [sent. 6394 len. 6]: ` Tut , tut ! '
Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 6]: was Chuffey 's answer . '
Parsing [sent. 6396 len. 4]: I know better .
Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 6]: I say HE 'S wrong .
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 6]: I say HE 'S wrong .
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 5]: He 's a boy .
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 6]: That 's what he is .
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 12]: So are you , Mr Chuzzlewit -- a kind of boy .
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 27]: You 're quite a boy to many I have known ; you 're a boy to me ; you 're a boy to hundreds of us .
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 6]: Do n't mind him ! '
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 55]: With which extraordinary speech -- for in the case of Chuffey this was a burst of eloquence without a parallel -- the poor old shadow drew through his palsied arm his master 's hand , and held it there , with his own folded upon it , as if he would defend him . '
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 38]: I grow deafer every day , Chuff , ' said Anthony , with as much softness of manner , or , to describe it more correctly , with as little hardness as he was capable of expressing .
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 9]: ` No , no , ' cried Chuffey .
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 7]: ` No , you do n't .
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 5]: What if you did ?
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 10]: I 've been deaf this twenty year . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 16]: I grow blinder , too , ' said the old man , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 8]: ` That 's a good sign ! '
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 3]: cried Chuffey .
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 3]: ` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 7]: The best sign in the world !
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 7]: You saw too well before . '
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 45]: He patted Anthony upon the hand as one might comfort a child , and drawing the old man 's arm still further through his own , shook his trembling fingers towards the spot where Jonas sat , as though he would wave him off .
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 57]: But , Anthony remaining quite still and silent , he relaxed his hold by slow degrees and lapsed into his usual niche in the corner ; merely putting forth his hand at intervals and touching his old employer gently on the coat , as with the design of assuring himself that he was yet beside him .
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 74]: Mr Jonas was so very much amazed by these proceedings that he could do nothing but stare at the two old men , until Chuffey had fallen into his usual state , and Anthony had sunk into a doze ; when he gave some vent to his emotions by going close up to the former personage , and making as though he would , in vulgar parlance , ` punch his head . '
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 26]: ` They 've been carrying on this game , ' thought Jonas in a brown study , ` for the last two or three weeks .
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 18]: I never saw my father take so much notice of him as he has in that time .
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 11]: You 're legacy hunting , are you , Mister Chuff ?
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 3]: Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 28]: But Chuffey was as little conscious of the thought as of the bodily advance of Mr Jonas 's clenched fist , which hovered fondly about his ear .
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 36]: When he had scowled at him to his heart 's content , Jonas took the candle from the table , and walking into the glass office , produced a bunch of keys from his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 36]: With one of these he opened a secret drawer in the desk ; peeping stealthily out , as he did so , to be certain that the two old men were still before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 27]: ` All as right as ever , ' said Jonas , propping the lid of the desk open with his forehead , and unfolding a paper .
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 9]: ` Here 's the will , Mister Chuff .
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 22]: Thirty pound a year for your maintenance , old boy , and all the rest to his only son , Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 10]: You need n't trouble yourself to be too affectionate .
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 8]: You wo n't get anything by it .
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 5]: What 's that ? '
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 6]: It WAS startling , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 26]: A face on the other side of the glass partition looking curiously in ; and not at him but at the paper in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 6439 len. 20]: For the eyes were attentively cast down upon the writing , and were swiftly raised when he cried out .
Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 15]: Then they met his own , and were as the eyes of Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 33]: Suffering the lid of the desk to fall with a loud noise , but not forgetting even then to lock it , Jonas , pale and breathless , gazed upon this phantom .
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 11]: It moved , opened the door , and walked in .
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 7]: ` What 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 6]: cried Jonas , falling back .
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 5]: ` Who is it ?
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 6]: Where do you come from ?
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 6]: What do you want ? '
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 4]: ` Matter ! '
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 17]: cried the voice of Mr Pecksniff , as Pecksniff in the flesh smiled amiably upon him .
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 8]: ` The matter , Mr Jonas ! '
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 12]: ` What are you prying and peering about here for ? '
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 5]: said Jonas , angrily .
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 19]: ` What do you mean by coming up to town in this way , and taking one unawares ?
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 32]: It 's precious odd a man ca n't read the -- the newspaper -- in his own office without being startled out of his wits by people coming in without notice .
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 10]: Why did n't you knock at the door ? '
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 19]: ` So I did , Mr Jonas , ' answered Pecksniff , ` but no one heard me .
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 47]: I was curious , ' he added in his gentle way as he laid his hand upon the young man 's shoulder , ` to find out what part of the newspaper interested you so much ; but the glass was too dim and dirty . '
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 8]: Jonas glanced in haste at the partition .
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 2]: Well .
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 6]: It was n't very clean .
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 7]: So far he spoke the truth .
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 7]: ` Was it poetry now ? '
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 18]: said Mr Pecksniff , shaking the forefinger of his right hand with an air of cheerful banter .
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 6]: ` Or was it politics ?
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 8]: Or was it the price of stock ?
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 15]: The main chance , Mr Jonas , the main chance , I suspect . '
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 34]: ` You ai n't far from the truth , ' answered Jonas , recovering himself and snuffing the candle ; ` but how the deuce do you come to be in London again ?
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 2]: Ecod !
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 32]: it 's enough to make a man stare , to see a fellow looking at him all of a sudden , who he thought was sixty or seventy mile away . '
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 10]: ` So it is , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 11]: ` No doubt of it , my dear Mr Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 35]: For while the human mind is constituted as it is -- ' ` Oh , bother the human mind , ' interrupted Jonas with impatience ` what have you come up for ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 19]: A little matter of business , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` which has arisen quite unexpectedly . '
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 8]: cried Jonas , ` is that all ?
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 2]: Well .
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 8]: Here 's father in the next room .
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 7]: Hallo father , here 's Pecksniff !
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 23]: He gets more addle-pated every day he lives , I do believe , ' muttered Jonas , shaking his honoured parent roundly .
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 13]: ` Do n't I tell you Pecksniff 's here , stupid-head ? '
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 54]: The combined effects of the shaking and this loving remonstrance soon awoke the old man , who gave Mr Pecksniff a chuckling welcome which was attributable in part to his being glad to see that gentleman , and in part to his unfading delight in the recollection of having called him a hypocrite .
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 73]: As Mr Pecksniff had not yet taken tea -LRB- indeed he had , but an hour before , arrived in London -RRB- the remains of the late collation , with a rasher of bacon , were served up for his entertainment ; and as Mr Jonas had a business appointment in the next street , he stepped out to keep it ; promising to return before Mr Pecksniff could finish his repast .
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 32]: ` And now , my good sir , ' said Mr Pecksniff to Anthony ; ` now that we are alone , pray tell me what I can do for you .
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 27]: I say alone , because I believe that our dear friend Mr Chuffey is , metaphysically speaking , a -- shall I say a dummy ? '
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 17]: asked Mr Pecksniff with his sweetest smile , and his head very much on one side .
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 16]: ` He neither hears us , ' replied Anthony , ` nor sees us . '
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 56]: ` Why , then , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ' I will be bold to say , with the utmost sympathy for his afflictions , and the greatest admiration of those excellent qualities which do equal honour to his head and to his heart , that he is what is playfully termed a dummy .
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 13]: You were going to observe , my dear sir -- ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 20]: I was not going to make any observation that I know of , ' replied the old man . '
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 10]: I was , ' said Mr Pecksniff , mildly .
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 3]: YOU were ?
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 5]: What was it ? '
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 67]: ` That I never , ' said Mr Pecksniff , previously rising to see that the door was shut , and arranging his chair when he came back , so that it could not be opened in the least without his immediately becoming aware of the circumstance ; ` that I never in my life was so astonished as by the receipt of your letter yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 76]: That you should do me the honour to wish to take counsel with me on any matter , amazed me ; but that you should desire to do so , to the exclusion even of Mr Jonas , showed an amount of confidence in one to whom you had done a verbal injury -- merely a verbal injury , you were anxious to repair -- which gratified , which moved , which overcame me . '
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 28]: He was always a glib speaker , but he delivered this short address very glibly ; having been at some pains to compose it outside the coach .
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 36]: Although he paused for a reply , and truly said that he was there at Anthony 's request , the old man sat gazing at him in profound silence and with a perfectly blank face .
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 55]: Nor did he seem to have the least desire or impulse to pursue the conversation , though Mr Pecksniff looked towards the door , and pulled out his watch , and gave him many other hints that their time was short , and Jonas , if he kept his word , would soon return .
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 82]: But the strangest incident in all this strange behaviour was , that of a sudden , in a moment , so swiftly that it was impossible to trace how , or to observe any process of change , his features fell into their old expression , and he cried , striking his hand passionately upon the table as if no interval at all had taken place : ` Will you hold your tongue , sir , and let me speak ? '
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 29]: Mr Pecksniff deferred to him with a submissive bow ; and said within himself , ' I knew his hand was changed , and that his writing staggered .
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 5]: I said so yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 2]: Ahem !
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 4]: Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 21]: ` Jonas is sweet upon your daughter , Pecksniff , ' said the old man , in his usual tone .
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 23]: ` We spoke of that , if you remember , sir , at Mrs Todgers 's , ' replied the courteous architect .
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 12]: ` You need n't speak so loud , ' retorted Anthony .
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 10]: ` I 'm not so deaf as that . '
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 73]: Mr Pecksniff had certainly raised his voice pretty high ; not so much because he thought Anthony was deaf , as because he felt convinced that his perceptive faculties were waxing dim ; but this quick resentment of his considerate behaviour greatly disconcerted him , and , not knowing what tack to shape his course upon , he made another inclination of the head , yet more submissive that the last . '
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 21]: I have said , ' repeated the old man , ` that Jonas is sweet upon your daughter . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 20]: A charming girl , sir , ' murmured Mr Pecksniff , seeing that he waited for an answer . '
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 17]: A dear girl , Mr Chuzzlewit , though I say it , who should not . '
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 30]: ` You know better , ' cried the old man , advancing his weazen face at least a yard , and starting forward in his chair to do it .
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 4]: ` You lie !
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 12]: What , you WILL be a hypocrite , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 10]: ` My good sir , ' Mr Pecksniff began .
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 23]: ` Do n't call me a good sir , ' retorted Anthony , ` and do n't claim to be one yourself .
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 18]: If your daughter was what you would have me believe , she would n't do for Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 10]: Being what she is , I think she will .
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 8]: He might be deceived in a wife .
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 13]: She might run riot , contract debts , and waste his substance .
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 30]: Now when I am dead -- ' His face altered so horribly as he said the word , that Mr Pecksniff really was fain to look another way . '
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 52]: -- It will be worse for me to know of such doings , than if I was alive ; for to be tormented for getting that together , which even while I suffer for its acquisition , is flung into the very kennels of the streets , would be insupportable torture .
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 37]: No , ' said the old man , hoarsely , ` let that be saved at least ; let there be something gained , and kept fast hold of , when so much is lost . '
Parsing [sent. 6524 len. 29]: ` My dear Mr Chuzzlewit , ' said Pecksniff , ` these are unwholesome fancies ; quite unnecessary , sir , quite uncalled for , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 15]: The truth is , my dear sir , that you are not well ! '
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 6]: ` Not dying though ! '
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 13]: cried Anthony , with something like the snarl of a wild animal .
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 4]: ` Not yet !
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 8]: There are years of life in me .
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 13]: Why , look at him , ' pointing to his feeble clerk .
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 17]: ` Death has no right to leave him standing , and to mow me down ! '
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 50]: Mr Pecksniff was so much afraid of the old man , and so completely taken aback by the state in which he found him , that he had not even presence of mind enough to call up a scrap of morality from the great storehouse within his own breast .
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 70]: Therefore he stammered out that no doubt it was , in fairness and decency , Mr Chuffey 's turn to expire ; and that from all he had heard of Mr Chuffey , and the little he had the pleasure of knowing of that gentleman , personally , he felt convinced in his own mind that he would see the propriety of expiring with as little delay as possible .
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 5]: ` Come here ! '
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 11]: said the old man , beckoning him to draw nearer .
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 19]: ` Jonas will be my heir , Jonas will be rich , and a great catch for you .
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 4]: You know that .
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 9]: Jonas is sweet upon your daughter . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 20]: I know that too , ' thought Mr Pecksniff , ` for you have said it often enough . '
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 30]: ` He might get more money than with her , ' said the old man , ` but she will help him to take care of what they have .
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 17]: She is not too young or heedless , and comes of a good hard griping stock .
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 10]: But do n't you play too fine a game .
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 25]: She only holds him by a thread ; and if you draw it too tight -LRB- I know his temper -RRB- it 'll snap .
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 14]: Bind him when he 's in the mood , Pecksniff ; bind him .
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 5]: You 're too deep .
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 15]: In your way of leading him on , you 'll leave him miles behind .
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 24]: Bah , you man of oil , have I no eyes to see how you have angled with him from the first ? '
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 29]: ` Now I wonder , ' thought Mr Pecksniff , looking at him with a wistful face , ` whether this is all he has to say ? '
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 57]: Old Anthony rubbed his hands and muttered to himself ; complained again that he was cold ; drew his chair before the fire ; and , sitting with his back to Mr Pecksniff , and his chin sunk down upon his breast , was , in another minute , quite regardless or forgetful of his presence .
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 36]: Uncouth and unsatisfactory as this short interview had been , it had furnished Mr Pecksniff with a hint which , supposing nothing further were imparted to him , repaid the journey up and home again .
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 52]: For the good gentleman had never -LRB- for want of an opportunity -RRB- dived into the depths of Mr Jonas 's nature ; and any recipe for catching such a son-in-law -LRB- much more one written on a leaf out of his own father 's book -RRB- was worth the having .
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 86]: In order that he might lose no chance of improving so fair an opportunity by allowing Anthony to fall asleep before he had finished all he had to say , Mr Pecksniff , in the disposal of the refreshments on the table , a work to which he now applied himself in earnest , resorted to many ingenious contrivances for attracting his attention ; such as coughing , sneezing , clattering the teacups , sharpening the knives , dropping the loaf , and so forth .
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 17]: But all in vain , for Mr Jonas returned , and Anthony had said no more .
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 6]: My father asleep again ? '
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 17]: he cried , as he hung up his hat , and cast a look at him .
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 3]: and snoring .
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 4]: Only hear ! '
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 11]: ` He snores very deep , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 5]: ` Snores deep ? '
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 3]: repeated Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 9]: ` Yes ; let him alone for that .
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 11]: He 'll snore for six , at any time . '
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 30]: ` Do you know , Mr Jonas , ' said Pecksniff , ` that I think your father is -- do n't let me alarm you -- breaking ? '
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 8]: ` Oh , is he though ? '
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 18]: replied Jonas , with a shake of the head which expressed the closeness of his dutiful observation .
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 12]: ` Ecod , you do n't know how tough he is .
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 9]: He ai n't upon the move yet . '
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 21]: ` It struck me that he was changed , both in his appearance and manner , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 20]: ` That 's all you know about it , ' returned Jonas , seating himself with a melancholy air .
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 10]: ` He never was better than he is now .
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 7]: How are they all at home ?
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 5]: How 's Charity ? '
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 9]: ` Blooming , Mr Jonas , blooming . '
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 11]: ` And the other one ; how 's she ? '
Parsing [sent. 6577 len. 5]: ` Volatile trifler ! '
Parsing [sent. 6578 len. 7]: said Mr Pecksniff , fondly musing .
Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 9]: ` She is well , she is well .
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 36]: Roving from parlour to bedroom , Mr Jonas , like a bee , skimming from post to pillar , like the butterfly ; dipping her young beak into our currant wine , like the humming-bird !
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 25]: were she a little less giddy than she is ; and had she but the sterling qualities of Cherry , my young friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 10]: ` Is she so very giddy , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 3]: asked Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 6585 len. 6]: ` Well , well ! '
Parsing [sent. 6586 len. 18]: said Mr Pecksniff , with great feeling ; ` let me not be hard upon my child .
Parsing [sent. 6587 len. 8]: Beside her sister Cherry she appears so .
Parsing [sent. 6588 len. 9]: A strange noise that , Mr Jonas ! '
Parsing [sent. 6589 len. 18]: ` Something wrong in the clock , I suppose , ' said Jonas , glancing towards it .
Parsing [sent. 6590 len. 15]: ` So the other one ai n't your favourite , ai n't she ? '
Parsing [sent. 6591 len. 32]: The fond father was about to reply , and had already summoned into his face a look of most intense sensibility , when the sound he had already noticed was repeated .
Parsing [sent. 6592 len. 19]: ` Upon my word , Mr Jonas , that is a very extraordinary clock , ' said Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 6593 len. 32]: It would have been , if it had made the noise which startled them ; but another kind of time-piece was fast running down , and from that the sound proceeded .
Parsing [sent. 6594 len. 51]: A scream from Chuffey , rendered a hundred times more loud and formidable by his silent habits , made the house ring from roof to cellar ; and , looking round , they saw Anthony Chuzzlewit extended on the floor , with the old clerk upon his knees beside him .
Parsing [sent. 6595 len. 53]: He had fallen from his chair in a fit , and lay there , battling for each gasp of breath , with every shrivelled vein and sinew starting in its place , as if it were bent on bearing witness to his age , and sternly pleading with Nature against his recovery .
Parsing [sent. 6596 len. 35]: It was frightful to see how the principle of life , shut up within his withered frame , fought like a strong devil , mad to be released , and rent its ancient prison-house .
Parsing [sent. 6597 len. 63]: A young man in the fullness of his vigour , struggling with so much strength of desperation , would have been a dismal sight ; but an old , old , shrunken body , endowed with preternatural might , and giving the lie in every motion of its every limb and joint to its enfeebled aspect , was a hideous spectacle indeed .
Parsing [sent. 6598 len. 51]: They raised him up , and fetched a surgeon with all haste , who bled the patient and applied some remedies ; but the fits held him so long that it was past midnight when they got him -- quiet now , but quite unconscious and exhausted -- into bed .
Parsing [sent. 6599 len. 24]: ` Do n't go , ' said Jonas , putting his ashy lips to Mr Pecksniff 's ear and whispered across the bed .
Parsing [sent. 6600 len. 14]: ` It was a mercy you were present when he was taken ill .
Parsing [sent. 6601 len. 11]: Some one might have said it was my doing . '
Parsing [sent. 6602 len. 5]: ` YOUR doing ! '
Parsing [sent. 6603 len. 5]: cried Mr Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 6604 len. 20]: I do n't know but they might , ' he replied , wiping the moisture from his white face .
Parsing [sent. 6605 len. 6]: ` People say such things .
Parsing [sent. 6606 len. 7]: How does he look now ? '
Parsing [sent. 6607 len. 7]: Mr Pecksniff shook his head . '
Parsing [sent. 6608 len. 11]: I used to joke , you know , ' said .
Parsing [sent. 6609 len. 12]: Jonas : ` but I -- I never wished him dead .
Parsing [sent. 6610 len. 9]: Do you think he 's very bad ? '
Parsing [sent. 6611 len. 7]: ` The doctor said he was .
Parsing [sent. 6612 len. 10]: You heard , ' was Mr Pecksniff 's answer .
Parsing [sent. 6613 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6614 len. 20]: but he might say that to charge us more , in case of his getting well ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 6615 len. 9]: ` You must n't go away , Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 6616 len. 20]: Now it 's come to this , I would n't be without a witness for a thousand pound . '
Parsing [sent. 6617 len. 12]: Chuffey said not a word , and heard not a word .
Parsing [sent. 6618 len. 35]: He had sat himself down in a chair at the bedside , and there he remained , motionless ; except that he sometimes bent his head over the pillow , and seemed to listen .
Parsing [sent. 6619 len. 6]: He never changed in this .
Parsing [sent. 6620 len. 41]: Though once in the dreary night Mr Pecksniff , having dozed , awoke with a confused impression that he had heard him praying , and strangely mingling figures -- not of speech , but arithmetic -- with his broken prayers .
Parsing [sent. 6621 len. 46]: Jonas sat there , too , all night ; not where his father could have seen him , had his consciousness returned , but hiding , as it were , behind him , and only reading how he looked , in Mr Pecksniff 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6622 len. 37]: HE , the coarse upstart , who had ruled the house so long -- that craven cur , who was afraid to move , and shook so , that his very shadow fluttered on the wall !
Parsing [sent. 6623 len. 24]: It was broad , bright , stirring day when , leaving the old clerk to watch him , they went down to breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 6624 len. 84]: People hurried up and down the street ; windows and doors were opened ; thieves and beggars took their usual posts ; workmen bestirred themselves ; tradesmen set forth their shops ; bailiffs and constables were on the watch ; all kinds of human creatures strove , in their several ways , as hard to live , as the one sick old man who combated for every grain of sand in his fast-emptying glass , as eagerly as if it were an empire .
Parsing [sent. 6625 len. 24]: ` If anything happens Pecksniff , ' said Jonas , ` you must promise me to stop here till it 's all over .
Parsing [sent. 6626 len. 12]: You shall see that I do what 's right . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6627 len. 17]: I know that you will do what 's right , Mr Jonas , ' said Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 6628 len. 12]: ` Yes , yes , but I wo n't be doubted .
Parsing [sent. 6629 len. 20]: No one shall have it in his power to say a syllable against me , ' he returned . '
Parsing [sent. 6630 len. 7]: I know how people will talk .
Parsing [sent. 6631 len. 19]: Just as if he was n't old , or I had the secret of keeping him alive ! '
Parsing [sent. 6632 len. 55]: Mr Pecksniff promised that he would remain , if circumstances should render it , in his esteemed friend 's opinion , desirable ; they were finishing their meal in silence , when suddenly an apparition stood before them , so ghastly to the view that Jonas shrieked aloud , and both recoiled in horror .
Parsing [sent. 6633 len. 18]: Old Anthony , dressed in his usual clothes , was in the room -- beside the table .
Parsing [sent. 6634 len. 50]: He leaned upon the shoulder of his solitary friend ; and on his livid face , and on his horny hands , and in his glassy eyes , and traced by an eternal finger in the very drops of sweat upon his brow , was one word -- Death .
Parsing [sent. 6635 len. 26]: He spoke to them -- in something of his own voice too , but sharpened and made hollow , like a dead man 's face .
Parsing [sent. 6636 len. 9]: What he would have said , God knows .
Parsing [sent. 6637 len. 16]: He seemed to utter words , but they were such as man had never heard .
Parsing [sent. 6638 len. 22]: And this was the most fearful circumstance of all , to see him standing there , gabbling in an unearthly tongue .
Parsing [sent. 6639 len. 10]: ` He 's better now , ' said Chuffey .
Parsing [sent. 6640 len. 4]: ` Better now .
Parsing [sent. 6641 len. 15]: Let him sit in his old chair , and he 'll be well again .
Parsing [sent. 6642 len. 7]: I told him not to mind .
Parsing [sent. 6643 len. 7]: I said so , yesterday . '
Parsing [sent. 6644 len. 31]: They put him in his easy-chair , and wheeled it near the window ; then , swinging open the door , exposed him to the free current of morning air .
Parsing [sent. 6645 len. 29]: But not all the air that is , nor all the winds that ever blew ` twixt Heaven and Earth , could have brought new life to him .
Parsing [sent. 6646 len. 20]: Plunge him to the throat in golden pieces now , and his heavy fingers shall not close on one !
Parsing [sent. 6647 len. 44]: CHAPTER NINETEEN THE READER IS BROUGHT INTO COMMUNICATION WITH SOME PROFESSIONAL PERSONS , AND SHEDS A TEAR OVER THE FILAIL PIETY OF GOOD MR JONAS Mr Pecksniff was in a hackney cabriolet , for Jonas Chuzzlewit had said ` Spare no expense . '
Parsing [sent. 6648 len. 30]: Mankind is evil in its thoughts and in its base constructions , and Jonas was resolved it should not have an inch to stretch into an ell against him .
Parsing [sent. 6649 len. 22]: It never should be charged upon his father 's son that he had grudged the money for his father 's funeral .
Parsing [sent. 6650 len. 23]: Hence , until the obsequies should be concluded , Jonas had taken for his motto ` Spend , and spare not ! '
Parsing [sent. 6651 len. 50]: Mr Pecksniff had been to the undertaker , and was now upon his way to another officer in the train of mourning -- a female functionary , a nurse , and watcher , and performer of nameless offices about the persons of the dead -- whom he had recommended .
Parsing [sent. 6652 len. 28]: Her name , as Mr Pecksniff gathered from a scrap of writing in his hand , was Gamp ; her residence in Kingsgate Street , High Holborn .
Parsing [sent. 6653 len. 21]: So Mr Pecksniff , in a hackney cab , was rattling over Holborn stones , in quest of Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 6654 len. 43]: This lady lodged at a bird-fancier 's , next door but one to the celebrated mutton-pie shop , and directly opposite to the original cat 's - meat warehouse ; the renown of which establishments was duly heralded on their respective fronts .
Parsing [sent. 6655 len. 108]: It was a little house , and this was the more convenient ; for Mrs Gamp being , in her highest walk of art , a monthly nurse , or , as her sign-board boldly had it , ` Midwife , ' and lodging in the first-floor front , was easily assailable at night by pebbles , walking-sticks , and fragments of tobacco-pipe ; all much more efficacious than the street-door knocker , which was so constructed as to wake the street with ease , and even spread alarms of fire in Holborn , without making the smallest impression on the premises to which it was addressed .
Parsing [sent. 6656 len. 46]: It chanced on this particular occasion , that Mrs Gamp had been up all the previous night , in attendance upon a ceremony to which the usage of gossips has given that name which expresses , in two syllables , the curse pronounced on Adam .
Parsing [sent. 6657 len. 67]: It chanced that Mrs Gamp had not been regularly engaged , but had been called in at a crisis , in consequence of her great repute , to assist another professional lady with her advice ; and thus it happened that , all points of interest in the case being over , Mrs Gamp had come home again to the bird-fancier 's and gone to bed .
Parsing [sent. 6658 len. 28]: So when Mr Pecksniff drove up in the hackney cab , Mrs Gamp 's curtains were drawn close , and Mrs Gamp was fast asleep behind them .
Parsing [sent. 6659 len. 36]: If the bird-fancier had been at home , as he ought to have been , there would have been no great harm in this ; but he was out , and his shop was closed .
Parsing [sent. 6660 len. 85]: The shutters were down certainly ; and in every pane of glass there was at least one tiny bird in a tiny bird-cage , twittering and hopping his little ballet of despair , and knocking his head against the roof ; while one unhappy goldfinch who lived outside a red villa with his name on the door , drew the water for his own drinking , and mutely appealed to some good man to drop a farthing 's - worth of poison in it .
Parsing [sent. 6661 len. 7]: Still , the door was shut .
Parsing [sent. 6662 len. 25]: Mr Pecksniff tried the latch , and shook it , causing a cracked bell inside to ring most mournfully ; but no one came .
Parsing [sent. 6663 len. 118]: The bird-fancier was an easy shaver also , and a fashionable hair-dresser also , and perhaps he had been sent for , express , from the court end of the town , to trim a lord , or cut and curl a lady ; but however that might be , there , upon his own ground , he was not ; nor was there any more distinct trace of him to assist the imagination of an inquirer , than a professional print or emblem of his calling -LRB- much favoured in the trade -RRB- , representing a hair-dresser of easy manners curling a lady of distinguished fashion , in the presence of a patent upright grand pianoforte .
Parsing [sent. 6664 len. 91]: Noting these circumstances , Mr Pecksniff , in the innocence of his heart , applied himself to the knocker ; but at the first double knock every window in the street became alive with female heads ; and before he could repeat the performance whole troops of married ladies -LRB- some about to trouble Mrs Gamp themselves very shortly -RRB- came flocking round the steps , all crying out with one accord , and with uncommon interest , ` Knock at the winder , sir , knock at the winder .
Parsing [sent. 6665 len. 21]: Lord bless you , do n't lose no more time than you can help -- knock at the winder ! '
Parsing [sent. 6666 len. 54]: Acting upon this suggestion , and borrowing the driver 's whip for the purpose , Mr Pecksniff soon made a commotion among the first floor flower-pots , and roused Mrs Gamp , whose voice -- to the great satisfaction of the matrons -- was heard to say , ` I 'm coming . '
Parsing [sent. 6667 len. 20]: ` He 's as pale as a muffin , ' said one lady , in allusion to Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 6668 len. 20]: ` So he ought to be , if he 's the feelings of a man , ' observed another .
Parsing [sent. 6669 len. 31]: A third lady -LRB- with her arms folded -RRB- said she wished he had chosen any other time for fetching Mrs Gamp , but it always happened so with HER .
Parsing [sent. 6670 len. 39]: It gave Mr Pecksniff much uneasiness to find , from these remarks , that he was supposed to have come to Mrs Gamp upon an errand touching -- not the close of life , but the other end .
Parsing [sent. 6671 len. 35]: Mrs Gamp herself was under the same impression , for , throwing open the window , she cried behind the curtains , as she hastily attired herself -- ` Is it Mrs Perkins ? '
Parsing [sent. 6672 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 6673 len. 6]: returned Mr Pecksniff , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 6674 len. 7]: ` Nothing of the sort . '
Parsing [sent. 6675 len. 7]: ` What , Mr Whilks ! '
Parsing [sent. 6676 len. 4]: cried Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 6677 len. 24]: ` Do n't say it 's you , Mr Whilks , and that poor creetur Mrs Whilks with not even a pincushion ready .
Parsing [sent. 6678 len. 11]: Do n't say it 's you , Mr Whilks ! '
Parsing [sent. 6679 len. 12]: ` It is n't Mr Whilks , ' said Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 6680 len. 7]: I do n't know the man .
Parsing [sent. 6681 len. 5]: Nothing of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 6682 len. 25]: A gentleman is dead ; and some person being wanted in the house , you have been recommended by Mr Mould the undertaker . '
Parsing [sent. 6683 len. 41]: As she was by this time in a condition to appear , Mrs Gamp , who had a face for all occasions , looked out of the window with her mourning countenance , and said she would be down directly .
Parsing [sent. 6684 len. 70]: But the matrons took it very ill that Mr Pecksniff 's mission was of so unimportant a kind ; and the lady with her arms folded rated him in good round terms , signifying that she would be glad to know what he meant by terrifying delicate females ` with his corpses ; ' and giving it as her opinion that he was quite ugly enough to know better .
Parsing [sent. 6685 len. 33]: The other ladies were not at all behind-hand in expressing similar sentiments ; and the children , of whom some scores had now collected , hooted and defied Mr Pecksniff quite savagely .
Parsing [sent. 6686 len. 31]: So when Mrs Gamp appeared , the unoffending gentleman was glad to hustle her with very little ceremony into the cabriolet , and drive off , overwhelmed with popular execration .
Parsing [sent. 6687 len. 49]: Mrs Gamp had a large bundle with her , a pair of pattens , and a species of gig umbrella ; the latter article in colour like a faded leaf , except where a circular patch of a lively blue had been dexterously let in at the top .
Parsing [sent. 6688 len. 66]: She was much flurried by the haste she had made , and laboured under the most erroneous views of cabriolets , which she appeared to confound with mail-coaches or stage-wagons , inasmuch as she was constantly endeavouring for the first half mile to force her luggage through the little front window , and clamouring to the driver to ` put it in the boot . '
Parsing [sent. 6689 len. 35]: When she was disabused of this idea , her whole being resolved itself into an absorbing anxiety about her pattens , with which she played innumerable games at quoits on Mr Pecksniff 's legs .
Parsing [sent. 6690 len. 30]: It was not until they were close upon the house of mourning that she had enough composure to observe -- ` And so the gentleman 's dead , sir !
Parsing [sent. 6691 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6692 len. 7]: The more 's the pity . '
Parsing [sent. 6693 len. 8]: She did n't even know his name .
Parsing [sent. 6694 len. 11]: ` But it 's what we must all come to .
Parsing [sent. 6695 len. 19]: It 's as certain as being born , except that we ca n't make our calculations as exact .
Parsing [sent. 6696 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6697 len. 4]: Poor dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 6698 len. 38]: She was a fat old woman , this Mrs Gamp , with a husky voice and a moist eye , which she had a remarkable power of turning up , and only showing the white of it .
Parsing [sent. 6699 len. 28]: Having very little neck , it cost her some trouble to look over herself , if one may say so , at those to whom she talked .
Parsing [sent. 6700 len. 22]: She wore a very rusty black gown , rather the worse for snuff , and a shawl and bonnet to correspond .
Parsing [sent. 6701 len. 102]: In these dilapidated articles of dress she had , on principle , arrayed herself , time out of mind , on such occasions as the present ; for this at once expressed a decent amount of veneration for the deceased , and invited the next of kin to present her with a fresher suit of weeds ; an appeal so frequently successful , that the very fetch and ghost of Mrs Gamp , bonnet and all , might be seen hanging up , any hour in the day , in at least a dozen of the second-hand clothes shops about Holborn .
Parsing [sent. 6702 len. 34]: The face of Mrs Gamp -- the nose in particular -- was somewhat red and swollen , and it was difficult to enjoy her society without becoming conscious of a smell of spirits .
Parsing [sent. 6703 len. 46]: Like most persons who have attained to great eminence in their profession , she took to hers very kindly ; insomuch that , setting aside her natural predilections as a woman , she went to a lying-in or a laying-out with equal zest and relish .
Parsing [sent. 6704 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 6705 len. 16]: repeated Mrs Gamp ; for it was always a safe sentiment in cases of mourning .
Parsing [sent. 6706 len. 4]: ` Ah dear !
Parsing [sent. 6707 len. 42]: When Gamp was summoned to his long home , and I see him a-lying in Guy 's Hospital with a penny-piece on each eye , and his wooden leg under his left arm , I thought I should have fainted away .
Parsing [sent. 6708 len. 6]: But I bore up . '
Parsing [sent. 6709 len. 42]: If certain whispers current in the Kingsgate Street circles had any truth in them , she had indeed borne up surprisingly ; and had exerted such uncommon fortitude as to dispose of Mr Gamp 's remains for the benefit of science .
Parsing [sent. 6710 len. 38]: But it should be added , in fairness , that this had happened twenty years before ; and that Mr and Mrs Gamp had long been separated on the ground of incompatibility of temper in their drink .
Parsing [sent. 6711 len. 12]: ` You have become indifferent since then , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 6712 len. 4]: said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 6713 len. 10]: ` Use is second nature , Mrs Gamp . '
Parsing [sent. 6714 len. 15]: ` You may well say second nater , sir , ' returned that lady .
Parsing [sent. 6715 len. 24]: ` One 's first ways is to find sich things a trial to the feelings , and so is one 's lasting custom .
Parsing [sent. 6716 len. 40]: If it was n't for the nerve a little sip of liquor gives me -LRB- I never was able to do more than taste it -RRB- , I never could go through with what I sometimes has to do .
Parsing [sent. 6717 len. 87]: `` Mrs Harris , '' I says , at the very last case as ever I acted in , which it was but a young person , `` Mrs Harris , '' I says , `` leave the bottle on the chimley-piece , and do n't ask me to take none , but let me put my lips to it when I am so dispoged , and then I will do what I 'm engaged to do , according to the best of my ability . ''
Parsing [sent. 6718 len. 63]: `` Mrs Gamp , '' she says , in answer , `` if ever there was a sober creetur to be got at eighteen pence a day for working people , and three and six for gentlefolks -- night watching , '' ' said Mrs Gamp with emphasis , ' `` being a extra charge -- you are that inwallable person . ''
Parsing [sent. 6719 len. 46]: `` Mrs Harris , '' I says to her , `` do n't name the charge , for if I could afford to lay all my feller creeturs out for nothink , I would gladly do it , sich is the love I bears 'em .
Parsing [sent. 6720 len. 80]: But what I always says to them as has the management of matters , Mrs Harris '' ' -- here she kept her eye on Mr Pecksniff -- ' `` be they gents or be they ladies , is , do n't ask me whether I wo n't take none , or whether I will , but leave the bottle on the chimley-piece , and let me put my lips to it when I am so dispoged . '' '
Parsing [sent. 6721 len. 12]: The conclusion of this affecting narrative brought them to the house .
Parsing [sent. 6722 len. 91]: In the passage they encountered Mr Mould the undertaker ; a little elderly gentleman , bald , and in a suit of black ; with a notebook in his hand , a massive gold watch-chain dangling from his fob , and a face in which a queer attempt at melancholy was at odds with a smirk of satisfaction ; so that he looked as a man might , who , in the very act of smacking his lips over choice old wine , tried to make believe it was physic .
Parsing [sent. 6723 len. 15]: ` Well , Mrs Gamp , and how are YOU , Mrs Gamp ? '
Parsing [sent. 6724 len. 13]: said this gentleman , in a voice as soft as his step .
Parsing [sent. 6725 len. 15]: ` Pretty well , I thank you , sir , ' dropping a curtsey .
Parsing [sent. 6726 len. 11]: ` You 'll be very particular here , Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 6727 len. 10]: This is not a common case , Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 6728 len. 28]: Let everything be very nice and comfortable , Mrs Gamp , if you please , ' said the undertaker , shaking his head with a solemn air .
Parsing [sent. 6729 len. 14]: ` It shall be , sir , ' she replied , curtseying again .
Parsing [sent. 6730 len. 14]: ` You knows me of old , sir , I hope . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6731 len. 14]: I hope so , too , Mrs Gamp , ' said the undertaker .
Parsing [sent. 6732 len. 8]: ` and I think so also . '
Parsing [sent. 6733 len. 5]: Mrs Gamp curtseyed again .
Parsing [sent. 6734 len. 35]: ` This is one of the most impressive cases , sir , ' he continued , addressing Mr Pecksniff , ` that I have seen in the whole course of my professional experience . '
Parsing [sent. 6735 len. 7]: ` Indeed , Mr Mould ! '
Parsing [sent. 6736 len. 4]: cried that gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 6737 len. 11]: ` Such affectionate regret , sir , I never saw .
Parsing [sent. 6738 len. 28]: There is no limitation , there is positively NO limitation ' -- opening his eyes wide , and standing on tiptoe -- ` in point of expense !
Parsing [sent. 6739 len. 30]: I have orders , sir , to put on my whole establishment of mutes ; and mutes come very dear , Mr Pecksniff ; not to mention their drink .
Parsing [sent. 6740 len. 21]: To provide silver-plated handles of the very best description , ornamented with angels ' heads from the most expensive dies .
Parsing [sent. 6741 len. 7]: To be perfectly profuse in feathers .
Parsing [sent. 6742 len. 13]: In short , sir , to turn out something absolutely gorgeous . '
Parsing [sent. 6743 len. 16]: ` My friend Mr Jonas is an excellent man , ' said Mr Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 6744 len. 27]: I have seen a good deal of what is filial in my time , sir , ' retorted Mould , ` and what is unfilial too .
Parsing [sent. 6745 len. 5]: It is our lot .
Parsing [sent. 6746 len. 9]: We come into the knowledge of those secrets .
Parsing [sent. 6747 len. 35]: But anything so filial as this ; anything so honourable to human nature ; so calculated to reconcile all of us to the world we live in ; never yet came under my observation .
Parsing [sent. 6748 len. 29]: It only proves , sir , what was so forcibly observed by the lamented theatrical poet -- buried at Stratford -- that there is good in everything . '
Parsing [sent. 6749 len. 18]: ` It is very pleasant to hear you say so , Mr Mould , ' observed Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 6750 len. 8]: ` You are very kind , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6751 len. 10]: And what a man Mr Chuzzlewit was , sir !
Parsing [sent. 6752 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6753 len. 6]: what a man he was .
Parsing [sent. 6754 len. 54]: You may talk of your lord mayors , ' said Mould , waving his hand at the public in general , ` your sheriffs , your common councilmen , your trumpery ; but show me a man in this city who is worthy to walk in the shoes of the departed Mr Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 6755 len. 12]: No , no , ' cried Mould , with bitter sarcasm .
Parsing [sent. 6756 len. 46]: ` Hang 'em up , hang 'em up ; sole 'em and heel 'em , and have 'em ready for his son against he 's old enough to wear 'em ; but do n't try 'em on yourselves , for they wo n't fit you .
Parsing [sent. 6757 len. 34]: We knew him , ' said Mould , in the same biting vein , as he pocketed his note-book ; ` we knew him , and are not to be caught with chaff .
Parsing [sent. 6758 len. 9]: Mr Pecksniff , sir , good morning . '
Parsing [sent. 6759 len. 30]: Mr Pecksniff returned the compliment ; and Mould , sensible of having distinguished himself , was going away with a brisk smile , when he fortunately remembered the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 6760 len. 32]: Quickly becoming depressed again , he sighed ; looked into the crown of his hat , as if for comfort ; put it on without finding any ; and slowly departed .
Parsing [sent. 6761 len. 75]: Mrs Gamp and Mr Pecksniff then ascended the staircase ; and the former , having been shown to the chamber in which all that remained of Anthony Chuzzlewit lay covered up , with but one loving heart , and that a halting one , to mourn it , left the latter free to enter the darkened room below , and rejoin Mr Jonas , from whom he had now been absent nearly two hours .
Parsing [sent. 6762 len. 38]: He found that example to bereaved sons , and pattern in the eyes of all performers of funerals , musing over a fragment of writing-paper on the desk , and scratching figures on it with a pen .
Parsing [sent. 6763 len. 62]: The old man 's chair , and hat , and walking-stick , were removed from their accustomed places , and put out of sight ; the window-blinds as yellow as November fogs , were drawn down close ; Jonas himself was so subdued , that he could scarcely be heard to speak , and only seen to walk across the room .
Parsing [sent. 6764 len. 23]: ` Pecksniff , ' he said , in a whisper , ` you shall have the regulation of it all , mind !
Parsing [sent. 6765 len. 19]: You shall be able to tell anybody who talks about it that everything was correctly and nicely done .
Parsing [sent. 6766 len. 18]: There is n't any one you 'd like to ask to the funeral , is there ? '
Parsing [sent. 6767 len. 11]: ` No , Mr Jonas , I think not . '
Parsing [sent. 6768 len. 17]: ` Because if there is , you know , ' said Jonas , ` ask him .
Parsing [sent. 6769 len. 12]: We do n't want to make a secret of it . '
Parsing [sent. 6770 len. 14]: ` No , ' repeated Mr Pecksniff , after a little reflection . '
Parsing [sent. 6771 len. 28]: I am not the less obliged to you on that account , Mr Jonas , for your liberal hospitality ; but there really is no one . '
Parsing [sent. 6772 len. 28]: ` Very well , ' said Jonas ; ` then you , and I , and Chuffey , and the doctor , will be just a coachful .
Parsing [sent. 6773 len. 27]: We 'll have the doctor , Pecksniff , because he knows what was the matter with him , and that it could n't be helped . '
Parsing [sent. 6774 len. 11]: ` Where is our dear friend , Mr Chuffey ? '
Parsing [sent. 6775 len. 24]: asked Pecksniff , looking round the chamber , and winking both his eyes at once -- for he was overcome by his feelings .
Parsing [sent. 6776 len. 40]: But here he was interrupted by Mrs Gamp , who , divested of her bonnet and shawl , came sidling and bridling into the room ; and with some sharpness demanded a conference outside the door with Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 6777 len. 27]: ` You may say whatever you wish to say here , Mrs Gamp , ' said that gentleman , shaking his head with a melancholy expression .
Parsing [sent. 6778 len. 49]: ` It is not much as I have to say when people is a-mourning for the dead and gone , ' said Mrs Gamp ; ` but what I have to say is TO the pint and purpose , and no offence intended , must be so considered .
Parsing [sent. 6779 len. 79]: I have been at a many places in my time , gentlemen , and I hope I knows what my duties is , and how the same should be performed ; in course , if I did not , it would be very strange , and very wrong in sich a gentleman as Mr Mould , which has undertook the highest families in this land , and given every satisfaction , so to recommend me as he does .
Parsing [sent. 6780 len. 61]: I have seen a deal of trouble my own self , ' said Mrs Gamp , laying greater and greater stress upon her words , ` and I can feel for them as has their feelings tried , but I am not a Rooshan or a Prooshan , and consequently can not suffer Spies to be set over me . '
Parsing [sent. 6781 len. 75]: Before it was possible that an answer could be returned , Mrs Gamp , growing redder in the face , went on to say : ` It is not a easy matter , gentlemen , to live when you are left a widder woman ; particular when your feelings works upon you to that extent that you often find yourself a-going out on terms which is a certain loss , and never can repay .
Parsing [sent. 6782 len. 25]: But in whatever way you earns your bread , you may have rules and regulations of your own which can not be broke through .
Parsing [sent. 6783 len. 47]: Some people , ' said Mrs Gamp , again entrenching herself behind her strong point , as if it were not assailable by human ingenuity , ` may be Rooshans , and others may be Prooshans ; they are born so , and will please themselves .
Parsing [sent. 6784 len. 10]: Them which is of other naturs thinks different . '
Parsing [sent. 6785 len. 25]: ` If I understand this good lady , ' said Mr Pecksniff , turning to Jonas , ` Mr Chuffey is troublesome to her .
Parsing [sent. 6786 len. 7]: Shall I fetch him down ? '
Parsing [sent. 6787 len. 8]: ` Do , ' said Jonas . '
Parsing [sent. 6788 len. 16]: I was going to tell you he was up there , when she came in .
Parsing [sent. 6789 len. 25]: I 'd go myself and bring him down , only -- only I 'd rather you went , if you do n't mind . '
Parsing [sent. 6790 len. 36]: Mr Pecksniff promptly departed , followed by Mrs Gamp , who , seeing that he took a bottle and glass from the cupboard , and carried it in his hand , was much softened . '
Parsing [sent. 6791 len. 38]: I am sure , ' she said , ` that if it was n't for his own happiness , I should no more mind him being there , poor dear , than if he was a fly .
Parsing [sent. 6792 len. 32]: But them as is n't used to these things , thinks so much of 'em afterwards , that it 's a kindness to 'em not to let 'em have their wish .
Parsing [sent. 6793 len. 41]: And even , ' said Mrs Gamp , probably in reference to some flowers of speech she had already strewn on Mr Chuffey , ` even if one calls 'em names , it 's only done to rouse 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 6794 len. 16]: Whatever epithets she had bestowed on the old clerk , they had not roused HIM .
Parsing [sent. 6795 len. 60]: He sat beside the bed , in the chair he had occupied all the previous night , with his hands folded before him , and his head bowed down ; and neither looked up , on their entrance , nor gave any sign of consciousness , until Mr Pecksniff took him by the arm , when he meekly rose .
Parsing [sent. 6796 len. 16]: ` Three score and ten , ' said Chuffey , ` ought and carry seven .
Parsing [sent. 6797 len. 28]: Some men are so strong that they live to four score -- four times ought 's an ought , four times two 's an eight -- eighty .
Parsing [sent. 6798 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6799 len. 28]: why -- why -- why did n't he live to four times ought 's an ought , and four times two 's an eight , eighty ? '
Parsing [sent. 6800 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6801 len. 7]: what a wale of grief ! '
Parsing [sent. 6802 len. 12]: cried Mrs Gamp , possessing herself of the bottle and glass .
Parsing [sent. 6803 len. 13]: ` Why did he die before his poor old crazy servant ? '
Parsing [sent. 6804 len. 12]: said Chuffey , clasping his hands and looking up in anguish .
Parsing [sent. 6805 len. 11]: ` Take him from me , and what remains ? '
Parsing [sent. 6806 len. 18]: ` Mr Jonas , ' returned Pecksniff , ` Mr Jonas , my good friend . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6807 len. 12]: I loved him , ' cried the old man , weeping .
Parsing [sent. 6808 len. 7]: ` He was good to me .
Parsing [sent. 6809 len. 9]: We learnt Tare and Tret together at school .
Parsing [sent. 6810 len. 13]: I took him down once , six boys in the arithmetic class .
Parsing [sent. 6811 len. 4]: God forgive me !
Parsing [sent. 6812 len. 10]: Had I the heart to take him down ! '
Parsing [sent. 6813 len. 10]: ` Come , Mr Chuffey , ' said Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 6814 len. 5]: ` Come with me .
Parsing [sent. 6815 len. 9]: Summon up your fortitude , Mr Chuffey . '
Parsing [sent. 6816 len. 12]: ` Yes , I will , ' returned the old clerk .
Parsing [sent. 6817 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 6818 len. 31]: I 'll sum up my forty -- How many times forty -- Oh , Chuzzlewit and Son -- Your own son Mr Chuzzlewit ; your own son , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 6819 len. 24]: He yielded to the hand that guided him , as he lapsed into this familiar expression , and submitted to be led away .
Parsing [sent. 6820 len. 53]: Mrs Gamp , with the bottle on one knee , and the glass on the other , sat upon a stool , shaking her head for a long time , until , in a moment of abstraction , she poured out a dram of spirits , and raised it to her lips .
Parsing [sent. 6821 len. 48]: It was succeeded by a second , and by a third , and then her eyes -- either in the sadness of her reflections upon life and death , or in her admiration of the liquor -- were so turned up , as to be quite invisible .
Parsing [sent. 6822 len. 7]: But she shook her head still .
Parsing [sent. 6823 len. 47]: Poor Chuffey was conducted to his accustomed corner , and there he remained , silent and quiet , save at long intervals , when he would rise , and walk about the room , and wring his hands , or raise some strange and sudden cry .
Parsing [sent. 6824 len. 16]: For a whole week they all three sat about the hearth and never stirred abroad .
Parsing [sent. 6825 len. 52]: Mr Pecksniff would have walked out in the evening time , but Mr Jonas was so averse to his being absent for a minute , that he abandoned the idea , and so , from morning until night , they brooded together in the dark room , without relief or occupation .
Parsing [sent. 6826 len. 33]: The weight of that which was stretched out , stiff and stark , in the awful chamber above-stairs , so crushed and bore down Jonas , that he bent beneath the load .
Parsing [sent. 6827 len. 26]: During the whole long seven days and nights , he was always oppressed and haunted by a dreadful sense of its presence in the house .
Parsing [sent. 6828 len. 29]: Did the door move , he looked towards it with a livid face and starting eye , as if he fully believed that ghostly fingers clutched the handle .
Parsing [sent. 6829 len. 34]: Did the fire fiicker in a draught of air , he glanced over his shoulder , as almost dreading to behold some shrouded figure fanning and flapping at it with its fearful dress .
Parsing [sent. 6830 len. 41]: The lightest noise disturbed him ; and once , in the night , at the sound of a footstep overhead , he cried out that the dead man was walking -- tramp , tramp , tramp -- about his coffin .
Parsing [sent. 6831 len. 31]: He lay at night upon a mattress on the floor of the sitting-room ; his own chamber having been assigned to Mrs Gamp ; and Mr Pecksniff was similarly accommodated .
Parsing [sent. 6832 len. 19]: The howling of a dog before the house , filled him with a terror he could not disguise .
Parsing [sent. 6833 len. 24]: He avoided the reflection in the opposite windows of the light that burned above , as though it had been an angry eye .
Parsing [sent. 6834 len. 41]: He often , in every night , rose up from his fitful sleep , and looked and longed for dawn ; all directions and arrangements , even to the ordering of their daily meals , he abandoned to Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 6835 len. 103]: That excellent gentleman , deeming that the mourner wanted comfort , and that high feeding was likely to do him infinite service , availed himself of these opportunities to such good purpose , that they kept quite a dainty table during this melancholy season ; with sweetbreads , stewed kidneys , oysters , and other such light viands for supper every night ; over which , and sundry jorums of hot punch , Mr Pecksniff delivered such moral reflections and spiritual consolation as might have converted a Heathen -- especially if he had had but an imperfect acquaintance with the English tongue .
Parsing [sent. 6836 len. 15]: Nor did Mr Pecksniff alone indulge in the creature comforts during this sad time .
Parsing [sent. 6837 len. 18]: Mrs Gamp proved to be very choice in her eating , and repudiated hashed mutton with scorn .
Parsing [sent. 6838 len. 86]: In her drinking too , she was very punctual and particular , requiring a pint of mild porter at lunch , a pint at dinner , half-a-pint as a species of stay or holdfast between dinner and tea , and a pint of the celebrated staggering ale , or Real Old Brighton Tipper , at supper ; besides the bottle on the chimney-piece , and such casual invitations to refresh herself with wine as the good breeding of her employers might prompt them to offer .
Parsing [sent. 6839 len. 53]: In like manner , Mr Mould 's men found it necessary to drown their grief , like a young kitten in the morning of its existence , for which reason they generally fuddled themselves before they began to do anything , lest it should make head and get the better of them .
Parsing [sent. 6840 len. 43]: In short , the whole of that strange week was a round of dismal joviality and grim enjoyment ; and every one , except poor Chuffey , who came within the shadow of Anthony Chuzzlewit 's grave , feasted like a Ghoul .
Parsing [sent. 6841 len. 18]: At length the day of the funeral , pious and truthful ceremony that it was , arrived .
Parsing [sent. 6842 len. 112]: Mr Mould , with a glass of generous port between his eye and the light , leaned against the desk in the little glass office with his gold watch in his unoccupied hand , and conversed with Mrs Gamp ; two mutes were at the house-door , looking as mournful as could be reasonably expected of men with such a thriving job in hand ; the whole of Mr Mould 's establishment were on duty within the house or without ; feathers waved , horses snorted , silk and velvets fluttered ; in a word , as Mr Mould emphatically said , ` Everything that money could do was done . '
Parsing [sent. 6843 len. 11]: ` And what can do more , Mrs Gamp ? '
Parsing [sent. 6844 len. 13]: exclaimed the undertaker as he emptied his glass and smacked his lips .
Parsing [sent. 6845 len. 9]: ` Nothing in the world , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 6846 len. 11]: ` Nothing in the world , ' repeated Mr Mould .
Parsing [sent. 6847 len. 7]: ` You are right , Mrs.Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 6848 len. 28]: Why do people spend more money ' -- here he filled his glass again -- ` upon a death , Mrs Gamp , than upon a birth ?
Parsing [sent. 6849 len. 13]: Come , that 's in your way ; you ought to know .
Parsing [sent. 6850 len. 9]: How do you account for that now ? '
Parsing [sent. 6851 len. 37]: ` Perhaps it is because an undertaker 's charges comes dearer than a nurse 's charges , sir , ' said Mrs Gamp , tittering , and smoothing down her new black dress with her hands .
Parsing [sent. 6852 len. 6]: ` Ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 6853 len. 4]: laughed Mr Mould .
Parsing [sent. 6854 len. 16]: ` You have been breakfasting at somebody 's expense this morning , Mrs Gamp . '
Parsing [sent. 6855 len. 27]: But seeing , by the aid of a little shaving-glass which hung opposite , that he looked merry , he composed his features and became sorrowful .
Parsing [sent. 6856 len. 47]: ` Many 's the time that I 've not breakfasted at my own expense along of your recommending , sir ; and many 's the time I hope to do the same in time to come , ' said Mrs Gamp , with an apologetic curtsey .
Parsing [sent. 6857 len. 14]: ` So be it , ' replied Mr Mould , ` please Providence .
Parsing [sent. 6858 len. 13]: No , Mrs Gamp ; I 'll tell you why it is .
Parsing [sent. 6859 len. 37]: It 's because the laying out of money with a well-conducted establishment , where the thing is performed upon the very best scale , binds the broken heart , and sheds balm upon the wounded spirit .
Parsing [sent. 6860 len. 18]: Hearts want binding , and spirits want balming when people die ; not when people are born .
Parsing [sent. 6861 len. 11]: Look at this gentleman to-day ; look at him . '
Parsing [sent. 6862 len. 6]: ` An open-handed gentleman ? '
Parsing [sent. 6863 len. 7]: cried Mrs Gamp , with enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 6864 len. 22]: ` No , no , ' said the undertaker ; ` not an open-handed gentleman in general , by any means .
Parsing [sent. 6865 len. 43]: There you mistake him ; but an afflicted gentleman , an affectionate gentleman , who knows what it is in the power of money to do , in giving him relief , and in testifying his love and veneration for the departed .
Parsing [sent. 6866 len. 126]: It can give him , ' said Mr Mould , waving his watch-chain slowly round and round , so that he described one circle after every item ; ` it can give him four horses to each vehicle ; it can give him velvet trappings ; it can give him drivers in cloth cloaks and top-boots ; it can give him the plumage of the ostrich , dyed black ; it can give him any number of walking attendants , dressed in the first style of funeral fashion , and carrying batons tipped with brass ; it can give him a handsome tomb ; it can give him a place in Westminster Abbey itself , if he choose to invest it in such a purchase .
Parsing [sent. 6867 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6868 len. 23]: do not let us say that gold is dross , when it can buy such things as these , Mrs Gamp . '
Parsing [sent. 6869 len. 31]: ` But what a blessing , sir , ' said Mrs Gamp , ` that there are such as you , to sell or let 'em out on hire ! '
Parsing [sent. 6870 len. 15]: ` Aye , Mrs Gamp , you are right , ' rejoined the undertaker .
Parsing [sent. 6871 len. 8]: ` We should be an honoured calling .
Parsing [sent. 6872 len. 17]: We do good by stealth , and blush to have it mentioned in our little bills .
Parsing [sent. 6873 len. 36]: How much consolation may I -- even I , ' cried Mr Mould , ` have diffused among my fellow-creatures by means of my four long-tailed prancers , never harnessed under ten pund ten ! '
Parsing [sent. 6874 len. 78]: Mrs Gamp had begun to make a suitable reply , when she was interrupted by the appearance of one of Mr Mould 's assistants -- his chief mourner in fact -- an obese person , with his waistcoat in closer connection with his legs than is quite reconcilable with the established ideas of grace ; with that cast of feature which is figuratively called a bottle nose ; and with a face covered all over with pimples .
Parsing [sent. 6875 len. 27]: He had been a tender plant once upon a time , but from constant blowing in the fat atmosphere of funerals , had run to seed .
Parsing [sent. 6876 len. 18]: ` Well , Tacker , ' said Mr Mould , ` is all ready below ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 6877 len. 10]: A beautiful show , sir , ' rejoined Tacker .
Parsing [sent. 6878 len. 31]: ` The horses are prouder and fresher than ever I see 'em ; and toss their heads , they do , as if they knowed how much their plumes cost .
Parsing [sent. 6879 len. 24]: One , two , three , four , ' said Mr Tacker , heaping that number of black cloaks upon his left arm .
Parsing [sent. 6880 len. 12]: ` Is Tom there , with the cake and wine ? '
Parsing [sent. 6881 len. 4]: asked Mr Mould .
Parsing [sent. 6882 len. 17]: ` Ready to come in at a moment 's notice , sir , ' said Tacker .
Parsing [sent. 6883 len. 46]: ` Then , ' rejoined Mr Mould , putting up his watch , and glancing at himself in the little shaving-glass , that he might be sure his face had the right expression on it ; ` then I think we may proceed to business .
Parsing [sent. 6884 len. 9]: Give me the paper of gloves , Tacker .
Parsing [sent. 6885 len. 8]: Ah , what a man he was !
Parsing [sent. 6886 len. 13]: Ah , Tacker , Tacker , what a man he was ! '
Parsing [sent. 6887 len. 45]: Mr Tacker , who from his great experience in the performance of funerals , would have made an excellent pantomime actor , winked at Mrs Gamp without at all disturbing the gravity of his countenance , and followed his master into the next room .
Parsing [sent. 6888 len. 46]: It was a great point with Mr Mould , and a part of his professional tact , not to seem to know the doctor ; though in reality they were near neighbours , and very often , as in the present instance , worked together .
Parsing [sent. 6889 len. 62]: So he advanced to fit on his black kid gloves as if he had never seen him in all his life ; while the doctor , on his part , looked as distant and unconscious as if he had heard and read of undertakers , and had passed their shops , but had never before been brought into communication with one .
Parsing [sent. 6890 len. 6]: ` Gloves , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 6891 len. 4]: said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 6892 len. 8]: ` Mr Pecksniff after you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6893 len. 12]: I could n't think of it , ' returned Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 6894 len. 15]: ` You are very good , ' said the doctor , taking a pair .
Parsing [sent. 6895 len. 24]: ` Well , sir , as I was saying -- I was called up to attend that case at about half-past one o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 6896 len. 6]: Cake and wine , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 6897 len. 4]: Which is port ?
Parsing [sent. 6898 len. 4]: Thank you . '
Parsing [sent. 6899 len. 6]: Mr Pecksniff took some also .
Parsing [sent. 6900 len. 27]: ` At about half-past one o'clock in the morning , sir , ' resumed the doctor , ' I was called up to attend that case .
Parsing [sent. 6901 len. 22]: At the first pull of the night-bell I turned out , threw up the window , and put out my head .
Parsing [sent. 6902 len. 4]: Cloak , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 6903 len. 7]: Do n't tie it too tight .
Parsing [sent. 6904 len. 5]: That 'll do . '
Parsing [sent. 6905 len. 15]: Mr Pecksniff having been likewise inducted into a similar garment , the doctor resumed .
Parsing [sent. 6906 len. 11]: ` And put out my head -- hat , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 6907 len. 9]: My good friend , that is not mine .
Parsing [sent. 6908 len. 18]: Mr Pecksniff , I beg your pardon , but I think we have unintentionally made an exchange .
Parsing [sent. 6909 len. 3]: Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 6910 len. 26]: Well , sir , I was going to tell you -- ' ` We are quite ready , ' interrupted Mould in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 6911 len. 6]: ` Ready , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 6912 len. 4]: said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 6913 len. 20]: ` Very good , Mr Pecksniff , I 'll take an opportunity of relating the rest in the coach .
Parsing [sent. 6914 len. 5]: It 's rather curious .
Parsing [sent. 6915 len. 4]: Ready , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 6916 len. 7]: No rain , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 6917 len. 11]: ` Quite fair , sir , ' returned Mould . '
Parsing [sent. 6918 len. 22]: I was afraid the ground would have been wet , ' said the doctor , ` for my glass fell yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 6919 len. 10]: We may congratulate ourselves upon our good fortune . '
Parsing [sent. 6920 len. 48]: But seeing by this time that Mr Jonas and Chuffey were going out at the door , he put a white pocket-handkerchief to his face as if a violent burst of grief had suddenly come upon him , and walked down side by side with Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 6921 len. 14]: Mr Mould and his men had not exaggerated the grandeur of the arrangements .
Parsing [sent. 6922 len. 4]: They were splendid .
Parsing [sent. 6923 len. 30]: The four hearse-horses , especially , reared and pranced , and showed their highest action , as if they knew a man was dead , and triumphed in it .
Parsing [sent. 6924 len. 32]: ` They break us , drive us , ride us ; ill-treat , abuse , and maim us for their pleasure -- But they die ; Hurrah , they die ! '
Parsing [sent. 6925 len. 85]: So through the narrow streets and winding city ways , went Anthony Chuzzlewit 's funeral ; Mr Jonas glancing stealthily out of the coach-window now and then , to observe its effect upon the crowd ; Mr Mould as he walked along , listening with a sober pride to the exclamations of the bystanders ; the doctor whispering his story to Mr Pecksniff , without appearing to come any nearer the end of it ; and poor old Chuffey sobbing unregarded in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 6926 len. 35]: But he had greatly scandalized Mr Mould at an early stage of the ceremony by carrying his handkerchief in his hat in a perfectly informal manner , and wiping his eyes with his knuckles .
Parsing [sent. 6927 len. 31]: And as Mr Mould himself had said already , his behaviour was indecent , and quite unworthy of such an occasion ; and he never ought to have been there .
Parsing [sent. 6928 len. 48]: There he was , however ; and in the churchyard there he was , also , conducting himself in a no less unbecoming manner , and leaning for support on Tacker , who plainly told him that he was fit for nothing better than a walking funeral .
Parsing [sent. 6929 len. 7]: But Chuffey , Heaven help him !
Parsing [sent. 6930 len. 21]: heard no sound but the echoes , lingering in his own heart , of a voice for ever silent . '
Parsing [sent. 6931 len. 20]: I loved him , ' cried the old man , sinking down upon the grave when all was done .
Parsing [sent. 6932 len. 8]: ` He was very good to me .
Parsing [sent. 6933 len. 10]: Oh , my dear old friend and master ! '
Parsing [sent. 6934 len. 28]: ` Come , come , Mr Chuffey , ' said the doctor , ` this wo n't do ; it 's a clayey soil , Mr Chuffey .
Parsing [sent. 6935 len. 7]: You must n't , really . '
Parsing [sent. 6936 len. 51]: ` If it had been the commonest thing we do , and Mr Chuffey had been a Bearer , gentlemen , ' said Mould , casting an imploring glance upon them , as he helped to raise him , ` he could n't have gone on worse than this . '
Parsing [sent. 6937 len. 12]: ` Be a man , Mr Chuffey , ' said Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 6938 len. 12]: ` Be a gentleman , Mr Chuffey , ' said Mould .
Parsing [sent. 6939 len. 39]: ` Upon my word , my good friend , ' murmured the doctor , in a tone of stately reproof , as he stepped up to the old man 's side , ` this is worse than weakness .
Parsing [sent. 6940 len. 12]: This is bad , selfish , very wrong , Mr Chuffey .
Parsing [sent. 6941 len. 11]: You should take example from others , my good sir .
Parsing [sent. 6942 len. 32]: You forget that you were not connected by ties of blood with our deceased friend ; and that he had a very near and very dear relation , Mr Chuffey . '
Parsing [sent. 6943 len. 8]: ` Aye , his own son ! '
Parsing [sent. 6944 len. 12]: cried the old man , clasping his hands with remarkable passion .
Parsing [sent. 6945 len. 10]: ` His own , own , only son ! '
Parsing [sent. 6946 len. 19]: ` He 's not right in his head , you know , ' said Jonas , turning pale .
Parsing [sent. 6947 len. 10]: ` You 're not to mind anything he says .
Parsing [sent. 6948 len. 13]: I should n't wonder if he was to talk some precious nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 6949 len. 11]: But do n't you mind him , any of you .
Parsing [sent. 6950 len. 4]: I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 6951 len. 19]: My father left him to my charge ; and whatever he says or does , that 's enough .
Parsing [sent. 6952 len. 8]: I 'll take care of him . '
Parsing [sent. 6953 len. 32]: A hum of admiration rose from the mourners -LRB- including Mr Mould and his merry men -RRB- at this new instance of magnanimity and kind feeling on the part of Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 6954 len. 10]: But Chuffey put it to the test no farther .
Parsing [sent. 6955 len. 24]: He said not a word more , and being left to himself for a little while , crept back again to the coach .
Parsing [sent. 6956 len. 34]: It has been said that Mr Jonas turned pale when the behaviour of the old clerk attracted general attention ; his discomposure , however , was but momentary , and he soon recovered .
Parsing [sent. 6957 len. 13]: But these were not the only changes he had exhibited that day .
Parsing [sent. 6958 len. 73]: The curious eyes of Mr Pecksniff had observed that as soon as they left the house upon their mournful errand , he began to mend ; that as the ceremonies proceeded he gradually , by little and little , recovered his old condition , his old looks , his old bearing , his old agreeable characteristics of speech and manner , and became , in all respects , his old pleasant self .
Parsing [sent. 6959 len. 100]: And now that they were seated in the coach on their return home ; and more when they got there , and found the windows open , the light and air admitted , and all traces of the late event removed ; he felt so well convinced that Jonas was again the Jonas he had known a week ago , and not the Jonas of the intervening time , that he voluntarily gave up his recently-acquired power without one faint attempt to exercise it , and at once fell back into his former position of mild and deferential guest .
Parsing [sent. 6960 len. 170]: Mrs Gamp went home to the bird-fancier 's , and was knocked up again that very night for a birth of twins ; Mr Mould dined gayly in the bosom of his family , and passed the evening facetiously at his club ; the hearse , after standing for a long time at the door of a roistering public-house , repaired to its stables with the feathers inside and twelve red-nosed undertakers on the roof , each holding on by a dingy peg , to which , in times of state , a waving plume was fitted ; the various trappings of sorrow were carefully laid by in presses for the next hirer ; the fiery steeds were quenched and quiet in their stalls ; the doctor got merry with wine at a wedding-dinner , and forgot the middle of the story which had no end to it ; the pageant of a few short hours ago was written nowhere half so legibly as in the undertaker 's books .
Parsing [sent. 6961 len. 5]: Not in the churchyard ?
Parsing [sent. 6962 len. 4]: Not even there .
Parsing [sent. 6963 len. 24]: The gates were closed ; the night was dark and wet ; the rain fell silently , among the stagnant weeds and nettles .
Parsing [sent. 6964 len. 13]: One new mound was there which had not been there last night .
Parsing [sent. 6965 len. 22]: Time , burrowing like a mole below the ground , had marked his track by throwing up another heap of earth .
Parsing [sent. 6966 len. 5]: And that was all .
Parsing [sent. 6967 len. 57]: CHAPTER TWENTY IS A CHAPTER OF LOVE ` Pecksniff , ' said Jonas , taking off his hat , to see that the black crape band was all right ; and finding that it was , putting it on again , complacently ; ` what do you mean to give your daughters when they marry ? '
Parsing [sent. 6968 len. 25]: ` My dear Mr Jonas , ' cried the affectionate parent , with an ingenuous smile , ` what a very singular inquiry ! '
Parsing [sent. 6969 len. 40]: ` Now , do n't you mind whether it 's a singular inquiry or a plural one , ' retorted Jonas , eyeing Mr Pecksniff with no great favour , ` but answer it , or let it alone .
Parsing [sent. 6970 len. 6]: One or the other . '
Parsing [sent. 6971 len. 3]: ` Hum !
Parsing [sent. 6972 len. 29]: The question , my dear friend , ' said Mr Pecksniff , laying his hand tenderly upon his kinsman 's knee , ` is involved with many considerations .
Parsing [sent. 6973 len. 6]: What would I give them ?
Parsing [sent. 6974 len. 3]: Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 6975 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6976 len. 7]: what would you give 'em ? '
Parsing [sent. 6977 len. 3]: repeated Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 6978 len. 33]: ` Why , that , ` said Mr Pecksniff , ` would naturally depend in a great measure upon the kind of husbands they might choose , my dear young friend . '
Parsing [sent. 6979 len. 14]: Mr Jonas was evidently disconcerted , and at a loss how to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 6980 len. 6]: It was a good answer .
Parsing [sent. 6981 len. 15]: It seemed a deep one , but such is the wisdom of simplicity ! '
Parsing [sent. 6982 len. 29]: ` My standard for the merits I would require in a son-in-law , ' said Mr Pecksniff , after a short silence , ` is a high one .
Parsing [sent. 6983 len. 52]: Forgive me , my dear Mr Jonas , ' he added , greatly moved , ` if I say that you have spoiled me , and made it a fanciful one ; an imaginative one ; a prismatically tinged one , if I may be permitted to call it so . '
Parsing [sent. 6984 len. 9]: ` What do you mean by that ? '
Parsing [sent. 6985 len. 10]: growled Jonas , looking at him with increased disfavour .
Parsing [sent. 6986 len. 18]: ` Indeed , my dear friend , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` you may well inquire .
Parsing [sent. 6987 len. 20]: The heart is not always a royal mint , with patent machinery to work its metal into current coin .
Parsing [sent. 6988 len. 17]: Sometimes it throws it out in strange forms , not easily recognized as coin at all .
Parsing [sent. 6989 len. 6]: But it is sterling gold .
Parsing [sent. 6990 len. 7]: It has at least that merit .
Parsing [sent. 6991 len. 6]: It is sterling gold . '
Parsing [sent. 6992 len. 5]: ` Is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 6993 len. 11]: grumbled Jonas , with a doubtful shake of the head .
Parsing [sent. 6994 len. 4]: ` Aye ! '
Parsing [sent. 6995 len. 12]: said Mr Pecksniff , warming with his subject ` it is .
Parsing [sent. 6996 len. 59]: To be plain with you , Mr Jonas , if I could find two such sons-in-law as you will one day make to some deserving man , capable of appreciating a nature such as yours , I would -- forgetful of myself -- bestow upon my daughters portions reaching to the very utmost limit of my means . '
Parsing [sent. 6997 len. 11]: This was strong language , and it was earnestly delivered .
Parsing [sent. 6998 len. 49]: But who can wonder that such a man as Mr Pecksniff , after all he had seen and heard of Mr Jonas , should be strong and earnest upon such a theme ; a theme that touched even the worldly lips of undertakers with the honey of eloquence !
Parsing [sent. 6999 len. 12]: Mr Jonas was silent , and looked thoughtfully at the landscape .
Parsing [sent. 7000 len. 23]: For they were seated on the outside of the coach , at the back , and were travelling down into the country .
Parsing [sent. 7001 len. 20]: He accompanied Mr Pecksniff home for a few days ' change of air and scene after his recent trials .
Parsing [sent. 7002 len. 28]: ` Well , ' he said , at last , with captivating bluntness , ` suppose you got one such son-in-law as me , what then ? '
Parsing [sent. 7003 len. 34]: Mr Pecksniff regarded him at first with inexpressible surprise ; then gradually breaking into a sort of dejected vivacity , said : ` Then well I know whose husband he would be ! '
Parsing [sent. 7004 len. 4]: ` Whose ? '
Parsing [sent. 7005 len. 5]: asked Jonas , drily .
Parsing [sent. 7006 len. 17]: ` My eldest girl 's , Mr Jonas , ' replied Pecksniff , with moistening eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7007 len. 18]: ` My dear Cherry 's ; my staff , my scrip , my treasure , Mr Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 7008 len. 13]: A hard struggle , but it is in the nature of things !
Parsing [sent. 7009 len. 11]: I must one day part with her to a husband .
Parsing [sent. 7010 len. 8]: I know it , my dear friend .
Parsing [sent. 7011 len. 7]: I am prepared for it . '
Parsing [sent. 7012 len. 3]: ` Ecod !
Parsing [sent. 7013 len. 19]: you 've been prepared for that a pretty long time , I should think , ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 7014 len. 15]: ` Many have sought to bear her from me , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 7015 len. 5]: ` All have failed .
Parsing [sent. 7016 len. 24]: `` I never will give my hand , papa '' -- those were her words -- `` unless my heart is won . ''
Parsing [sent. 7017 len. 16]: She has not been quite so happy as she used to be , of late .
Parsing [sent. 7018 len. 7]: I do n't know why . '
Parsing [sent. 7019 len. 27]: Again Mr Jonas looked at the landscape ; then at the coachman ; then at the luggage on the roof ; finally at Mr Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 7020 len. 18]: I suppose you 'll have to part with the other one , some of these days ? '
Parsing [sent. 7021 len. 11]: he observed , as he caught that gentleman 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 7022 len. 8]: ` Probably , ' said the parent .
Parsing [sent. 7023 len. 19]: ` Years will tame down the wildness of my foolish bird , and then it will be caged .
Parsing [sent. 7024 len. 15]: But Cherry , Mr Jonas , Cherry -- ' ` Oh , ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 7025 len. 3]: interrupted Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 7026 len. 9]: ` Years have made her all right enough .
Parsing [sent. 7027 len. 4]: Nobody doubts that .
Parsing [sent. 7028 len. 10]: But you have n't answered what I asked you .
Parsing [sent. 7029 len. 20]: Of course , you 're not obliged to do it , you know , if you do n't like .
Parsing [sent. 7030 len. 7]: You 're the best judge . '
Parsing [sent. 7031 len. 63]: There was a warning sulkiness in the manner of this speech , which admonished Mr Pecksniff that his dear friend was not to be trifled with or fenced off , and that he must either return a straight-forward reply to his question , or plainly give him to understand that he declined to enlighten him upon the subject to which it referred .
Parsing [sent. 7032 len. 87]: Mindful in this dilemma of the caution old Anthony had given him almost with his latest breath , he resolved to speak to the point , and so told Mr Jonas -LRB- enlarging upon the communication as a proof of his great attachment and confidence -RRB- , that in the case he had put ; to wit , in the event of such a man as he proposing for his daughter 's hand , he would endow her with a fortune of four thousand pounds . '
Parsing [sent. 7033 len. 32]: I should sadly pinch and cramp myself to do so , ' was his fatherly remark ; ` but that would be my duty , and my conscience would reward me .
Parsing [sent. 7034 len. 9]: For myself , my conscience is my bank .
Parsing [sent. 7035 len. 29]: I have a trifle invested there -- a mere trifle , Mr Jonas -- but I prize it as a store of value , I assure you . '
Parsing [sent. 7036 len. 15]: The good man 's enemies would have divided upon this question into two parties .
Parsing [sent. 7037 len. 36]: One would have asserted without scruple that if Mr Pecksniff 's conscience were his bank , and he kept a running account there , he must have overdrawn it beyond all mortal means of computation .
Parsing [sent. 7038 len. 50]: The other would have contended that it was a mere fictitious form ; a perfectly blank book ; or one in which entries were only made with a peculiar kind of invisible ink to become legible at some indefinite time ; and that he never troubled it at all .
Parsing [sent. 7039 len. 48]: ` It would sadly pinch and cramp me , my dear friend , ' repeated Mr Pecksniff , ` but Providence -- perhaps I may be permitted to say a special Providence -- has blessed my endeavours , and I could guarantee to make the sacrifice . '
Parsing [sent. 7040 len. 29]: A question of philosophy arises here , whether Mr Pecksniff had or had not good reason to say that he was specially patronized and encouraged in his undertakings .
Parsing [sent. 7041 len. 42]: All his life long he had been walking up and down the narrow ways and by-places , with a hook in one hand and a crook in the other , scraping all sorts of valuable odds and ends into his pouch .
Parsing [sent. 7042 len. 59]: Now , there being a special Providence in the fall of a sparrow , it follows -LRB- so Mr Pecksniff , and only such admirable men , would have reasoned -RRB- , that there must also be a special Providence in the alighting of the stone or stick , or other substance which is aimed at the sparrow .
Parsing [sent. 7043 len. 54]: And Mr Pecksniff 's hook , or crook , having invariably knocked the sparrow on the head and brought him down , that gentleman may have been led to consider himself as specially licensed to bag sparrows , and as being specially seized and possessed of all the birds he had got together .
Parsing [sent. 7044 len. 48]: That many undertakings , national as well as individual -- but especially the former -- are held to be specially brought to a glorious and successful issue , which never could be so regarded on any other process of reasoning , must be clear to all men .
Parsing [sent. 7045 len. 53]: Therefore the precedents would seem to show that Mr Pecksniff had -LRB- as things go -RRB- good argument for what he said and might be permitted to say it , and did not say it presumptuously , vainly , or arrogantly , but in a spirit of high faith and great wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 7046 len. 24]: Mr Jonas , not being much accustomed to perplex his mind with theories of this nature , expressed no opinion on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 7047 len. 20]: Nor did he receive his companion 's announcement with one solitary syllable , good , bad , or indifferent .
Parsing [sent. 7048 len. 87]: He preserved this taciturnity for a quarter of an hour at least , and during the whole of that time appeared to be steadily engaged in subjecting some given amount to the operation of every known rule in figures ; adding to it , taking from it , multiplying it , reducing it by long and short division ; working it by the rule-of-three direct and inversed ; exchange or barter ; practice ; simple interest ; compound interest ; and other means of arithmetical calculation .
Parsing [sent. 7049 len. 39]: The result of these labours appeared to be satisfactory , for when he did break silence , it was as one who had arrived at some specific result , and freed himself from a state of distressing uncertainty .
Parsing [sent. 7050 len. 7]: ` Come , old Pecksniff ! '
Parsing [sent. 7051 len. 30]: -- Such was his jocose address , as he slapped that gentleman on the back , at the end of the stage -- ` let 's have something ! '
Parsing [sent. 7052 len. 11]: ` With all my heart , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 7053 len. 11]: ` Let 's treat the driver , ' cried Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 7054 len. 26]: ` If you think it wo n't hurt the man , or render him discontented with his station -- certainly , ' faltered Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 7055 len. 26]: Jonas only laughed at this , and getting down from the coach-top with great alacrity , cut a cumbersome kind of caper in the road .
Parsing [sent. 7056 len. 72]: After which , he went into the public-house , and there ordered spirituous drink to such an extent , that Mr Pecksniff had some doubts of his perfect sanity , until Jonas set them quite at rest by saying , when the coach could wait no longer : ` I 've been standing treat for a whole week and more , and letting you have all the delicacies of the season .
Parsing [sent. 7057 len. 8]: YOU shall pay for this Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 7058 len. 35]: It was not a joke either , as Mr Pecksniff at first supposed ; for he went off to the coach without further ceremony , and left his respected victim to settle the bill .
Parsing [sent. 7059 len. 17]: But Mr Pecksniff was a man of meek endurance , and Mr Jonas was his friend .
Parsing [sent. 7060 len. 28]: Moreover , his regard for that gentleman was founded , as we know , on pure esteem , and a knowledge of the excellence of his character .
Parsing [sent. 7061 len. 33]: He came out from the tavern with a smiling face , and even went so far as to repeat the performance , on a less expensive scale , at the next ale-house .
Parsing [sent. 7062 len. 64]: There was a certain wildness in the spirits of Mr Jonas -LRB- not usually a part of his character -RRB- which was far from being subdued by these means , and , for the rest of the journey , he was so very buoyant -- it may be said , boisterous -- that Mr Pecksniff had some difficulty in keeping pace with him .
Parsing [sent. 7063 len. 10]: They were not expected -- oh dear , no !
Parsing [sent. 7064 len. 61]: Mr Pecksniff had proposed in London to give the girls a surprise , and had said he would n't write a word to prepare them on any account , in order that he and Mr Jonas might take them unawares , and just see what they were doing , when they thought their dear papa was miles and miles away .
Parsing [sent. 7065 len. 51]: As a consequence of this playful device , there was nobody to meet them at the finger-post , but that was of small consequence , for they had come down by the day coach , and Mr Pecksniff had only a carpetbag , while Mr Jonas had only a portmanteau .
Parsing [sent. 7066 len. 61]: They took the portmanteau between them , put the bag upon it , and walked off up the lane without delay ; Mr Pecksniff already going on tiptoe as if , without this precaution , his fond children , being then at a distance of a couple of miles or so , would have some filial sense of his approach .
Parsing [sent. 7067 len. 29]: It was a lovely evening in the spring-time of the year ; and in the soft stillness of the twilight , all nature was very calm and beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 7068 len. 35]: The day had been fine and warm ; but at the coming on of night , the air grew cool , and in the mellowing distance smoke was rising gently from the cottage chimneys .
Parsing [sent. 7069 len. 58]: There were a thousand pleasant scents diffused around , from young leaves and fresh buds ; the cuckoo had been singing all day long , and was but just now hushed ; the smell of earth newly-upturned , first breath of hope to the first labourer after his garden withered , was fragrant in the evening breeze .
Parsing [sent. 7070 len. 48]: It was a time when most men cherish good resolves , and sorrow for the wasted past ; when most men , looking on the shadows as they gather , think of that evening which must close on all , and that to-morrow which has none beyond .
Parsing [sent. 7071 len. 12]: ` Precious dull , ' said Mr Jonas , looking about .
Parsing [sent. 7072 len. 13]: ` It 's enough to make a man go melancholy mad . '
Parsing [sent. 7073 len. 15]: ` We shall have lights and a fire soon , ' observed Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 7074 len. 16]: ` We shall need 'em by the time we get there , ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 7075 len. 9]: ` Why the devil do n't you talk ?
Parsing [sent. 7076 len. 7]: What are you thinking of ? '
Parsing [sent. 7077 len. 36]: ` To tell you the truth , Mr Jonas , ' said Pecksniff with great solemnity , ` my mind was running at that moment on our late dear friend , your departed father . '
Parsing [sent. 7078 len. 24]: Mr Jonas immediately let his burden fall , and said , threatening him with his hand : ` Drop that , Pecksniff ! '
Parsing [sent. 7079 len. 24]: Mr Pecksniff not exactly knowing whether allusion was made to the subject or the portmanteau , stared at his friend in unaffected surprise .
Parsing [sent. 7080 len. 8]: ` Drop it , I say ! '
Parsing [sent. 7081 len. 5]: cried Jonas , fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 7082 len. 5]: ` Do you hear ?
Parsing [sent. 7083 len. 8]: Drop it , now and for ever .
Parsing [sent. 7084 len. 10]: You had better , I give you notice ! '
Parsing [sent. 7085 len. 24]: ` It was quite a mistake , ' urged Mr Pecksniff , very much dismayed ; ` though I admit it was foolish .
Parsing [sent. 7086 len. 11]: I might have known it was a tender string . '
Parsing [sent. 7087 len. 24]: ` Do n't talk to me about tender strings , ' said Jonas , wiping his forehead with the cuff of his coat .
Parsing [sent. 7088 len. 21]: ` I 'm not going to be crowed over by you , because I do n't like dead company . '
Parsing [sent. 7089 len. 15]: Mr Pecksniff had got out the words ` Crowed over , Mr Jonas ! '
Parsing [sent. 7090 len. 23]: when that young man , with a dark expression in his countenance , cut him short once more : ` Mind ! '
Parsing [sent. 7091 len. 4]: he said . '
Parsing [sent. 7092 len. 6]: I wo n't have it .
Parsing [sent. 7093 len. 16]: I advise you not to revive the subject , neither to me nor anybody else .
Parsing [sent. 7094 len. 15]: You can take a hint , if you choose as well as another man .
Parsing [sent. 7095 len. 7]: There 's enough said about it .
Parsing [sent. 7096 len. 4]: Come along ! '
Parsing [sent. 7097 len. 79]: Taking up his part of the load again , when he had said these words , he hurried on so fast that Mr Pecksniff , at the other end of the portmanteau , found himself dragged forward , in a very inconvenient and ungraceful manner , to the great detriment of what is called by fancy gentlemen ` the bark ' upon his shins , which were most unmercifully bumped against the hard leather and the iron buckles .
Parsing [sent. 7098 len. 37]: In the course of a few minutes , however , Mr Jonas relaxed his speed , and suffered his companion to come up with him , and to bring the portmanteau into a tolerably straight position .
Parsing [sent. 7099 len. 48]: It was pretty clear that he regretted his late outbreak , and that he mistrusted its effect on Mr Pecksniff ; for as often as that gentleman glanced towards Mr Jonas , he found Mr Jonas glancing at him , which was a new source of embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 7100 len. 35]: It was but a short-lived one , though , for Mr Jonas soon began to whistle , whereupon Mr Pecksniff , taking his cue from his friend , began to hum a tune melodiously .
Parsing [sent. 7101 len. 10]: ` Pretty nearly there , ai n't we ? '
Parsing [sent. 7102 len. 10]: said Jonas , when this had lasted some time .
Parsing [sent. 7103 len. 12]: ` Close , my dear friend , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 7104 len. 12]: ` What 'll they be doing , do you suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 7105 len. 3]: asked Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 7106 len. 10]: ` Impossible to say , ' cried Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 7107 len. 4]: ` Giddy truants !
Parsing [sent. 7108 len. 9]: They may be away from home , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 7109 len. 7]: I was going to -- he !
Parsing [sent. 7110 len. 2]: he !
Parsing [sent. 7111 len. 2]: he !
Parsing [sent. 7112 len. 36]: -- I was going to propose , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` that we should enter by the back way , and come upon them like a clap of thunder , Mr Jonas . '
Parsing [sent. 7113 len. 38]: It might not have been easy to decide in respect of which of their manifold properties , Jonas , Mr Pecksniff , the carpet-bag , and the portmanteau , could be likened to a clap of thunder .
Parsing [sent. 7114 len. 41]: But Mr Jonas giving his assent to this proposal , they stole round into the back yard , and softly advanced towards the kitchen window , through which the mingled light of fire and candle shone upon the darkening night .
Parsing [sent. 7115 len. 18]: Truly Mr Pecksniff is blessed in his children -- in one of them , at any rate .
Parsing [sent. 7116 len. 37]: The prudent Cherry -- staff and scrip , and treasure of her doting father -- there she sits , at a little table white as driven snow , before the kitchen fire , making up accounts !
Parsing [sent. 7117 len. 36]: See the neat maiden , as with pen in hand , and calculating look addressed towards the ceiling and bunch of keys within a little basket at her side , she checks the housekeeping expenditure !
Parsing [sent. 7118 len. 32]: From flat-iron , dish-cover , and warming-pan ; from pot and kettle , face of brass footman , and black-leaded stove ; bright glances of approbation wink and glow upon her .
Parsing [sent. 7119 len. 16]: The very onions dangling from the beam , mantle and shine like cherubs ' cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 7120 len. 14]: Something of the influence of those vegetables sinks into Mr Pecksniff 's nature .
Parsing [sent. 7121 len. 3]: He weeps .
Parsing [sent. 7122 len. 42]: It is but for a moment , and he hides it from the observation of his friend -- very carefully -- by a somewhat elaborate use of his pocket-handkerchief , in fact ; for he would not have his weakness known .
Parsing [sent. 7123 len. 15]: ` Pleasant , ' he murmured , ` pleasant to a father 's feelings !
Parsing [sent. 7124 len. 4]: My dear girl !
Parsing [sent. 7125 len. 13]: Shall we let her know we are here , Mr Jonas ? '
Parsing [sent. 7126 len. 25]: ` Why , I suppose you do n't mean to spend the evening in the stable , or the coach-house , ' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 7127 len. 28]: ` That , indeed , is not such hospitality as I would show to YOU , my friend , ' cried Mr Pecksniff , pressing his hand .
Parsing [sent. 7128 len. 23]: And then he took a long breath , and tapping at the window , shouted with stentorian blandness : ` Boh ! '
Parsing [sent. 7129 len. 7]: Cherry dropped her pen and screamed .
Parsing [sent. 7130 len. 10]: But innocence is ever bold , or should be .
Parsing [sent. 7131 len. 37]: As they opened the door , the valiant girl exclaimed in a firm voice , and with a presence of mind which even in that trying moment did not desert her , ` Who are you ?
Parsing [sent. 7132 len. 5]: What do you want ?
Parsing [sent. 7133 len. 2]: Speak !
Parsing [sent. 7134 len. 14]: or I will call my Pa. ' Mr Pecksniff held out his arms .
Parsing [sent. 7135 len. 12]: She knew him instantly , and rushed into his fond embrace .
Parsing [sent. 7136 len. 25]: ` It was thoughtless of us , Mr Jonas , it was very thoughtless , ' said Pecksniff , smoothing his daugther 's hair .
Parsing [sent. 7137 len. 14]: ` My darling , do you see that I am not alone ! '
Parsing [sent. 7138 len. 3]: Not she .
Parsing [sent. 7139 len. 10]: She had seen nothing but her father until now .
Parsing [sent. 7140 len. 23]: She saw Mr Jonas now , though ; and blushed , and hung her head down , as she gave him welcome .
Parsing [sent. 7141 len. 5]: But where was Merry ?
Parsing [sent. 7142 len. 22]: Mr Pecksniff did n't ask the question in reproach , but in a vein of mildness touched with a gentle sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 7143 len. 10]: She was upstairs , reading on the parlour couch .
Parsing [sent. 7144 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7145 len. 8]: Domestic details had no charms for HER .
Parsing [sent. 7146 len. 16]: ` But call her down , ' said Mr Pecksniff , with a placid resignation .
Parsing [sent. 7147 len. 9]: ` Call her down , my love . '
Parsing [sent. 7148 len. 23]: She was called and came , all flushed and tumbled from reposing on the sofa ; but none the worse for that .
Parsing [sent. 7149 len. 6]: No , not at all .
Parsing [sent. 7150 len. 7]: Rather the better , if anything .
Parsing [sent. 7151 len. 7]: ` Oh my goodness me ! '
Parsing [sent. 7152 len. 42]: cried the arch girl , turning to her cousin when she had kissed her father on both cheeks , and in her frolicsome nature had bestowed a supernumerary salute upon the tip of his nose , ` YOU here , fright !
Parsing [sent. 7153 len. 15]: Well , I 'm very thankful that you wo n't trouble ME much ! '
Parsing [sent. 7154 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 7155 len. 11]: you 're as lively as ever , are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 7156 len. 3]: said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 7157 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7158 len. 7]: You 're a wicked one ! '
Parsing [sent. 7159 len. 7]: ` There , go along ! '
Parsing [sent. 7160 len. 7]: retorted Merry , pushing him away .
Parsing [sent. 7161 len. 23]: ` I 'm sure I do n't know what I shall ever do , if I have to see much of you .
Parsing [sent. 7162 len. 9]: Go along , for gracious ' sake ! '
Parsing [sent. 7163 len. 33]: Mr Pecksniff striking in here , with a request that Mr Jonas would immediately walk upstairs , he so far complied with the young lady 's adjuration as to go at once .
Parsing [sent. 7164 len. 73]: But though he had the fair Cherry on his arm , he could not help looking back at her sister , and exchanging some further dialogue of the same bantering description , as they all four ascended to the parlour ; where -- for the young ladies happened , by good fortune , to be a little later than usual that night -- the tea-board was at that moment being set out .
Parsing [sent. 7165 len. 43]: Mr Pinch was not at home , so they had it all to themselves , and were very snug and talkative , Jonas sitting between the two sisters , and displaying his gallantry in that engaging manner which was peculiar to him .
Parsing [sent. 7166 len. 51]: It was a hard thing , Mr Pecksniff said , when tea was done , and cleared away , to leave so pleasant a little party , but having some important papers to examine in his own apartment , he must beg them to excuse him for half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 7167 len. 14]: With this apology he withdrew , singing a careless strain as he went .
Parsing [sent. 7168 len. 38]: He had not been gone five minutes , when Merry , who had been sitting in the window , apart from Jonas and her sister , burst into a half-smothered laugh , and skipped towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 7169 len. 4]: ` Hallo ! '
Parsing [sent. 7170 len. 3]: cried Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 7171 len. 6]: ` Do n't go . '
Parsing [sent. 7172 len. 8]: ` Oh , I dare say ! '
Parsing [sent. 7173 len. 6]: rejoined Merry , looking back .
Parsing [sent. 7174 len. 16]: ` You 're very anxious I should stay , fright , ai n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 7175 len. 10]: ` Yes , I am , ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 7176 len. 7]: ` Upon my word I am .
Parsing [sent. 7177 len. 8]: I want to speak to you . '
Parsing [sent. 7178 len. 33]: But as she left the room notwithstanding , he ran out after her , and brought her back , after a short struggle in the passage which scandalized Miss Cherry very much .
Parsing [sent. 7179 len. 19]: ` Upon my word , Merry , ' urged that young lady , ' I wonder at you !
Parsing [sent. 7180 len. 11]: There are bounds even to absurdity , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 7181 len. 17]: ` Thank you , my sweet , ' said Merry , pursing up her rosy Lips .
Parsing [sent. 7182 len. 9]: ` Much obliged to it for its advice .
Parsing [sent. 7183 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7184 len. 11]: do leave me alone , you monster , do ! '
Parsing [sent. 7185 len. 49]: This entreaty was wrung from her by a new proceeding on the part of Mr Jonas , who pulled her down , all breathless as she was , into a seat beside him on the sofa , having at the same time Miss Cherry upon the other side .
Parsing [sent. 7186 len. 26]: ` Now , ' said Jonas , clasping the waist of each ; ' I have got both arms full , have n't I ? '
Parsing [sent. 7187 len. 25]: ` One of them will be black and blue to-morrow , if you do n't let me go , ' cried the playful Merry .
Parsing [sent. 7188 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7189 len. 16]: I do n't mind YOUR pinching , ' grinned Jonas , ' a bit . '
Parsing [sent. 7190 len. 15]: ` Pinch him for me , Cherry , pray , ' said Mercy . '
Parsing [sent. 7191 len. 17]: I never did hate anybody so much as I hate this creature , I declare ! '
Parsing [sent. 7192 len. 28]: ` No , no , do n't say that , ' urged Jonas , ` and do n't pinch either , because I want to be serious .
Parsing [sent. 7193 len. 10]: I say -- Cousin Charity -- ' ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 7194 len. 3]: what ? '
Parsing [sent. 7195 len. 5]: she answered sharply . '
Parsing [sent. 7196 len. 32]: I want to have some sober talk , ' said Jonas ; ' I want to prevent any mistakes , you know , and to put everything upon a pleasant understanding .
Parsing [sent. 7197 len. 11]: That 's desirable and proper , ai n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 7198 len. 8]: Neither of the sisters spoke a word .
Parsing [sent. 7199 len. 13]: Mr Jonas paused and cleared his throat , which was very dry .
Parsing [sent. 7200 len. 18]: ` She 'll not believe what I am going to say , will she , cousin ? '
Parsing [sent. 7201 len. 8]: said Jonas , timidly squeezing Miss Charity .
Parsing [sent. 7202 len. 18]: ` Really , Mr Jonas , I do n't know , until I hear what it is .
Parsing [sent. 7203 len. 6]: It 's quite impossible ! '
Parsing [sent. 7204 len. 37]: ` Why , you see , ' said Jonas , ` her way always being to make game of people , I know she 'll laugh , or pretend to -- I know that , beforehand .
Parsing [sent. 7205 len. 16]: But you can tell her I 'm in earnest , cousin ; ca n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 7206 len. 10]: You 'll confess you know , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 7207 len. 14]: You 'll be honourable , I 'm sure , ' he added persuasively .
Parsing [sent. 7208 len. 3]: No answer .
Parsing [sent. 7209 len. 19]: His throat seemed to grow hotter and hotter , and to be more and more difficult of control .
Parsing [sent. 7210 len. 50]: ` You see , Cousin Charity , ' said Jonas , ` nobody but you can tell her what pains I took to get into her company when you were both at the boarding-house in the city , because nobody 's so well aware of it , you know .
Parsing [sent. 7211 len. 34]: Nobody else can tell her how hard I tried to get to know you better , in order that I might get to know her without seeming to wish it ; can they ?
Parsing [sent. 7212 len. 36]: I always asked you about her , and said where had she gone , and when would she come , and how lively she was , and all that ; did n't I , cousin ?
Parsing [sent. 7213 len. 40]: I know you 'll tell her so , if you have n't told her so already , and -- and -- I dare say you have , because I 'm sure you 're honourable , ai n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 7214 len. 5]: Still not a word .
Parsing [sent. 7215 len. 43]: The right arm of Mr Jonas -- the elder sister sat upon his right -- may have been sensible of some tumultuous throbbing which was not within itself ; but nothing else apprised him that his words had had the least effect .
Parsing [sent. 7216 len. 38]: ` Even if you kept it to yourself , and have n't told her , ' resumed Jonas , ` it do n't much matter , because you 'll bear honest witness now ; wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 7217 len. 14]: We 've been very good friends from the first ; have n't we ?
Parsing [sent. 7218 len. 23]: and of course we shall be quite friends in future , and so I do n't mind speaking before you a bit .
Parsing [sent. 7219 len. 12]: Cousin Mercy , you 've heard what I 've been saying .
Parsing [sent. 7220 len. 11]: She 'll confirm it , every word ; she must .
Parsing [sent. 7221 len. 8]: Will you have me for your husband ?
Parsing [sent. 7222 len. 3]: Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 7223 len. 55]: As he released his hold of Charity , to put this question with better effect , she started up and hurried away to her own room , marking her progress as she went by such a train of passionate and incoherent sound , as nothing but a slighted woman in her anger could produce .
Parsing [sent. 7224 len. 6]: ` Let me go away .
Parsing [sent. 7225 len. 33]: Let me go after her , ' said Merry , pushing him off , and giving him -- to tell the truth -- more than one sounding slap upon his outstretched face .
Parsing [sent. 7226 len. 7]: ` Not till you say yes .
Parsing [sent. 7227 len. 6]: You have n't told me .
Parsing [sent. 7228 len. 9]: Will you have me for your husband ? '
Parsing [sent. 7229 len. 7]: ` No , I wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 7230 len. 9]: I ca n't bear the sight of you .
Parsing [sent. 7231 len. 9]: I have told you so a hundred times .
Parsing [sent. 7232 len. 5]: You are a fright .
Parsing [sent. 7233 len. 11]: Besides , I always thought you liked my sister best .
Parsing [sent. 7234 len. 6]: We all thought so . '
Parsing [sent. 7235 len. 12]: ` But that was n't my fault , ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 7236 len. 11]: ` Yes it was ; you know it was . '
Parsing [sent. 7237 len. 12]: ` Any trick is fair in love , ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 7238 len. 17]: ` She may have thought I liked her best , but you did n't . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7239 len. 4]: I did ! '
Parsing [sent. 7240 len. 7]: ` No , you did n't .
Parsing [sent. 7241 len. 16]: You never could have thought I liked her best , when you were by . '
Parsing [sent. 7242 len. 23]: ` There 's no accounting for tastes , ' said Merry ; ` at least I did n't mean to say that .
Parsing [sent. 7243 len. 8]: I do n't know what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 7244 len. 7]: Let me go to her . '
Parsing [sent. 7245 len. 12]: ` Say `` Yes , '' and then I will . '
Parsing [sent. 7246 len. 26]: ` If I ever brought myself to say so , it should only be that I might hate and tease you all my life . '
Parsing [sent. 7247 len. 17]: ` That 's as good , ' cried Jonas , ` as saying it right out .
Parsing [sent. 7248 len. 7]: It 's a bargain , cousin .
Parsing [sent. 7249 len. 12]: We 're a pair , if ever there was one . '
Parsing [sent. 7250 len. 34]: This gallant speech was succeeded by a confused noise of kissing and slapping ; and then the fair but much dishevelled Merry broke away , and followed in the footsteps of her sister .
Parsing [sent. 7251 len. 101]: Now whether Mr Pecksniff had been listening -- which in one of his character appears impossible ; or divined almost by inspiration what the matter was -- which , in a man of his sagacity is far more probable ; or happened by sheer good fortune to find himself in exactly the right place , at precisely the right time -- which , under the special guardianship in which he lived might very reasonably happen ; it is quite certain that at the moment when the sisters came together in their own room , he appeared at the chamber door .
Parsing [sent. 7252 len. 40]: And a marvellous contrast it was -- they so heated , noisy , and vehement ; he so calm , so self-possessed , so cool and full of peace , that not a hair upon his head was stirred .
Parsing [sent. 7253 len. 4]: ` Children ! '
Parsing [sent. 7254 len. 27]: said Mr Pecksniff , spreading out his hands in wonder , but not before he had shut the door , and set his back against it .
Parsing [sent. 7255 len. 3]: ` Girls !
Parsing [sent. 7256 len. 2]: Daughters !
Parsing [sent. 7257 len. 5]: What is this ? '
Parsing [sent. 7258 len. 25]: ` The wretch ; the apostate ; the false , mean , odious villain ; has before my very face proposed to Mercy ! '
Parsing [sent. 7259 len. 7]: was his eldest daughter 's answer .
Parsing [sent. 7260 len. 8]: ` Who has proposed to Mercy ! '
Parsing [sent. 7261 len. 4]: asked Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 7262 len. 4]: ` HE has .
Parsing [sent. 7263 len. 8]: That thing , Jonas , downstairs . '
Parsing [sent. 7264 len. 7]: ` Jonas proposed to Mercy ? '
Parsing [sent. 7265 len. 4]: said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 7266 len. 5]: ` Aye , aye !
Parsing [sent. 7267 len. 3]: Indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 7268 len. 9]: ` Have you nothing else to say ? '
Parsing [sent. 7269 len. 3]: cried Charity .
Parsing [sent. 7270 len. 10]: ` Am I to be driven mad , papa ?
Parsing [sent. 7271 len. 11]: He has proposed to Mercy , not to me . '
Parsing [sent. 7272 len. 5]: ` Oh , fie !
Parsing [sent. 7273 len. 4]: For shame ! '
Parsing [sent. 7274 len. 6]: said Mr Pecksniff , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 7275 len. 6]: ` Oh , for shame !
Parsing [sent. 7276 len. 16]: Can the triumph of a sister move you to this terrible display , my child ?
Parsing [sent. 7277 len. 8]: Oh , really this is very sad !
Parsing [sent. 7278 len. 14]: I am sorry ; I am surprised and hurt to see you so .
Parsing [sent. 7279 len. 8]: Mercy , my girl , bless you !
Parsing [sent. 7280 len. 4]: See to her .
Parsing [sent. 7281 len. 13]: Ah , envy , envy , what a passion you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 7282 len. 35]: Uttering this apostrophe in a tone full of grief and lamentation , Mr Pecksniff left the room -LRB- taking care to shut the door behind him -RRB- , and walked downstairs into the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 7283 len. 14]: There he found his intended son-in-law , whom he seized by both hands .
Parsing [sent. 7284 len. 4]: ` Jonas ! '
Parsing [sent. 7285 len. 4]: cried Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 7286 len. 3]: ` Jonas !
Parsing [sent. 7287 len. 11]: the dearest wish of my heart is now fulfilled ! '
Parsing [sent. 7288 len. 15]: ` Very well ; I 'm glad to hear it , ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 7289 len. 5]: ` That 'll do .
Parsing [sent. 7290 len. 3]: I say !
Parsing [sent. 7291 len. 22]: As it ai n't the one you 're so fond of , you must come down with another thousand , Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 7292 len. 7]: You must make it up five .
Parsing [sent. 7293 len. 15]: It 's worth that , to keep your treasure to yourself , you know .
Parsing [sent. 7294 len. 17]: You get off very cheap that way , and have n't a sacrifice to make . '
Parsing [sent. 7295 len. 48]: The grin with which he accompanied this , set off his other attractions to such unspeakable advantage , that even Mr Pecksniff lost his presence of mind for a moment , and looked at the young man as if he were quite stupefied with wonder and admiration .
Parsing [sent. 7296 len. 43]: But he quickly regained his composure , and was in the very act of changing the subject , when a hasty step was heard without , and Tom Pinch , in a state of great excitement , came darting into the room .
Parsing [sent. 7297 len. 46]: On seeing a stranger there , apparently engaged with Mr Pecksniff in private conversation , Tom was very much abashed , though he still looked as if he had something of great importance to communicate , which would be a sufficient apology for his intrusion .
Parsing [sent. 7298 len. 14]: ` Mr Pinch , ' said Pecksniff , ` this is hardly decent .
Parsing [sent. 7299 len. 18]: You will excuse my saying that I think your conduct scarcely decent , Mr Pinch . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7300 len. 20]: I beg your pardon , sir , ' replied Tom , ` for not knocking at the door . '
Parsing [sent. 7301 len. 16]: ` Rather beg this gentleman 's pardon , Mr Pinch , ' said Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 7302 len. 8]: I know you ; he does not .
Parsing [sent. 7303 len. 9]: -- My young man , Mr Jonas . '
Parsing [sent. 7304 len. 29]: The son-in-law that was to be gave him a slight nod -- not actively disdainful or contemptuous , only passively ; for he was in a good humour .
Parsing [sent. 7305 len. 16]: ` Could I speak a word with you , sir , if you please ? '
Parsing [sent. 7306 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 7307 len. 7]: ` It 's rather pressing . '
Parsing [sent. 7308 len. 20]: ` It should be very pressing to justify this strange behaviour , Mr Pinch , ' returned his master .
Parsing [sent. 7309 len. 11]: ` Excuse me for one moment , my dear friend .
Parsing [sent. 7310 len. 15]: Now , sir , what is the reason of this rough intrusion ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7311 len. 53]: I am very sorry , sir , I am sure , ' said Tom , standing , cap in hand , before his patron in the passage ; ` and I know it must have a very rude appearance -- ' ` It HAS a very rude appearance , Mr Pinch . '
Parsing [sent. 7312 len. 54]: ` Yes , I feel that , sir ; but the truth is , I was so surprised to see them , and knew you would be too , that I ran home very fast indeed , and really had n't enough command over myself to know what I was doing very well .
Parsing [sent. 7313 len. 37]: I was in the church just now , sir , touching the organ for my own amusement , when I happened to look round , and saw a gentleman and lady standing in the aisle listening .
Parsing [sent. 7314 len. 50]: They seemed to be strangers , sir , as well as I could make out in the dusk ; and I thought I did n't know them ; so presently I left off , and said , would they walk up into the organ-loft , or take a seat ?
Parsing [sent. 7315 len. 22]: No , they said , they would n't do that ; but they thanked me for the music they had heard .
Parsing [sent. 7316 len. 18]: In fact , ' observed Tom , blushing , ` they said , `` Delicious music ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7317 len. 27]: at least , SHE did ; and I am sure that was a greater pleasure and honour to me than any compliment I could have had .
Parsing [sent. 7318 len. 45]: I -- I -- beg your pardon sir ; ' he was all in a tremble , and dropped his hat for the second time ` but I -- I 'm rather flurried , and I fear I 've wandered from the point . '
Parsing [sent. 7319 len. 28]: ` If you will come back to it , Thomas , ' said Mr Pecksniff , with an icy look , ' I shall feel obliged . '
Parsing [sent. 7320 len. 12]: ` Yes , sir , ' returned Tom , ` certainly .
Parsing [sent. 7321 len. 22]: They had a posting carriage at the porch , sir , and had stopped to hear the organ , they said .
Parsing [sent. 7322 len. 23]: And then they said -- SHE said , I mean , `` I believe you live with Mr Pecksniff , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7323 len. 63]: I said I had that honour , and I took the liberty , sir , ' added Tom , raising his eyes to his benefactor 's face , ` of saying , as I always will and must , with your permission , that I was under great obligations to you , and never could express my sense of them sufficiently . '
Parsing [sent. 7324 len. 15]: ` That , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` was very , very wrong .
Parsing [sent. 7325 len. 8]: Take your time , Mr Pinch . '
Parsing [sent. 7326 len. 10]: ` Thank you , sir , ' cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 7327 len. 28]: ` On that they asked me -- she asked , I mean -- `` Was n't there a bridle road to Mr Pecksniff 's house ? '' '
Parsing [sent. 7328 len. 9]: Mr Pecksniff suddenly became full of interest . '
Parsing [sent. 7329 len. 8]: `` Without going by the Dragon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7330 len. 35]: When I said there was , and said how happy I should be to show it 'em , they sent the carriage on by the road , and came with me across the meadows .
Parsing [sent. 7331 len. 48]: I left 'em at the turnstile to run forward and tell you they were coming , and they 'll be here , sir , in -- in less than a minute 's time , I should say , ' added Tom , fetching his breath with difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 7332 len. 20]: ` Now , who , ' said Mr Pecksniff , pondering , ` who may these people be ? '
Parsing [sent. 7333 len. 8]: ` Bless my soul , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 7334 len. 17]: cried Tom , ' I meant to mention that at first , I thought I had .
Parsing [sent. 7335 len. 11]: I knew them -- her , I mean -- directly .
Parsing [sent. 7336 len. 23]: The gentleman who was ill at the Dragon , sir , last winter ; and the young lady who attended him . '
Parsing [sent. 7337 len. 29]: Tom 's teeth chattered in his head , and he positively staggered with amazement , at witnessing the extraordinary effect produced on Mr Pecksniff by these simple words .
Parsing [sent. 7338 len. 205]: The dread of losing the old man 's favour almost as soon as they were reconciled , through the mere fact of having Jonas in the house ; the impossibility of dismissing Jonas , or shutting him up , or tying him hand and foot and putting him in the coal-cellar , without offending him beyond recall ; the horrible discordance prevailing in the establishment , and the impossibility of reducing it to decent harmony with Charity in loud hysterics , Mercy in the utmost disorder , Jonas in the parlour , and Martin Chuzzlewit and his young charge upon the very doorsteps ; the total hopelessness of being able to disguise or feasibly explain this state of rampant confusion ; the sudden accumulation over his devoted head of every complicated perplexity and entanglement for his extrication from which he had trusted to time , good fortune , chance , and his own plotting , so filled the entrapped architect with dismay , that if Tom could have been a Gorgon staring at Mr Pecksniff , and Mr Pecksniff could have been a Gorgon staring at Tom , they could not have horrified each other half so much as in their own bewildered persons .
Parsing [sent. 7339 len. 6]: ` Dear , dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 7340 len. 9]: cried Tom , ` what have I done ?
Parsing [sent. 7341 len. 11]: I hoped it would be a pleasant surprise , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7342 len. 9]: I thought you would like to know . '
Parsing [sent. 7343 len. 14]: But at that moment a loud knocking was heard at the hall door .
Parsing [sent. 7344 len. 18]: CHAPTER TWENTY -- ONE MORE AMERICAN EXPERIENCES , MARTIN TAKES A PARTNER , AND MAKES A PURCHASE .
Parsing [sent. 7345 len. 11]: SOME ACCOUNT OF EDEN , AS IT APPEARED ON PAPER .
Parsing [sent. 7346 len. 6]: ALSO OF THE BRITISH LION .
Parsing [sent. 7347 len. 44]: ALSO OF THE KIND OF SYMPATHY PROFESSED AND ENTERTAINED BY THE WATERTOAST ASSOCIATION OF UNITED SYMPATHISERS The knocking at Mr Pecksniff 's door , though loud enough , bore no resemblance whatever to the noise of an American railway train at full speed .
Parsing [sent. 7348 len. 67]: It may be well to begin the present chapter with this frank admission , lest the reader should imagine that the sounds now deafening this history 's ears have any connection with the knocker on Mr Pecksniff 's door , or with the great amount of agitation pretty equally divided between that worthy man and Mr Pinch , of which its strong performance was the cause .
Parsing [sent. 7349 len. 27]: Mr Pecksniff 's house is more than a thousand leagues away ; and again this happy chronicle has Liberty and Moral Sensibility for its high companions .
Parsing [sent. 7350 len. 47]: Again it breathes the blessed air of Independence ; again it contemplates with pious awe that moral sense which renders unto Ceasar nothing that is his ; again inhales that sacred atmosphere which was the life of him -- oh noble patriot , with many followers !
Parsing [sent. 7351 len. 23]: -- who dreamed of Freedom in a slave 's embrace , and waking sold her offspring and his own in public markets .
Parsing [sent. 7352 len. 18]: How the wheels clank and rattle , and the tram-road shakes , as the train rushes on !
Parsing [sent. 7353 len. 22]: And now the engine yells , as it were lashed and tortured like a living labourer , and writhed in agony .
Parsing [sent. 7354 len. 23]: A poor fancy ; for steel and iron are of infinitely greater account , in this commonwealth , than flesh and blood .
Parsing [sent. 7355 len. 58]: If the cunning work of man be urged beyond its power of endurance , it has within it the elements of its own revenge ; whereas the wretched mechanism of the Divine Hand is dangerous with no such property , but may be tampered with , and crushed , and broken , at the driver 's pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 7356 len. 5]: Look at that engine !
Parsing [sent. 7357 len. 42]: It shall cost a man more dollars in the way of penalty and fine , and satisfaction of the outraged law , to deface in wantonness that senseless mass of metal , than to take the lives of twenty human creatures !
Parsing [sent. 7358 len. 31]: Thus the stars wink upon the bloody stripes ; and Liberty pulls down her cap upon her eyes , and owns Oppression in its vilest aspect , for her sister .
Parsing [sent. 7359 len. 39]: The engine-driver of the train whose noise awoke us to the present chapter was certainly troubled with no such reflections as these ; nor is it very probable that his mind was disturbed by any reflections at all .
Parsing [sent. 7360 len. 105]: He leaned with folded arms and crossed legs against the side of the carriage , smoking ; and , except when he expressed , by a grunt as short as his pipe , his approval of some particularly dexterous aim on the part of his colleague , the fireman , who beguiled his leisure by throwing logs of wood from the tender at the numerous stray cattle on the line , he preserved a composure so immovable , and an indifference so complete , that if the locomotive had been a sucking-pig , he could not have been more perfectly indifferent to its doings .
Parsing [sent. 7361 len. 47]: Notwithstanding the tranquil state of this officer , and his unbroken peace of mind , the train was proceeding with tolerable rapidity ; and the rails being but poorly laid , the jolts and bumps it met with in its progress were neither slight nor few .
Parsing [sent. 7362 len. 9]: There were three great caravans or cars attached .
Parsing [sent. 7363 len. 29]: The ladies ' car , the gentlemen 's car , and the car for negroes ; the latter painted black , as an appropriate compliment to its company .
Parsing [sent. 7364 len. 42]: Martin and Mark Tapley were in the first , as it was the most comfortable ; and , being far from full , received other gentlemen who , like them , were unblessed by the society of ladies of their own .
Parsing [sent. 7365 len. 14]: They were seated side by side , and were engaged in earnest conversation .
Parsing [sent. 7366 len. 37]: ` And so , Mark , ' said Martin , looking at him with an anxious expression , ` and so you are glad we have left New York far behind us , are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 7367 len. 10]: ` Yes , sir , ' said Mark . '
Parsing [sent. 7368 len. 3]: I am .
Parsing [sent. 7369 len. 4]: Precious glad . '
Parsing [sent. 7370 len. 10]: ` Were you not `` jolly '' there ? '
Parsing [sent. 7371 len. 3]: asked Martin .
Parsing [sent. 7372 len. 11]: ` On the contrairy , sir , ' returned Mark .
Parsing [sent. 7373 len. 21]: ` The jolliest week as ever I spent in my life , was that there week at Pawkins 's . '
Parsing [sent. 7374 len. 10]: ` What do you think of our prospects ? '
Parsing [sent. 7375 len. 18]: inquired Martin , with an air that plainly said he had avoided the question for some time .
Parsing [sent. 7376 len. 10]: ` Uncommon bright , sir , ' returned Mark .
Parsing [sent. 7377 len. 19]: ` Impossible for a place to have a better name , sir , than the Walley of Eden .
Parsing [sent. 7378 len. 17]: No man could n't think of settling in a better place than the Walley of Eden .
Parsing [sent. 7379 len. 36]: And I 'm told , ' added Mark , after a pause , ` as there 's lots of serpents there , so we shall come out , quite complete and reg ` lar . '
Parsing [sent. 7380 len. 63]: So far from dwelling upon this agreeable piece of information with the least dismay , Mark 's face grew radiant as he called it to mind ; so very radiant , that a stranger might have supposed he had all his life been yearning for the society of serpents , and now hailed with delight the approaching consummation of his fondest wishes .
Parsing [sent. 7381 len. 7]: ` Who told you that ? '
Parsing [sent. 7382 len. 6]: asked Martin , sternly . '
Parsing [sent. 7383 len. 8]: A military officer , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 7384 len. 9]: ` Confound you for a ridiculous fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 7385 len. 10]: cried Martin , laughing heartily in spite of himself .
Parsing [sent. 7386 len. 5]: ` What military officer ?
Parsing [sent. 7387 len. 10]: You know they spring up in every field . '
Parsing [sent. 7388 len. 34]: ` As thick as scarecrows in England , sir , ' interposed Mark , ` which is a sort of milita themselves , being entirely coat and wescoat , with a stick inside .
Parsing [sent. 7389 len. 4]: Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 7390 len. 14]: -- Do n't mind me , sir ; it 's my way sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 7391 len. 7]: I ca n't help being jolly .
Parsing [sent. 7392 len. 16]: Why it was one of them inwading conquerors at Pawkins 's , as told me .
Parsing [sent. 7393 len. 43]: `` Am I rightly informed , '' he says -- not exactly through his nose , but as if he 'd got a stoppage in it , very high up -- `` that you 're a-going to the Walley of Eden ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7394 len. 13]: `` I heard some talk on it , '' I told him .
Parsing [sent. 7395 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7396 len. 45]: says he , `` if you should ever happen to go to bed there -- you MAY , you know , '' he says , `` in course of time as civilisation progresses -- do n't forget to take a axe with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7397 len. 7]: I looks at him tolerable hard .
Parsing [sent. 7398 len. 4]: `` Fleas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7399 len. 10]: says I. `` And more , '' says he .
Parsing [sent. 7400 len. 4]: `` Wampires ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7401 len. 10]: says I. `` And more , '' says he .
Parsing [sent. 7402 len. 6]: `` Musquitoes , perhaps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7403 len. 10]: says I. `` And more , '' says he .
Parsing [sent. 7404 len. 5]: `` What more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7405 len. 13]: says I. `` Snakes more , '' says he ; `` rattle-snakes .
Parsing [sent. 7406 len. 10]: You 're right to a certain extent , stranger .
Parsing [sent. 7407 len. 29]: There air some catawampous chawers in the small way too , as graze upon a human pretty strong ; but do n't mind THEM -- they 're company .
Parsing [sent. 7408 len. 60]: It 's snakes , '' he says , `` as you 'll object to ; and whenever you wake and see one in a upright poster on your bed , '' he says , `` like a corkscrew with the handle off a-sittin ' on its bottom ring , cut him down , for he means wenom . '' '
Parsing [sent. 7409 len. 11]: ` Why did n't you tell me this before ! '
Parsing [sent. 7410 len. 22]: cried Martin , with an expression of face which set off the cheerfulness of Mark 's visage to great advantage . '
Parsing [sent. 7411 len. 12]: I never thought on it , sir , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 7412 len. 15]: ` It come in at one ear , and went out at the other .
Parsing [sent. 7413 len. 49]: But Lord love us , he was one of another Company , I dare say , and only made up the story that we might go to his Eden , and not the opposition one ' ` There 's some probability in that , ' observed Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 7414 len. 15]: I can honestly say that I hope so , with all my heart . '
Parsing [sent. 7415 len. 53]: ` I 've not a doubt about it , sir , ' returned Mark , who , full of the inspiriting influence of the anecodote upon himself , had for the moment forgotten its probable effect upon his master ; ` anyhow , we must live , you know , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 7416 len. 4]: ` Live ! '
Parsing [sent. 7417 len. 3]: cried Martin .
Parsing [sent. 7418 len. 40]: ` Yes , it 's easy to say live ; but if we should happen not to wake when rattlesnakes are making corkscrews of themselves upon our beds , it may be not so easy to do it . '
Parsing [sent. 7419 len. 21]: ` And that 's a fact , ' said a voice so close in his ear that it tickled him .
Parsing [sent. 7420 len. 7]: ` That 's dreadful true . '
Parsing [sent. 7421 len. 45]: Martin looked round , and found that a gentleman , on the seat behind , had thrust his head between himself and Mark , and sat with his chin resting on the back rail of their little bench , entertaining himself with their conversation .
Parsing [sent. 7422 len. 51]: He was as languid and listless in his looks as most of the gentlemen they had seen ; his cheeks were so hollow that he seemed to be always sucking them in ; and the sun had burnt him , not a wholesome red or brown , but dirty yellow .
Parsing [sent. 7423 len. 48]: He had bright dark eyes , which he kept half closed ; only peeping out of the corners , and even then with a glance that seemed to say , ` Now you wo n't overreach me ; you want to , but you wo n't . '
Parsing [sent. 7424 len. 42]: His arms rested carelessly on his knees as he leant forward ; in the palm of his left hand , as English rustics have their slice of cheese , he had a cake of tobacco ; in his right a penknife .
Parsing [sent. 7425 len. 72]: He struck into the dialogue with as little reserve as if he had been specially called in , days before , to hear the arguments on both sides , and favour them with his opinion ; and he no more contemplated or cared for the possibility of their not desiring the honour of his acquaintance or interference in their private affairs than if he had been a bear or a buffalo .
Parsing [sent. 7426 len. 25]: ` That , ' he repeated , nodding condescendingly to Martin , as to an outer barbarian and foreigner , ` is dreadful true .
Parsing [sent. 7427 len. 7]: Darn all manner of vermin . '
Parsing [sent. 7428 len. 26]: Martin could not help frowning for a moment , as if he were disposed to insinuate that the gentleman had unconsciously ` darned ' himself .
Parsing [sent. 7429 len. 27]: But remembering the wisdom of doing at Rome as Romans do , he smiled with the pleasantest expression he could assume upon so short a notice .
Parsing [sent. 7430 len. 32]: Their new friend said no more just then , being busily employed in cutting a quid or plug from his cake of tobacco , and whistling softly to himself the while .
Parsing [sent. 7431 len. 56]: When he had shaped it to his liking , he took out his old plug , and deposited the same on the back of the seat between Mark and Martin , while he thrust the new one into the hollow of his cheek , where it looked like a large walnut , or tolerable pippin .
Parsing [sent. 7432 len. 48]: Finding it quite satisfactory , he stuck the point of his knife into the old plug , and holding it out for their inspection , remarked with the air of a man who had not lived in vain , that it was ` used up considerable . '
Parsing [sent. 7433 len. 49]: Then he tossed it away ; put his knife into one pocket and his tobacco into another ; rested his chin upon the rail as before ; and approving of the pattern on Martin 's waistcoat , reached out his hand to feel the texture of that garment .
Parsing [sent. 7434 len. 9]: ` What do you call this now ? '
Parsing [sent. 7435 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 7436 len. 19]: ` Upon my word ' said Martin , ' I do n't know what it 's called . '
Parsing [sent. 7437 len. 16]: ` It 'll cost a dollar or more a yard , I reckon ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7438 len. 7]: I really do n't know . '
Parsing [sent. 7439 len. 21]: ` In my country , ' said the gentleman , ` we know the cost of our own pro-duce . '
Parsing [sent. 7440 len. 11]: Martin not discussing the question , there was a pause .
Parsing [sent. 7441 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 7442 len. 31]: resumed their new friend , after staring at them intently during the whole interval of silence ; ` how 's the unnat ` ral old parent by this time ? '
Parsing [sent. 7443 len. 22]: Mr Tapley regarding this inquiry as only another version of the impertinent English question , ` How 's your mother ? '
Parsing [sent. 7444 len. 13]: would have resented it instantly , but for Martin 's prompt interposition .
Parsing [sent. 7445 len. 8]: ` You mean the old country ? '
Parsing [sent. 7446 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 7447 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 7448 len. 4]: was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 7449 len. 5]: ` How 's she ?
Parsing [sent. 7450 len. 11]: Progressing back ` ards , I expect , as usual ?
Parsing [sent. 7451 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 7452 len. 6]: How 's Queen Victoria ? '
Parsing [sent. 7453 len. 12]: ` In good health , I believe , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 7454 len. 28]: ` Queen Victoria wo n't shake in her royal shoes at all , when she hears to-morrow named , ' observed the stranger , ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 7455 len. 8]: ` Not that I am aware of .
Parsing [sent. 7456 len. 5]: Why should she ? '
Parsing [sent. 7457 len. 27]: ` She wo n't be taken with a cold chill , when she realises what is being done in these diggings , ' said the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 7458 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 7459 len. 8]: ` No , ' said Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 7460 len. 11]: I think I could take my oath of that . '
Parsing [sent. 7461 len. 88]: The strange gentleman looked at him as if in pity for his ignorance or prejudice , and said : ` Well , sir , I tell you this -- there ai n't a engine with its biler bust , in God A'mighty 's free U-nited States , so fixed , and nipped , and frizzled to a most e-tarnal smash , as that young critter , in her luxurious location in the Tower of London will be , when she reads the next double-extra Watertoast Gazette . '
Parsing [sent. 7462 len. 15]: Several other gentlemen had left their seats and gathered round during the foregoing dialogue .
Parsing [sent. 7463 len. 8]: They were highly delighted with this speech .
Parsing [sent. 7464 len. 37]: One very lank gentleman , in a loose limp white cravat , long white waistcoat , and a black great-coat , who seemed to be in authority among them , felt called upon to acknowledge it .
Parsing [sent. 7465 len. 3]: ` Hem !
Parsing [sent. 7466 len. 14]: Mr La Fayette Kettle , ' he said , taking off his hat .
Parsing [sent. 7467 len. 10]: There was a grave murmur of ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 7468 len. 6]: ` Mr La Fayette Kettle !
Parsing [sent. 7469 len. 3]: Sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 7470 len. 4]: Mr Kettle bowed .
Parsing [sent. 7471 len. 40]: ` In the name of this company , sir , and in the name of our common country , and in the name of that righteous cause of holy sympathy in which we are engaged , I thank you .
Parsing [sent. 7472 len. 56]: I thank you , sir , in the name of the Watertoast Sympathisers ; and I thank you , sir , in the name of the Watertoast Gazette ; and I thank you , sir , in the name of the star-spangled banner of the Great United States , for your eloquent and categorical exposition .
Parsing [sent. 7473 len. 126]: And if , sir , ' said the speaker , poking Martin with the handle of his umbrella to bespeak his attention , for he was listening to a whisper from Mark ; ` if , sir , in such a place , and at such a time , I might venture to con-clude with a sentiment , glancing -- however slantin ` dicularly -- at the subject in hand , I would say , sir , may the British Lion have his talons eradicated by the noble bill of the American Eagle , and be taught to play upon the Irish Harp and the Scotch Fiddle that music which is breathed in every empty shell that lies upon the shores of green Co-lumbia ! '
Parsing [sent. 7474 len. 20]: Here the lank gentleman sat down again , amidst a great sensation ; and every one looked very grave .
Parsing [sent. 7475 len. 24]: ` General Choke , ' said Mr La Fayette Kettle , ` you warm my heart ; sir , you warm my heart .
Parsing [sent. 7476 len. 25]: But the British Lion is not unrepresented here , sir ; and I should be glad to hear his answer to those remarks . '
Parsing [sent. 7477 len. 53]: ` Upon my word , ' cried Martin , laughing , ` since you do me the honour to consider me his representative , I have only to say that I never heard of Queen Victoria reading the What 's - his-name Gazette and that I should scarcely think it probable . '
Parsing [sent. 7478 len. 25]: General Choke smiled upon the rest , and said , in patient and benignant explanation : ` It is sent to her , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7479 len. 6]: It is sent to her .
Parsing [sent. 7480 len. 4]: Her mail . '
Parsing [sent. 7481 len. 35]: ` But if it is addressed to the Tower of London , it would hardly come to hand , I fear , ' returned Martin ; ` for she do n't live there . '
Parsing [sent. 7482 len. 39]: ` The Queen of England , gentlemen , ' observed Mr Tapley , affecting the greatest politeness , and regarding them with an immovable face , ` usually lives in the Mint to take care of the money .
Parsing [sent. 7483 len. 35]: She HAS lodgings , in virtue of her office , with the Lord Mayor at the Mansion House ; but do n't often occupy them , in consequence of the parlour chimney smoking . '
Parsing [sent. 7484 len. 37]: ` Mark , ' said Martin , ' I shall be very much obliged to you if you 'll have the goodness not to interfere with preposterous statements , however jocose they may appear to you .
Parsing [sent. 7485 len. 33]: I was merely remarking gentlemen -- though it 's a point of very little import -- that the Queen of England does not happen to live in the Tower of London . '
Parsing [sent. 7486 len. 4]: ` General ! '
Parsing [sent. 7487 len. 6]: cried Mr La Fayette Kettle .
Parsing [sent. 7488 len. 5]: ` You hear ? '
Parsing [sent. 7489 len. 4]: ` General ! '
Parsing [sent. 7490 len. 4]: echoed several others .
Parsing [sent. 7491 len. 4]: ` General ! '
Parsing [sent. 7492 len. 3]: ` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 7493 len. 5]: Pray , silence ! '
Parsing [sent. 7494 len. 23]: said General Choke , holding up his hand , and speaking with a patient and complacent benevolence that was quite touching . '
Parsing [sent. 7495 len. 74]: I have always remarked it as a very extraordinary circumstance , which I impute to the natur ' of British Institutions and their tendency to suppress that popular inquiry and information which air so widely diffused even in the trackless forests of this vast Continent of the Western Ocean ; that the knowledge of Britishers themselves on such points is not to be compared with that possessed by our intelligent and locomotive citizens .
Parsing [sent. 7496 len. 9]: This is interesting , and confirms my observation .
Parsing [sent. 7497 len. 52]: When you say , sir , ' he continued , addressing Martin , ` that your Queen does not reside in the Tower of London , you fall into an error , not uncommon to your countrymen , even when their abilities and moral elements air such as to command respect .
Parsing [sent. 7498 len. 8]: But , sir , you air wrong .
Parsing [sent. 7499 len. 22]: She DOES live there -- ' ` When she is at the Court of Saint James 's , ' interposed Kettle .
Parsing [sent. 7500 len. 46]: ` When she is at the Court of Saint James 's , of course , ' returned the General , in the same benignant way ; ` for if her location was in Windsor Pavilion it could n't be in London at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 7501 len. 30]: Your Tower of London , sir , ' pursued the General , smiling with a mild consciousness of his knowledge , ` is nat ` rally your royal residence .
Parsing [sent. 7502 len. 42]: Being located in the immediate neighbourhood of your Parks , your Drives , your Triumphant Arches , your Opera , and your Royal Almacks , it nat ` rally suggests itself as the place for holding a luxurious and thoughtless court .
Parsing [sent. 7503 len. 19]: And , consequently , ' said the General , ` consequently , the court is held there . '
Parsing [sent. 7504 len. 8]: ` Have you been in England ? '
Parsing [sent. 7505 len. 3]: asked Martin .
Parsing [sent. 7506 len. 17]: ` In print I have , sir , ' said the General , ` not otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 7507 len. 9]: We air a reading people here , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7508 len. 17]: You will meet with much information among us that will surprise you , sir . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7509 len. 13]: I have not the least doubt of it , ' returned Martin .
Parsing [sent. 7510 len. 24]: But here he was interrupted by Mr La Fayette Kettle , who whispered in his ear : ` You know General Choke ? '
Parsing [sent. 7511 len. 12]: ` No , ' returned Martin , in the same tone .
Parsing [sent. 7512 len. 9]: ` You know what he is considered ? '
Parsing [sent. 7513 len. 12]: ` One of the most remarkable men in the country ? '
Parsing [sent. 7514 len. 7]: said Martin , at a venture .
Parsing [sent. 7515 len. 11]: ` That 's a fact , ' rejoined Kettle . '
Parsing [sent. 7516 len. 12]: I was sure you must have heard of him ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 7517 len. 34]: I think , ' said Martin , addressing himself to the General again , ` that I have the pleasure of being the bearer of a letter of introduction to you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7518 len. 16]: From Mr Bevan , of Massachusetts , ' he added , giving it to him .
Parsing [sent. 7519 len. 20]: The General took it and read it attentively ; now and then stopping to glance at the two strangers .
Parsing [sent. 7520 len. 22]: When he had finished the note , he came over to Martin , sat down by him , and shook hands .
Parsing [sent. 7521 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 7522 len. 13]: he said , ` and you think of settling in Eden ? '
Parsing [sent. 7523 len. 17]: ` Subject to your opinion , and the agent 's advice , ' replied Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 7524 len. 16]: I am told there is nothing to be done in the old towns . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7525 len. 16]: I can introduce you to the agent , sir , ' said the General . '
Parsing [sent. 7526 len. 4]: I know him .
Parsing [sent. 7527 len. 15]: In fact , I am a member of the Eden Land Corporation myself . '
Parsing [sent. 7528 len. 41]: This was serious news to Martin , for his friend had laid great stress upon the General 's having no connection , as he thought , with any land company , and therefore being likely to give him disinterested advice .
Parsing [sent. 7529 len. 28]: The General explained that he had joined the Corporation only a few weeks ago , and that no communication had passed between himself and Mr Bevan since .
Parsing [sent. 7530 len. 25]: ` We have very little to venture , ' said Martin anxiously -- ` only a few pounds -- but it is our all .
Parsing [sent. 7531 len. 26]: Now , do you think that for one of my profession , this would be a speculation with any hope or chance in it ? '
Parsing [sent. 7532 len. 36]: ` Well , ' observed the General , gravely , ` if there was n't any hope or chance in the speculation , it would n't have engaged my dollars , I opinionate . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7533 len. 12]: I do n't mean for the sellers , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 7534 len. 10]: ` For the buyers -- for the buyers ! '
Parsing [sent. 7535 len. 8]: ` For the buyers , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 7536 len. 10]: observed the General , in a most impressive manner .
Parsing [sent. 7537 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 7538 len. 30]: you come from an old country ; from a country , sir , that has piled up golden calves as high as Babel , and worshipped 'em for ages .
Parsing [sent. 7539 len. 56]: We are a new country , sir ; man is in a more primeval state here , sir ; we have not the excuse of having lapsed in the slow course of time into degenerate practices ; we have no false gods ; man , sir , here , is man in all his dignity .
Parsing [sent. 7540 len. 7]: We fought for that or nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7541 len. 54]: Here am I , sir , ' said the General , setting up his umbrella to represent himself , and a villanous-looking umbrella it was ; a very bad counter to stand for the sterling coin of his benevolence , ` here am I with grey hairs sir , and a moral sense .
Parsing [sent. 7542 len. 29]: Would I , with my principles , invest capital in this speculation if I did n't think it full of hopes and chances for my brother man ? '
Parsing [sent. 7543 len. 18]: Martin tried to look convinced , but he thought of New York , and found it difficult .
Parsing [sent. 7544 len. 24]: ` What are the Great United States for , sir , ' pursued the General ` if not for the regeneration of man ?
Parsing [sent. 7545 len. 29]: But it is nat ` ral in you to make such an enquerry , for you come from England , and you do not know my country . '
Parsing [sent. 7546 len. 43]: ` Then you think , ' said Martin , ` that allowing for the hardships we are prepared to undergo , there is a reasonable -- Heaven knows we do n't expect much -- a reasonable opening in this place ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7547 len. 8]: A reasonable opening in Eden , sir !
Parsing [sent. 7548 len. 33]: But see the agent , see the agent ; see the maps and plans , sir ; and conclude to go or stay , according to the natur ' of the settlement .
Parsing [sent. 7549 len. 16]: Eden had n't need to go a-begging yet , sir , ' remarked the General .
Parsing [sent. 7550 len. 10]: ` It is an awful lovely place , sure-ly .
Parsing [sent. 7551 len. 7]: And frightful wholesome , likewise ! '
Parsing [sent. 7552 len. 19]: said Mr Kettle , who had made himself a party to this conversation as a matter of course .
Parsing [sent. 7553 len. 29]: Martin felt that to dispute such testimony , for no better reason than because he had his secret misgivings on the subject , would be ungentlemanly and indecent .
Parsing [sent. 7554 len. 29]: So he thanked the General for his promise to put him in personal communication with the agent ; and ` concluded ' to see that officer next morning .
Parsing [sent. 7555 len. 35]: He then begged the General to inform him who the Watertoast Sympathisers were , of whom he had spoken in addressing Mr La Fayette Kettle , and on what grievances they bestowed their Sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 7556 len. 67]: To which the General , looking very serious , made answer , that he might fully enlighten himself on those points to-morrow by attending a Great Meeting of the Body , which would then be held at the town to which they were travelling ; ` over which , sir , ' said the General , ` my fellow-citizens have called on me to preside . '
Parsing [sent. 7557 len. 12]: They came to their journey 's end late in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 7558 len. 24]: Close to the railway was an immense white edifice , like an ugly hospital , on which was painted ` NATIONAL HOTEL . '
Parsing [sent. 7559 len. 50]: There was a wooden gallery or verandah in front , in which it was rather startling , when the train stopped , to behold a great many pairs of boots and shoes , and the smoke of a great many cigars , but no other evidences of human habitation .
Parsing [sent. 7560 len. 64]: By slow degrees , however , some heads and shoulders appeared , and connecting themselves with the boots and shoes , led to the discovery that certain gentlemen boarders , who had a fancy for putting their heels where the gentlemen boarders in other countries usually put their heads , were enjoying themselves after their own manner in the cool of the evening .
Parsing [sent. 7561 len. 26]: There was a great bar-room in this hotel , and a great public room in which the general table was being set out for supper .
Parsing [sent. 7562 len. 50]: There were interminable whitewashed staircases , long whitewashed galleries upstairs and downstairs , scores of little whitewashed bedrooms , and a four-sided verandah to every story in the house , which formed a large brick square with an uncomfortable courtyard in the centre , where some clothes were drying .
Parsing [sent. 7563 len. 82]: Here and there , some yawning gentlemen lounged up and down with their hands in their pockets ; but within the house and without , wherever half a dozen people were collected together , there , in their looks , dress , morals , manners , habits , intellect , and conversation , were Mr Jefferson Brick , Colonel Diver , Major Pawkins , General Choke , and Mr La Fayette Kettle , over , and over , and over again .
Parsing [sent. 7564 len. 26]: They did the same things ; said the same things ; judged all subjects by , and reduced all subjects to , the same standard .
Parsing [sent. 7565 len. 37]: Observing how they lived , and how they were always in the enchanting company of each other , Martin even began to comprehend their being the social , cheerful , winning , airy men they were .
Parsing [sent. 7566 len. 57]: At the sounding of a dismal gong , this pleasant company went trooping down from all parts of the house to the public room ; while from the neighbouring stores other guests came flocking in , in shoals ; for half the town , married folks as well as single , resided at the National Hotel .
Parsing [sent. 7567 len. 59]: Tea , coffee , dried meats , tongue , ham , pickles , cake , toast , preserves , and bread and butter , were swallowed with the usual ravaging speed ; and then , as before , the company dropped off by degrees , and lounged away to the desk , the counter , or the bar-room .
Parsing [sent. 7568 len. 35]: The ladies had a smaller ordinary of their own , to which their husbands and brothers were admitted if they chose ; and in all other respects they enjoyed themselves as at Pawkins 's .
Parsing [sent. 7569 len. 36]: ` Now , Mark , my good fellow , said Martin , closing the door of his little chamber , ` we must hold a solemn council , for our fate is decided to-morrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 7570 len. 18]: You are determined to invest these savings of yours in the common stock , are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 7571 len. 27]: ` If I had n't been determined to make that wentur , sir , ' answered Mr Tapley , ' I should n't have come . '
Parsing [sent. 7572 len. 20]: ` How much is there here , did you say ' asked Martin , holding up a little bag .
Parsing [sent. 7573 len. 7]: ` Thirty-seven pound ten and sixpence .
Parsing [sent. 7574 len. 9]: The Savings ' Bank said so at least .
Parsing [sent. 7575 len. 5]: I never counted it .
Parsing [sent. 7576 len. 8]: But THEY know , bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 7577 len. 23]: said Mark , with a shake of the head expressive of his unbounded confidence in the wisdom and arithmetic of those Institutions .
Parsing [sent. 7578 len. 25]: ` The money we brought with us , ' said Martin , ` is reduced to a few shillings less than eight pounds . '
Parsing [sent. 7579 len. 25]: Mr Tapley smiled , and looked all manner of ways , that he might not be supposed to attach any importance to this fact .
Parsing [sent. 7580 len. 25]: ` Upon the ring -- HER ring , Mark , ' said Martin , looking ruefully at his empty finger -- ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 7581 len. 4]: sighed Mr Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 7582 len. 9]: ` Beg your pardon , sir . ' '
Parsing [sent. 7583 len. 11]: -- We raised , in English money , fourteen pounds .
Parsing [sent. 7584 len. 23]: So , even with that , your share of the stock is still very much the larger of the two you see .
Parsing [sent. 7585 len. 58]: Now , Mark , ' said Martin , in his old way , just as he might have spoken to Tom Pinch , ' I have thought of a means of making this up to you -- more than making it up to you , I hope -- and very materially elevating your prospects in life . '
Parsing [sent. 7586 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7587 len. 16]: do n't talk of that , you know , sir , ' returned Mark . '
Parsing [sent. 7588 len. 9]: I do n't want no elevating , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7589 len. 12]: I 'm all right enough , sir , I am . '
Parsing [sent. 7590 len. 27]: ` No , but hear me , ' said Martin , ` because this is very important to you , and a great satisfaction to me .
Parsing [sent. 7591 len. 17]: Mark , you shall be a partner in the business ; an equal partner with myself .
Parsing [sent. 7592 len. 35]: I will put in , as my additional capital , my professional knowledge and ability ; and half the annual profits , as long as it is carried on , shall be yours . '
Parsing [sent. 7593 len. 3]: Poor Martin !
Parsing [sent. 7594 len. 8]: For ever building castles in the air .
Parsing [sent. 7595 len. 20]: For ever , in his very selfishness , forgetful of all but his own teeming hopes and sanguine plans .
Parsing [sent. 7596 len. 18]: Swelling , at that instant , with the consciousness of patronizing and most munificently rewarding Mark ! '
Parsing [sent. 7597 len. 44]: I do n't know , sir , ' Mark rejoined , much more sadly than his custom was , though from a very different cause than Martin supposed , ` what I can say to this , in the way of thanking you .
Parsing [sent. 7598 len. 20]: I 'll stand by you , sir , to the best of my ability , and to the last .
Parsing [sent. 7599 len. 5]: That 's all . '
Parsing [sent. 7600 len. 20]: ` We quite understand each other , my good fellow , ' said Martin rising in self-approval and condescension .
Parsing [sent. 7601 len. 19]: ` We are no longer master and servant , but friends and partners ; and are mutually gratified .
Parsing [sent. 7602 len. 18]: If we determine on Eden , the business shall be commenced as soon as we get there .
Parsing [sent. 7603 len. 30]: Under the name , ' said Martin , who never hammered upon an idea that was n't red hot , ` under the name of Chuzzlewit and Tapley . '
Parsing [sent. 7604 len. 20]: ` Lord love you , sir , ' cried Mark , ` do n't have my name in it .
Parsing [sent. 7605 len. 10]: I ai n't acquainted with the business , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7606 len. 8]: I must be Co. , I must .
Parsing [sent. 7607 len. 38]: I 've often thought , ' he added , in a low voice , ` as I should like to know a Co. ; but I little thought as ever I should live to be one . '
Parsing [sent. 7608 len. 11]: ` You shall have your own way , Mark . '
Parsing [sent. 7609 len. 7]: ` Thank ` ee , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7610 len. 37]: If any country gentleman thereabouts , in the public way , or otherwise , wanted such a thing as a skittle-ground made , I could take that part of the bis ` ness , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 7611 len. 12]: ` Against any architect in the States , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 7612 len. 19]: ` Get a couple of sherry-cobblers , Mark , and we 'll drink success to the firm . '
Parsing [sent. 7613 len. 35]: Either he forgot already -LRB- and often afterwards -RRB- , that they were no longer master and servant , or considered this kind of duty to be among the legitimate functions of the Co. .
Parsing [sent. 7614 len. 49]: But Mark obeyed with his usual alacrity ; and before they parted for the night , it was agreed between them that they should go together to the agent 's in the morning , but that Martin should decide the Eden question , on his own sound judgment .
Parsing [sent. 7615 len. 34]: And Mark made no merit , even to himself in his jollity , of this concession ; perfectly well knowing that the matter would come to that in the end , any way .
Parsing [sent. 7616 len. 30]: The General was one of the party at the public table next day , and after breakfast suggested that they should wait upon the agent without loss of time .
Parsing [sent. 7617 len. 32]: They , desiring nothing more , agreed ; so off they all four started for the office of the Eden Settlement , which was almost within rifle-shot of the National Hotel .
Parsing [sent. 7618 len. 11]: It was a small place -- something like a turnpike .
Parsing [sent. 7619 len. 27]: But a great deal of land may be got into a dice-box , and why may not a whole territory be bargained for in a shed ?
Parsing [sent. 7620 len. 40]: It was but a temporary office too ; for the Edeners were ` going ' to build a superb establishment for the transaction of their business , and had already got so far as to mark out the site .
Parsing [sent. 7621 len. 8]: Which is a great way in America .
Parsing [sent. 7622 len. 71]: The office-door was wide open , and in the doorway was the agent ; no doubt a tremendous fellow to get through his work , for he seemed to have no arrears , but was swinging backwards and forwards in a rocking-chair , with one of his legs planted high up against the door-post , and the other doubled up under him , as if he were hatching his foot .
Parsing [sent. 7623 len. 18]: He was a gaunt man in a huge straw hat , and a coat of green stuff .
Parsing [sent. 7624 len. 49]: The weather being hot , he had no cravat , and wore his shirt collar wide open ; so that every time he spoke something was seen to twitch and jerk up in his throat , like the little hammers in a harpsichord when the notes are struck .
Parsing [sent. 7625 len. 13]: Perhaps it was the Truth feebly endeavouring to leap to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 7626 len. 8]: If so , it never reached them .
Parsing [sent. 7627 len. 26]: Two grey eyes lurked deep within this agent 's head , but one of them had no sight in it , and stood stock still .
Parsing [sent. 7628 len. 18]: With that side of his face he seemed to listen to what the other side was doing .
Parsing [sent. 7629 len. 29]: Thus each profile had a distinct expression ; and when the movable side was most in action , the rigid one was in its coldest state of watchfulness .
Parsing [sent. 7630 len. 31]: It was like turning the man inside out , to pass to that view of his features in his liveliest mood , and see how calculating and intent they were .
Parsing [sent. 7631 len. 58]: Each long black hair upon his head hung down as straight as any plummet line ; but rumpled tufts were on the arches of his eyes , as if the crow whose foot was deeply printed in the corners had pecked and torn them in a savage recognition of his kindred nature as a bird of prey .
Parsing [sent. 7632 len. 20]: Such was the man whom they now approached , and whom the General saluted by the name of Scadder .
Parsing [sent. 7633 len. 18]: ` Well , Gen ` ral , ' he returned , ` and how are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 7634 len. 17]: ` Ac-tive and spry , sir , in my country 's service and the sympathetic cause .
Parsing [sent. 7635 len. 9]: Two gentlemen on business , Mr Scadder . '
Parsing [sent. 7636 len. 23]: He shook hands with each of them -- nothing is done in America without shaking hands -- then went on rocking . '
Parsing [sent. 7637 len. 23]: I think I know what bis ` ness you have brought these strangers here upon , then , Gen ` ral ? '
Parsing [sent. 7638 len. 5]: ` Well , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7639 len. 6]: I expect you may . '
Parsing [sent. 7640 len. 11]: ` You air a tongue-y person , Gen ` ral .
Parsing [sent. 7641 len. 15]: For you talk too much , and that 's fact , ' said Scadder .
Parsing [sent. 7642 len. 21]: ` You speak a-larming well in public , but you did n't ought to go ahead so fast in private .
Parsing [sent. 7643 len. 3]: Now ! '
Parsing [sent. 7644 len. 15]: ` If I can realise your meaning , ride me on a rail ! '
Parsing [sent. 7645 len. 9]: returned the General , after pausing for consideration .
Parsing [sent. 7646 len. 38]: ` You know we did n't wish to sell the lots off right away to any loafer as might bid , ' said Scadder ; ` but had con-cluded to reserve 'em for Aristocrats of Natur ' .
Parsing [sent. 7647 len. 3]: Yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 7648 len. 9]: ` And they are here , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 7649 len. 6]: cried the General with warmth .
Parsing [sent. 7650 len. 8]: ` They are here , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 7651 len. 20]: ` If they air here , ' returned the agent , in reproachful accents , ` that 's enough .
Parsing [sent. 7652 len. 18]: But you did n't ought to have your dander ris with ME , Gen ` ral . '
Parsing [sent. 7653 len. 31]: The General whispered Martin that Scadder was the honestest fellow in the world , and that he would n't have given him offence designedly , for ten thousand dollars . '
Parsing [sent. 7654 len. 37]: I do my duty ; and I raise the dander of my feller critters , as I wish to serve , ' said Scadder in a low voice , looking down the road and rocking still .
Parsing [sent. 7655 len. 18]: ` They rile up rough , along of my objecting to their selling Eden off too cheap .
Parsing [sent. 7656 len. 6]: That 's human natur ' !
Parsing [sent. 7657 len. 3]: Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 7658 len. 14]: ` Mr Scadder , ' said the General , assuming his oratorical deportment .
Parsing [sent. 7659 len. 3]: ` Sir !
Parsing [sent. 7660 len. 10]: Here is my hand , and here my heart .
Parsing [sent. 7661 len. 11]: I esteem you , sir , and ask your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 7662 len. 34]: These gentlemen air friends of mine , or I would not have brought 'em here , sir , being well aware , sir , that the lots at present go entirely too cheap .
Parsing [sent. 7663 len. 15]: But these air friends , sir ; these air partick ` ler friends . '
Parsing [sent. 7664 len. 29]: Mr Scadder was so satisfied by this explanation , that he shook the General warmly by the hand , and got out of the rocking-chair to do it .
Parsing [sent. 7665 len. 15]: He then invited the General 's particular friends to accompany him into the office .
Parsing [sent. 7666 len. 54]: As to the General , he observed , with his usual benevolence , that being one of the company , he would n't interfere in the transaction on any account ; so he appropriated the rocking-chair to himself , and looked at the prospect , like a good Samaritan waiting for a traveller .
Parsing [sent. 7667 len. 4]: ` Heyday ! '
Parsing [sent. 7668 len. 20]: cried Martin , as his eye rested on a great plan which occupied one whole side of the office .
Parsing [sent. 7669 len. 31]: Indeed , the office had little else in it , but some geological and botanical specimens , one or two rusty ledgers , a homely desk , and a stool .
Parsing [sent. 7670 len. 3]: ` Heyday !
Parsing [sent. 7671 len. 5]: what 's that ? '
Parsing [sent. 7672 len. 30]: ` That 's Eden , ' said Scadder , picking his teeth with a sort of young bayonet that flew out of his knife when he touched a spring .
Parsing [sent. 7673 len. 13]: ` Why , I had no idea it was a city . '
Parsing [sent. 7674 len. 5]: ` Had n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 7675 len. 8]: Oh , it 's a city . '
Parsing [sent. 7676 len. 6]: A flourishing city , too !
Parsing [sent. 7677 len. 4]: An architectural city !
Parsing [sent. 7678 len. 54]: There were banks , churches , cathedrals , market-places , factories , hotels , stores , mansions , wharves ; an exchange , a theatre ; public buildings of all kinds , down to the office of the Eden Stinger , a daily journal ; all faithfully depicted in the view before them .
Parsing [sent. 7679 len. 4]: ` Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 7680 len. 9]: It 's really a most important place ! '
Parsing [sent. 7681 len. 5]: cried Martin turning round .
Parsing [sent. 7682 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7683 len. 10]: it 's very important , ' observed the agent .
Parsing [sent. 7684 len. 30]: ` But , I am afraid , ' said Martin , glancing again at the Public Buildings , ` that there 's nothing left for me to do . '
Parsing [sent. 7685 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 7686 len. 11]: it ai n't all built , ' replied the agent .
Parsing [sent. 7687 len. 5]: ` Not quite . '
Parsing [sent. 7688 len. 6]: This was a great relief .
Parsing [sent. 7689 len. 10]: ` The market-place , now , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 7690 len. 6]: ` Is that built ? '
Parsing [sent. 7691 len. 4]: ` That ? '
Parsing [sent. 7692 len. 14]: said the agent , sticking his toothpick into the weathercock on the top .
Parsing [sent. 7693 len. 5]: ` Let me see .
Parsing [sent. 7694 len. 8]: No ; that ai n't built . '
Parsing [sent. 7695 len. 14]: ` Rather a good job to begin with -- eh , Mark ? '
Parsing [sent. 7696 len. 8]: whispered Martin nudging him with his elbow .
Parsing [sent. 7697 len. 26]: Mark , who , with a very stolid countenance had been eyeing the plan and the agent by turns , merely rejoined ` Uncommon ! '
Parsing [sent. 7698 len. 37]: A dead silence ensued , Mr Scadder in some short recesses or vacations of his toothpick , whistled a few bars of Yankee Doodle , and blew the dust off the roof of the Theatre . '
Parsing [sent. 7699 len. 45]: I suppose , ' said Martin , feigning to look more narrowly at the plan , but showing by his tremulous voice how much depended , in his mind , upon the answer ; ' I suppose there are -- several architects there ? '
Parsing [sent. 7700 len. 12]: ` There ai n't a single one , ' said Scadder .
Parsing [sent. 7701 len. 19]: ` Mark , ' whispered Martin , pulling him by the sleeve , ` do you hear that ?
Parsing [sent. 7702 len. 12]: But whose work is all this before us , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 7703 len. 4]: he asked aloud .
Parsing [sent. 7704 len. 18]: ` The soil being very fruitful , public buildings grows spontaneous , perhaps , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 7705 len. 30]: He was on the agent 's dark side as he said it ; but Scadder instantly changed his place , and brought his active eye to bear upon him .
Parsing [sent. 7706 len. 13]: ` Feel of my hands , young man , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 7707 len. 5]: ` What for ? '
Parsing [sent. 7708 len. 5]: asked Mark , declining .
Parsing [sent. 7709 len. 13]: ` Air they dirty , or air they clean , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 7710 len. 7]: said Scadder , holding them out .
Parsing [sent. 7711 len. 11]: In a physical point of view they were decidedly dirty .
Parsing [sent. 7712 len. 35]: But it being obvious that Mr Scadder offered them for examination in a figurative sense , as emblems of his moral character , Martin hastened to pronounce them pure as the driven snow . '
Parsing [sent. 7713 len. 49]: I entreat , Mark , ' he said , with some irritation , ` that you will not obtrude remarks of that nature , which , however harmless and well-intentioned , are quite out of place , and can not be expected to be very agreeable to strangers .
Parsing [sent. 7714 len. 6]: I am quite surprised . '
Parsing [sent. 7715 len. 15]: ` The Co. 's a-putting his foot in it already , ' thought Mark .
Parsing [sent. 7716 len. 20]: ` He must be a sleeping partner -- fast asleep and snoring -- Co. must ; I see . '
Parsing [sent. 7717 len. 40]: Mr Scadder said nothing , but he set his back against the plan , and thrust his toothpick into the desk some twenty times ; looking at Mark all the while as if he were stabbing him in effigy .
Parsing [sent. 7718 len. 25]: ` You have n't said whose work it is , ' Martin ventured to observe at length , in a tone of mild propitiation .
Parsing [sent. 7719 len. 20]: ` Well , never mind whose work it is , or is n't , ' said the agent sulkily .
Parsing [sent. 7720 len. 8]: ` No matter how it did eventuate .
Parsing [sent. 7721 len. 23]: P'raps he cleared off , handsome , with a heap of dollars ; p ` raps he was n't worth a cent .
Parsing [sent. 7722 len. 15]: P'raps he was a loafin ' rowdy ; p ` raps a ring-tailed roarer .
Parsing [sent. 7723 len. 3]: Now ! '
Parsing [sent. 7724 len. 8]: ` All your doing , Mark ! '
Parsing [sent. 7725 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 7726 len. 18]: ` P'raps , ' pursued the agent , ` them ai n't plants of Eden 's raising .
Parsing [sent. 7727 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 7728 len. 12]: P'raps that desk and stool ai n't made from Eden lumber .
Parsing [sent. 7729 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 7730 len. 11]: P'raps no end of squatters ai n't gone out there .
Parsing [sent. 7731 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 7732 len. 16]: P'raps there ai n't no such location in the territoary of the Great U-nited States .
Parsing [sent. 7733 len. 6]: Oh , no ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 7734 len. 18]: I hope you 're satisfied with the success of your joke , Mark , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 7735 len. 59]: But here , at a most opportune and happy time , the General interposed , and called out to Scadder from the doorway to give his friends the particulars of that little lot of fifty acres with the house upon it ; which , having belonged to the company formerly , had lately lapsed again into their hands .
Parsing [sent. 7736 len. 17]: ` You air a deal too open-handed , Gen ` ral , ' was the answer .
Parsing [sent. 7737 len. 12]: ` It is a lot as should be rose in price .
Parsing [sent. 7738 len. 4]: It is . '
Parsing [sent. 7739 len. 34]: He grumblingly opened his books notwithstanding , and always keeping his bright side towards Mark , no matter at what amount of inconvenience to himself , displayed a certain leaf for their perusal .
Parsing [sent. 7740 len. 21]: Martin read it greedily , and then inquired : ` Now where upon the plan may this place be ? '
Parsing [sent. 7741 len. 6]: ` Upon the plan ? '
Parsing [sent. 7742 len. 3]: said Scadder .
Parsing [sent. 7743 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 7744 len. 39]: He turned towards it , and reflected for a short time , as if , having been put upon his mettle , he was resolved to be particular to the very minutest hair 's breadth of a shade .
Parsing [sent. 7745 len. 49]: At length , after wheeling his toothpick slowly round and round in the air , as if it were a carrier pigeon just thrown up , he suddenly made a dart at the drawing , and pierced the very centre of the main wharf , through and through .
Parsing [sent. 7746 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 7747 len. 19]: he said , leaving his knife quivering in the wall ; ` that 's where it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 7748 len. 19]: Martin glanced with sparkling eyes upon his Co. , and his Co. saw that the thing was done .
Parsing [sent. 7749 len. 83]: The bargain was not concluded as easily as might have been expected though , for Scadder was caustic and ill-humoured , and cast much unnecessary opposition in the way ; at one time requesting them to think of it , and call again in a week or a fortnight ; at another , predicting that they would n't like it ; at another , offering to retract and let them off , and muttering strong imprecations upon the folly of the General .
Parsing [sent. 7750 len. 74]: But the whole of the astoundingly small sum total of purchase-money -- it was only one hundred and fifty dollars , or something more than thirty pounds of the capital brought by Co. into the architectural concern -- was ultimately paid down ; and Martin 's head was two inches nearer the roof of the little wooden office , with the consciousness of being a landed proprietor in the thriving city of Eden .
Parsing [sent. 7751 len. 33]: ` If it should n't happen to fit , ' said Scadder , as he gave Martin the necessary credentials on recepit of his money , ` do n't blame me . '
Parsing [sent. 7752 len. 10]: ` No , no , ' he replied merrily .
Parsing [sent. 7753 len. 7]: ` We 'll not blame you .
Parsing [sent. 7754 len. 8]: General , are you going ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7755 len. 32]: I am at your service , sir ; and I wish you , ' said the General , giving him his hand with grave cordiality , ` joy of your po-ssession .
Parsing [sent. 7756 len. 43]: You air now , sir , a denizen of the most powerful and highly-civilised dominion that has ever graced the world ; a do-minion , sir , where man is bound to man in one vast bond of equal love and truth .
Parsing [sent. 7757 len. 13]: May you , sir , be worthy of your a-dopted country ! '
Parsing [sent. 7758 len. 43]: Martin thanked him , and took leave of Mr Scadder ; who had resumed his post in the rocking-chair , immediately on the General 's rising from it , and was once more swinging away as if he had never been disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 7759 len. 35]: Mark looked back several times as they went down the road towards the National Hotel , but now his blighted profile was towards them , and nothing but attentive thoughtfulness was written on it .
Parsing [sent. 7760 len. 7]: Strangely different to the other side !
Parsing [sent. 7761 len. 46]: He was not a man much given to laughing , and never laughed outright ; but every line in the print of the crow 's foot , and every little wiry vein in that division of his head , was wrinkled up into a grin !
Parsing [sent. 7762 len. 41]: The compound figure of Death and the Lady at the top of the old ballad was not divided with a greater nicety , and had n't halves more monstrously unlike each other , than the two profiles of Zephaniah Scadder .
Parsing [sent. 7763 len. 45]: The General posted along at a great rate , for the clock was on the stroke of twelve ; and at that hour precisely , the Great Meeting of the Watertoast Sympathisers was to be holden in the public room of the National Hotel .
Parsing [sent. 7764 len. 78]: Being very curious to witness the demonstration , and know what it was all about , Martin kept close to the General ; and , keeping closer than ever when they entered the Hall , got by that means upon a little platform of tables at the upper end ; where an armchair was set for the General , and Mr La Fayette Kettle , as secretary , was making a great display of some foolscap documents .
Parsing [sent. 7765 len. 5]: Screamers , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 7766 len. 6]: ` Well , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 7767 len. 39]: he said , as he shook hands with Martin , ` here is a spectacle calc ` lated to make the British Lion put his tail between his legs , and howl with anguish , I expect ! '
Parsing [sent. 7768 len. 29]: Martin certainly thought it possible that the British Lion might have been rather out of his element in that Ark ; but he kept the idea to himself .
Parsing [sent. 7769 len. 49]: The General was then voted to the chair , on the motion of a pallid lad of the Jefferson Brick school ; who forthwith set in for a high-spiced speech , with a good deal about hearths and homes in it , and unriveting the chains of Tyranny .
Parsing [sent. 7770 len. 14]: Oh but it was a clincher for the British Lion , it was !
Parsing [sent. 7771 len. 11]: The indignation of the glowing young Columbian knew no bounds .
Parsing [sent. 7772 len. 44]: If he could only have been one of his own forefathers , he said , would n't he have peppered that same Lion , and been to him as another Brute Tamer with a wire whip , teaching him lessons not easily forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 7773 len. 3]: ` Lion !
Parsing [sent. 7774 len. 10]: -LRB- cried that young Columbian -RRB- where is he ?
Parsing [sent. 7775 len. 4]: Who is he ?
Parsing [sent. 7776 len. 4]: What is he ?
Parsing [sent. 7777 len. 5]: Show him to me .
Parsing [sent. 7778 len. 6]: Let me have him here .
Parsing [sent. 7779 len. 3]: Here ! '
Parsing [sent. 7780 len. 16]: said the young Columbian , in a wrestling attitude , ` upon this sacred altar .
Parsing [sent. 7781 len. 3]: Here ! '
Parsing [sent. 7782 len. 31]: cried the young Columbian , idealising the dining-table , ` upon ancestral ashes , cemented with the glorious blood poured out like water on our native plains of Chickabiddy Lick !
Parsing [sent. 7783 len. 6]: Bring forth that Lion ! '
Parsing [sent. 7784 len. 5]: said the young Columbian .
Parsing [sent. 7785 len. 7]: ` Alone , I dare him !
Parsing [sent. 7786 len. 5]: I taunt that Lion .
Parsing [sent. 7787 len. 35]: I tell that Lion , that Freedom 's hand once twisted in his mane , he rolls a corse before me , and the Eagles of the Great Republic laugh ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 7788 len. 80]: When it was found that the Lion did n't come , but kept out of the way ; that the young Columbian stood there , with folded arms , alone in his glory ; and consequently that the Eagles were no doubt laughing wildly on the mountain tops ; such cheers arose as might have shaken the hands upon the Horse -- Guards ' clock , and changed the very mean time of the day in England 's capital .
Parsing [sent. 7789 len. 6]: ` Who is this ? '
Parsing [sent. 7790 len. 6]: Martin telegraphed to La Fayette .
Parsing [sent. 7791 len. 29]: The Secretary wrote something , very gravely , on a piece of paper , twisted it up , and had it passed to him from hand to hand .
Parsing [sent. 7792 len. 22]: It was an improvement on the old sentiment : ` Perhaps as remarkable a man as any in our country . '
Parsing [sent. 7793 len. 23]: This young Columbian was succeeded by another , to the full as eloquent as he , who drew down storms of cheers .
Parsing [sent. 7794 len. 41]: But both remarkable youths , in their great excitement -LRB- for your true poetry can never stoop to details -RRB- , forgot to say with whom or what the Watertoasters sympathized , and likewise why or wherefore they were sympathetic .
Parsing [sent. 7795 len. 50]: Thus Martin remained for a long time as completely in the dark as ever ; until at length a ray of light broke in upon him through the medium of the Secretary , who , by reading the minutes of their past proceedings , made the matter somewhat clearer .
Parsing [sent. 7796 len. 96]: He then learned that the Watertoast Association sympathized with a certain Public Man in Ireland , who held a contest upon certain points with England ; and that they did so , because they did n't love England at all -- not by any means because they loved Ireland much ; being indeed horribly jealous and distrustful of its people always , and only tolerating them because of their working hard , which made them very useful ; labour being held in greater indignity in the simple republic than in any other country upon earth .
Parsing [sent. 7797 len. 45]: This rendered Martin curious to see what grounds of sympathy the Watertoast Association put forth ; nor was he long in suspense , for the General rose to read a letter to the Public Man , which with his own hands he had written .
Parsing [sent. 7798 len. 36]: ` Thus , ' said the General , ` thus , my friends and fellow-citizens , it runs : ' `` SIR -- I address you on behalf of the Watertoast Association of United Sympathisers .
Parsing [sent. 7799 len. 13]: It is founded , sir , in the great republic of America !
Parsing [sent. 7800 len. 42]: and now holds its breath , and swells the blue veins in its forehead nigh to bursting , as it watches , sir , with feverish intensity and sympathetic ardour , your noble efforts in the cause of Freedom . '' '
Parsing [sent. 7801 len. 32]: At the name of Freedom , and at every repetition of that name , all the Sympathisers roared aloud ; cheering with nine times nine , and nine times over . '
Parsing [sent. 7802 len. 15]: `` In Freedom 's name , sir -- holy Freedom -- I address you .
Parsing [sent. 7803 len. 17]: In Freedom 's name , I send herewith a contribution to the funds of your society .
Parsing [sent. 7804 len. 40]: In Freedom 's name , sir , I advert with indignation and disgust to that accursed animal , with gore-stained whiskers , whose rampant cruelty and fiery lust have ever been a scourge , a torment to the world .
Parsing [sent. 7805 len. 51]: The naked visitors to Crusoe 's Island , sir ; the flying wives of Peter Wilkins ; the fruit-smeared children of the tangled bush ; nay , even the men of large stature , anciently bred in the mining districts of Cornwall ; alike bear witness to its savage nature .
Parsing [sent. 7806 len. 19]: Where , sir , are the Cormorans , the Blunderbores , the Great Feefofums , named in History ?
Parsing [sent. 7807 len. 11]: All , all , exterminated by its destroying hand . '
Parsing [sent. 7808 len. 12]: `` I allude , sir , to the British Lion . '
Parsing [sent. 7809 len. 66]: `` Devoted , mind and body , heart and soul , to Freedom , sir -- to Freedom , blessed solace to the snail upon the cellar-door , the oyster in his pearly bed , the still mite in his home of cheese , the very winkle of your country in his shelly lair -- in her unsullied name , we offer you our sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 7810 len. 36]: Oh , sir , in this our cherished and our happy land , her fires burn bright and clear and smokeless ; once lighted up in yours , the lion shall be roasted whole . '
Parsing [sent. 7811 len. 85]: `` I am , sir , in Freedom 's name , ' `` Your affectionate friend and faithful Sympathiser , ' `` CYRUS CHOKE , ' `` General , U.S.M. '' ' It happened that just as the General began to read this letter , the railroad train arrived , bringing a new mail from England ; and a packet had been handed in to the Secretary , which during its perusal and the frequent cheerings in homage to freedom , he had opened .
Parsing [sent. 7812 len. 54]: Now , its contents disturbed him very much , and the moment the General sat down , he hurried to his side , and placed in his hand a letter and several printed extracts from English newspapers ; to which , in a state of infinite excitement , he called his immediate attention .
Parsing [sent. 7813 len. 73]: The General , being greatly heated by his own composition , was in a fit state to receive any inflammable influence ; but he had no sooner possessed himself of the contents of these documents , than a change came over his face , involving such a huge amount of choler and passion , that the noisy concourse were silent in a moment , in very wonder at the sight of him .
Parsing [sent. 7814 len. 5]: ` My friends ! '
Parsing [sent. 7815 len. 22]: cried the General , rising ; ` my friends and fellow citizens , we have been mistaken in this man . '
Parsing [sent. 7816 len. 6]: ` In what man ? '
Parsing [sent. 7817 len. 4]: was the cry .
Parsing [sent. 7818 len. 23]: ` In this , ' panted the General , holding up the letter he had read aloud a few minutes before . '
Parsing [sent. 7819 len. 24]: I find that he has been , and is , the advocate -- consistent in it always too -- of Nigger emancipation ! '
Parsing [sent. 7820 len. 42]: If anything beneath the sky be real , those Sons of Freedom would have pistolled , stabbed -- in some way slain -- that man by coward hands and murderous violence , if he had stood among them at that time .
Parsing [sent. 7821 len. 36]: The most confiding of their own countrymen would not have wagered then -- no , nor would they ever peril -- one dunghill straw , upon the life of any man in such a strait .
Parsing [sent. 7822 len. 37]: They tore the letter , cast the fragments in the air , trod down the pieces as they fell ; and yelled , and groaned , and hissed , till they could cry no longer . '
Parsing [sent. 7823 len. 29]: I shall move , ' said the General , when he could make himself heard , ` that the Watertoast Association of United Sympathisers be immediately dissolved ! '
Parsing [sent. 7824 len. 4]: Down with it !
Parsing [sent. 7825 len. 4]: Away with it !
Parsing [sent. 7826 len. 6]: Do n't hear of it !
Parsing [sent. 7827 len. 4]: Burn its records !
Parsing [sent. 7828 len. 5]: Pull the room down !
Parsing [sent. 7829 len. 7]: Blot it out of human memory !
Parsing [sent. 7830 len. 7]: ` But , my fellow-countrymen ! '
Parsing [sent. 7831 len. 8]: said the General , ` the contributions .
Parsing [sent. 7832 len. 4]: We have funds .
Parsing [sent. 7833 len. 10]: What is to be done with the funds ? '
Parsing [sent. 7834 len. 90]: It was hastily resolved that a piece of plate should be presented to a certain constitutional Judge , who had laid down from the Bench the noble principle that it was lawful for any white mob to murder any black man ; and that another piece of plate , of similar value should be presented to a certain Patriot , who had declared from his high place in the Legislature , that he and his friends would hang without trial , any Abolitionist who might pay them a visit .
Parsing [sent. 7835 len. 49]: For the surplus , it was agreed that it should be devoted to aiding the enforcement of those free and equal laws , which render it incalculably more criminal and dangerous to teach a negro to read and write than to roast him alive in a public city .
Parsing [sent. 7836 len. 22]: These points adjusted , the meeting broke up in great disorder , and there was an end of the Watertoast Sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 7837 len. 39]: As Martin ascended to his bedroom , his eye was attracted by the Republican banner , which had been hoisted from the house-top in honour of the occasion , and was fluttering before a window which he passed .
Parsing [sent. 7838 len. 4]: ` Tut ! '
Parsing [sent. 7839 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 7840 len. 10]: ` You 're a gay flag in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 7841 len. 28]: But let a man be near enough to get the light upon the other side and see through you ; and you are but sorry fustian ! '
Parsing [sent. 7842 len. 20]: CHAPTER TWENTY -- TWO FROM WHICH IT WILL BE SEEN THAT MARTIN BECAME A LION OF HIS OWN ACCOUNT .
Parsing [sent. 7843 len. 57]: TOGETHER WITH THE REASON WHY As soon as it was generally known in the National Hotel , that the young Englishman , Mr Chuzzlewit , had purchased a ` lo-cation ' in the Valley of Eden , and intended to betake himself to that earthly Paradise by the next steamboat , he became a popular character .
Parsing [sent. 7844 len. 67]: Why this should be , or how it had come to pass , Martin no more knew than Mrs Gamp , of Kingsgate Street , High Holborn , did ; but that he was for the time being the lion , by popular election , of the Watertoast community , and that his society was in rather inconvenient request there could be no kind of doubt .
Parsing [sent. 7845 len. 53]: The first notification he received of this change in his position , was the following epistle , written in a thin running hand -- with here and there a fat letter or two , to make the general effect more striking -- on a sheet of paper , ruled with blue lines .
Parsing [sent. 7846 len. 8]: ` NATIONAL HOTEL , ` MONDAY MORNING .
Parsing [sent. 7847 len. 56]: ` Dear Sir -- ` When I had the privillidge of being your fellow-traveller in the cars , the day before yesterday , you offered some remarks upon the subject of the tower of London , which -LRB- in common with my fellow-citizens generally -RRB- I could wish to hear repeated to a public audience .
Parsing [sent. 7848 len. 71]: ` As secretary to the Young Men 's Watertoast Association of this town , I am requested to inform you that the Society will be proud to hear you deliver a lecture upon the Tower of London , at their Hall to-morrow evening , at seven o'clock ; and as a large issue of quarter-dollar tickets may be expected , your answer and consent by bearer will be considered obliging .
Parsing [sent. 7849 len. 13]: ` Dear Sir , ` Yours truly , ` LA FAYETTE KETTLE .
Parsing [sent. 7850 len. 6]: ` The Honourable M. Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 7851 len. 18]: ` P.S. -- The Society would not be particular in limiting you to the Tower of London .
Parsing [sent. 7852 len. 40]: Permit me to suggest that any remarks upon the Elements of Geology , or -LRB- if more convenient -RRB- upon the Writings of your talented and witty countryman , the honourable Mr Miller , would be well received . '
Parsing [sent. 7853 len. 27]: Very much aghast at this invitation , Martin wrote back , civilly declining it ; and had scarcely done so , when he received another letter .
Parsing [sent. 7854 len. 13]: ` No. 47 , Bunker Hill Street , ` Monday Morning . '
Parsing [sent. 7855 len. 4]: -LRB- Private -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 7856 len. 26]: ` Sir -- I was raised in those interminable solitudes where our mighty Mississippi -LRB- or Father of Waters -RRB- rolls his turbid flood . '
Parsing [sent. 7857 len. 7]: I am young , and ardent .
Parsing [sent. 7858 len. 23]: For there is a poetry in wildness , and every alligator basking in the slime is in himself an Epic , self-contained .
Parsing [sent. 7859 len. 5]: I aspirate for fame .
Parsing [sent. 7860 len. 8]: It is my yearning and my thirst .
Parsing [sent. 7861 len. 34]: ` Are you , sir , aware of any member of Congress in England , who would undertake to pay my expenses to that country , and for six months after my arrival ?
Parsing [sent. 7862 len. 21]: ` There is something within me which gives me the assurance that this enlightened patronage would not be thrown away .
Parsing [sent. 7863 len. 33]: In literature or art ; the bar , the pulpit , or the stage ; in one or other , if not all , I feel that I am certain to succeed .
Parsing [sent. 7864 len. 39]: ` If too much engaged to write to any such yourself , please let me have a list of three or four of those most likely to respond , and I will address them through the Post Office .
Parsing [sent. 7865 len. 38]: May I also ask you to favour me with any critical observations that have ever presented themselves to your reflective faculties , on `` Cain , a Mystery , '' by the Right Honourable Lord Byron ? '
Parsing [sent. 7866 len. 43]: I am , Sir , ` Yours -LRB- forgive me if I add , soaringly -RRB- , ` PUTNAM SMIF ` P.S. -- Address your answer to America Junior , Messrs. Hancock & Floby , Dry Goods Store , as above . '
Parsing [sent. 7867 len. 43]: Both of which letters , together with Martin 's reply to each , were , according to a laudable custom , much tending to the promotion of gentlemanly feeling and social confidence , published in the next number of the Watertoast Gazette .
Parsing [sent. 7868 len. 25]: He had scarcely got through this correspondence when Captain Kedgick , the landlord , kindly came upstairs to see how he was getting on .
Parsing [sent. 7869 len. 22]: The Captain sat down upon the bed before he spoke ; and finding it rather hard , moved to the pillow .
Parsing [sent. 7870 len. 6]: ` Well , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 7871 len. 36]: said the Captain , putting his hat a little more on one side , for it was rather tight in the crown : ` You 're quite a public man I calc ` late . '
Parsing [sent. 7872 len. 14]: ` So it seems , ' retorted Martin , who was very tired .
Parsing [sent. 7873 len. 20]: ` Our citizens , sir , ' pursued the Captain , ` intend to pay their respects to you .
Parsing [sent. 7874 len. 18]: You will have to hold a sort of le-vee , sir , while you 're here . '
Parsing [sent. 7875 len. 5]: ` Powers above ! '
Parsing [sent. 7876 len. 16]: cried Martin , ' I could n't do that , my good fellow ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 7877 len. 11]: I reckon you MUST then , ' said the Captain .
Parsing [sent. 7878 len. 14]: ` Must is not a pleasant word , Captain , ' urged Martin .
Parsing [sent. 7879 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 7880 len. 29]: I did n't fix the mother language , and I ca n't unfix it , ' said the Captain coolly ; ` else I 'd make it pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 7881 len. 4]: You must re-ceive .
Parsing [sent. 7882 len. 5]: That 's all . '
Parsing [sent. 7883 len. 20]: ` But why should I receive people who care as much for me as I care for them ? '
Parsing [sent. 7884 len. 3]: asked Martin .
Parsing [sent. 7885 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 7886 len. 18]: because I have had a muniment put up in the bar , ' returned the Captain . '
Parsing [sent. 7887 len. 4]: A what ? '
Parsing [sent. 7888 len. 4]: cried Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 7889 len. 8]: A muniment , ' rejoined the Captain .
Parsing [sent. 7890 len. 54]: Martin looked despairingly at Mark , who informed him that the Captain meant a written notice that Mr Chuzzlewit would receive the Watertoasters that day , at and after two o'clock which was in effect then hanging in the bar , as Mark , from ocular inspection of the same , could testify .
Parsing [sent. 7891 len. 21]: ` You would n't be unpop ` lar , I know , ' said the Captain , paring his nails .
Parsing [sent. 7892 len. 26]: ` Our citizens a n't long of riling up , I tell you ; and our Gazette could flay you like a wild cat . '
Parsing [sent. 7893 len. 30]: Martin was going to be very wroth , but he thought better of it , and said : ` In Heaven 's name let them come , then . '
Parsing [sent. 7894 len. 13]: ` Oh , THEY 'll come , ' returned the Captain . '
Parsing [sent. 7895 len. 16]: I have seen the big room fixed a ` purpose , with my eyes . '
Parsing [sent. 7896 len. 27]: ` But will you , ' said Martin , seeing that the Captain was about to go ; ` will you at least tell me this ?
Parsing [sent. 7897 len. 9]: What do they want to see me for ?
Parsing [sent. 7898 len. 5]: what have I done ?
Parsing [sent. 7899 len. 15]: and how do they happen to have such a sudden interest in me ? '
Parsing [sent. 7900 len. 70]: Captain Kedgick put a thumb and three fingers to each side of the brim of his hat ; lifted it a little way off his head ; put it on again carefully ; passed one hand all down his face , beginning at the forehead and ending at the chin ; looked at Martin ; then at Mark ; then at Martin again ; winked , and walked out .
Parsing [sent. 7901 len. 8]: ` Upon my life , now ! '
Parsing [sent. 7902 len. 24]: said Martin , bringing his hand heavily upon the table ; ` such a perfectly unaccountable fellow as that , I never saw .
Parsing [sent. 7903 len. 10]: Mark , what do you say to this ? '
Parsing [sent. 7904 len. 30]: ` Why , sir , ' returned his partner , ` my opinion is that we must have got to the MOST remarkable man in the country at last .
Parsing [sent. 7905 len. 14]: So I hope there 's an end to the breed , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 7906 len. 14]: Although this made Martin laugh , it could n't keep off two o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 7907 len. 48]: Punctually , as the hour struck , Captain Kedgick returned to hand him to the room of state ; and he had no sooner got him safe there , than he bawled down the staircase to his fellow-citizens below , that Mr Chuzzlewit was ` receiving . '
Parsing [sent. 7908 len. 7]: Up they came with a rush .
Parsing [sent. 7909 len. 30]: Up they came until the room was full , and , through the open door , a dismal perspective of more to come , was shown upon the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 7910 len. 32]: One after another , one after another , dozen after dozen , score after score , more , more , more , up they came ; all shaking hands with Martin .
Parsing [sent. 7911 len. 67]: Such varieties of hands , the thick , the thin , the short , the long , the fat , the lean , the coarse , the fine ; such differences of temperature , the hot , the cold , the dry , the moist , the flabby ; such diversities of grasp , the tight , the loose , the short-lived , and the lingering !
Parsing [sent. 7912 len. 33]: Still up , up , up , more , more , more ; and ever and anon the Captain 's voice was heard above the crowd -- ` There 's more below !
Parsing [sent. 7913 len. 5]: there 's more below .
Parsing [sent. 7914 len. 17]: Now , gentlemen you that have been introduced to Mr Chuzzlewit , will you clear gentlemen ?
Parsing [sent. 7915 len. 4]: Will you clear ?
Parsing [sent. 7916 len. 19]: Will you be so good as clear , gentlemen , and make a little room for more ? '
Parsing [sent. 7917 len. 23]: Regardless of the Captain 's cries , they did n't clear at all , but stood there , bolt upright and staring .
Parsing [sent. 7918 len. 20]: Two gentlemen connected with the Watertoast Gazette had come express to get the matter for an article on Martin .
Parsing [sent. 7919 len. 8]: They had agreed to divide the labour .
Parsing [sent. 7920 len. 9]: One of them took him below the waistcoat .
Parsing [sent. 7921 len. 3]: One above .
Parsing [sent. 7922 len. 22]: Each stood directly in front of his subject with his head a little on one side , intent on his department .
Parsing [sent. 7923 len. 32]: If Martin put one boot before the other , the lower gentleman was down upon him ; he rubbed a pimple on his nose , and the upper gentleman booked it .
Parsing [sent. 7924 len. 32]: He opened his mouth to speak , and the same gentleman was on one knee before him , looking in at his teeth , with the nice scrutiny of a dentist .
Parsing [sent. 7925 len. 44]: Amateurs in the physiognomical and phrenological sciences roved about him with watchful eyes and itching fingers , and sometimes one , more daring than the rest , made a mad grasp at the back of his head , and vanished in the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 7926 len. 21]: They had him in all points of view : in front , in profile , three-quarter face , and behind .
Parsing [sent. 7927 len. 15]: Those who were not professional or scientific , audibly exchanged opinions on his looks .
Parsing [sent. 7928 len. 13]: New lights shone in upon him , in respect of his nose .
Parsing [sent. 7929 len. 11]: Contradictory rumours were abroad on the subject of his hair .
Parsing [sent. 7930 len. 44]: And still the Captain 's voice was heard -- so stifled by the concourse , that he seemed to speak from underneath a feather-bed -- exclaiming -- ` Gentlemen , you that have been introduced to Mr Chuzzlewit , WILL you clear ? '
Parsing [sent. 7931 len. 66]: Even when they began to clear it was no better ; for then a stream of gentlemen , every one with a lady on each arm -LRB- exactly like the chorus to the National Anthem when Royalty goes in state to the play -RRB- , came gliding in -- every new group fresher than the last , and bent on staying to the latest moment .
Parsing [sent. 7932 len. 58]: If they spoke to him , which was not often , they invariably asked the same questions , in the same tone ; with no more remorse , or delicacy , or consideration , than if he had been a figure of stone , purchased , and paid for , and set up there for their delight .
Parsing [sent. 7933 len. 51]: Even when , in the slow course of time , these died off , it was as bad as ever , if not worse ; for then the boys grew bold , and came in as a class of themselves , and did everything that the grown-up people had done .
Parsing [sent. 7934 len. 77]: Uncouth stragglers , too , appeared ; men of a ghostly kind , who being in , did n't know how to get out again ; insomuch that one silent gentleman with glazed and fishy eyes and only one button on his waistcoat -LRB- which was a very large metal one , and shone prodigiously -RRB- , got behind the door , and stood there , like a clock , long after everybody else was gone .
Parsing [sent. 7935 len. 40]: Martin felt , from pure fatigue , and heat , and worry , as if he could have fallen on the ground and willingly remained there , if they would but have had the mercy to leave him alone .
Parsing [sent. 7936 len. 85]: But as letters and messages , threatening his public denouncement if he did n't see the senders , poured in like hail ; and as more visitors came while he took his coffee by himself ; and as Mark , with all his vigilance , was unable to keep them from the door ; he resolved to go to bed -- not that he felt at all sure of bed being any protection , but that he might not leave a forlorn hope untried .
Parsing [sent. 7937 len. 67]: He had communicated this design to Mark , and was on the eve of escaping , when the door was thrown open in a great hurry , and an elderly gentleman entered ; bringing with him a lady who certainly could not be considered young -- that was matter of fact ; and probably could not be considered handsome -- but that was matter of opinion .
Parsing [sent. 7938 len. 18]: She was very straight , very tall , and not at all flexible in face or figure .
Parsing [sent. 7939 len. 42]: On her head she wore a great straw bonnet , with trimmings of the same , in which she looked as if she had been thatched by an unskillful labourer ; and in her hand she held a most enormous fan .
Parsing [sent. 7940 len. 8]: ` Mr Chuzzlewit , I believe ? '
Parsing [sent. 7941 len. 4]: said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 7942 len. 7]: ` That is my name . '
Parsing [sent. 7943 len. 16]: ` Sir , ' said the gentleman , ' I am pressed for time . '
Parsing [sent. 7944 len. 5]: ` Thank God ! '
Parsing [sent. 7945 len. 4]: thought Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 7946 len. 24]: I go back Toe my home , sir , ' pursued the gentleman , ` by the return train , which starts immediate .
Parsing [sent. 7947 len. 14]: Start is not a word you use in your country , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 7948 len. 11]: ` Oh yes , it is , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 7949 len. 34]: ` You air mistaken , sir , ' returned the gentleman , with great decision : ` but we will not pursue the subject , lest it should awake your preju -- dice .
Parsing [sent. 7950 len. 6]: Sir , Mrs Hominy . '
Parsing [sent. 7951 len. 3]: Martin bowed .
Parsing [sent. 7952 len. 29]: ` Mrs Hominy , sir , is the lady of Major Hominy , one of our chicest spirits ; and belongs Toe one of our most aristocratic families .
Parsing [sent. 7953 len. 18]: You air , p ` raps , acquainted , sir , with Mrs Hominy 's writings . '
Parsing [sent. 7954 len. 7]: Martin could n't say he was .
Parsing [sent. 7955 len. 18]: ` You have much Toe learn , and Toe enjoy , sir , ' said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 7956 len. 34]: ` Mrs Hominy is going Toe stay until the end of the Fall , sir , with her married daughter at the settlement of New Thermopylae , three days this side of Eden .
Parsing [sent. 7957 len. 27]: Any attention , sir , that you can show Toe Mrs Hominy upon the journey , will be very grateful Toe the Major and our fellow-citizens .
Parsing [sent. 7958 len. 20]: Mrs Hominy , I wish you good night , ma'am , and a pleasant pro-gress on your route ! '
Parsing [sent. 7959 len. 19]: Martin could scarcely believe it ; but he had gone , and Mrs Hominy was drinking the milk .
Parsing [sent. 7960 len. 11]: ` A'most used-up I am , I do declare ! '
Parsing [sent. 7961 len. 3]: she observed .
Parsing [sent. 7962 len. 23]: ` The jolting in the cars is pretty nigh as bad as if the rail was full of snags and sawyers . '
Parsing [sent. 7963 len. 8]: ` Snags and sawyers , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 7964 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 7965 len. 22]: ` Well , then , I do suppose you 'll hardly realise my meaning , sir , ' said Mrs Hominy .
Parsing [sent. 7966 len. 3]: ` My !
Parsing [sent. 7967 len. 3]: Only think !
Parsing [sent. 7968 len. 4]: DO tell ! '
Parsing [sent. 7969 len. 51]: It did not appear that these expressions , although they seemed to conclude with an urgent entreaty , stood in need of any answer ; for Mrs Hominy , untying her bonnet-strings , observed that she would withdraw to lay that article of dress aside , and would return immediately .
Parsing [sent. 7970 len. 4]: ` Mark ! '
Parsing [sent. 7971 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 7972 len. 7]: ` Touch me , will you .
Parsing [sent. 7973 len. 5]: Am I awake ? '
Parsing [sent. 7974 len. 15]: ` Hominy is , sir , ' returned his partner -- ` Broad awake !
Parsing [sent. 7975 len. 38]: Just the sort of woman , sir , as would be discovered with her eyes wide open , and her mind a-working for her country 's good , at any hour of the day or night . '
Parsing [sent. 7976 len. 48]: They had no opportunity of saying more , for Mrs Hominy stalked in again -- very erect , in proof of her aristocratic blood ; and holding in her clasped hands a red cotton pocket-handkerchief , perhaps a parting gift from that choice spirit , the Major .
Parsing [sent. 7977 len. 59]: She had laid aside her bonnet , and now appeared in a highly aristocratic and classical cap , meeting beneath her chin : a style of headdress so admirably adapted to her countenance , that if the late Mr Grimaldi had appeared in the lappets of Mrs Siddons , a more complete effect could not have been produced .
Parsing [sent. 7978 len. 7]: Martin handed her to a chair .
Parsing [sent. 7979 len. 15]: Her first words arrested him before he could get back to his own seat .
Parsing [sent. 7980 len. 6]: ` Pray , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 7981 len. 13]: said Mrs Hominy , ` where do you hail from ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 7982 len. 29]: I am afraid I am dull of comprehension , ' answered Martin , ` being extremely tired ; but upon my word I do n't understand you . '
Parsing [sent. 7983 len. 27]: Mrs Hominy shook her head with a melancholy smile that said , not inexpressively , ` They corrupt even the language in that old country ! '
Parsing [sent. 7984 len. 24]: and added then , as coming down a step or two to meet his low capacity , ` Where was you rose ? '
Parsing [sent. 7985 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 7986 len. 10]: said Martin ' I was born in Kent . '
Parsing [sent. 7987 len. 12]: ` And how do you like our country , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 7988 len. 4]: asked Mrs Hominy .
Parsing [sent. 7989 len. 12]: ` Very much indeed , ' said Martin , half asleep .
Parsing [sent. 7990 len. 13]: ` At least -- that is -- pretty well , ma'am . '
Parsing [sent. 7991 len. 27]: ` Most strangers -- and partick ` larly Britishers -- are much surprised by what they see in the U-nited States , ' remarked Mrs Hominy .
Parsing [sent. 7992 len. 16]: ` They have excellent reason to be so , ma'am , ' said Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 7993 len. 12]: I never was so much surprised in all my life . '
Parsing [sent. 7994 len. 16]: ` Our institutions make our people smart much , sir , ' Mrs Hominy remarked .
Parsing [sent. 7995 len. 21]: ` The most short-sighted man could see that at a glance , with his naked eye , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 7996 len. 32]: Mrs Hominy was a philosopher and an authoress , and consequently had a pretty strong digestion ; but this coarse , this indecorous phrase , was almost too much for her .
Parsing [sent. 7997 len. 22]: For a gentleman sitting alone with a lady -- although the door WAS open -- to talk about a naked eye !
Parsing [sent. 7998 len. 28]: A long interval elapsed before even she -- woman of masculine and towering intellect though she was -- could call up fortitude enough to resume the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 7999 len. 7]: But Mrs Hominy was a traveller .
Parsing [sent. 8000 len. 11]: Mrs Hominy was a writer of reviews and analytical disquisitions .
Parsing [sent. 8001 len. 56]: Mrs Hominy had had her letters from abroad , beginning ` My ever dearest blank , ' and signed ` The Mother of the Modern Gracchi ' -LRB- meaning the married Miss Hominy -RRB- , regularly printed in a public journal , with all the indignation in capitals , and all the sarcasm in italics .
Parsing [sent. 8002 len. 36]: Mrs Hominy had looked on foreign countries with the eye of a perfect republican hot from the model oven ; and Mrs Hominy could talk -LRB- or write -RRB- about them by the hour together .
Parsing [sent. 8003 len. 35]: So Mrs Hominy at last came down on Martin heavily , and as he was fast asleep , she had it all her own way , and bruised him to her heart 's content .
Parsing [sent. 8004 len. 68]: It is no great matter what Mrs Hominy said , save that she had learnt it from the cant of a class , and a large class , of her fellow countrymen , who in their every word , avow themselves to be as senseless to the high principles on which America sprang , a nation , into life , as any Orson in her legislative halls .
Parsing [sent. 8005 len. 60]: Who are no more capable of feeling , or of caring if they did feel , that by reducing their own country to the ebb of honest men 's contempt , they put in hazard the rights of nations yet unborn , and very progress of the human race , than are the swine who wallow in their streets .
Parsing [sent. 8006 len. 23]: Who think that crying out to other nations , old in their iniquity , ` We are no worse than you ! '
Parsing [sent. 8007 len. 5]: -LRB- No worse ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 8008 len. 58]: is high defence and ` vantage-ground enough for that Republic , but yesterday let loose upon her noble course , and but to-day so maimed and lame , so full of sores and ulcers , foul to the eye and almost hopeless to the sense , that her best friends turn from the loathsome creature with disgust .
Parsing [sent. 8009 len. 127]: Who , having by their ancestors declared and won their Independence , because they would not bend the knee to certain Public vices and corruptions , and would not abrogate the truth , run riot in the Bad , and turn their backs upon the Good ; and lying down contented with the wretched boast that other Temples also are of glass , and stones which batter theirs may be flung back ; show themselves , in that alone , as immeasurably behind the import of the trust they hold , and as unworthy to possess it as if the sordid hucksterings of all their little governments -- each one a kingdom in its small depravity -- were brought into a heap for evidence against them .
Parsing [sent. 8010 len. 41]: Martin by degrees became so far awake , that he had a sense of a terrible oppression on his mind ; an imperfect dream that he had murdered a particular friend , and could n't get rid of the body .
Parsing [sent. 8011 len. 13]: When his eyes opened it was staring him full in the face .
Parsing [sent. 8012 len. 44]: There was the horrible Hominy talking deep truths in a melodious snuffle , and pouring forth her mental endowments to such an extent that the Major 's bitterest enemy , hearing her , would have forgiven him from the bottom of his heart .
Parsing [sent. 8013 len. 69]: Martin might have done something desperate if the gong had not sounded for supper ; but sound it did most opportunely ; and having stationed Mrs Hominy at the upper end of the table he took refuge at the lower end himself ; whence , after a hasty meal he stole away , while the lady was yet busied with dried beef and a saucer-full of pickled fixings .
Parsing [sent. 8014 len. 32]: It would be difficult to give an adequate idea of Mrs Hominy 's freshness next day , or of the avidity with which she went headlong into moral philosophy at breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 8015 len. 26]: Some little additional degree of asperity , perhaps , was visible in her features , but not more than the pickles would have naturally produced .
Parsing [sent. 8016 len. 8]: All that day she clung to Martin .
Parsing [sent. 8017 len. 139]: She sat beside him while he received his friends -LRB- for there was another Reception , yet more numerous than the former -RRB- , propounded theories , and answered imaginary objections , so that Martin really began to think he must be dreaming , and speaking for two ; she quoted interminable passages from certain essays on government , written by herself ; used the Major 's pocket-handkerchief as if the snuffle were a temporary malady , of which she was determined to rid herself by some means or other ; and , in short , was such a remarkable companion , that Martin quite settled it between himself and his conscience , that in any new settlement it would be absolutely necessary to have such a person knocked on the head for the general peace of society .
Parsing [sent. 8018 len. 43]: In the meantime Mark was busy , from early in the morning until late at night , in getting on board the steamboat such provisions , tools and other necessaries , as they had been forewarned it would be wise to take .
Parsing [sent. 8019 len. 84]: The purchase of these things , and the settlement of their bill at the National , reduced their finances to so low an ebb , that if the captain had delayed his departure any longer , they would have been in almost as bad a plight as the unfortunate poorer emigrants , who -LRB- seduced on board by solemn advertisement -RRB- had been living on the lower deck a whole week , and exhausting their miserable stock of provisions before the voyage commenced .
Parsing [sent. 8020 len. 14]: There they were , all huddled together with the engine and the fires .
Parsing [sent. 8021 len. 71]: Farmers who had never seen a plough ; woodmen who had never used an axe ; builders who could n't make a box ; cast out of their own land , with not a hand to aid them : newly come into an unknown world , children in helplessness , but men in wants -- with younger children at their backs , to live or die as it might happen !
Parsing [sent. 8022 len. 11]: The morning came , and they would start at noon .
Parsing [sent. 8023 len. 10]: Noon came , and they would start at night .
Parsing [sent. 8024 len. 24]: But nothing is eternal in this world ; not even the procrastination of an American skipper ; and at night all was ready .
Parsing [sent. 8025 len. 72]: Dispirited and weary to the last degree , but a greater lion than ever -LRB- he had done nothing all the afternoon but answer letters from strangers ; half of them about nothing ; half about borrowing money , and all requiring an instantaneous reply -RRB- , Martin walked down to the wharf , through a concourse of people , with Mrs Hominy upon his arm ; and went on board .
Parsing [sent. 8026 len. 34]: But Mark was bent on solving the riddle of this lionship , if he could ; and so , not without the risk of being left behind , ran back to the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 8027 len. 22]: Captain Kedgick was sitting in the colonnade , with a julep on his knee , and a cigar in his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 8028 len. 21]: He caught Mark 's eye , and said : ` Why , what the ` Tarnal brings you here ? '
Parsing [sent. 8029 len. 17]: ` I 'll tell you plainly what it is , Captain , ' said Mark . '
Parsing [sent. 8030 len. 10]: I want to ask you a question . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8031 len. 31]: A man may ASK a question , so he may , ' returned Kedgick ; strongly implying that another man might not answer a question , so he might n't .
Parsing [sent. 8032 len. 15]: ` What have they been making so much of him for , now ? '
Parsing [sent. 8033 len. 5]: said Mark , slyly .
Parsing [sent. 8034 len. 4]: ` Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 8035 len. 14]: ` Our people like ex-citement , ' answered Kedgick , sucking his cigar .
Parsing [sent. 8036 len. 9]: ` But how has he excited 'em ? '
Parsing [sent. 8037 len. 3]: asked Mark .
Parsing [sent. 8038 len. 20]: The Captain looked at him as if he were half inclined to unburden his mind of a capital joke .
Parsing [sent. 8039 len. 6]: ` You air a-going ? '
Parsing [sent. 8040 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 8041 len. 4]: ` Going ! '
Parsing [sent. 8042 len. 3]: cried Mark .
Parsing [sent. 8043 len. 8]: ` Ai n't every moment precious ? '
Parsing [sent. 8044 len. 13]: ` Our people like ex-citement , ' said the Captain , whispering .
Parsing [sent. 8045 len. 34]: ` He ai n't like emigrants in gin ` ral ; and he excited 'em along of this ; ' he winked and burst into a smothered laugh ; ` along of this .
Parsing [sent. 8046 len. 21]: Scadder is a smart man , and -- and -- nobody as goes to Eden ever comes back alive ! '
Parsing [sent. 8047 len. 37]: The wharf was close at hand , and at that instant Mark could hear them shouting out his name ; could even hear Martin calling to him to make haste , or they would be separated .
Parsing [sent. 8048 len. 19]: It was too late to mend the matter , or put any face upon it but the best .
Parsing [sent. 8049 len. 15]: He gave the Captain a parting benediction , and ran off like a race-horse .
Parsing [sent. 8050 len. 3]: ` Mark !
Parsing [sent. 8051 len. 3]: Mark ! '
Parsing [sent. 8052 len. 3]: cried Martin .
Parsing [sent. 8053 len. 8]: ` Here am I , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 8054 len. 20]: shouted Mark , suddenly replying from the edge of the quay , and leaping at a bound on board .
Parsing [sent. 8055 len. 9]: ` Never was half so jolly , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8056 len. 3]: All right .
Parsing [sent. 8057 len. 3]: Haul in !
Parsing [sent. 8058 len. 4]: Go ahead ! '
Parsing [sent. 8059 len. 33]: The sparks from the wood fire streamed upward from the two chimneys , as if the vessel were a great firework just lighted ; and they roared away upon the dark water .
Parsing [sent. 8060 len. 14]: CHAPTER TWENTY -- THREE MARTIN AND HIS PARTNER TAKE POSSESSION OF THEIR ESTATE .
Parsing [sent. 8061 len. 44]: THE JOYFUL OCCASION INVOLVES SOME FURTHER ACCOUNT OF EDEN There happened to be on board the steamboat several gentlemen passengers , of the same stamp as Martin 's New York friend Mr Bevan ; and in their society he was cheerful and happy .
Parsing [sent. 8062 len. 43]: They released him as well as they could from the intellectual entanglements of Mrs Hominy ; and exhibited , in all they said and did , so much good sense and high feeling , that he could not like them too well .
Parsing [sent. 8063 len. 35]: ` If this were a republic of Intellect and Worth , ' he said , ` instead of vapouring and jobbing , they would not want the levers to keep it in motion . '
Parsing [sent. 8064 len. 36]: ` Having good tools , and using bad ones , ' returned Mr Tapley , ` would look as if they was rather a poor sort of carpenters , sir , would n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 8065 len. 3]: Martin nodded .
Parsing [sent. 8066 len. 23]: ` As if their work were infinitely above their powers and purpose , Mark ; and they botched it in consequence . '
Parsing [sent. 8067 len. 53]: ` The best on it is , ' said Mark , ` that when they do happen to make a decent stroke ; such as better workmen , with no such opportunities , make every day of their lives and think nothing of -- they begin to sing out so surprising loud .
Parsing [sent. 8068 len. 8]: Take notice of my words , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8069 len. 77]: If ever the defaulting part of this here country pays its debts -- along of finding that not paying 'em wo n't do in a commercial point of view , you see , and is inconvenient in its consequences -- they 'll take such a shine out of it , and make such bragging speeches , that a man might suppose no borrowed money had ever been paid afore , since the world was first begun .
Parsing [sent. 8070 len. 11]: That 's the way they gammon each other , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8071 len. 7]: Bless you , I know 'em .
Parsing [sent. 8072 len. 9]: Take notice of my words , now ! '
Parsing [sent. 8073 len. 10]: ` You seem to be growing profoundly sagacious ! '
Parsing [sent. 8074 len. 5]: cried Martin , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 8075 len. 33]: ` Whether that is , ' thought Mark , ` because I 'm a day 's journey nearer Eden , and am brightening up afore I die , I ca n't say .
Parsing [sent. 8076 len. 16]: P'rhaps by the time I get there I shall have growed into a prophet . '
Parsing [sent. 8077 len. 33]: He gave no utterance to these sentiments ; but the excessive joviality they inspired within him , and the merriment they brought upon his shining face , were quite enough for Martin .
Parsing [sent. 8078 len. 52]: Although he might sometimes profess to make light of his partner 's inexhaustible cheerfulness , and might sometimes , as in the case of Zephaniah Scadder , find him too jocose a commentator , he was always sensible of the effect of his example in rousing him to hopefulness and courage .
Parsing [sent. 8079 len. 16]: Whether he were in the humour to profit by it , mattered not a jot .
Parsing [sent. 8080 len. 13]: It was contagious , and he could not choose but be affected .
Parsing [sent. 8081 len. 23]: At first they parted with some of their passengers once or twice a day , and took in others to replace them .
Parsing [sent. 8082 len. 39]: But by degrees , the towns upon their route became more thinly scattered ; and for many hours together they would see no other habitations than the huts of the wood-cutters , where the vessel stopped for fuel .
Parsing [sent. 8083 len. 19]: Sky , wood , and water all the livelong day ; and heat that blistered everything it touched .
Parsing [sent. 8084 len. 57]: On they toiled through great solitudes , where the trees upon the banks grew thick and close ; and floatad in the stream ; and held up shrivelled arms from out the river 's depths ; and slid down from the margin of the land , half growing , half decaying , in the miry water .
Parsing [sent. 8085 len. 40]: On through the weary day and melancholy night ; beneath the burning sun , and in the mist and vapour of the evening ; on , until return appeared impossible , and restoration to their home a miserable dream .
Parsing [sent. 8086 len. 30]: They had now but few people on board , and these few were as flat , as dull , and stagnant , as the vegetation that oppressed their eyes .
Parsing [sent. 8087 len. 31]: No sound of cheerfulness or hope was heard ; no pleasant talk beguiled the tardy time ; no little group made common cause against the full depression of the scene .
Parsing [sent. 8088 len. 31]: But that , at certain periods , they swallowed food together from a common trough , it might have been old Charon 's boat , conveying melancholy shades to judgment .
Parsing [sent. 8089 len. 19]: At length they drew near New Thermopylae ; where , that same evening , Mrs Hominy would disembark .
Parsing [sent. 8090 len. 15]: A gleam of comfort sunk into Martin 's bosom when she told him this .
Parsing [sent. 8091 len. 10]: Mark needed none ; but he was not displeased .
Parsing [sent. 8092 len. 11]: It was almost night when they came alongside the landing-place .
Parsing [sent. 8093 len. 27]: A steep bank with an hotel like a barn on the top of it ; a wooden store or two ; and a few scattered sheds .
Parsing [sent. 8094 len. 19]: ` You sleep here to-night , and go on in the morning , I suppose , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 8095 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 8096 len. 9]: ` Where should I go on to ? '
Parsing [sent. 8097 len. 8]: cried the mother of the modern Gracchi .
Parsing [sent. 8098 len. 6]: ` To New Thermopylae . '
Parsing [sent. 8099 len. 3]: ` My !
Parsing [sent. 8100 len. 6]: ai n't I there ? '
Parsing [sent. 8101 len. 4]: said Mrs Hominy .
Parsing [sent. 8102 len. 24]: Martin looked for it all round the darkening panorama ; but he could n't see it , and was obliged to say so .
Parsing [sent. 8103 len. 7]: ` Why that 's it ! '
Parsing [sent. 8104 len. 11]: cried Mrs Hominy , pointing to the sheds just mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 8105 len. 4]: ` THAT ! '
Parsing [sent. 8106 len. 3]: exclaimed Martin .
Parsing [sent. 8107 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 8108 len. 26]: that ; and work it which way you will , it whips Eden , ' said Mrs Hominy , nodding her head with great expression .
Parsing [sent. 8109 len. 29]: The married Miss Hominy , who had come on board with her husband , gave to this statement her most unqualified support , as did that gentleman also .
Parsing [sent. 8110 len. 59]: Martin gratefully declined their invitation to regale himself at their house during the half hour of the vessel 's stay ; and having escorted Mrs Hominy and the red pocket-handkerchief -LRB- which was still on active service -RRB- safely across the gangway , returned in a thoughtful mood to watch the emigrants as they removed their goods ashore .
Parsing [sent. 8111 len. 57]: Mark , as he stood beside him , glanced in his face from time to time ; anxious to discover what effect this dialogue had had upon him , and not unwilling that his hopes should be dashed before they reached their destination , so that the blow he feared might be broken in its fall .
Parsing [sent. 8112 len. 37]: But saving that he sometimes looked up quickly at the poor erections on the hill , he gave him no clue to what was passing in his mind , until they were again upon their way .
Parsing [sent. 8113 len. 26]: ` Mark , ' he said then , ` are there really none but ourselves on board this boat who are bound for Eden ? '
Parsing [sent. 8114 len. 7]: ` None at all , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8115 len. 23]: Most of 'em , as you know , have stopped short ; and the few that are left are going further on .
Parsing [sent. 8116 len. 4]: What matters that !
Parsing [sent. 8117 len. 9]: More room there for us , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 8118 len. 8]: ` Oh , to be sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 8119 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 8120 len. 12]: ` But I was thinking -- ' and there he paused .
Parsing [sent. 8121 len. 6]: ` Yes , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8122 len. 3]: observed Mark .
Parsing [sent. 8123 len. 52]: ` How odd it was that the people should have arranged to try their fortune at a wretched hole like that , for instance , when there is such a much better , and such a very different kind of place , near at hand , as one may say . '
Parsing [sent. 8124 len. 33]: He spoke in a tone so very different from his usual confidence , and with such an obvious dread of Mark 's reply , that the good-natured fellow was full of pity .
Parsing [sent. 8125 len. 33]: ` Why , you know , sir , ' said Mark , as gently as he could by any means insinuate the observation , ` we must guard against being too sanguine .
Parsing [sent. 8126 len. 28]: There 's no occasion for it , either , because we 're determined to make the best of everything , after we know the worst of it .
Parsing [sent. 8127 len. 7]: Ai n't we , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8128 len. 11]: Martin looked at him , but answered not a word .
Parsing [sent. 8129 len. 16]: ` Even Eden , you know , ai n't all built , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 8130 len. 28]: ` In the name of Heaven , man , ' cried Martin angrily , ` do n't talk of Eden in the same breath with that place .
Parsing [sent. 8131 len. 4]: Are you mad ?
Parsing [sent. 8132 len. 6]: There -- God forgive me !
Parsing [sent. 8133 len. 12]: -- do n't think harshly of me for my temper ! '
Parsing [sent. 8134 len. 19]: After that , he turned away , and walked to and fro upon the deck full two hours .
Parsing [sent. 8135 len. 35]: Nor did he speak again , except to say ` Good night , ' until next day ; nor even then upon this subject , but on other topics quite foreign to the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 8136 len. 58]: As they proceeded further on their track , and came more and more towards their journey 's end , the monotonous desolation of the scene increased to that degree , that for any redeeming feature it presented to their eyes , they might have entered , in the body , on the grim domains of Giant Despair .
Parsing [sent. 8137 len. 132]: A flat morass , bestrewn with fallen timber ; a marsh on which the good growth of the earth seemed to have been wrecked and cast away , that from its decomposing ashes vile and ugly things might rise ; where the very trees took the aspect of huge weeds , begotten of the slime from which they sprung , by the hot sun that burnt them up ; where fatal maladies , seeking whom they might infect , came forth at night in misty shapes , and creeping out upon the water , hunted them like spectres until day ; where even the blessed sun , shining down on festering elements of corruption and disease , became a horror ; this was the realm of Hope through which they moved .
Parsing [sent. 8138 len. 5]: At last they stopped .
Parsing [sent. 8139 len. 4]: At Eden too .
Parsing [sent. 8140 len. 30]: The waters of the Deluge might have left it but a week before ; so choked with slime and matted growth was the hideous swamp which bore that name .
Parsing [sent. 8141 len. 25]: There being no depth of water close in shore , they landed from the vessel 's boat , with all their goods beside them .
Parsing [sent. 8142 len. 43]: There were a few log-houses visible among the dark trees ; the best , a cow-shed or a rude stable ; but for the wharves , the market-place , the public buildings -- ` Here comes an Edener , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 8143 len. 12]: ` He 'll get us help to carry these things up .
Parsing [sent. 8144 len. 7]: Keep a good heart , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8145 len. 4]: Hallo there ! '
Parsing [sent. 8146 len. 18]: The man advanced toward them through the thickening gloom , very slowly ; leaning on a stick .
Parsing [sent. 8147 len. 26]: As he drew nearer , they observed that he was pale and worn , and that his anxious eyes were deeply sunken in his head .
Parsing [sent. 8148 len. 18]: His dress of homespun blue hung about him in rags ; his feet and head were bare .
Parsing [sent. 8149 len. 16]: He sat down on a stump half-way , and beckoned them to come to him .
Parsing [sent. 8150 len. 28]: When they complied , he put his hand upon his side as if in pain , and while he fetched his breath stared at them , wondering .
Parsing [sent. 8151 len. 4]: ` Strangers ! '
Parsing [sent. 8152 len. 10]: he exclaimed , as soon as he could speak .
Parsing [sent. 8153 len. 9]: ` The very same , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 8154 len. 8]: ` How are you , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8155 len. 15]: ` I 've had the fever very bad , ' he answered faintly . '
Parsing [sent. 8156 len. 9]: I have n't stood upright these many weeks .
Parsing [sent. 8157 len. 13]: Those are your notions I see , ' pointing to their property .
Parsing [sent. 8158 len. 13]: ` Yes , sir , ' said Mark , ` they are .
Parsing [sent. 8159 len. 30]: You could n't recommend us some one as would lend a hand to help carry 'em up to the -- to the town , could you , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8160 len. 35]: ` My eldest son would do it if he could , ' replied the man ; ` but today he has his chill upon him , and is lying wrapped up in the blankets .
Parsing [sent. 8161 len. 7]: My youngest died last week . '
Parsing [sent. 8162 len. 24]: ` I 'm sorry for it , governor , with all my heart , ' said Mark , shaking him by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 8163 len. 6]: ` Do n't mind us .
Parsing [sent. 8164 len. 14]: Come along with me , and I 'll give you an arm back .
Parsing [sent. 8165 len. 26]: The goods is safe enough , sir ' -- to Martin -- ` there ai n't many people about , to make away with 'em .
Parsing [sent. 8166 len. 7]: What a comfort that is ! '
Parsing [sent. 8167 len. 8]: ` No , ' cried the man .
Parsing [sent. 8168 len. 28]: ` You must look for such folk here , ' knocking his stick upon the ground , ` or yonder in the bush , towards the north .
Parsing [sent. 8169 len. 7]: We 've buried most of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 8170 len. 6]: The rest have gone away .
Parsing [sent. 8171 len. 14]: Them that we have here , do n't come out at night . '
Parsing [sent. 8172 len. 13]: ` The night air ai n't quite wholesome , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 8173 len. 3]: said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 8174 len. 13]: ` It 's deadly poison , ' was the settler 's answer .
Parsing [sent. 8175 len. 44]: Mark showed no more uneasiness than if it had been commended to him as ambrosia ; but he gave the man his arm , and as they went along explained to him the nature of their purchase , and inquired where it lay .
Parsing [sent. 8176 len. 44]: Close to his own log-house , he said ; so close that he had used their dwelling as a store-house for some corn ; they must excuse it that night , but he would endeavour to get it taken out upon the morrow .
Parsing [sent. 8177 len. 43]: He then gave them to understand , as an additional scrap of local chit-chat , that he had buried the last proprietor with his own hands ; a piece of information which Mark also received without the least abatement of his equanimity .
Parsing [sent. 8178 len. 49]: In a word , he conducted them to a miserable cabin , rudely constructed of the trunks of trees ; the door of which had either fallen down or been carried away long ago ; and which was consequently open to the wild landscape and the dark night .
Parsing [sent. 8179 len. 39]: Saving for the little store he had mentioned , it was perfectly bare of all furniture ; but they had left a chest upon the landing-place , and he gave them a rude torch in lieu of candle .
Parsing [sent. 8180 len. 32]: This latter acquisition Mark planted in the earth , and then declaring that the mansion ` looked quite comfortable , ' hurried Martin off again to help bring up the chest .
Parsing [sent. 8181 len. 42]: And all the way to the landing-place and back , Mark talked incessantly ; as if he would infuse into his partner 's breast some faint belief that they had arrived under the most auspicious and cheerful of all imaginable circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 8182 len. 38]: But many a man who would have stood within a home dismantled , strong in his passion and design of vengeance , has had the firmness of his nature conquered by the razing of an air-built castle .
Parsing [sent. 8183 len. 21]: When the log-hut received them for the second time , Martin laid down upon the ground , and wept aloud .
Parsing [sent. 8184 len. 8]: ` Lord love you , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 8185 len. 14]: cried Mr Tapley , in great terror ; ` Do n't do that !
Parsing [sent. 8186 len. 7]: Do n't do that , sir !
Parsing [sent. 8187 len. 4]: Anything but that !
Parsing [sent. 8188 len. 23]: It never helped man , woman , or child , over the lowest fence yet , sir , and it never will .
Parsing [sent. 8189 len. 31]: Besides its being of no use to you , it 's worse than of no use to me , for the least sound of it will knock me flat down .
Parsing [sent. 8190 len. 10]: I ca n't stand up agin it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8191 len. 5]: Anything but that ! '
Parsing [sent. 8192 len. 46]: There is no doubt he spoke the truth , for the extraordinary alarm with which he looked at Martin as he paused upon his knees before the chest , in the act of unlocking it , to say these words , sufficiently confirmed him . '
Parsing [sent. 8193 len. 17]: I ask your forgiveness a thousand times , my dear fellow , ' said Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 8194 len. 15]: I could n't have helped it , if death had been the penalty . '
Parsing [sent. 8195 len. 6]: ` Ask my forgiveness ! '
Parsing [sent. 8196 len. 16]: said Mark , with his accustomed cheerfulness , as he proceeded to unpack the chest .
Parsing [sent. 8197 len. 11]: ` The head partner a-asking forgiveness of Co. , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 8198 len. 12]: There must be something wrong in the firm when that happens .
Parsing [sent. 8199 len. 13]: I must have the books inspected and the accounts gone over immediate .
Parsing [sent. 8200 len. 4]: Here we are .
Parsing [sent. 8201 len. 6]: Everything in its proper place .
Parsing [sent. 8202 len. 6]: Here 's the salt pork .
Parsing [sent. 8203 len. 5]: Here 's the biscuit .
Parsing [sent. 8204 len. 5]: Here 's the whiskey .
Parsing [sent. 8205 len. 6]: Uncommon good it smells too .
Parsing [sent. 8206 len. 6]: Here 's the tin pot .
Parsing [sent. 8207 len. 11]: This tin pot 's a small fortun ' in itself !
Parsing [sent. 8208 len. 5]: Here 's the blankets .
Parsing [sent. 8209 len. 5]: Here 's the axe .
Parsing [sent. 8210 len. 11]: Who says we ai n't got a first-rate fit out ?
Parsing [sent. 8211 len. 25]: I feel as if I was a cadet gone out to Indy , and my noble father was chairman of the Board of Directors .
Parsing [sent. 8212 len. 47]: Now , when I 've got some water from the stream afore the door and mixed the grog , ' cried Mark , running out to suit the action to the word , ` there 's a supper ready , comprising every delicacy of the season .
Parsing [sent. 8213 len. 9]: Here we are , sir , all complete .
Parsing [sent. 8214 len. 11]: For what we are going to receive , et cetrer .
Parsing [sent. 8215 len. 15]: Lord bless you , sir , it 's very like a gipsy party ! '
Parsing [sent. 8216 len. 18]: It was impossible not to take heart , in the company of such a man as this .
Parsing [sent. 8217 len. 20]: Martin sat upon the ground beside the box ; took out his knife ; and ate and drank sturdily .
Parsing [sent. 8218 len. 33]: ` Now you see , ' said Mark , when they had made a hearty meal ; ` with your knife and mine , I sticks this blanket right afore the door .
Parsing [sent. 8219 len. 15]: Or where , in a state of high civilization , the door would be .
Parsing [sent. 8220 len. 6]: And very neat it looks .
Parsing [sent. 8221 len. 14]: Then I stops the aperture below , by putting the chest agin it .
Parsing [sent. 8222 len. 6]: And very neat THAT looks .
Parsing [sent. 8223 len. 8]: Then there 's your blanket , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8224 len. 5]: Then here 's mine .
Parsing [sent. 8225 len. 12]: And what 's to hinder our passing a good night ? '
Parsing [sent. 8226 len. 14]: For all his light-hearted speaking , it was long before he slept himself .
Parsing [sent. 8227 len. 34]: He wrapped his blanket round him , put the axe ready to his hand , and lay across the threshold of the door ; too anxious and too watchful to close his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 8228 len. 57]: The novelty of their dreary situation , the dread of some rapacious animal or human enemy , the terrible uncertainty of their means of subsistence , the apprehension of death , the immense distance and the hosts of obstacles between themselves and England , were fruitful sources of disquiet in the deep silence of the night .
Parsing [sent. 8229 len. 25]: Though Martin would have had him think otherwise , Mark felt that he was waking also , and a prey to the same reflections .
Parsing [sent. 8230 len. 45]: This was almost worse than all , for if he began to brood over their miseries instead of trying to make head against them there could be little doubt that such a state of mind would powerfully assist the influence of the pestilent climate .
Parsing [sent. 8231 len. 33]: Never had the light of day been half so welcome to his eyes , as when awaking from a fitful doze , Mark saw it shining through the blanket in the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 8232 len. 37]: He stole out gently , for his companion was sleeping now ; and having refreshed himself by washing in the river , where it snowed before the door , took a rough survey of the settlement .
Parsing [sent. 8233 len. 24]: There were not above a score of cabins in the whole ; half of these appeared untenanted ; all were rotten and decayed .
Parsing [sent. 8234 len. 25]: The most tottering , abject , and forlorn among them was called , with great propriety , the Bank , and National Credit Office .
Parsing [sent. 8235 len. 21]: It had some feeble props about it , but was settling deep down in the mud , past all recovery .
Parsing [sent. 8236 len. 43]: Here and there an effort had been made to clear the land , and something like a field had been marked out , where , among the stumps and ashes of burnt trees , a scanty crop of Indian corn was growing .
Parsing [sent. 8237 len. 37]: In some quarters , a snake or zigzag fence had been begun , but in no instance had it been completed ; and the felled logs , half hidden in the soil , lay mouldering away .
Parsing [sent. 8238 len. 47]: Three or four meagre dogs , wasted and vexed with hunger ; some long-legged pigs , wandering away into the woods in search of food ; some children , nearly naked , gazing at him from the huts ; were all the living things he saw .
Parsing [sent. 8239 len. 46]: A fetid vapour , hot and sickening as the breath of an oven , rose up from the earth , and hung on everything around ; and as his foot-prints sunk into the marshy ground , a black ooze started forth to blot them out .
Parsing [sent. 8240 len. 7]: Their own land was mere forest .
Parsing [sent. 8241 len. 33]: The trees had grown so think and close that they shouldered one another out of their places , and the weakest , forced into shapes of strange distortion , languished like cripples .
Parsing [sent. 8242 len. 82]: The best were stunted , from the pressure and the want of room ; and high about the stems of all grew long rank grass , dank weeds , and frowsy underwood ; not divisible into their separate kinds , but tangled all together in a heap ; a jungle deep and dark , with neither earth nor water at its roots , but putrid matter , formed of the pulpy offal of the two , and of their own corruption .
Parsing [sent. 8243 len. 46]: He went down to the landing-place where they had left their goods last night ; and there he found some half-dozen men -- wan and forlorn to look at , but ready enough to assist -- who helped him to carry them to the log-house .
Parsing [sent. 8244 len. 18]: They shook their heads in speaking of the settlement , and had no comfort to give him .
Parsing [sent. 8245 len. 13]: Those who had the means of going away had all deserted it .
Parsing [sent. 8246 len. 23]: They who were left had lost their wives , their children , friends , or brothers there , and suffered much themselves .
Parsing [sent. 8247 len. 16]: Most of them were ill then ; none were the men they had been once .
Parsing [sent. 8248 len. 24]: They frankly offered their assistance and advice , and , leaving him for that time , went sadly off upon their several tasks .
Parsing [sent. 8249 len. 18]: Martin was by this time stirring ; but he had greatly changed , even in one night .
Parsing [sent. 8250 len. 30]: He was very pale and languid ; he spoke of pains and weakness in his limbs , and complained that his sight was dim , and his voice feeble .
Parsing [sent. 8251 len. 87]: Increasing in his own briskness as the prospect grew more and more dismal , Mark brought away a door from one of the deserted houses , and fitted it to their own habitation ; then went back again for a rude bench he had observed , with which he presently returned in triumph ; and having put this piece of furniture outside the house , arranged the notable tin pot and other such movables upon it , that it might represent a dresser or a sideboard .
Parsing [sent. 8252 len. 33]: Greatly satisfied with this arrangement , he next rolled their cask of flour into the house and set it up on end in one corner , where it served for a side-table .
Parsing [sent. 8253 len. 20]: No better dining-table could be required than the chest , which he solemnly devoted to that useful service thenceforth .
Parsing [sent. 8254 len. 16]: Their blankets , clothes , and the like , he hung on pegs and nails .
Parsing [sent. 8255 len. 78]: And lastly , he brought forth a great placard -LRB- which Martin in the exultation of his heart had prepared with his own hands at the National Hotel -RRB- bearing the inscription , CHUZZLEWIT & CO. , ARCHITECTS AND SURVEYORS , which he displayed upon the most conspicuous part of the premises , with as much gravity as if the thriving city of Eden had a real existence , and they expected to be overwhelmed with business .
Parsing [sent. 8256 len. 44]: ` These here tools , ' said Mark , bringing forward Martin 's case of instruments and sticking the compasses upright in a stump before the door , ` shall be set out in the open air to show that we come provided .
Parsing [sent. 8257 len. 26]: And now , if any gentleman wants a house built , he 'd better give his orders , afore we 're other ways bespoke . '
Parsing [sent. 8258 len. 55]: Considering the intense heat of the weather , this was not a bad morning 's work ; but without pausing for a moment , though he was streaming at every pore , Mark vanished into the house again , and presently reappeared with a hatchet ; intent on performing some impossibilities with that implement .
Parsing [sent. 8259 len. 25]: ` Here 's ugly old tree in the way , sir , ' he observed , ` which 'll be all the better down .
Parsing [sent. 8260 len. 9]: We can build the oven in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 8261 len. 13]: There never was such a handy spot for clay as Eden is .
Parsing [sent. 8262 len. 7]: That 's convenient , anyhow . '
Parsing [sent. 8263 len. 7]: But Martin gave him no answer .
Parsing [sent. 8264 len. 48]: He had sat the whole time with his head upon his hands , gazing at the current as it rolled swiftly by ; thinking , perhaps , how fast it moved towards the open sea , the high road to the home he never would behold again .
Parsing [sent. 8265 len. 18]: Not even the vigorous strokes which Mark dealt at the tree awoke him from his mournful meditation .
Parsing [sent. 8266 len. 21]: Finding all his endeavours to rouse him of no use , Mark stopped in his work and came towards him .
Parsing [sent. 8267 len. 13]: ` Do n't give in , sir , ' said Mr Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 8268 len. 27]: ` Oh , Mark , ' returned his friend , ` what have I done in all my life that has deserved this heavy fate ? '
Parsing [sent. 8269 len. 40]: ` Why , sir , ' returned Mark , ` for the matter of that , everybody as is here might say the same thing ; many of 'em with better reason p ` raps than you or me .
Parsing [sent. 8270 len. 5]: Hold up , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8271 len. 3]: Do something .
Parsing [sent. 8272 len. 26]: Could n't you ease your mind , now , do n't you think , by making some personal obserwations in a letter to Scadder ? '
Parsing [sent. 8273 len. 19]: ` No , ' said Martin , shaking his head sorrowfully : ' I am past that . '
Parsing [sent. 8274 len. 27]: ` But if you 're past that already , ' returned Mark , ` you must be ill , and ought to be attended to . '
Parsing [sent. 8275 len. 10]: ` Do n't mind me , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 8276 len. 9]: ` Do the best you can for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 8277 len. 9]: You 'll soon have only yourself to consider .
Parsing [sent. 8278 len. 15]: And then God speed you home , and forgive me for bringing you here !
Parsing [sent. 8279 len. 9]: I am destined to die in this place .
Parsing [sent. 8280 len. 12]: I felt it the instant I set foot upon the shore .
Parsing [sent. 8281 len. 15]: Sleeping or waking , Mark , I dreamed it all last night . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8282 len. 22]: I said you must be ill , ' returned Mark , tenderly , ` and now I 'm sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 8283 len. 23]: A touch of fever and ague caught on these rivers , I dare say ; but bless you , THAT 'S nothing .
Parsing [sent. 8284 len. 18]: It 's only a seasoning , and we must all be seasoned , one way or another .
Parsing [sent. 8285 len. 13]: That 's religion that is , you know , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 8286 len. 8]: He only sighed and shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 8287 len. 51]: ` Wait half a minute , ' said Mark cheerily , 'till I run up to one of our neighbours and ask what 's best to be took , and borrow a little of it to give you ; and to-morrow you 'll find yourself as strong as ever again .
Parsing [sent. 8288 len. 8]: I wo n't be gone a minute .
Parsing [sent. 8289 len. 14]: Do n't give in while I 'm away , whatever you do ! '
Parsing [sent. 8290 len. 29]: Throwing down his hatchet , he sped away immediately , but stopped when he had got a little distance , and looked back ; then hurried on again .
Parsing [sent. 8291 len. 35]: ` Now , Mr Tapley , ' said Mark , giving himself a tremendous blow in the chest by way of reviver , ` just you attend to what I 've got to say .
Parsing [sent. 8292 len. 14]: Things is looking about as bad as they CAN look , young man .
Parsing [sent. 8293 len. 23]: You 'll not have such another opportunity for showing your jolly disposition , my fine fellow , as long as you live .
Parsing [sent. 8294 len. 18]: And therefore , Tapley , Now 's your time to come out strong ; or Never ! '
Parsing [sent. 8295 len. 25]: CHAPTER TWENTY -- FOUR REPORTS PROGRESS IN CERTAIN HOMELY MATTERS OF LOVE , HATRED , JEALOUSY , AND REVENGE ` Hallo , Pecksniff ! '
Parsing [sent. 8296 len. 7]: cried Mr Jonas from the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 8297 len. 15]: ` Is n't somebody a-going to open that precious old door of yours ? '
Parsing [sent. 8298 len. 6]: ` Immediately , Mr Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 8299 len. 3]: Immediately . '
Parsing [sent. 8300 len. 16]: ` Ecod , ' muttered the orphan , ` not before it 's time neither .
Parsing [sent. 8301 len. 55]: Whoever it is , has knocked three times , and each one loud enough to wake the -- ' he had such a repugnance to the idea of waking the Dead , that he stopped even then with the words upon his tongue , and said , instead , ` the Seven Sleepers . '
Parsing [sent. 8302 len. 12]: ` Immediately , Mr Jonas ; immediately , ' repeated Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 8303 len. 55]: ` Thomas Pinch ' -- he could n't make up his mind , in his great agitation , whether to call Tom his dear friend or a villain , so he shook his fist at him PRO TEM -- ` go up to my daughters ' room , and tell them who is here .
Parsing [sent. 8304 len. 4]: Say , Silence .
Parsing [sent. 8305 len. 2]: Silence !
Parsing [sent. 8306 len. 7]: Do you hear me , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 8307 len. 6]: ` Directly , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8308 len. 16]: cried Tom , departing , in a state of much amazement , on his errand .
Parsing [sent. 8309 len. 10]: ` You 'll -- ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 8310 len. 21]: -- you 'll excuse me , Mr Jonas , if I close this door a moment , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 8311 len. 3]: said Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 8312 len. 8]: ` This may be a professional call .
Parsing [sent. 8313 len. 8]: Indeed I am pretty sure it is .
Parsing [sent. 8314 len. 4]: Thank you . '
Parsing [sent. 8315 len. 54]: Then Mr Pecksniff , gently warbling a rustic stave , put on his garden hat , seized a spade , and opened the street door ; calmly appearing on the threshold , as if he thought he had , from his vineyard , heard a modest rap , but was not quite certain .
Parsing [sent. 8316 len. 29]: Seeing a gentleman and lady before him , he started back in as much confusion as a good man with a crystal conscience might betray in mere surprise .
Parsing [sent. 8317 len. 16]: Recognition came upon him the next moment , and he cried : ` Mr Chuzzlewit !
Parsing [sent. 8318 len. 6]: Can I believe my eyes !
Parsing [sent. 8319 len. 8]: My dear sir ; my good sir !
Parsing [sent. 8320 len. 9]: A joyful hour , a happy hour indeed .
Parsing [sent. 8321 len. 9]: Pray , my dear sir , walk in .
Parsing [sent. 8322 len. 7]: You find me in my garden-dress .
Parsing [sent. 8323 len. 8]: You will excuse it , I know .
Parsing [sent. 8324 len. 8]: It is an ancient pursuit , gardening .
Parsing [sent. 8325 len. 6]: Primitive , my dear sir .
Parsing [sent. 8326 len. 16]: Or , if I am not mistaken , Adam was the first of our calling .
Parsing [sent. 8327 len. 49]: MY Eve , I grieve to say is no more , sir ; but ' -- here he pointed to his spade , and shook his head as if he were not cheerful without an effort -- ` but I do a little bit of Adam still . '
Parsing [sent. 8328 len. 26]: He had by this time got them into the best parlour , where the portrait by Spiller , and the bust by Spoker , were .
Parsing [sent. 8329 len. 14]: ` My daughters , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` will be overjoyed .
Parsing [sent. 8330 len. 42]: If I could feel weary upon such a theme , I should have been worn out long ago , my dear sir , by their constant anticipation of this happiness and their repeated allusions to our meeting at Mrs Todgers 's .
Parsing [sent. 8331 len. 38]: Their fair young friend , too , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` whom they so desire to know and love -- indeed to know her , is to love -- I hope I see her well .
Parsing [sent. 8332 len. 13]: I hope in saying , `` Welcome to my humble roof ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8333 len. 9]: I find some echo in her own sentiments .
Parsing [sent. 8334 len. 16]: If features are an index to the heart , I have no fears of that .
Parsing [sent. 8335 len. 19]: An extremely engaging expression of countenance , Mr Chuzzlewit , my dear sir -- very much so ! '
Parsing [sent. 8336 len. 15]: ` Mary , ' said the old man , ` Mr Pecksniff flatters you .
Parsing [sent. 8337 len. 9]: But flattery from him is worth the having .
Parsing [sent. 8338 len. 15]: He is not a dealer in it , and it comes from his heart .
Parsing [sent. 8339 len. 12]: We thought Mr -- ' ` Pinch , ' said Mary .
Parsing [sent. 8340 len. 12]: ` Mr Pinch would have arrived before us , Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 8341 len. 75]: ` He did arrive before you , my dear sir , ' retorted Pecksniff , raising his voice for the edification of Tom upon the stairs , ` and was about , I dare say , to tell me of your coming , when I begged him first to knock at my daughters ' chamber , and inquire after Charity , my dear child , who is not so well as I could wish .
Parsing [sent. 8342 len. 22]: No , ' said Mr Pecksniff , answering their looks , ' I am sorry to say , she is not .
Parsing [sent. 8343 len. 15]: It is merely an hysterical affection ; nothing more , I am not uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 8344 len. 3]: Mr Pinch !
Parsing [sent. 8345 len. 3]: Thomas ! '
Parsing [sent. 8346 len. 8]: exclaimed Pecksniff , in his kindest accents .
Parsing [sent. 8347 len. 5]: ` Pray come in .
Parsing [sent. 8348 len. 8]: I shall make no stranger of you .
Parsing [sent. 8349 len. 19]: Thomas is a friend of mine , of rather long-standing , Mr Chuzzlewit , you must know . '
Parsing [sent. 8350 len. 10]: ` Thank you , sir , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 8351 len. 25]: ` You introduce me very kindly , and speak of me in terms of which I am very proud ' ` Old Thomas ! '
Parsing [sent. 8352 len. 11]: cried his master , pleasantly ` God bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 8353 len. 30]: Tom reported that the young ladies would appear directly , and that the best refreshments which the house afforded were even then in preparation , under their joint superintendence .
Parsing [sent. 8354 len. 48]: While he was speaking , the old man looked at him intently , though with less harshness than was common to him ; nor did the mutual embarrassment of Tom and the young lady , to whatever cause he attributed it , seem to escape his observation .
Parsing [sent. 8355 len. 32]: ` Pecksniff , ' he said after a pause , rising and taking him aside towards the window , ' I was much shocked on hearing of my brother 's death .
Parsing [sent. 8356 len. 8]: We had been strangers for many years .
Parsing [sent. 8357 len. 24]: My only comfort is that he must have lived the happier and better man for having associated no hopes or schemes with me .
Parsing [sent. 8358 len. 5]: Peace to his memory !
Parsing [sent. 8359 len. 21]: We were play-fellows once ; and it would have been better for us both if we had died then . '
Parsing [sent. 8360 len. 26]: Finding him in this gentle mood , Mr Pecksniff began to see another way out of his difficulties , besides the casting overboard of Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 8361 len. 30]: ` That any man , my dear sir , could possibly be the happier for not knowing you , ' he returned , ` you will excuse my doubting .
Parsing [sent. 8362 len. 67]: But that Mr Anthony , in the evening of his life , was happier in the affection of his excellent son -- a pattern , my dear sir , a pattern to all sons -- and in the care of a distant relation who , however lowly in his means of serving him , had no bounds to his inclination ; I can inform you . '
Parsing [sent. 8363 len. 6]: ` How 's this ? '
Parsing [sent. 8364 len. 5]: said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 8365 len. 8]: ` You are not a legatee ? '
Parsing [sent. 8366 len. 28]: ` You do n't , ' said Mr Pecksniff , with a melancholy pressure of his hand , ` quite understand my nature yet , I find .
Parsing [sent. 8367 len. 10]: No , sir , I am not a legatee .
Parsing [sent. 8368 len. 11]: I am proud to say I am not a legatee .
Parsing [sent. 8369 len. 14]: I am proud to say that neither of my children is a legatee .
Parsing [sent. 8370 len. 14]: And yet , sir , I was with him at his own request .
Parsing [sent. 8371 len. 8]: HE understood me somewhat better , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8372 len. 10]: He wrote and said , `` I am sick .
Parsing [sent. 8373 len. 4]: I am sinking .
Parsing [sent. 8374 len. 5]: Come to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8375 len. 5]: I went to him .
Parsing [sent. 8376 len. 15]: I sat beside his bed , sir , and I stood beside his grave .
Parsing [sent. 8377 len. 16]: Yes , at the risk of offending even you , I did it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8378 len. 30]: Though the avowal should lead to our instant separation , and to the severing of those tender ties between us which have recently been formed , I make it .
Parsing [sent. 8379 len. 25]: But I am not a legatee , ' said Mr Pecksniff , smiling dispassionately ; ` and I never expected to be a legatee .
Parsing [sent. 8380 len. 5]: I knew better ! '
Parsing [sent. 8381 len. 7]: ` His son a pattern ! '
Parsing [sent. 8382 len. 4]: cried old Martin .
Parsing [sent. 8383 len. 8]: ` How can you tell me that ?
Parsing [sent. 8384 len. 17]: My brother had in his wealth the usual doom of wealth , and root of misery .
Parsing [sent. 8385 len. 24]: He carried his corrupting influence with him , go where he would ; and shed it round him , even on his hearth .
Parsing [sent. 8386 len. 37]: It made of his own child a greedy expectant , who measured every day and hour the lessening distance between his father and the grave , and cursed his tardy progress on that dismal road . '
Parsing [sent. 8387 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 8388 len. 6]: cried Mr Pecksniff , boldly .
Parsing [sent. 8389 len. 8]: ` Not at all , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 8390 len. 29]: ` But I saw that shadow in his house , ' said Martin Chuzzlewit , ` the last time we met , and warned him of its presence .
Parsing [sent. 8391 len. 12]: I know it when I see it , do I not ?
Parsing [sent. 8392 len. 13]: I , who have lived within it all these years ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 8393 len. 12]: I deny it , ' Mr Pecksniff answered , warmly . '
Parsing [sent. 8394 len. 5]: I deny it altogether .
Parsing [sent. 8395 len. 25]: That bereaved young man is now in this house , sir , seeking in change of scene the peace of mind he has lost .
Parsing [sent. 8396 len. 55]: Shall I be backward in doing justice to that young man , when even undertakers and coffin-makers have been moved by the conduct he has exhibited ; when even mutes have spoken in his praise , and the medical man has n't known what to do with himself in the excitement of his feelings !
Parsing [sent. 8397 len. 18]: There is a person of the name of Gamp , sir -- Mrs Gamp -- ask her .
Parsing [sent. 8398 len. 9]: She saw Mr Jonas in a trying time .
Parsing [sent. 8399 len. 5]: Ask HER , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8400 len. 14]: She is respectable , but not sentimental , and will state the fact .
Parsing [sent. 8401 len. 30]: A line addressed to Mrs Gamp , at the BirdShop , Kingsgate Street , High Holborn , London , will meet with every attention , I have no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 8402 len. 9]: Let her be examined , my good sir .
Parsing [sent. 8403 len. 5]: Strike , but hear !
Parsing [sent. 8404 len. 8]: Leap , Mr Chuzzlewit , but look !
Parsing [sent. 8405 len. 35]: Forgive me , my dear sir , ' said Mr Pecksniff , taking both his hands , ` if I am warm ; but I am honest , and must state the truth . '
Parsing [sent. 8406 len. 22]: In proof of the character he gave himself , Mr Pecksniff suffered tears of honesty to ooze out of his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 8407 len. 23]: The old man gazed at him for a moment with a look of wonder , repeating to himself , ` Here now !
Parsing [sent. 8408 len. 5]: In this house ! '
Parsing [sent. 8409 len. 20]: But he mastered his surprise , and said , after a pause : ` Let me see him . '
Parsing [sent. 8410 len. 10]: ` In a friendly spirit , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 8411 len. 4]: said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 8412 len. 18]: ` Forgive me , sir but he is in the receipt of my humble hospitality . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8413 len. 15]: I said , ' replied the old man , ` let me see him .
Parsing [sent. 8414 len. 24]: If I were disposed to regard him in any other than a friendly spirit , I should have said keep us apart . '
Parsing [sent. 8415 len. 7]: ` Certainly , my dear sir .
Parsing [sent. 8416 len. 4]: So you would .
Parsing [sent. 8417 len. 8]: You are frankness itself , I know .
Parsing [sent. 8418 len. 32]: I will break this happiness to him , ' said Mr Pecksniff , as he left the room , ` if you will excuse me for a minute -- gently . '
Parsing [sent. 8419 len. 25]: He paved the way to the disclosure so very gently , that a quarter of an hour elapsed before he returned with Mr Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 8420 len. 25]: In the meantime the young ladies had made their appearance , and the table had been set out for the refreshment of the travellers .
Parsing [sent. 8421 len. 60]: Now , however well Mr Pecksniff , in his morality , had taught Jonas the lesson of dutiful behaviour to his uncle , and however perfectly Jonas , in the cunning of his nature , had learnt it , that young man 's bearing , when presented to his father 's brother , was anything but manly or engaging .
Parsing [sent. 8422 len. 87]: Perhaps , indeed , so singular a mixture of defiance and obsequiousness , of fear and hardihood , of dogged sullenness and an attempt at enraging and propitiation , never was expressed in any one human figure as in that of Jonas , when , having raised his downcast eyes to Martin 's face , he let them fall again , and uneasily closing and unclosing his hands without a moment 's intermission , stood swinging himself from side to side , waiting to be addressed .
Parsing [sent. 8423 len. 9]: ` Nephew , ' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 8424 len. 12]: ` You have been a dutiful son , I hear . '
Parsing [sent. 8425 len. 23]: ` As dutiful as sons in general , I suppose , ' returned Jonas , looking up and down once more . '
Parsing [sent. 8426 len. 27]: I do n't brag to have been any better than other sons ; but I have n't been any worse , I dare say . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8427 len. 21]: A pattern to all sons , I am told , ' said the old man , glancing towards Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 8428 len. 4]: ` Ecod ! '
Parsing [sent. 8429 len. 30]: said Jonas , looking up again for a moment , and shaking his head , ` I 've been as good a son as ever you were a brother .
Parsing [sent. 8430 len. 15]: It 's the pot and the kettle , if you come to that . '
Parsing [sent. 8431 len. 20]: ` You speak bitterly , in the violence of your regret , ' said Martin , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 8432 len. 7]: ` Give me your hand . '
Parsing [sent. 8433 len. 11]: Jonas did so , and was almost at his ease .
Parsing [sent. 8434 len. 28]: ` Pecksniff , ' he whispered , as they drew their chairs about the table ; ' I gave him as good as he brought , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 8435 len. 18]: He had better look at home , before he looks out of window , I think ? '
Parsing [sent. 8436 len. 44]: Mr Pecksniff only answered by a nudge of the elbow , which might either be construed into an indignant remonstrance or a cordial assent ; but which , in any case , was an emphatic admonition to his chosen son-in-law to be silent .
Parsing [sent. 8437 len. 17]: He then proceeded to do the honours of the house with his accustomed ease and amiability .
Parsing [sent. 8438 len. 34]: But not even Mr Pecksniff 's guileless merriment could set such a party at their ease , or reconcile materials so utterly discordant and conflicting as those with which he had to deal .
Parsing [sent. 8439 len. 57]: The unspeakable jealously and hatred which that night 's explanation had sown in Charity 's breast , was not to be so easily kept down ; and more than once it showed itself in such intensity , as seemed to render a full disclosure of all the circumstances then and there , impossible to be avoided .
Parsing [sent. 8440 len. 84]: The beauteous Merry , too , with all the glory of her conquest fresh upon her , so probed and lanced the rankling disappointment of her sister by her capricious airs and thousand little trials of Mr Jonas 's obedience , that she almost goaded her into a fit of madness , and obliged her to retire from table in a burst of passion , hardly less vehement than that to which she had abandoned herself in the first tumult of her wrath .
Parsing [sent. 8441 len. 48]: The constraint imposed upon the family by the presence among them for the first time of Mary Graham -LRB- for by that name old Martin Chuzzlewit had introduced her -RRB- did not at all improve this state of things ; gentle and quiet though her manner was .
Parsing [sent. 8442 len. 182]: Mr Pecksniff 's situation was peculiarly trying ; for , what with having constantly to keep the peace between his daughters ; to maintain a reasonable show of affection and unity in his household ; to curb the growing ease and gaiety of Jonas , which vented itself in sundry insolences towards Mr Pinch , and an indefinable coarseness of manner in reference to Mary -LRB- they being the two dependants -RRB- ; to make no mention at all of his having perpetually to conciliate his rich old relative , and to smooth down , or explain away , some of the ten thousand bad appearances and combinations of bad appearances , by which they were surrounded on that unlucky evening -- what with having to do this , and it would be difficult to sum up how much more , without the least relief or assistance from anybody , it may be easily imagined that Mr Pecksniff had in his enjoyment something more than that usual portion of alloy which is mixed up with the best of men 's delights .
Parsing [sent. 8443 len. 28]: Perhaps he had never in his life felt such relief as when old Martin , looking at his watch , announced that it was time to go .
Parsing [sent. 8444 len. 18]: ` We have rooms , ' he said , ` at the Dragon , for the present .
Parsing [sent. 8445 len. 9]: I have a fancy for the evening walk .
Parsing [sent. 8446 len. 19]: The nights are dark just now ; perhaps Mr Pinch would not object to light us home ? '
Parsing [sent. 8447 len. 6]: ` My dear sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 8448 len. 9]: cried Pecksniff , ' I shall be delighted .
Parsing [sent. 8449 len. 9]: Merry , my child , the lantern . '
Parsing [sent. 8450 len. 41]: ` The lantern , if you please , my dear , ' said Martin ; ` but I could n't think of taking your father out of doors to-night ; and , to be brief , I wo n't . '
Parsing [sent. 8451 len. 21]: Mr Pecksniff already had his hat in his hand , but it was so emphatically said that he paused . '
Parsing [sent. 8452 len. 13]: I take Mr Pinch , or go alone , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 8453 len. 7]: ` Which shall it be ? '
Parsing [sent. 8454 len. 21]: ` It shall be Thomas , sir , ' cried Pecksniff , ` since you are so resolute upon it .
Parsing [sent. 8455 len. 14]: Thomas , my friend , be very careful , if you please . '
Parsing [sent. 8456 len. 32]: Tom was in some need of this injunction , for he felt so nervous , and trembled to such a degree , that he found it difficult to hold the lantern .
Parsing [sent. 8457 len. 25]: How much more difficult when , at the old man 's bidding she drew her hand through his -- Tom Pinch 's -- arm !
Parsing [sent. 8458 len. 27]: ` And so , Mr Pinch , ' said Martin , on the way , ` you are very comfortably situated here ; are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 8459 len. 30]: Tom answered , with even more than his usual enthusiasm , that he was under obligations to Mr Pecksniff which the devotion of a lifetime would but imperfectly repay .
Parsing [sent. 8460 len. 10]: ` How long have you known my nephew ? '
Parsing [sent. 8461 len. 3]: asked Martin .
Parsing [sent. 8462 len. 7]: ` Your nephew , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8463 len. 3]: faltered Tom .
Parsing [sent. 8464 len. 9]: ` Mr Jonas Chuzzlewit , ' said Mary .
Parsing [sent. 8465 len. 21]: ` Oh dear , yes , ' cried Tom , greatly relieved , for his mind was running upon Martin .
Parsing [sent. 8466 len. 3]: ` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 8467 len. 11]: I never spoke to him before to-night , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 8468 len. 20]: ` Perhaps half a lifetime will suffice for the acknowledgment of HIS kindness , ' observed the old man .
Parsing [sent. 8469 len. 24]: Tom felt that this was a rebuff for him , and could not but understand it as a left-handed hit at his employer .
Parsing [sent. 8470 len. 5]: So he was silent .
Parsing [sent. 8471 len. 25]: Mary felt that Mr Pinch was not remarkable for presence of mind , and that he could not say too little under existing circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 8472 len. 5]: So SHE was silent .
Parsing [sent. 8473 len. 54]: The old man , disgusted by what in his suspicious nature he considered a shameless and fulsome puff of Mr Pecksniff , which was a part of Tom 's hired service and in which he was determined to persevere , set him down at once for a deceitful , servile , miserable fawner .
Parsing [sent. 8474 len. 5]: So HE was silent .
Parsing [sent. 8475 len. 40]: And though they were all sufficiently uncomfortable , it is fair to say that Martin was perhaps the most so ; for he had felt kindly towards Tom at first , and had been interested by his seeming simplicity .
Parsing [sent. 8476 len. 20]: ` You 're like the rest , ' he thought , glancing at the face of the unconscious Tom .
Parsing [sent. 8477 len. 15]: ` You had nearly imposed upon me , but you have lost your labour .
Parsing [sent. 8478 len. 15]: You are too zealous a toad-eater , and betray yourself , Mr Pinch . '
Parsing [sent. 8479 len. 14]: During the whole remainder of the walk , not another word was spoken .
Parsing [sent. 8480 len. 26]: First among the meetings to which Tom had long looked forward with a beating heart , it was memorable for nothing but embarrassment and confusion .
Parsing [sent. 8481 len. 27]: They parted at the Dragon door ; and sighing as he extinguished the candle in the lantern , Tom turned back again over the gloomy fields .
Parsing [sent. 8482 len. 34]: As he approached the first stile , which was in a lonely part , made very dark by a plantation of young firs , a man slipped past him and went on before .
Parsing [sent. 8483 len. 14]: Coming to the stile he stopped , and took his seat upon it .
Parsing [sent. 8484 len. 26]: Tom was rather startled , and for a moment stood still , but he stepped forward again immediately , and went close up to him .
Parsing [sent. 8485 len. 26]: It was Jonas ; swinging his legs to and fro , sucking the head of a stick , and looking with a sneer at Tom .
Parsing [sent. 8486 len. 6]: ` Good gracious me ! '
Parsing [sent. 8487 len. 13]: cried Tom , ` who would have thought of its being you !
Parsing [sent. 8488 len. 7]: You followed us , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 8489 len. 8]: ` What 's that to you ? '
Parsing [sent. 8490 len. 3]: said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 8491 len. 7]: ` Go to the devil ! '
Parsing [sent. 8492 len. 14]: ` You are not very civil , I think , ' remarked Tom .
Parsing [sent. 8493 len. 10]: ` Civil enough for YOU , ' retorted Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 8494 len. 6]: ` Who are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 8495 len. 19]: ` One who has as good a right to common consideration as another , ' said Tom mildly .
Parsing [sent. 8496 len. 10]: ` You 're a liar , ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 8497 len. 10]: ` You have n't a right to any consideration .
Parsing [sent. 8498 len. 8]: You have n't a right to anything .
Parsing [sent. 8499 len. 17]: You 're a pretty sort of fellow to talk about your rights , upon my soul !
Parsing [sent. 8500 len. 4]: Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 8501 len. 6]: -- Rights , too ! '
Parsing [sent. 8502 len. 25]: ` If you proceed in this way , ' returned Tom , reddening , ` you will oblige me to talk about my wrongs .
Parsing [sent. 8503 len. 9]: But I hope your joke is over . '
Parsing [sent. 8504 len. 42]: ` It 's the way with you curs , ' said Mr Jonas , ` that when you know a man 's in real earnest , you pretend to think he 's joking , so that you may turn it off .
Parsing [sent. 8505 len. 8]: But that wo n't do with me .
Parsing [sent. 8506 len. 5]: It 's too stale .
Parsing [sent. 8507 len. 25]: Now just attend to me for a bit , Mr Pitch , or Witch , or Stitch , or whatever your name is . '
Parsing [sent. 8508 len. 10]: ` My name is Pinch , ' observed Tom .
Parsing [sent. 8509 len. 11]: ` Have the goodness to call me by it . '
Parsing [sent. 8510 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 8511 len. 16]: You must n't even be called out of your name , must n't you ! '
Parsing [sent. 8512 len. 3]: cried Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 8513 len. 11]: ` Pauper ' prentices are looking up , I think .
Parsing [sent. 8514 len. 13]: Ecod , we manage 'em a little better in the city ! '
Parsing [sent. 8515 len. 14]: ` Never mind what you do in the city , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 8516 len. 11]: ` What have you got to say to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 8517 len. 29]: ` Just this , Mister Pinch , ' retorted Jonas , thrusting his face so close to Tom 's that Tom was obliged to retreat a step . '
Parsing [sent. 8518 len. 25]: I advise you to keep your own counsel , and to avoid title-tattle , and not to cut in where you 're not wanted .
Parsing [sent. 8519 len. 49]: I 've heard something of you , my friend , and your meek ways ; and I recommend you to forget 'em till I am married to one of Pecksniff 's gals , and not to curry favour among my relations , but to leave the course clear .
Parsing [sent. 8520 len. 23]: You know , when curs wo n't leave the course clear , they 're whipped off ; so this is kind advice .
Parsing [sent. 8521 len. 4]: Do you understand ?
Parsing [sent. 8522 len. 2]: Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 8523 len. 38]: Damme , who are you , ' cried Jonas , with increased contempt , ` that you should walk home with THEM , unless it was behind 'em , like any other servant out of livery ? '
Parsing [sent. 8524 len. 4]: ` Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 8525 len. 23]: cried Tom , ' I see that you had better get off the stile , and let me pursue my way home .
Parsing [sent. 8526 len. 10]: Make room for me , if you please . '
Parsing [sent. 8527 len. 7]: ` Do n't think it ! '
Parsing [sent. 8528 len. 8]: said Jonas , spreading out his legs .
Parsing [sent. 8529 len. 6]: ` Not till I choose .
Parsing [sent. 8530 len. 7]: And I do n't choose now .
Parsing [sent. 8531 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 8532 len. 23]: You 're afraid of my making you split upon some of your babbling just now , are you , Sneak ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8533 len. 26]: I am not afraid of many things , I hope , ' said Tom ; ` and certainly not of anything that you will do .
Parsing [sent. 8534 len. 12]: I am not a tale-bearer , and I despise all meanness .
Parsing [sent. 8535 len. 5]: You quite mistake me .
Parsing [sent. 8536 len. 3]: Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 8537 len. 5]: cried Tom , indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 8538 len. 14]: ` Is this manly from one in your position to one in mine ?
Parsing [sent. 8539 len. 9]: Please to make room for me to pass .
Parsing [sent. 8540 len. 9]: The less I say , the better . '
Parsing [sent. 8541 len. 7]: ` The less you say ! '
Parsing [sent. 8542 len. 17]: retorted Jonas , dangling his legs the more , and taking no heed of this request .
Parsing [sent. 8543 len. 10]: ` You say very little , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 8544 len. 20]: Ecod , I should like to know what goes on between you and a vagabond member of my family .
Parsing [sent. 8545 len. 14]: There 's very little in that too , I dare say ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 8546 len. 20]: I know no vagabond member of your family , ' cried Tom , stoutly , ` You do ! '
Parsing [sent. 8547 len. 4]: said Jonas . '
Parsing [sent. 8548 len. 8]: I do n't , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 8549 len. 15]: ` Your uncle 's namesake , if you mean him , is no vagabond .
Parsing [sent. 8550 len. 31]: Any comparison between you and him ' -- Tom snapped his fingers at him , for he was rising fast in wrath -- ` is immeasurably to your disadvantage . '
Parsing [sent. 8551 len. 5]: ` Oh indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 8552 len. 3]: sneered Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 8553 len. 21]: ` And what do you think of his deary -- his beggarly leavings , eh , Mister Pinch ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8554 len. 19]: I do n't mean to say another word , or stay here another instant , ' replied Tom .
Parsing [sent. 8555 len. 18]: ` As I told you before , you 're a liar , ' said Jonas , coolly .
Parsing [sent. 8556 len. 13]: ` You 'll stay here till I give you leave to go .
Parsing [sent. 8557 len. 11]: Now , keep where you are , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 8558 len. 30]: He flourished his stick over Tom 's head ; but in a moment it was spinning harmlessly in the air , and Jonas himself lay sprawling in the ditch .
Parsing [sent. 8559 len. 35]: In the momentary struggle for the stick , Tom had brought it into violent contact with his opponent 's forehead ; and the blood welled out profusely from a deep cut on the temple .
Parsing [sent. 8560 len. 27]: Tom was first apprised of this by seeing that he pressed his handkerchief to the wounded part , and staggered as he rose , being stunned .
Parsing [sent. 8561 len. 6]: ` Are you hurt ? '
Parsing [sent. 8562 len. 4]: said Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 8563 len. 5]: I am very sorry .
Parsing [sent. 8564 len. 7]: Lean on me for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 8565 len. 15]: You can do that without forgiving me , if you still bear me malice .
Parsing [sent. 8566 len. 20]: But I do n't know why ; for I never offended you before we met on this spot . '
Parsing [sent. 8567 len. 42]: He made him no answer ; not appearing at first to understand him , or even to know that he was hurt , though he several times took his handkerchief from the cut to look vacantly at the blood upon it .
Parsing [sent. 8568 len. 36]: After one of these examinations , he looked at Tom , and then there was an expression in his features , which showed that he understood what had taken place , and would remember it .
Parsing [sent. 8569 len. 10]: Nothing more passed between them as they went home .
Parsing [sent. 8570 len. 29]: Jonas kept a little in advance , and Tom Pinch sadly followed , thinking of the grief which the knowledge of this quarrel must occasion his excellent benefactor .
Parsing [sent. 8571 len. 51]: When Jonas knocked at the door , Tom 's heart beat high ; higher when Miss Mercy answered it , and seeing her wounded lover , shireked aloud ; higher , when he followed them into the family parlour ; higher than at any other time , when Jonas spoke .
Parsing [sent. 8572 len. 13]: ` Do n't make a noise about it , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 8573 len. 7]: ` It 's nothing worth mentioning .
Parsing [sent. 8574 len. 43]: I did n't know the road ; the night 's very dark ; and just as I came up with Mr Pinch ' -- he turned his face towards Tom , but not his eyes -- ' I ran against a tree .
Parsing [sent. 8575 len. 7]: It 's only skin deep . '
Parsing [sent. 8576 len. 10]: ` Cold water , Merry , my child ! '
Parsing [sent. 8577 len. 4]: cried Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 8578 len. 4]: ` Brown paper !
Parsing [sent. 8579 len. 2]: Scissors !
Parsing [sent. 8580 len. 6]: A piece of old linen !
Parsing [sent. 8581 len. 9]: Charity , my dear , make a bandage .
Parsing [sent. 8582 len. 7]: Bless me , Mr Jonas ! '
Parsing [sent. 8583 len. 14]: ` Oh , bother YOUR nonsense , ' returned the gracious son-in-law elect .
Parsing [sent. 8584 len. 9]: ` Be of some use if you can .
Parsing [sent. 8585 len. 9]: If you ca n't , get out ! '
Parsing [sent. 8586 len. 31]: Miss Charity , though called upon to lend her aid , sat upright in one corner , with a smile upon her face , and did n't move a finger .
Parsing [sent. 8587 len. 101]: Though Mercy laved the wound herself ; and Mr Pecksniff held the patient 's head between his two hands , as if without that assistance it must inevitably come in half ; and Tom Pinch , in his guilty agitation , shook a bottle of Dutch Drops until they were nothing but English Froth , and in his other hand sustained a formidable carving-knife , really intended to reduce the swelling , but apparently designed for the ruthless infliction of another wound as soon as that was dressed ; Charity rendered not the least assistance , nor uttered a word .
Parsing [sent. 8588 len. 72]: But when Mr Jonas 's head was bound up , and he had gone to bed , and everybody else had retired , and the house was quiet , Mr Pinch , as he sat mournfully on his bedstead , ruminating , heard a gentle tap at his door ; and opening it , saw her , to his great astonishment , standing before him with her finger on her lip .
Parsing [sent. 8589 len. 8]: ` Mr Pinch , ' she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 8590 len. 5]: ` Dear Mr Pinch !
Parsing [sent. 8591 len. 5]: Tell me the truth !
Parsing [sent. 8592 len. 4]: You did that ?
Parsing [sent. 8593 len. 12]: There was some quarrel between you , and you struck him ?
Parsing [sent. 8594 len. 7]: I am sure of it ! '
Parsing [sent. 8595 len. 23]: It was the first time she had ever spoken kindly to Tom , in all the many years they had passed together .
Parsing [sent. 8596 len. 6]: He was stupefied with amazement .
Parsing [sent. 8597 len. 9]: ` Was it so , or not ? '
Parsing [sent. 8598 len. 5]: she eagerly demanded . '
Parsing [sent. 8599 len. 10]: I was very much provoked , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 8600 len. 6]: ` Then it was ? '
Parsing [sent. 8601 len. 7]: cried Charity , with sparkling eyes .
Parsing [sent. 8602 len. 3]: ` Ye-yes .
Parsing [sent. 8603 len. 12]: We had a struggle for the path , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 8604 len. 13]: ` But I did n't mean to hurt him so much . '
Parsing [sent. 8605 len. 6]: ` Not so much ! '
Parsing [sent. 8606 len. 17]: she repeated , clenching her hand and stamping her foot , to Tom 's great wonder .
Parsing [sent. 8607 len. 6]: ` Do n't say that .
Parsing [sent. 8608 len. 6]: It was brave of you .
Parsing [sent. 8609 len. 6]: I honour you for it .
Parsing [sent. 8610 len. 26]: If you should ever quarrel again , do n't spare him for the world , but beat him down and set your shoe upon him .
Parsing [sent. 8611 len. 8]: Not a word of this to anybody .
Parsing [sent. 8612 len. 11]: Dear Mr Pinch , I am your friend from tonight .
Parsing [sent. 8613 len. 10]: I am always your friend from this time . '
Parsing [sent. 8614 len. 32]: She turned her flushed face upon Tom to confirm her words by its kindling expression ; and seizing his right hand , pressed it to her breast , and kissed it .
Parsing [sent. 8615 len. 61]: And there was nothing personal in this to render it at all embarrassing , for even Tom , whose power of observation was by no means remarkable , knew from the energy with which she did it that she would have fondled any hand , no matter how bedaubed or dyed , that had broken the head of Jonas Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 8616 len. 16]: Tom went into his room , and went to bed , full of uncomfortable thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 8617 len. 116]: That there should be any such tremendous division in the family as he knew must have taken place to convert Charity Pecksniff into his friend , for any reason , but , above all , for that which was clearly the real one ; that Jonas , who had assailed him with such exceeding coarseness , should have been sufficiently magnanimous to keep the secret of their quarrel ; and that any train of circumstances should have led to the commission of an assault and battery by Thomas Pinch upon any man calling himself the friend of Seth Pecksniff ; were matters of such deep and painful cogitation that he could not close his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 8618 len. 69]: His own violence , in particular , so preyed upon the generous mind of Tom , that coupling it with the many former occasions on which he had given Mr Pecksniff pain and anxiety -LRB- occasions of which that gentleman often reminded him -RRB- , he really began to regard himself as destined by a mysterious fate to be the evil genius and bad angel of his patron .
Parsing [sent. 8619 len. 30]: But he fell asleep at last , and dreamed -- new source of waking uneasiness -- that he had betrayed his trust , and run away with Mary Graham .
Parsing [sent. 8620 len. 24]: It must be acknowledged that , asleep or awake , Tom 's position in reference to this young lady was full of uneasiness .
Parsing [sent. 8621 len. 52]: The more he saw of her , the more he admired her beauty , her intelligence , the amiable qualities that even won on the divided house of Pecksniff , and in a few days restored , at all events , the semblance of harmony and kindness between the angry sisters .
Parsing [sent. 8622 len. 24]: When she spoke , Tom held his breath , so eagerly he listened ; when she sang , he sat like one entranced .
Parsing [sent. 8623 len. 36]: She touched his organ , and from that bright epoch even it , the old companion of his happiest hours , incapable as he had thought of elevation , began a new and deified existence .
Parsing [sent. 8624 len. 9]: God 's love upon thy patience , Tom !
Parsing [sent. 8625 len. 50]: Who , that had beheld thee , for three summer weeks , poring through half the deadlong night over the jingling anatomy of that inscrutable old harpsichord in the back parlour , could have missed the entrance to thy secret heart : albeit it was dimly known to thee ?
Parsing [sent. 8626 len. 87]: Who that had seen the glow upon thy cheek when leaning down to listen , after hours of labour , for the sound of one incorrigible note , thou foundest that it had a voice at last , and wheezed out a flat something , distantly akin to what it ought to be , would not have known that it was destined for no common touch , but one that smote , though gently as an angel 's hand , upon the deepest chord within thee !
Parsing [sent. 8627 len. 111]: And if a friendly glance -- aye , even though it were as guileless as thine own , Dear Tom -- could have but pierced the twilight of that evening , when , in a voice well tempered to the time , sad , sweet , and low , yet hopeful , she first sang to the altered instrument , and wondered at the change ; and thou , sitting apart at the open window , kept a glad silence and a swelling heart -- must not that glance have read perforce the dawning of a story , Tom , that it were well for thee had never been begun !
Parsing [sent. 8628 len. 27]: Tom Pinch 's situation was not made the less dangerous or difficult by the fact of no one word passing between them in reference to Martin .
Parsing [sent. 8629 len. 14]: Honourably mindful of his promise , Tom gave her opportunities of all kinds .
Parsing [sent. 8630 len. 40]: Early and late he was in the church ; in her favourite walks ; in the village , in the garden , in the meadows ; and in any or all of these places he might have spoken freely .
Parsing [sent. 8631 len. 20]: But no ; at all such times she carefully avoided him , or never came in his way unaccompanied .
Parsing [sent. 8632 len. 46]: It could not be that she disliked or distrusted him , for by a thousand little delicate means , too slight for any notice but his own , she singled him out when others were present , and showed herself the very soul of kindness .
Parsing [sent. 8633 len. 26]: Could it be that she had broken with Martin , or had never returned his affection , save in his own bold and heightened fancy ?
Parsing [sent. 8634 len. 13]: Tom 's cheek grew red with self-reproach as he dismissed the thought .
Parsing [sent. 8635 len. 31]: All this time old Martin came and went in his own strange manner , or sat among the rest absorbed within himself , and holding little intercourse with any one .
Parsing [sent. 8636 len. 45]: Although he was unsocial , he was not willful in other things , or troublesome , or morose ; being never better pleased than when they left him quite unnoticed at his book , and pursued their own amusements in his presence , unreserved .
Parsing [sent. 8637 len. 23]: It was impossible to discern in whom he took an interest , or whether he had an interest in any of them .
Parsing [sent. 8638 len. 21]: Unless they spoke to him directly , he never showed that he had ears or eyes for anything that passed .
Parsing [sent. 8639 len. 50]: One day the lively Merry , sitting with downcast eyes under a shady tree in the churchyard , whither she had retired after fatiguing herself by the imposition of sundry trials on the temper of Mr Jonas , felt that a new shadow came between her and the sun .
Parsing [sent. 8640 len. 23]: Raising her eyes in the expectation of seeing her betrothed , she was not a little surprised to see old Martin instead .
Parsing [sent. 8641 len. 31]: Her surprise was not diminished when he took his seat upon the turf beside her , and opened a conversation thus : ` When are you to be married ? '
Parsing [sent. 8642 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8643 len. 8]: dear Mr Chuzzlewit , my goodness me !
Parsing [sent. 8644 len. 8]: I 'm sure I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 8645 len. 8]: Not yet awhile , I hope . '
Parsing [sent. 8646 len. 5]: ` You hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 8647 len. 5]: said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 8648 len. 17]: It was very gravely said , but she took it for banter , and giggled excessively .
Parsing [sent. 8649 len. 4]: ` Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 8650 len. 21]: said the old man , with unusual kindness , ` you are young , good-looking , and I think good-natured !
Parsing [sent. 8651 len. 20]: Frivolous you are , and love to be , undoubtedly ; but you must have some heart . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8652 len. 28]: I have not given it all away , I can tell you , ' said Merry , nodding her head shrewdly , and plucking up the grass .
Parsing [sent. 8653 len. 10]: ` Have you parted with any of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 8654 len. 15]: She threw the grass about , and looked another way , but said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 8655 len. 5]: Martin repeated his question .
Parsing [sent. 8656 len. 8]: ` Lor , my dear Mr Chuzzlewit !
Parsing [sent. 8657 len. 6]: really you must excuse me !
Parsing [sent. 8658 len. 7]: How very odd you are . '
Parsing [sent. 8659 len. 34]: ` If it be odd in me to desire to know whether you love the young man whom I understand you are to marry , I AM very odd , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 8660 len. 9]: ` For that is certainly my wish . '
Parsing [sent. 8661 len. 16]: ` He 's such a monster , you know , ' said Merry , pouting .
Parsing [sent. 8662 len. 9]: ` Then you do n't love him ? '
Parsing [sent. 8663 len. 5]: returned the old man .
Parsing [sent. 8664 len. 7]: ` Is that your meaning ? '
Parsing [sent. 8665 len. 24]: ` Why , my dear Mr Chuzzlewit , I 'm sure I tell him a hundred times a day that I hate him .
Parsing [sent. 8666 len. 10]: You must have heard me tell him that . '
Parsing [sent. 8667 len. 7]: ` Often , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 8668 len. 11]: ` And so I do , ' cried Merry . '
Parsing [sent. 8669 len. 5]: I do positively . '
Parsing [sent. 8670 len. 17]: ` Being at the same time engaged to marry him , ' observed the old man .
Parsing [sent. 8671 len. 8]: ` Oh yes , ' said Merry .
Parsing [sent. 8672 len. 44]: ` But I told the wretch -- my dear Mr Chuzzlewit , I told him when he asked me -- that if I ever did marry him , it should only be that I might hate and tease him all my life . '
Parsing [sent. 8673 len. 24]: She had a suspicion that the old man regarded Jonas with anything but favour , and intended these remarks to be extremely captivating .
Parsing [sent. 8674 len. 31]: He did not appear , however , to regard them in that light by any means ; for when he spoke again , it was in a tone of severity .
Parsing [sent. 8675 len. 49]: ` Look about you , ' he said , pointing to the graves ; ` and remember that from your bridal hour to the day which sees you brought as low as these , and laid in such a bed , there will be no appeal against him .
Parsing [sent. 8676 len. 16]: Think , and speak , and act , for once , like an accountable creature .
Parsing [sent. 8677 len. 8]: Is any control put upon your inclinations ?
Parsing [sent. 8678 len. 7]: Are you forced into this match ?
Parsing [sent. 8679 len. 14]: Are you insidiously advised or tempted to contract it , by any one ?
Parsing [sent. 8680 len. 12]: I will not ask by whom ; by any one ? '
Parsing [sent. 8681 len. 12]: ` No , ' said Merry , shrugging her shoulders . '
Parsing [sent. 8682 len. 9]: I do n't know that I am . '
Parsing [sent. 8683 len. 8]: ` Do n't know that you are !
Parsing [sent. 8684 len. 4]: Are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 8685 len. 7]: ` No , ' replied Merry .
Parsing [sent. 8686 len. 10]: ` Nobody ever said anything to me about it .
Parsing [sent. 8687 len. 22]: If any one had tried to make me have him , I would n't have had him at all . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8688 len. 20]: I am told that he was at first supposed to be your sister 's admirer , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 8689 len. 6]: ` Oh , good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 8690 len. 31]: My dear Mr Chuzzlewit , it would be very hard to make him , though he IS a monster , accountable for other people 's vanity , ' said Merry .
Parsing [sent. 8691 len. 11]: ` And poor dear Cherry is the vainest darling ! '
Parsing [sent. 8692 len. 10]: ` It was her mistake , then ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8693 len. 52]: I hope it was , ' cried Merry ; ` but , all along , the dear child has been so dreadfully jealous , and SO cross , that , upon my word and honour , it 's impossible to please her , and it 's of no use trying . '
Parsing [sent. 8694 len. 15]: ` Not forced , persuaded , or controlled , ' said Martin , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 8695 len. 9]: ` And that 's true , I see .
Parsing [sent. 8696 len. 6]: There is one chance yet .
Parsing [sent. 8697 len. 11]: You may have lapsed into this engagement in very giddiness .
Parsing [sent. 8698 len. 12]: It may have been the wanton act of a light head .
Parsing [sent. 8699 len. 5]: Is that so ? '
Parsing [sent. 8700 len. 27]: ` My dear Mr Chuzzlewit , ' simpered Merry , ` as to light-headedness , there never was such a feather of a head as mine .
Parsing [sent. 8701 len. 8]: It 's perfect balloon , I declare !
Parsing [sent. 8702 len. 8]: You never DID , you know ! '
Parsing [sent. 8703 len. 67]: He waited quietly till she had finished , and then said , steadily and slowly , and in a softened voice , as if he would still invite her confidence : ` Have you any wish -- or is there anything within your breast that whispers you may form the wish , if you have time to think -- to be released from this engagement ? '
Parsing [sent. 8704 len. 19]: Again Miss Merry pouted , and looked down , and plucked the grass , and shrugged her shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 8705 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 8706 len. 8]: She did n't know that she had .
Parsing [sent. 8707 len. 8]: She was pretty sure she had n't .
Parsing [sent. 8708 len. 7]: Quite sure , she might say .
Parsing [sent. 8709 len. 8]: She ` did n't mind it . '
Parsing [sent. 8710 len. 31]: ` Has it ever occurred to you , ' said Martin , ` that your married life may perhaps be miserable , full of bitterness , and most unhappy ? '
Parsing [sent. 8711 len. 16]: Merry looked down again ; and now she tore the grass up by the roots .
Parsing [sent. 8712 len. 10]: ` My dear Mr Chuzzlewit , what shocking words !
Parsing [sent. 8713 len. 9]: Of course , I shall quarrel with him .
Parsing [sent. 8714 len. 7]: I should quarrel with any husband .
Parsing [sent. 8715 len. 8]: Married people always quarrel , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 8716 len. 46]: But as to being miserable , and bitter , and all those dreadful things , you know , why I could n't be absolutely that , unless he always had the best of it ; and I mean to have the best of it myself .
Parsing [sent. 8717 len. 29]: I always do now , ' cried Merry , nodding her head and giggling very much ; ` for I make a perfect slave of the creature . '
Parsing [sent. 8718 len. 12]: ` Let it go on , ' said Martin , rising .
Parsing [sent. 8719 len. 6]: ` Let it go on !
Parsing [sent. 8720 len. 17]: I sought to know your mind , my dear , and you have shown it me .
Parsing [sent. 8721 len. 5]: I wish you joy .
Parsing [sent. 8722 len. 3]: Joy ! '
Parsing [sent. 8723 len. 20]: he repeated , looking full upon her , and pointing to the wicket-gate where Jonas entered at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 8724 len. 20]: And then , without waiting for his nephew , he passed out at another gate , and went away .
Parsing [sent. 8725 len. 9]: ` Oh , you terrible old man ! '
Parsing [sent. 8726 len. 7]: cried the facetious Merry to herself .
Parsing [sent. 8727 len. 23]: ` What a perfectly hideous monster to be wandering about churchyards in the broad daylight , frightening people out of their wits !
Parsing [sent. 8728 len. 15]: Do n't come here , Griffin , or I 'll go away directly . '
Parsing [sent. 8729 len. 6]: Mr Jonas was the Griffin .
Parsing [sent. 8730 len. 30]: He sat down upon the grass at her side , in spite of this warning , and sulkily inquired : ` What 's my uncle been a-talking about ? '
Parsing [sent. 8731 len. 8]: ` About you , ' rejoined Merry .
Parsing [sent. 8732 len. 13]: ` He says you 're not half good enough for me . '
Parsing [sent. 8733 len. 9]: ` Oh , yes , I dare say !
Parsing [sent. 8734 len. 5]: We all know that .
Parsing [sent. 8735 len. 13]: He means to give you some present worth having , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 8736 len. 10]: Did he say anything that looked like it ? '
Parsing [sent. 8737 len. 7]: ` THAT he did n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 8738 len. 7]: cried Merry , most decisively . '
Parsing [sent. 8739 len. 11]: A stingy old dog he is , ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 8740 len. 4]: ` Well ? '
Parsing [sent. 8741 len. 4]: ` Griffin ! '
Parsing [sent. 8742 len. 17]: cried Miss Mercy , in counterfeit amazement ; ` what are you doing , Griffin ? '
Parsing [sent. 8743 len. 13]: ` Only giving you a squeeze , ' said the discomfited Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 8744 len. 12]: ` There 's no harm in that , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 8745 len. 24]: ` But there is great deal of harm in it , if I do n't consider it agreeable , ' returned his cousin .
Parsing [sent. 8746 len. 8]: ` Do go along , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 8747 len. 7]: You make me so hot ! '
Parsing [sent. 8748 len. 21]: Mr Jonas withdrew his arm , and for a moment looked at her more like a murderer than a lover .
Parsing [sent. 8749 len. 20]: But he cleared his brow by degrees , and broke silence with : ' I say , Mel ! '
Parsing [sent. 8750 len. 15]: ` What do you say , you vulgar thing -- you low savage ? '
Parsing [sent. 8751 len. 5]: cried his fair betrothed .
Parsing [sent. 8752 len. 7]: ` When is it to be ?
Parsing [sent. 8753 len. 73]: I ca n't afford to go on dawdling about here half my life , I need n't tell you , and Pecksniff says that father 's being so lately dead makes very little odds ; for we can be married as quiet as we please down here , and my being lonely is a good reason to the neighbours for taking a wife home so soon , especially one that he knew .
Parsing [sent. 8754 len. 49]: As to crossbones -LRB- my uncle , I mean -RRB- , he 's sure not to put a spoke in the wheel , whatever we settle on , for he told Pecksniff only this morning , that if YOU liked it he 'd nothing at all to say .
Parsing [sent. 8755 len. 20]: So , Mel , ' said Jonas , venturing on another squeeze ; ` when shall it be ? '
Parsing [sent. 8756 len. 6]: ` Upon my word ! '
Parsing [sent. 8757 len. 3]: cried Merry .
Parsing [sent. 8758 len. 13]: ` Upon my soul , if you like , ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 8759 len. 12]: ` What do you say to next week , now ? '
Parsing [sent. 8760 len. 5]: ` To next week !
Parsing [sent. 8761 len. 16]: If you had said next quarter , I should have wondered at your impudence . '
Parsing [sent. 8762 len. 14]: ` But I did n't say next quarter , ' retorted Jonas . '
Parsing [sent. 8763 len. 6]: I said next week . '
Parsing [sent. 8764 len. 18]: ` Then , Griffin , ' cried Miss Merry , pushing him off , and rising . '
Parsing [sent. 8765 len. 4]: I say no !
Parsing [sent. 8766 len. 4]: not next week .
Parsing [sent. 8767 len. 19]: It sha n't be till I choose , and I may not choose it to be for months .
Parsing [sent. 8768 len. 3]: There ! '
Parsing [sent. 8769 len. 25]: He glanced up at her from the ground , almost as darkly as he had looked at Tom Pinch ; but held his peace .
Parsing [sent. 8770 len. 28]: ` No fright of a Griffin with a patch over his eye shall dictate to me or have a voice in the matter , ' said Merry .
Parsing [sent. 8771 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 8772 len. 7]: Still Mr Jonas held his peace .
Parsing [sent. 8773 len. 66]: ` If it 's next month , that shall be the very earliest ; but I wo n't say when it shall be till to-morrow ; and if you do n't like that , it shall never be at all , ' said Merry ; ` and if you follow me about and wo n't leave me alone , it shall never be at all .
Parsing [sent. 8774 len. 21]: There!v And if you do n't do everything I order you to do , it shall never be at all .
Parsing [sent. 8775 len. 6]: So do n't follow me .
Parsing [sent. 8776 len. 5]: There , Griffin ! '
Parsing [sent. 8777 len. 12]: And with that , she skipped away , among the trees .
Parsing [sent. 8778 len. 7]: ` Ecod , my lady ! '
Parsing [sent. 8779 len. 31]: said Jonas , looking after her , and biting a piece of straw , almost to powder ; ` you 'll catch it for this , when you ARE married .
Parsing [sent. 8780 len. 30]: It 's all very well now -- it keeps one on , somehow , and you know it -- but I 'll pay you off scot and lot by-and-bye .
Parsing [sent. 8781 len. 19]: This is a plaguey dull sort of a place for a man to be sitting by himself in .
Parsing [sent. 8782 len. 10]: I never could abide a mouldy old churchyard . '
Parsing [sent. 8783 len. 21]: As he turned into the avenue himself , Miss Merry , who was far ahead , happened to look back .
Parsing [sent. 8784 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 8785 len. 18]: said Jonas , with a sullen smile , and a nod that was not addressed to her .
Parsing [sent. 8786 len. 10]: ` Make the most of it while it lasts .
Parsing [sent. 8787 len. 9]: Get in your hay while the sun shines .
Parsing [sent. 8788 len. 17]: Take your own way as long as it 's in your power , my lady ! '
Parsing [sent. 8789 len. 35]: CHAPTER TWENTY -- FIVE IS IN PART PROFESSIONAL , AND FURNISHES THE READER WITH SOME VALUABLE HINTS IN RELATION TO THE MANAGEMENT OF A SICK CHAMBER Mr Mould was surrounded by his household gods .
Parsing [sent. 8790 len. 18]: He was enjoying the sweets of domestic repose , and gazing on them with a calm delight .
Parsing [sent. 8791 len. 28]: The day being sultry , and the window open , the legs of Mr Mould were on the window-seat , and his back reclined against the shutter .
Parsing [sent. 8792 len. 17]: Over his shining head a handkerchief was drawn , to guard his baldness from the flies .
Parsing [sent. 8793 len. 68]: The room was fragrant with the smell of punch , a tumbler of which grateful compound stood upon a small round table , convenient to the hand of Mr Mould ; so deftly mixed that as his eye looked down into the cool transparent drink , another eye , peering brightly from behind the crisp lemon-peel , looked up at him , and twinkled like a star .
Parsing [sent. 8794 len. 18]: Deep in the City , and within the ward of Cheap , stood Mr Mould 's establishment .
Parsing [sent. 8795 len. 40]: His Harem , or , in other words , the common sitting room of Mrs Mould and family , was at the back , over the little counting-house behind the shop ; abutting on a churchyard small and shady .
Parsing [sent. 8796 len. 21]: In this domestic chamber Mr Mould now sat ; gazing , a placid man , upon his punch and home .
Parsing [sent. 8797 len. 63]: If , for a moment at a time , he sought a wider prospect , whence he might return with freshened zest to these enjoyments , his moist glance wandered like a sunbeam through a rural screen of scarlet runners , trained on strings before the window , and he looked down , with an artist 's eye , upon the graves .
Parsing [sent. 8798 len. 16]: The partner of his life , and daughters twain , were Mr Mould 's companions .
Parsing [sent. 8799 len. 19]: Plump as any partridge was each Miss Mould , and Mrs M. was plumper than the two together .
Parsing [sent. 8800 len. 40]: So round and chubby were their fair proportions , that they might have been the bodies once belonging to the angels ' faces in the shop below , grown up , with other heads attached to make them mortal .
Parsing [sent. 8801 len. 23]: Even their peachy cheeks were puffed out and distended , as though they ought of right to be performing on celestial trumpets .
Parsing [sent. 8802 len. 35]: The bodiless cherubs in the shop , who were depicted as constantly blowing those instruments for ever and ever without any lungs , played , it is to be presumed , entirely by ear .
Parsing [sent. 8803 len. 28]: Mr Mould looked lovingly at Mrs Mould , who sat hard by , and was a helpmate to him in his punch as in all other things .
Parsing [sent. 8804 len. 20]: Each seraph daughter , too , enjoyed her share of his regards , and smiled upon him in return .
Parsing [sent. 8805 len. 47]: So bountiful were Mr Mould 's possessions , and so large his stock in trade , that even there , within his household sanctuary , stood a cumbrous press , whose mahogany maw was filled with shrouds , and winding-sheets , and other furniture of funerals .
Parsing [sent. 8806 len. 33]: But , though the Misses Mould had been brought up , as one may say , beneath his eye , it had cast no shadow on their timid infancy or blooming youth .
Parsing [sent. 8807 len. 17]: Sporting behind the scenes of death and burial from cradlehood , the Misses Mould knew better .
Parsing [sent. 8808 len. 25]: Hat-bands , to them , were but so many yards of silk or crape ; the final robe but such a quantity of linen .
Parsing [sent. 8809 len. 23]: The Misses Mould could idealise a player 's habit , or a court-lady 's petticoat , or even an act of parliament .
Parsing [sent. 8810 len. 11]: But they were not to be taken in by palls .
Parsing [sent. 8811 len. 5]: They made them sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 8812 len. 56]: The premises of Mr Mould were hard of hearing to the boisterous noises in the great main streets , and nestled in a quiet corner , where the City strife became a drowsy hum , that sometimes rose and sometimes fell and sometimes altogether ceased ; suggesting to a thoughtful mind a stoppage in Cheapside .
Parsing [sent. 8813 len. 60]: The light came sparkling in among the scarlet runners , as if the churchyard winked at Mr Mould , and said , ` We understand each other ; ' and from the distant shop a pleasant sound arose of coffin-making with a low melodious hammer , rat , tat , tat , tat , alike promoting slumber and digestion .
Parsing [sent. 8814 len. 20]: ` Quite the buzz of insects , ' said Mr Mould , closing his eyes in a perfect luxury .
Parsing [sent. 8815 len. 17]: ` It puts one in mind of the sound of animated nature in the agricultural districts .
Parsing [sent. 8816 len. 9]: It 's exactly like the woodpecker tapping . '
Parsing [sent. 8817 len. 32]: ` The woodpecker tapping the hollow ELM tree , ' observed Mrs Mould , adapting the words of the popular melody to the description of wood commonly used in the trade .
Parsing [sent. 8818 len. 6]: ` Ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 8819 len. 4]: laughed Mr Mould .
Parsing [sent. 8820 len. 9]: ` Not at all bad , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 8821 len. 18]: We shall be glad to hear from you again , Mrs M. Hollow elm tree , eh !
Parsing [sent. 8822 len. 4]: Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 8823 len. 4]: Very good indeed .
Parsing [sent. 8824 len. 15]: I 've seen worse than that in the Sunday papers , my love . '
Parsing [sent. 8825 len. 30]: Mrs Mould , thus encouraged , took a little more of the punch , and handed it to her daughters , who dutifully followed the example of their mother .
Parsing [sent. 8826 len. 8]: ` Hollow ELM tree , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 8827 len. 18]: said Mr Mould , making a slight motion with his legs in his enjoyment of the joke .
Parsing [sent. 8828 len. 8]: ` It 's beech in the song .
Parsing [sent. 8829 len. 4]: Elm , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 8830 len. 6]: Yes , to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 8831 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 8832 len. 15]: Upon my soul , that 's one of the best things I know ? '
Parsing [sent. 8833 len. 25]: He was so excessively tickled by the jest that he could n't forget it , but repeated twenty times , ` Elm , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 8834 len. 6]: Yes , to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 8835 len. 5]: Elm , of course .
Parsing [sent. 8836 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 8837 len. 21]: Upon my life , you know , that ought to be sent to somebody who could make use of it .
Parsing [sent. 8838 len. 12]: It 's one of the smartest things that ever was said .
Parsing [sent. 8839 len. 6]: Hollow ELM tree , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 8840 len. 3]: of course .
Parsing [sent. 8841 len. 3]: Very hollow .
Parsing [sent. 8842 len. 7]: Ha , ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 8843 len. 10]: Here a knock was heard at the room door .
Parsing [sent. 8844 len. 20]: ` That 's Tacker , I know , ' said Mrs Mould , ` by the wheezing he makes .
Parsing [sent. 8845 len. 22]: Who that hears him now , would suppose he 'd ever had wind enough to carry the feathers on his head !
Parsing [sent. 8846 len. 6]: Come in , Tacker . '
Parsing [sent. 8847 len. 18]: ` Beg your pardon , ma'am , ' said Tacker , looking in a little way . '
Parsing [sent. 8848 len. 8]: I thought our Governor was here . '
Parsing [sent. 8849 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 8850 len. 8]: so he is , ' cried Mould .
Parsing [sent. 8851 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8852 len. 20]: I did n't see you , I 'm sure , ' said Tacker , looking in a little farther .
Parsing [sent. 8853 len. 27]: ` You would n't be inclined to take a walking one of two , with the plain wood and a tin plate , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 8854 len. 14]: ` Certainly not , ' replied Mr Mould , ` much too common .
Parsing [sent. 8855 len. 8]: Nothing to say to it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 8856 len. 13]: I told 'em it was precious low , ' observed Mr Tacker .
Parsing [sent. 8857 len. 8]: ` Tell 'em to go somewhere else .
Parsing [sent. 8858 len. 15]: We do n't do that style of business here , ' said Mr Mould .
Parsing [sent. 8859 len. 8]: ` Like their impudence to propose it .
Parsing [sent. 8860 len. 5]: Who is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 8861 len. 19]: ` Why , ' returned Tacker , pausing , ` that 's where it is , you see .
Parsing [sent. 8862 len. 8]: It 's the beadle 's son-in-law . '
Parsing [sent. 8863 len. 9]: ` The beadle 's son-in-law , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 8864 len. 3]: said Mould .
Parsing [sent. 8865 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 8866 len. 16]: I 'll do it if the beadle follows in his cocked hat ; not else .
Parsing [sent. 8867 len. 20]: We carry it off that way , by looking official , but it 'll be low enough , then .
Parsing [sent. 8868 len. 7]: His cocked hat , mind ! '
Parsing [sent. 8869 len. 12]: ` I 'll take care , sir , ' rejoined Tacker .
Parsing [sent. 8870 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8871 len. 13]: Mrs Gamp 's below , and wants to speak to you . '
Parsing [sent. 8872 len. 12]: ` Tell Mrs Gamp to come upstairs , ' said Mould .
Parsing [sent. 8873 len. 11]: ` Now Mrs Gamp , what 's YOUR news ? '
Parsing [sent. 8874 len. 17]: The lady in question was by this time in the doorway , curtseying to Mrs Mould .
Parsing [sent. 8875 len. 29]: At the same moment a peculiar fragrance was borne upon the breeze , as if a passing fairy had hiccoughed , and had previously been to a wine-vaults .
Parsing [sent. 8876 len. 35]: Mrs Gamp made no response to Mr Mould , but curtseyed to Mrs Mould again , and held up her hands and eyes , as in a devout thanksgiving that she looked so well .
Parsing [sent. 8877 len. 37]: She was neatly , but not gaudily attired , in the weeds she had worn when Mr Pecksniff had the pleasure of making her acquaintance ; and was perhaps the turning of a scale more snuffy .
Parsing [sent. 8878 len. 60]: ` There are some happy creeturs , ' Mrs Gamp observed , ` as time runs back ` ards with , and you are one , Mrs Mould ; not that he need do nothing except use you in his most owldacious way for years to come , I 'm sure ; for young you are and will be .
Parsing [sent. 8879 len. 63]: I says to Mrs Harris , ' Mrs Gamp continued , ` only t ` other day ; the last Monday evening fortnight as ever dawned upon this Piljian 's Projiss of a mortal wale ; I says to Mrs Harris when she says to me , `` Years and our trials , Mrs Gamp , sets marks upon us all . ''
Parsing [sent. 8880 len. 27]: -- `` Say not the words , Mrs Harris , if you and me is to be continual friends , for sech is not the case .
Parsing [sent. 8881 len. 72]: Mrs Mould , '' I says , making so free , I will confess , as use the name , ' -LRB- she curtseyed here -RRB- , ' `` is one of them that goes agen the obserwation straight ; and never , Mrs Harris , whilst I 've a drop of breath to draw , will I set by , and not stand up , do n't think it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8882 len. 55]: -- `` I ast your pardon , ma'am , '' says Mrs Harris , `` and I humbly grant your grace ; for if ever a woman lived as would see her feller creeturs into fits to serve her friends , well do I know that woman 's name is Sairey Gamp . '' '
Parsing [sent. 8883 len. 77]: At this point she was fain to stop for breath ; and advantage may be taken of the circumstance , to state that a fearful mystery surrounded this lady of the name of Harris , whom no one in the circle of Mrs Gamp 's acquaintance had ever seen ; neither did any human being know her place of residence , though Mrs Gamp appeared on her own showing to be in constant communication with her .
Parsing [sent. 8884 len. 66]: There were conflicting rumours on the subject ; but the prevalent opinion was that she was a phantom of Mrs Gamp 's brain -- as Messrs. Doe and Roe are fictions of the law -- created for the express purpose of holding visionary dialogues with her on all manner of subjects , and invariably winding up with a compliment to the excellence of her nature .
Parsing [sent. 8885 len. 55]: ` And likeways what a pleasure , ' said Mrs Gamp , turning with a tearful smile towards the daughters , ` to see them two young ladies as I know 'd afore a tooth in their pretty heads was cut , and have many a day seen -- ah , the sweet creeturs !
Parsing [sent. 8886 len. 23]: -- playing at berryins down in the shop , and follerin ' the order-book to its long home in the iron safe !
Parsing [sent. 8887 len. 47]: But that 's all past and over , Mr Mould ; ' as she thus got in a carefully regulated routine to that gentleman , she shook her head waggishly ; ` That 's all past and over now , sir , a n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 8888 len. 9]: ` Changes , Mrs Gamp , changes ! '
Parsing [sent. 8889 len. 4]: returned the undertaker .
Parsing [sent. 8890 len. 29]: ` More changes too , to come , afore we 've done with changes , sir , ' said Mrs Gamp , nodding yet more waggishly than before .
Parsing [sent. 8891 len. 21]: ` Young ladies with such faces thinks of something else besides berryins , do n't they , sir ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 8892 len. 30]: I am sure I do n't know , Mrs Gamp , ' said Mould , with a chuckle -- ` Not bad in Mrs Gamp , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 8893 len. 11]: ` Oh yes , you do know , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 8894 len. 144]: said Mrs Gamp , ` and so does Mrs Mould , your ` ansome pardner too , sir ; and so do I , although the blessing of a daughter was deniged me ; which , if we had had one , Gamp would certainly have drunk its little shoes right off its feet , as with our precious boy he did , and arterward send the child a errand to sell his wooden leg for any money it would fetch as matches in the rough , and bring it home in liquor ; which was truly done beyond his years , for ev'ry individgle penny that child lost at toss or buy for kidney ones ; and come home arterwards quite bold , to break the news , and offering to drown himself if sech would be a satisfaction to his parents .
Parsing [sent. 8895 len. 30]: -- Oh yes , you do know , sir , ' said Mrs Gamp , wiping her eye with her shawl , and resuming the thread of her discourse .
Parsing [sent. 8896 len. 20]: ` There 's something besides births and berryins in the newspapers , a n't there , Mr Mould ? '
Parsing [sent. 8897 len. 25]: Mr Mould winked at Mrs Mould , whom he had by this time taken on his knee , and said : ` No doubt .
Parsing [sent. 8898 len. 8]: A good deal more , Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 8899 len. 16]: Upon my life , Mrs Gamp is very far from bad , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 8900 len. 12]: ` There 's marryings , a n't there , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8901 len. 12]: said Mrs Gamp , while both the daughters blushed and tittered .
Parsing [sent. 8902 len. 12]: ` Bless their precious hearts , and well they knows it !
Parsing [sent. 8903 len. 22]: Well you know 'd it too , and well did Mrs Mould , when you was at their time of life !
Parsing [sent. 8904 len. 13]: But my opinion is , you 're all of one age now .
Parsing [sent. 8905 len. 18]: For as to you and Mrs Mould , sir , ever having grandchildren -- ' ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8906 len. 4]: Fie , fie !
Parsing [sent. 8907 len. 10]: Nonsense , Mrs Gamp , ' replied the undertaker .
Parsing [sent. 8908 len. 6]: ` Devilish smart , though .
Parsing [sent. 8909 len. 3]: Ca-pi-tal ! '
Parsing [sent. 8910 len. 7]: -- this was in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 8911 len. 22]: ` My dear ' -- aloud again -- ` Mrs Gamp can drink a glass of rum , I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 8912 len. 10]: Sit down , Mrs Gamp , sit down . '
Parsing [sent. 8913 len. 59]: Mrs Gamp took the chair that was nearest the door , and casting up her eyes towards the ceiling , feigned to be wholly insensible to the fact of a glass of rum being in preparation , until it was placed in her hand by one of the young ladies , when she exhibited the greatest surprise . '
Parsing [sent. 8914 len. 40]: A thing , ' she said , ` as hardly ever , Mrs Mould , occurs with me unless it is when I am indispoged , and find my half a pint of porter settling heavy on the chest .
Parsing [sent. 8915 len. 25]: Mrs Harris often and often says to me , `` Sairey Gamp , '' she says , `` you raly do amaze me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8916 len. 14]: `` Mrs Harris , '' I says to her , `` why so ?
Parsing [sent. 8917 len. 9]: Give it a name , I beg . ''
Parsing [sent. 8918 len. 55]: `` Telling the truth then , ma'am , '' says Mrs Harris , `` and shaming him as shall be nameless betwixt you and me , never did I think till I know 'd you , as any woman could sick-nurse and monthly likeways , on the little that you takes to drink . ''
Parsing [sent. 8919 len. 39]: `` Mrs Harris , '' I says to her , `` none on us knows what we can do till we tries ; and wunst , when me and Gamp kept ` ouse , I thought so too .
Parsing [sent. 8920 len. 36]: But now , '' I says , `` my half a pint of porter fully satisfies ; perwisin ' , Mrs Harris , that it is brought reg ` lar , and draw 'd mild .
Parsing [sent. 8921 len. 54]: Whether I sicks or monthlies , ma'am , I hope I does my duty , but I am but a poor woman , and I earns my living hard ; therefore I DO require it , which I makes confession , to be brought reg ` lar and draw 'd mild . '' '
Parsing [sent. 8922 len. 32]: The precise connection between these observations and the glass of rum , did not appear ; for Mrs Gamp proposing as a toast ` The best of lucks to all ! '
Parsing [sent. 8923 len. 15]: took off the dram in quite a scientific manner , without any further remarks .
Parsing [sent. 8924 len. 11]: ` And what 's your news , Mrs Gamp ? '
Parsing [sent. 8925 len. 38]: asked Mould again , as that lady wiped her lips upon her shawl , and nibbled a corner off a soft biscuit , which she appeared to carry in her pocket as a provision against contingent drams .
Parsing [sent. 8926 len. 7]: ` How 's Mr Chuffey ? '
Parsing [sent. 8927 len. 28]: ` Mr Chuffey , sir , ' she replied , ` is jest as usual ; he a n't no better and he a n't no worse .
Parsing [sent. 8928 len. 39]: I take it very kind in the gentleman to have wrote up to you and said , `` let Mrs Gamp take care of him till I come home ; '' but ev'ry think he does is kind .
Parsing [sent. 8929 len. 8]: There a n't a many like him .
Parsing [sent. 8930 len. 12]: If there was , we should n't want no churches . '
Parsing [sent. 8931 len. 15]: ` What do you want to speak to me about , Mrs Gamp ? '
Parsing [sent. 8932 len. 8]: said Mould , coming to the point .
Parsing [sent. 8933 len. 19]: ` Jest this , sir , ' Mrs Gamp returned , ` with thanks to you for asking .
Parsing [sent. 8934 len. 25]: There IS a gent , sir , at the Bull in Holborn , as has been took ill there , and is bad abed .
Parsing [sent. 8935 len. 33]: They have a day nurse as was recommended from Bartholomew 's ; and well I knows her , Mr Mould , her name bein ' Mrs Prig , the best of creeturs .
Parsing [sent. 8936 len. 53]: But she is otherways engaged at night , and they are in wants of night-watching ; consequent she says to them , having reposed the greatest friendliness in me for twenty year , `` The soberest person going , and the best of blessings in a sick room , is Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 8937 len. 34]: Send a boy to Kingsgate Street , '' she says , `` and snap her up at any price , for Mrs Gamp is worth her weight and more in goldian guineas . ''
Parsing [sent. 8938 len. 37]: My landlord brings the message down to me , and says , `` bein ' in a light place where you are , and this job promising so well , why not unite the two ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8939 len. 23]: `` No , sir , '' I says , `` not unbeknown to Mr Mould , and therefore do not think it .
Parsing [sent. 8940 len. 23]: But I will go to Mr Mould , '' I says , `` and ast him , if you like . '' '
Parsing [sent. 8941 len. 14]: Here she looked sideways at the undertaker , and came to a stop .
Parsing [sent. 8942 len. 6]: ` Night-watching , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 8943 len. 7]: said Mould , rubbing his chin .
Parsing [sent. 8944 len. 9]: ` From eight o'clock till eight , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8945 len. 11]: I will not deceive you , ' Mrs Gamp rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 8946 len. 9]: ` And then go back , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 8947 len. 3]: said would .
Parsing [sent. 8948 len. 14]: ` Quite free , then , sir , to attend to Mr Chuffey .
Parsing [sent. 8949 len. 23]: His ways bein ' quiet , and his hours early , he 'd be abed , sir , nearly all the time .
Parsing [sent. 8950 len. 41]: I will not deny , ' said Mrs Gamp with meekness , ` that I am but a poor woman , and that the money is a object ; but do not let that act upon you , Mr Mould .
Parsing [sent. 8951 len. 24]: Rich folks may ride on camels , but it a n't so easy for 'em to see out of a needle 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 8952 len. 13]: That is my comfort , and I hope I knows it . '
Parsing [sent. 8953 len. 28]: ` Well , Mrs Gamp , ' observed Mould , ' I do n't see any particular objection to your earning an honest penny under such circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 8954 len. 12]: I should keep it quiet , I think , Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 8955 len. 27]: I would n't mention it to Mr Chuzzlewit on his return , for instance , unless it were necessary , or he asked you pointblank . '
Parsing [sent. 8956 len. 16]: ` The very words was on my lips , sir , ' Mrs Gamp rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 8957 len. 39]: ` Suppoging that the gent should die , I hope I might take the liberty of saying as I know 'd some one in the undertaking line , and yet give no offence to you , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 8958 len. 14]: ` Certainly , Mrs Gamp , ' said Mould , with much condescension .
Parsing [sent. 8959 len. 43]: ` You may casually remark , in such a case , that we do the thing pleasantly and in a great variety of styles , and are generally considered to make it as agreeable as possible to the feelings of the survivors .
Parsing [sent. 8960 len. 11]: But do n't obtrude it , do n't obtrude it .
Parsing [sent. 8961 len. 4]: Easy , easy !
Parsing [sent. 8962 len. 20]: My dear , you may as well give Mrs Gamp a card or two , if you please . '
Parsing [sent. 8963 len. 28]: Mrs Gamp received them , and scenting no more rum in the wind -LRB- for the bottle was locked up again -RRB- rose to take her departure .
Parsing [sent. 8964 len. 19]: ` Wishing ev'ry happiness to this happy family , ' said Mrs Gamp ` with all my heart .
Parsing [sent. 8965 len. 6]: Good arternoon , Mrs Mould !
Parsing [sent. 8966 len. 33]: If I was Mr would I should be jealous of you , ma'am ; and I 'm sure , if I was you , I should be jealous of Mr Mould . '
Parsing [sent. 8967 len. 5]: ` Tut , tut !
Parsing [sent. 8968 len. 4]: Bah , bah !
Parsing [sent. 8969 len. 7]: Go along , Mrs Gamp ! '
Parsing [sent. 8970 len. 5]: cried the delighted undertaker .
Parsing [sent. 8971 len. 55]: ` As to the young ladies , ' said Mrs Gamp , dropping a curtsey , ` bless their sweet looks -- how they can ever reconsize it with their duties to be so grown up with such young parents , it a n't for sech as me to give a guess at . '
Parsing [sent. 8972 len. 5]: ` Nonsense , nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 8973 len. 7]: Be off , Mrs Gamp ! '
Parsing [sent. 8974 len. 3]: cried Mould .
Parsing [sent. 8975 len. 17]: But in the height of his gratification he actually pinched Mrs Mould as he said it .
Parsing [sent. 8976 len. 34]: ` I 'll tell you what , my dear , ' he observed , when Mrs Gamp had at last withdrawn and shut the door , ` that 's a ve-ry shrewd woman .
Parsing [sent. 8977 len. 15]: That 's a woman whose intellect is immensely superior to her station in life .
Parsing [sent. 8978 len. 13]: That 's a woman who observes and reflects in an uncommon manner .
Parsing [sent. 8979 len. 46]: She 's the sort of woman now , ' said Mould , drawing his silk handkerchief over his head again , and composing himself for a nap ` one would almost feel disposed to bury for nothing ; and do it neatly , too ! '
Parsing [sent. 8980 len. 51]: Mrs Mould and her daughters fully concurred in these remarks ; the subject of which had by this time reached the street , where she experienced so much inconvenience from the air , that she was obliged to stand under an archway for a short time , to recover herself .
Parsing [sent. 8981 len. 51]: Even after this precaution , she walked so unsteadily as to attract the compassionate regards of divers kind-hearted boys , who took the liveliest interest in her disorder ; and in their simple language bade her be of good cheer , for she was ` only a little screwed . '
Parsing [sent. 8982 len. 46]: Whatever she was , or whatever name the vocabulary of medical science would have bestowed upon her malady , Mrs Gamp was perfectly acquainted with the way home again ; and arriving at the house of Anthony Chuzzlewit & Son , lay down to rest .
Parsing [sent. 8983 len. 29]: Remaining there until seven o'clock in the evening , and then persuading poor old Chuffey to betake himself to bed , she sallied forth upon her new engagement .
Parsing [sent. 8984 len. 44]: First , she went to her private lodgings in Kingsgate Street , for a bundle of robes and wrappings comfortable in the night season ; and then repaired to the Bull in Holborn , which she reached as the clocks were striking eight .
Parsing [sent. 8985 len. 45]: As she turned into the yard , she stopped ; for the landlord , landlady , and head chambermaid , were all on the threshold together talking earnestly with a young gentleman who seemed to have just come or to be just going away .
Parsing [sent. 8986 len. 52]: The first words that struck upon Mrs Gamp 's ear obviously bore reference to the patient ; and it being expedient that all good attendants should know as much as possible about the case on which their skill is brought to bear , Mrs Gamp listened as a matter of duty .
Parsing [sent. 8987 len. 7]: ` No better , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 8988 len. 4]: observed the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 8989 len. 4]: ` Worse ! '
Parsing [sent. 8990 len. 4]: said the landlord .
Parsing [sent. 8991 len. 9]: ` Much worse , ' added the landlady .
Parsing [sent. 8992 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8993 len. 23]: a deal badder , ' cried the chambermaid from the background , opening her eyes very wide , and shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 8994 len. 5]: ` Poor fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 8995 len. 12]: said the gentleman , ' I am sorry to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 8996 len. 33]: The worst of it is , that I have no idea what friends or relations he has , or where they live , except that it certainly is not in London . '
Parsing [sent. 8997 len. 53]: The landlord looked at the landlady ; the landlady looked at the landlord ; and the chambermaid remarked , hysterically , ` that of all the many wague directions she had ever seen or heerd of -LRB- and they was n't few in an hotel -RRB- , THAT was the waguest . '
Parsing [sent. 8998 len. 33]: ` The fact is , you see , ' pursued the gentleman , ` as I told you yesterday when you sent to me , I really know very little about him .
Parsing [sent. 8999 len. 16]: We were school-fellows together ; but since that time I have only met him twice .
Parsing [sent. 9000 len. 33]: On both occasions I was in London for a boy 's holiday -LRB- having come up for a week or so from Wiltshire -RRB- , and lost sight of him again directly .
Parsing [sent. 9001 len. 56]: The letter bearing my name and address which you found upon his table , and which led to your applying to me , is in answer , you will observe , to one he wrote from this house the very day he was taken ill , making an appointment with him at his own request .
Parsing [sent. 9002 len. 13]: Here is his letter , if you wish to see it . '
Parsing [sent. 9003 len. 11]: The landlord read it ; the landlady looked over him .
Parsing [sent. 9004 len. 36]: The chambermaid , in the background , made out as much of it as she could , and invented the rest ; believing it all from that time forth as a positive piece of evidence .
Parsing [sent. 9005 len. 11]: ` He has very little luggage , you say ? '
Parsing [sent. 9006 len. 16]: observed the gentleman , who was no other than our old friend , John Westlock .
Parsing [sent. 9007 len. 20]: ` Nothing but a portmanteau , ' said the landlord ; ` and very little in it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9008 len. 10]: A few pounds in his purse , though ? '
Parsing [sent. 9009 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 9010 len. 10]: It 's sealed up , and in the cash-box .
Parsing [sent. 9011 len. 16]: I made a memorandum of the amount , which you 're welcome to see . '
Parsing [sent. 9012 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 9013 len. 58]: said John , ` as the medical gentleman says the fever must take its course , and nothing can be done just now beyond giving him his drinks regularly and having him carefully attended to , nothing more can be said that I know of , until he is in a condition to give us some information .
Parsing [sent. 9014 len. 7]: Can you suggest anything else ? '
Parsing [sent. 9015 len. 24]: ` N-no , ' replied the landlord , ` except -- ' ` Except , who 's to pay , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 9016 len. 3]: said John .
Parsing [sent. 9017 len. 16]: ` Why , ' hesitated the landlord , ` it would be as well . '
Parsing [sent. 9018 len. 10]: ` Quite as well , ' said the landlady .
Parsing [sent. 9019 len. 17]: ` Not forgetting to remember the servants , ' said the chambermaid in a bland whisper .
Parsing [sent. 9020 len. 15]: ` It is but reasonable , I fully admit , ' said John Westlock .
Parsing [sent. 9021 len. 32]: ` At all events , you have the stock in hand to go upon for the present ; and I will readily undertake to pay the doctor and the nurses . '
Parsing [sent. 9022 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 9023 len. 5]: cried Mrs Gamp . '
Parsing [sent. 9024 len. 5]: A rayal gentleman ! '
Parsing [sent. 9025 len. 13]: She groaned her admiration so audibly , that they all turned round .
Parsing [sent. 9026 len. 16]: Mrs Gamp felt the necessity of advancing , bundle in hand , and introducing herself .
Parsing [sent. 9027 len. 27]: ` The night-nurse , ' she observed , ` from Kingsgate Street , well beknown to Mrs Prig the day-nurse , and the best of creeturs .
Parsing [sent. 9028 len. 8]: How is the poor dear gentleman to-night ?
Parsing [sent. 9029 len. 19]: If he a n't no better yet , still that is what must be expected and prepared for .
Parsing [sent. 9030 len. 42]: It a n't the fust time by a many score , ma'am , ' dropping a curtsey to the landlady , ` that Mrs Prig and me has nussed together , turn and turn about , one off , one on .
Parsing [sent. 9031 len. 15]: We knows each other 's ways , and often gives relief when others fail .
Parsing [sent. 9032 len. 29]: Our charges is but low , sir ' -- Mrs Gamp addressed herself to John on this head -- ` considerin ' the nater of our painful dooty .
Parsing [sent. 9033 len. 17]: If they wos made accordin ' to our wishes , they would be easy paid . '
Parsing [sent. 9034 len. 31]: Regarding herself as having now delivered her inauguration address , Mrs Gamp curtseyed all round , and signified her wish to be conducted to the scene of her official duties .
Parsing [sent. 9035 len. 46]: The chambermaid led her , through a variety of intricate passages , to the top of the house ; and pointing at length to a solitary door at the end of a gallery , informed her that yonder was the chamber where the patient lay .
Parsing [sent. 9036 len. 14]: That done , she hurried off with all the speed she could make .
Parsing [sent. 9037 len. 43]: Mrs Gamp traversed the gallery in a great heat from having carried her large bundle up so many stairs , and tapped at the door which was immediately opened by Mrs Prig , bonneted and shawled and all impatience to be gone .
Parsing [sent. 9038 len. 25]: Mrs Prig was of the Gamp build , but not so fat ; and her voice was deeper and more like a man 's .
Parsing [sent. 9039 len. 7]: She had also a beard . '
Parsing [sent. 9040 len. 10]: I began to think you war n't a-coming ! '
Parsing [sent. 9041 len. 8]: Mrs Prig observed , in some displeasure .
Parsing [sent. 9042 len. 16]: ` It shall be made good to-morrow night , ' said Mrs Gamp ` Honorable .
Parsing [sent. 9043 len. 10]: I had to go and fetch my things . '
Parsing [sent. 9044 len. 38]: She had begun to make signs of inquiry in reference to the position of the patient and his overhearing them -- for there was a screen before the door -- when Mrs Prig settled that point easily .
Parsing [sent. 9045 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 9046 len. 15]: she said aloud , ` he 's quiet , but his wits is gone .
Parsing [sent. 9047 len. 10]: It a n't no matter wot you say . '
Parsing [sent. 9048 len. 13]: ` Anythin ' to tell afore you goes , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 9049 len. 19]: asked Mrs Gamp , setting her bundle down inside the door , and looking affectionately at her partner .
Parsing [sent. 9050 len. 15]: ` The pickled salmon , ' Mrs Prig replied , ` is quite delicious .
Parsing [sent. 9051 len. 8]: I can partlck ` ler recommend it .
Parsing [sent. 9052 len. 18]: Do n't have nothink to say to the cold meat , for it tastes of the stable .
Parsing [sent. 9053 len. 7]: The drinks is all good . '
Parsing [sent. 9054 len. 7]: Mrs Gamp expressed herself much gratified .
Parsing [sent. 9055 len. 20]: ` The physic and them things is on the drawers and mankleshelf , ' said Mrs Prig , cursorily .
Parsing [sent. 9056 len. 10]: ` He took his last slime draught at seven .
Parsing [sent. 9057 len. 7]: The easy-chair a n't soft enough .
Parsing [sent. 9058 len. 7]: You 'll want his piller . '
Parsing [sent. 9059 len. 32]: Mrs Gamp thanked her for these hints , and giving her a friendly good night , held the door open until she had disappeared at the other end of the gallery .
Parsing [sent. 9060 len. 43]: Having thus performed the hospitable duty of seeing her safely off , she shut it , locked it on the inside , took up her bundle , walked round the screen , and entered on her occupation of the sick chamber . '
Parsing [sent. 9061 len. 17]: A little dull , but not so bad as might be , ' Mrs Gamp remarked .
Parsing [sent. 9062 len. 25]: ` I 'm glad to see a parapidge , in case of fire , and lots of roofs and chimley-pots to walk upon . '
Parsing [sent. 9063 len. 16]: It will be seen from these remarks that Mrs Gamp was looking out of window .
Parsing [sent. 9064 len. 24]: When she had exhausted the prospect , she tried the easy-chair , which she indignantly declared was ` harder than a brickbadge . '
Parsing [sent. 9065 len. 49]: Next she pursued her researches among the physic-bottles , glasses , jugs , and tea-cups ; and when she had entirely satisfied her curiosity on all these subjects of investigation , she untied her bonnet-strings and strolled up to the bedside to take a look at the patient .
Parsing [sent. 9066 len. 25]: A young man -- dark and not ill-looking -- with long black hair , that seemed the blacker for the whiteness of the bed-clothes .
Parsing [sent. 9067 len. 28]: His eyes were partly open , and he never ceased to roll his head from side to side upon the pillow , keeping his body almost quiet .
Parsing [sent. 9068 len. 38]: He did not utter words ; but every now and then gave vent to an expression of impatience or fatigue , sometimes of surprise ; and still his restless head -- oh , weary , weary hour !
Parsing [sent. 9069 len. 11]: -- went to and fro without a moment 's intermission .
Parsing [sent. 9070 len. 35]: Mrs Gamp solaced herself with a pinch of snuff , and stood looking at him with her head inclined a little sideways , as a connoisseur might gaze upon a doubtful work of art .
Parsing [sent. 9071 len. 45]: By degrees , a horrible remembrance of one branch of her calling took possession of the woman ; and stooping down , she pinned his wandering arms against his sides , to see how he would look if laid out as a dead man .
Parsing [sent. 9072 len. 13]: Her fingers itched to compose his limbs in that last marble attitude .
Parsing [sent. 9073 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 9074 len. 19]: said Mrs Gamp , walking away from the bed , ` he 'd make a lovely corpse . '
Parsing [sent. 9075 len. 80]: She now proceeded to unpack her bundle ; lighted a candle with the aid of a fire-box on the drawers ; filled a small kettle , as a preliminary to refreshing herself with a cup of tea in the course of the night ; laid what she called ' a little bit of fire , ' for the same philanthropic purpose ; and also set forth a small tea-board , that nothing might be wanting for her comfortable enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 9076 len. 33]: These preparations occupied so long , that when they were brought to a conclusion it was high time to think about supper ; so she rang the bell and ordered it . '
Parsing [sent. 9077 len. 49]: I think , young woman , ' said Mrs Gamp to the assistant chambermaid , in a tone expressive of weakness , ` that I could pick a little bit of pickled salmon , with a nice little sprig of fennel , and a sprinkling of white pepper .
Parsing [sent. 9078 len. 23]: I takes new bread , my dear , with just a little pat of fresh butter , and a mossel of cheese .
Parsing [sent. 9079 len. 45]: In case there should be such a thing as a cowcumber in the ` ouse , will you be so kind as bring it , for I 'm rather partial to 'em , and they does a world of good in a sick room .
Parsing [sent. 9080 len. 28]: If they draws the Brighton Old Tipper here , I takes THAT ale at night , my love , it bein ' considered wakeful by the doctors .
Parsing [sent. 9081 len. 47]: And whatever you do , young woman , do n't bring more than a shilling 's - worth of gin and water-warm when I rings the bell a second time ; for that is always my allowance , and I never takes a drop beyond ! '
Parsing [sent. 9082 len. 54]: Having preferred these moderate requests , Mrs Gamp observed that she would stand at the door until the order was executed , to the end that the patient might not be disturbed by her opening it a second time ; and therefore she would thank the young woman to ` look sharp . '
Parsing [sent. 9083 len. 28]: A tray was brought with everything upon it , even to the cucumber and Mrs Gamp accordingly sat down to eat and drink in high good humour .
Parsing [sent. 9084 len. 31]: The extent to which she availed herself of the vinegar , and supped up that refreshing fluid with the blade of her knife , can scarcely be expressed in narrative .
Parsing [sent. 9085 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 9086 len. 32]: sighed Mrs Gamp , as she meditated over the warm shilling 's - worth , ` what a blessed thing it is -- living in a wale -- to be contented !
Parsing [sent. 9087 len. 30]: What a blessed thing it is to make sick people happy in their beds , and never mind one 's self as long as one can do a service !
Parsing [sent. 9088 len. 12]: I do n't believe a finer cowcumber was ever grow 'd .
Parsing [sent. 9089 len. 9]: I 'm sure I never see one ! '
Parsing [sent. 9090 len. 42]: She moralised in the same vein until her glass was empty , and then admistered the patient 's medicine , by the simple process of clutching his windpipe to make him gasp , and immediately pouring it down his throat . '
Parsing [sent. 9091 len. 12]: I a ` most forgot the piller , I declare ! '
Parsing [sent. 9092 len. 8]: said Mrs Gamp , drawing it away .
Parsing [sent. 9093 len. 3]: ` There !
Parsing [sent. 9094 len. 13]: Now he 's comfortable as he can be , I 'm sure !
Parsing [sent. 9095 len. 14]: I must try to make myself as much so as I can . '
Parsing [sent. 9096 len. 29]: With this view , she went about the construction of an extemporaneous bed in the easy-chair , with the addition of the next easy one for her feet .
Parsing [sent. 9097 len. 73]: Having formed the best couch that the circumstances admitted of , she took out of her bundle a yellow night-cap , of prodigious size , in shape resembling a cabbage ; which article of dress she fixed and tied on with the utmost care , previously divesting herself of a row of bald old curls that could scarcely be called false , they were so very innocent of anything approaching to deception .
Parsing [sent. 9098 len. 17]: From the same repository she brought forth a night-jacket , in which she also attired herself .
Parsing [sent. 9099 len. 47]: Finally , she produced a watchman 's coat which she tied round her neck by the sleeves , so that she become two people ; and looked , behind , as if she were in the act of being embraced by one of the old patrol .
Parsing [sent. 9100 len. 22]: All these arrangements made , she lighted the rush-light , coiled herself up on her couch , and went to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 9101 len. 13]: Ghostly and dark the room became , and full of lowering shadows .
Parsing [sent. 9102 len. 29]: The distant noises in the streets were gradually hushed ; the house was quiet as a sepulchre ; the dead of might was coffined in the silent city .
Parsing [sent. 9103 len. 7]: Oh , weary , weary hour !
Parsing [sent. 9104 len. 65]: Oh , haggard mind , groping darkly through the past ; incapable of detaching itself from the miserable present ; dragging its heavy chain of care through imaginary feasts and revels , and scenes of awful pomp ; seeking but a moment 's rest among the long-forgotten haunts of childhood , and the resorts of yesterday ; and dimly finding fear and horror everywhere !
Parsing [sent. 9105 len. 7]: Oh , weary , weary hour !
Parsing [sent. 9106 len. 10]: What were the wanderings of Cain , to these !
Parsing [sent. 9107 len. 16]: Still , without a moment 's interval , the burning head tossed to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 9108 len. 32]: Still , from time to time , fatigue , impatience , suffering , and surprise , found utterance upon that rack , and plainly too , though never once in words .
Parsing [sent. 9109 len. 40]: At length , in the solemn hour of midnight , he began to talk ; waiting awfully for answers sometimes ; as though invisible companions were about his bed ; and so replying to their speech and questioning again .
Parsing [sent. 9110 len. 28]: Mrs Gamp awoke , and sat up in her bed ; presenting on the wall the shadow of a gigantic night constable , struggling with a prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 9111 len. 3]: ` Come !
Parsing [sent. 9112 len. 5]: Hold your tongue ! '
Parsing [sent. 9113 len. 7]: she cried , in sharp reproof .
Parsing [sent. 9114 len. 11]: ` Do n't make none of that noise here . '
Parsing [sent. 9115 len. 23]: There was no alteration in the face , or in the incessant motion of the head , but he talked on wildly .
Parsing [sent. 9116 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 9117 len. 26]: said Mrs Gamp , coming out of the chair with an impatient shiver ; ' I thought I was a-sleepin ' too pleasant to last !
Parsing [sent. 9118 len. 17]: The devil 's in the night , I think , it 's turned so chilly ! '
Parsing [sent. 9119 len. 8]: ` Do n't drink so much ! '
Parsing [sent. 9120 len. 5]: cried the sick man .
Parsing [sent. 9121 len. 7]: ` You 'll ruin us all .
Parsing [sent. 9122 len. 9]: Do n't you see how the fountain sinks ?
Parsing [sent. 9123 len. 13]: Look at the mark where the sparkling water was just now ! '
Parsing [sent. 9124 len. 7]: ` Sparkling water , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 9125 len. 4]: said Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 9126 len. 14]: ` I 'll have a sparkling cup o ' tea , I think .
Parsing [sent. 9127 len. 9]: I wish you 'd hold your noise ! '
Parsing [sent. 9128 len. 18]: He burst into a laugh , which , being prolonged , fell off into a dismal wail .
Parsing [sent. 9129 len. 13]: Checking himself , with fierce inconstancy he began to count -- fast .
Parsing [sent. 9130 len. 14]: ` One -- two -- three -- four -- five -- six . '
Parsing [sent. 9131 len. 58]: `` One , two , buckle my shoe , '' ' said Mrs Gamp , who was now on her knees , lighting the fire , `` three , four , shut the door , '' -- I wish you 'd shut your mouth , young man -- `` five , six , picking up sticks . ''
Parsing [sent. 9132 len. 19]: If I 'd got a few handy , I should have the kettle boiling all the sooner . '
Parsing [sent. 9133 len. 61]: Awaiting this desirable consummation , she sat down so close to the fender -LRB- which was a high one -RRB- that her nose rested upon it ; and for some time she drowsily amused herself by sliding that feature backwards and forwards along the brass top , as far as she could , without changing her position to do it .
Parsing [sent. 9134 len. 19]: She maintained , all the while , a running commentary upon the wanderings of the man in bed .
Parsing [sent. 9135 len. 42]: ` That makes five hundred and twenty-one men , all dressed alike , and with the same distortion on their faces , that have passed in at the window , and out at the door , ' he cried , anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 9136 len. 4]: ` Look there !
Parsing [sent. 9137 len. 9]: Five hundred and twenty-two -- twenty-three -- twenty-four .
Parsing [sent. 9138 len. 6]: Do you see them ? '
Parsing [sent. 9139 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 9140 len. 25]: I see 'em , ' said Mrs Gamp ; ` all the whole kit of 'em numbered like hackney-coaches , a n't they ? '
Parsing [sent. 9141 len. 4]: ` Touch me !
Parsing [sent. 9142 len. 7]: Let me be sure of this .
Parsing [sent. 9143 len. 4]: Touch me ! '
Parsing [sent. 9144 len. 30]: ` You 'll take your next draught when I 've made the kettle bile , ' retorted Mrs Gamp , composedly , ` and you 'll be touched then .
Parsing [sent. 9145 len. 17]: You 'll be touched up , too , if you do n't take it quiet . '
Parsing [sent. 9146 len. 16]: ` Five hundred and twenty-eight , five hundred and twenty-nine , five hundred and thirty .
Parsing [sent. 9147 len. 5]: -- Look here ! '
Parsing [sent. 9148 len. 8]: ` What 's the matter now ? '
Parsing [sent. 9149 len. 4]: said Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 9150 len. 26]: ` They 're coming four abreast , each man with his arm entwined in the next man 's , and his hand upon his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 9151 len. 16]: What 's that upon the arm of every man , and on the flag ? '
Parsing [sent. 9152 len. 12]: ` Spiders , p ` raps , ' said Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 9153 len. 3]: ` Crape !
Parsing [sent. 9154 len. 3]: Black crape !
Parsing [sent. 9155 len. 3]: Good God !
Parsing [sent. 9156 len. 8]: why do they wear it outside ? '
Parsing [sent. 9157 len. 13]: ` Would you have 'em carry black crape in their insides ? '
Parsing [sent. 9158 len. 4]: Mrs Gamp retorted .
Parsing [sent. 9159 len. 10]: ` Hold your noise , hold your noise . '
Parsing [sent. 9160 len. 39]: The fire beginning by this time to impart a grateful warmth , Mrs Gamp became silent ; gradually rubbed her nose more and more slowly along the top of the fender ; and fell into a heavy doze .
Parsing [sent. 9161 len. 22]: She was awakened by the room ringing -LRB- as she fancied -RRB- with a name she knew : ` Chuzzlewit ! '
Parsing [sent. 9162 len. 29]: The sound was so distinct and real , and so full of agonised entreaty , that Mrs Gamp jumped up in terror , and ran to the door .
Parsing [sent. 9163 len. 24]: She expected to find the passage filled with people , come to tell her that the house in the city had taken fire .
Parsing [sent. 9164 len. 12]: But the place was empty ; not a soul was there .
Parsing [sent. 9165 len. 9]: She opened the window , and looked out .
Parsing [sent. 9166 len. 10]: Dark , dull , dingy , and desolate house-tops .
Parsing [sent. 9167 len. 14]: As she passed to her seat again , she glanced at the patient .
Parsing [sent. 9168 len. 7]: Just the same ; but silent .
Parsing [sent. 9169 len. 20]: Mrs Gamp was so warm now , that she threw off the watchman 's coat , and fanned herself .
Parsing [sent. 9170 len. 14]: ` It seemed to make the wery bottles ring , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 9171 len. 9]: ` What could I have been a-dreaming of ?
Parsing [sent. 9172 len. 10]: That dratted Chuffey , I 'll be bound . '
Parsing [sent. 9173 len. 6]: The supposition was probable enough .
Parsing [sent. 9174 len. 34]: At any rate , a pinch of snuff , and the song of the steaming kettle , quite restored the tone of Mrs Gamp 's nerves , which were none of the weakest .
Parsing [sent. 9175 len. 24]: She brewed her tea ; made some buttered toast ; and sat down at the tea-board , with her face to the fire .
Parsing [sent. 9176 len. 28]: When once again , in a tone more terrible than that which had vibrated in her slumbering ear , these words were shrieked out : ` Chuzzlewit !
Parsing [sent. 9177 len. 2]: Jonas !
Parsing [sent. 9178 len. 3]: No ! '
Parsing [sent. 9179 len. 29]: Mrs Gamp dropped the cup she was in the act of raising to her lips , and turned round with a start that made the little tea-board leap .
Parsing [sent. 9180 len. 8]: The cry had come from the bed .
Parsing [sent. 9181 len. 22]: It was bright morning the next time Mrs Gamp looked out of the window , and the sun was rising cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 9182 len. 34]: Lighter and lighter grew the sky , and noisier the streets ; and high into the summer air uprose the smoke of newly kindled fires , until the busy day was broad awake .
Parsing [sent. 9183 len. 16]: Mrs Prig relieved punctually , having passed a good night at her other patient 's .
Parsing [sent. 9184 len. 19]: Mr Westlock came at the same time , but he was not admitted , the disorder being infectious .
Parsing [sent. 9185 len. 5]: The doctor came too .
Parsing [sent. 9186 len. 6]: The doctor shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 9187 len. 17]: It was all he could do , under the circumstances , and he did it well .
Parsing [sent. 9188 len. 10]: ` What sort of a night , nurse ? '
Parsing [sent. 9189 len. 10]: ` Restless , sir , ' said Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 9190 len. 5]: ` Talk much ? '
Parsing [sent. 9191 len. 10]: ` Middling , sir , ' said Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 9192 len. 10]: ` Nothing to the purpose , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 9193 len. 9]: ` Oh bless you , no , sir .
Parsing [sent. 9194 len. 4]: Only jargon . '
Parsing [sent. 9195 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 9196 len. 31]: said the doctor , ` we must keep him quiet ; keep the room cool ; give him his draughts regularly ; and see that he 's carefully looked to .
Parsing [sent. 9197 len. 5]: That 's all ! '
Parsing [sent. 9198 len. 26]: ` And as long as Mrs Prig and me waits upon him , sir , no fear of that , ' said Mrs Gamp . '
Parsing [sent. 9199 len. 24]: I suppose , ' observed Mrs Prig , when they had curtseyed the doctor out ; ` there 's nothin ' new ? '
Parsing [sent. 9200 len. 14]: ` Nothin ' at all , my dear , ' said Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 9201 len. 25]: ` He 's rather wearin ' in his talk from making up a lot of names ; elseways you need n't mind him . '
Parsing [sent. 9202 len. 15]: ` Oh , I sha n't mind him , ' Mrs Prig returned . '
Parsing [sent. 9203 len. 10]: I have somethin' else to think of . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9204 len. 23]: I pays my debts to-night , you know , my dear , and comes afore my time , ' said Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 9205 len. 30]: ` But , Betsy Prig ' -- speaking with great feeling , and laying her hand upon her arm -- ` try the cowcumbers , God bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 9206 len. 72]: CHAPTER TWENTY -- SIX AN UNEXPECTED MEETING , AND A PROMISING PROSPECT The laws of sympathy between beards and birds , and the secret source of that attraction which frequently impels a shaver of the one to be a dealer in the other , are questions for the subtle reasoning of scientific bodies ; not the less so , because their investigation would seem calculated to lead to no particular result .
Parsing [sent. 9207 len. 63]: It is enough to know that the artist who had the honour of entertaining Mrs Gamp as his first-floor lodger , united the two pursuits of barbering and bird-fancying ; and that it was not an original idea of his , but one in which he had , dispersed about the by-streets and suburbs of the town , a host of rivals .
Parsing [sent. 9208 len. 9]: The name of the householder was Paul Sweedlepipe .
Parsing [sent. 9209 len. 25]: But he was commonly called Poll Sweedlepipe ; and was not uncommonly believed to have been so christened , among his friends and neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 9210 len. 25]: With the exception of the staircase , and his lodger 's private apartment , Poll Sweedlepipe 's house was one great bird 's nest .
Parsing [sent. 9211 len. 47]: Gamecocks resided in the kitchen ; pheasants wasted the brightness of their golden plumage on the garret ; bantams roosted in the cellar ; owls had possession of the bedroom ; and specimens of all the smaller fry of birds chirrupped and twittered in the shop .
Parsing [sent. 9212 len. 7]: The staircase was sacred to rabbits .
Parsing [sent. 9213 len. 59]: There in hutches of all shapes and kinds , made from old packing-cases , boxes , drawers , and tea-chests , they increased in a prodigious degree , and contributed their share towards that complicated whiff which , quite impartially , and without distinction of persons , saluted every nose that was put into Sweedlepipe 's easy shaving-shop .
Parsing [sent. 9214 len. 19]: Many noses found their way there , for all that , especially on Sunday morning , before church-time .
Parsing [sent. 9215 len. 65]: Even archbishops shave , or must be shaved , on a Sunday , and beards WILL grow after twelve o'clock on Saturday night , though it be upon the chins of base mechanics ; who , not being able to engage their valets by the quarter , hire them by the job , and pay them -- oh , the wickedness of copper coin !
Parsing [sent. 9216 len. 5]: -- in dirty pence .
Parsing [sent. 9217 len. 46]: Poll Sweedlepipe , the sinner , shaved all comers at a penny each , and cut the hair of any customer for twopence ; and being a lone unmarried man , and having some connection in the bird line , Poll got on tolerably well .
Parsing [sent. 9218 len. 28]: He was a little elderly man , with a clammy cold right hand , from which even rabbits and birds could not remove the smell of shaving-soap .
Parsing [sent. 9219 len. 32]: Poll had something of the bird in his nature ; not of the hawk or eagle , but of the sparrow , that builds in chimney-stacks and inclines to human company .
Parsing [sent. 9220 len. 18]: He was not quarrelsome , though , like the sparrow ; but peaceful , like the dove .
Parsing [sent. 9221 len. 47]: In his walk he strutted ; and , in this respect , he bore a faint resemblance to the pigeon , as well as in a certain prosiness of speech , which might , in its monotony , be likened to the cooing of that bird .
Parsing [sent. 9222 len. 43]: He was very inquisitive ; and when he stood at his shop-door in the evening-tide , watching the neighbours , with his head on one side , and his eye cocked knowingly , there was a dash of the raven in him .
Parsing [sent. 9223 len. 13]: Yet there was no more wickedness in Poll than in a robin .
Parsing [sent. 9224 len. 80]: Happily , too , when any of his ornithological properties were on the verge of going too far , they were quenched , dissolved , melted down , and neutralised in the barber ; just as his bald head -- otherwise , as the head of a shaved magpie -- lost itself in a wig of curly black ringlets , parted on one side , and cut away almost to the crown , to indicate immense capacity of intellect .
Parsing [sent. 9225 len. 28]: Poll had a very small , shrill treble voice , which might have led the wags of Kingsgate Street to insist the more upon his feminine designation .
Parsing [sent. 9226 len. 51]: He had a tender heart , too ; for , when he had a good commission to provide three or four score sparrows for a shooting-match , he would observe , in a compassionate tone , how singular it was that sparrows should have been made expressly for such purposes .
Parsing [sent. 9227 len. 18]: The question , whether men were made to shoot them , never entered into Poll 's philosophy .
Parsing [sent. 9228 len. 35]: Poll wore , in his sporting character , a velveteen coat , a great deal of blue stocking , ankle boots , a neckerchief of some bright colour , and a very tall hat .
Parsing [sent. 9229 len. 25]: Pursuing his more quiet occupation of barber , he generally subsided into an apron not over-clean , a flannel jacket , and corduroy knee-shorts .
Parsing [sent. 9230 len. 69]: It was in this latter costume , but with his apron girded round his waist , as a token of his having shut up shop for the night , that he closed the door one evening , some weeks after the occurrences detailed in the last chapter , and stood upon the steps in Kingsgate Street , listening until the little cracked bell within should leave off ringing .
Parsing [sent. 9231 len. 24]: For until it did -- this was Mr Sweedlepipe 's reflection -- the place never seemed quiet enough to be left to itself .
Parsing [sent. 9232 len. 19]: ` It 's the greediest little bell to ring , ' said Poll , ` that ever was .
Parsing [sent. 9233 len. 8]: But it 's quiet at last . '
Parsing [sent. 9234 len. 20]: He rolled his apron up a little tighter as he said these words , and hastened down the street .
Parsing [sent. 9235 len. 18]: Just as he was turning into Holborn , he ran against a young gentleman in a livery .
Parsing [sent. 9236 len. 21]: This youth was bold , though small , and with several lively expressions of displeasure , turned upon him instantly .
Parsing [sent. 9237 len. 8]: ` Now , STOO -- PID ! '
Parsing [sent. 9238 len. 5]: cried the young gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 9239 len. 13]: ` Ca n't you look where you 're a-going to -- eh ?
Parsing [sent. 9240 len. 12]: Ca n't you mind where you 're a-coming to -- eh ?
Parsing [sent. 9241 len. 12]: What do you think your eyes was made for -- eh ?
Parsing [sent. 9242 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 9243 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 9244 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9245 len. 4]: Now then ! '
Parsing [sent. 9246 len. 31]: The young gentleman pronounced the two last words in a very loud tone and with frightful emphasis , as though they contained within themselves the essence of the direst aggravation .
Parsing [sent. 9247 len. 26]: But he had scarcely done so , when his anger yielded to surprise , and he cried , in a milder tone : ` What !
Parsing [sent. 9248 len. 3]: Polly ! '
Parsing [sent. 9249 len. 11]: ` Why , it a n't you , sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 9250 len. 3]: cried Poll .
Parsing [sent. 9251 len. 8]: ` It ca n't be you ! '
Parsing [sent. 9252 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 9253 len. 10]: It a n't me , ' returned the youth .
Parsing [sent. 9254 len. 10]: ` It 's my son , my oldest one .
Parsing [sent. 9255 len. 15]: He 's a credit to his father , a n't he , Polly ? '
Parsing [sent. 9256 len. 52]: With this delicate little piece of banter , he halted on the pavement , and went round and round in circles , for the better exhibition of his figure ; rather to the inconvenience of the passengers generally , who were not in an equal state of spirits with himself . '
Parsing [sent. 9257 len. 11]: I would n't have believed it , ' said Poll .
Parsing [sent. 9258 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 9259 len. 9]: You 've left your old place , then ?
Parsing [sent. 9260 len. 4]: Have you ? '
Parsing [sent. 9261 len. 5]: ` Have I ! '
Parsing [sent. 9262 len. 32]: returned his young friend , who had by this time stuck his hands into the pockets of his white cord breeches , and was swaggering along at the barber 's side .
Parsing [sent. 9263 len. 15]: 'D ` ye know a pair of top-boots when you see 'em , Polly ?
Parsing [sent. 9264 len. 5]: -- look here ! '
Parsing [sent. 9265 len. 7]: ` Beau-ti-ful ' cried Mr Sweedlepipe .
Parsing [sent. 9266 len. 16]: 'D ` ye know a slap-up sort of button , when you see it ? '
Parsing [sent. 9267 len. 4]: said the youth .
Parsing [sent. 9268 len. 30]: ` Do n't look at mine , if you ai n't a judge , because these lions ' heads was made for men of taste ; not snobs . '
Parsing [sent. 9269 len. 4]: ` Beau-ti-ful ! '
Parsing [sent. 9270 len. 6]: cried the barber again . '
Parsing [sent. 9271 len. 19]: A grass-green frock-coat , too , bound with gold ; and a cockade in your hat ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 9272 len. 10]: I should hope so , ' replied the youth .
Parsing [sent. 9273 len. 34]: ` Blow the cockade , though ; for , except that it do n't turn round , it 's like the wentilator that used to be in the kitchen winder at Todgers 's .
Parsing [sent. 9274 len. 17]: You ai n't seen the old lady 's name in the Gazette , have you ? '
Parsing [sent. 9275 len. 8]: ` No , ' returned the barber .
Parsing [sent. 9276 len. 7]: ` Is she a bankrupt ? '
Parsing [sent. 9277 len. 14]: ` If she ai n't , she will be , ' retorted Bailey .
Parsing [sent. 9278 len. 13]: ` That bis ` ness never can be carried on without ME .
Parsing [sent. 9279 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 9280 len. 5]: How are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 9281 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9282 len. 9]: I 'm pretty well , ' said Poll .
Parsing [sent. 9283 len. 19]: ` Are you living at this end of the town , or were you coming to see me ?
Parsing [sent. 9284 len. 14]: Was that the bis ` ness that brought you to Holborn ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9285 len. 19]: I have n't got no bis ` ness in Holborn , ' returned Bailey , with some displeasure .
Parsing [sent. 9286 len. 12]: ` All my bis ` ness lays at the West End .
Parsing [sent. 9287 len. 10]: I 've got the right sort of governor now .
Parsing [sent. 9288 len. 22]: You ca n't see his face for his whiskers , and ca n't see his whiskers for the dye upon 'em .
Parsing [sent. 9289 len. 8]: That 's a gentleman ai n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 9290 len. 13]: You would n't like a ride in a cab , would you ?
Parsing [sent. 9291 len. 11]: Why , it would n't be safe to offer it .
Parsing [sent. 9292 len. 20]: You 'd faint away , only to see me a-comin ' at a mild trot round the corner . '
Parsing [sent. 9293 len. 46]: To convey a slight idea of the effect of this approach , Mr Bailey counterfeited in his own person the action of a high-trotting horse and threw up his head so high , in backing against a pump , that he shook his hat off .
Parsing [sent. 9294 len. 20]: ` Why , he 's own uncle to Capricorn , ' said Bailey , ` and brother to Cauliflower .
Parsing [sent. 9295 len. 25]: He 's been through the winders of two chaney shops since we 've had him , and was sold for killin ' his missis .
Parsing [sent. 9296 len. 9]: That 's a horse , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 9297 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 9298 len. 28]: you 'll never want to buy any more red polls , now , ' observed Poll , looking on his young friend with an air of melancholy .
Parsing [sent. 9299 len. 25]: ` You 'll never want to buy any more red polls now , to hang up over the sink , will you ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9300 len. 9]: I should think not , ' replied Bailey .
Parsing [sent. 9301 len. 4]: ` Reether so .
Parsing [sent. 9302 len. 21]: I would n't have nothin ' to say to any bird below a Peacock ; and HE 'd be wulgar .
Parsing [sent. 9303 len. 7]: Well , how are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 9304 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9305 len. 9]: I 'm pretty well , ' said Poll .
Parsing [sent. 9306 len. 57]: He answered the question again because Mr Bailey asked it again ; Mr Bailey asked it again , because -- accompanied with a straddling action of the white cords , a bend of the knees , and a striking forth of the top-boots -- it was an easy horse-fleshy , turfy sort of thing to do .
Parsing [sent. 9307 len. 11]: ` Wot are you up to , old feller ? '
Parsing [sent. 9308 len. 10]: added Mr Bailey , with the same graceful rakishness .
Parsing [sent. 9309 len. 16]: He was quite the man-about-town of the conversation , while the easy-shaver was the child .
Parsing [sent. 9310 len. 17]: ` Why , I am going to fetch my lodger home , ' said Paul . '
Parsing [sent. 9311 len. 4]: A woman ! '
Parsing [sent. 9312 len. 12]: cried Mr Bailey , ` for a twenty-pun ' note ! '
Parsing [sent. 9313 len. 68]: The little barber hastened to explain that she was neither a young woman , nor a handsome woman , but a nurse , who had been acting as a kind of house-keeper to a gentleman for some weeks past , and left her place that night , in consequence of being superseded by another and a more legitimate house-keeper -- to wit , the gentleman 's bride .
Parsing [sent. 9314 len. 20]: ` He 's newly married , and he brings his young wife home to-night , ' said the barber .
Parsing [sent. 9315 len. 29]: ` So I 'm going to fetch my lodger away -- Mr Chuzzlewit 's , close behind the Post Office -- and carry her box for her . '
Parsing [sent. 9316 len. 6]: ` Jonas Chuzzlewit 's ? '
Parsing [sent. 9317 len. 3]: said Bailey .
Parsing [sent. 9318 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 9319 len. 11]: returned Paul : ` that 's the name sure enough .
Parsing [sent. 9320 len. 6]: Do you know him ? '
Parsing [sent. 9321 len. 6]: ` Oh , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 9322 len. 9]: cried Mr Bailey ; ` not at all .
Parsing [sent. 9323 len. 7]: And I do n't know her !
Parsing [sent. 9324 len. 3]: Not neither !
Parsing [sent. 9325 len. 14]: Why , they first kept company through me , a ` most . '
Parsing [sent. 9326 len. 4]: ` Ah ? '
Parsing [sent. 9327 len. 3]: said Paul .
Parsing [sent. 9328 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 9329 len. 18]: said Mr Bailey , with a wink ; ` and she ai n't bad looking mind you .
Parsing [sent. 9330 len. 7]: But her sister was the best .
Parsing [sent. 9331 len. 6]: SHE was the merry one .
Parsing [sent. 9332 len. 18]: I often used to have a bit of fun with her , in the hold times ! '
Parsing [sent. 9333 len. 26]: Mr Bailey spoke as if he already had a leg and three-quarters in the grave , and this had happened twenty or thirty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 9334 len. 121]: Paul Sweedlepipe , the meek , was so perfectly confounded by his precocious self-possession , and his patronizing manner , as well as by his boots , cockade , and livery , that a mist swam before his eyes , and he saw -- not the Bailey of acknowledged juvenility from Todgers 's Commercial Boarding House , who had made his acquaintance within a twelvemonth , by purchasing , at sundry times , small birds at twopence each -- but a highly-condensed embodiment of all the sporting grooms in London ; an abstract of all the stable-knowledge of the time ; a something at a high-pressure that must have had existence many years , and was fraught with terrible experiences .
Parsing [sent. 9335 len. 52]: And truly , though in the cloudy atmosphere of Todgers 's , Mr Bailey 's genius had ever shone out brightly in this particular respect , it now eclipsed both time and space , cheated beholders of their senses , and worked on their belief in defiance of all natural laws .
Parsing [sent. 9336 len. 42]: He walked along the tangible and real stones of Holborn Hill , an undersized boy ; and yet he winked the winks , and thought the thoughts , and did the deeds , and said the sayings of an ancient man .
Parsing [sent. 9337 len. 14]: There was an old principle within him , and a young surface without .
Parsing [sent. 9338 len. 12]: He became an inexplicable creature ; a breeched and booted Sphinx .
Parsing [sent. 9339 len. 29]: There was no course open to the barber , but to go distracted himself , or to take Bailey for granted ; and he wisely chose the latter .
Parsing [sent. 9340 len. 50]: Mr Bailey was good enough to continue to bear him company , and to entertain him , as they went , with easy conversation on various sporting topics ; especially on the comparative merits , as a general principle , of horses with white stockings , and horses without .
Parsing [sent. 9341 len. 50]: In regard to the style of tail to be preferred , Mr Bailey had opinions of his own , which he explained , but begged they might by no means influence his friend 's , as here he knew he had the misfortune to differ from some excellent authorities .
Parsing [sent. 9342 len. 74]: He treated Mr Sweedlepipe to a dram , compounded agreeably to his own directions , which he informed him had been invented by a member of the Jockey Club ; and , as they were by this time near the barber 's destination , he observed that , as he had an hour to spare , and knew the parties , he would , if quite agreeable , be introduced to Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 9343 len. 28]: Paul knocked at Jonas Chuzzlewit 's ; and , on the door being opened by that lady , made the two distinguished persons known to one another .
Parsing [sent. 9344 len. 32]: It was a happy feature in Mrs Gamp 's twofold profession , that it gave her an interest in everything that was young as well as in everything that was old .
Parsing [sent. 9345 len. 8]: She received Mr Bailey with much kindness .
Parsing [sent. 9346 len. 32]: ` It 's very good , I 'm sure , of you to come , ' she said to her landlord , ` as well as bring so nice a friend .
Parsing [sent. 9347 len. 27]: But I 'm afraid that I must trouble you so far as to step in , for the young couple has not yet made appearance . '
Parsing [sent. 9348 len. 10]: ` They 're late , ai n't they ? '
Parsing [sent. 9349 len. 14]: inquired her landlord , when she had conducted them downstairs into the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 9350 len. 20]: ` Well , sir , considern ' the Wings of Love , they are , ' said Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 9351 len. 45]: Mr Bailey inquired whether the Wings of Love had ever won a plate , or could be backed to do anything remarkable ; and being informed that it was not a horse , but merely a poetical or figurative expression , evinced considerable disgust .
Parsing [sent. 9352 len. 53]: Mrs Gamp was so very much astonished by his affable manners and great ease , that she was about to propound to her landlord in a whisper the staggering inquiry , whether he was a man or a boy , when Mr Sweedlepipe , anticipating her design , made a timely diversion .
Parsing [sent. 9353 len. 11]: ` He knows Mrs Chuzzlewit , ' said Paul aloud .
Parsing [sent. 9354 len. 20]: ` There 's nothin ' he do n't know ; that 's my opinion , ' observed Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 9355 len. 13]: ` All the wickedness of the world is Print to him . '
Parsing [sent. 9356 len. 20]: Mr Bailey received this as a compliment , and said , adjusting his cravat , ` reether so . '
Parsing [sent. 9357 len. 23]: ` As you knows Mrs Chuzzlewit , you knows , p ` raps , what her chris ` en name is ? '
Parsing [sent. 9358 len. 4]: Mrs Gamp observed .
Parsing [sent. 9359 len. 7]: ` Charity , ' said Bailey .
Parsing [sent. 9360 len. 7]: ` That it ai n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 9361 len. 4]: cried Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 9362 len. 9]: ` Cherry , then , ' said Bailey .
Parsing [sent. 9363 len. 7]: ` Cherry 's short for it .
Parsing [sent. 9364 len. 7]: It 's all the same . '
Parsing [sent. 9365 len. 20]: ` It do n't begin with a C at all , ' retorted Mrs Gamp , shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 9366 len. 11]: ` It begins with a M. ' ` Whew ! '
Parsing [sent. 9367 len. 28]: cried Mr Bailey , slapping a little cloud of pipe-clay out of his left leg , ` then he 's been and married the merry one ! '
Parsing [sent. 9368 len. 30]: As these words were mysterious , Mrs Gamp called upon him to explain , which Mr Bailey proceeded to do ; that lady listening greedily to everything he said .
Parsing [sent. 9369 len. 33]: He was yet in the fullness of his narrative when the sound of wheels , and a double knock at the street door , announced the arrival of the newly married couple .
Parsing [sent. 9370 len. 39]: Begging him to reserve what more he had to say for her hearing on the way home , Mrs Gamp took up the candle , and hurried away to receive and welcome the young mistress of the house .
Parsing [sent. 9371 len. 33]: ` Wishing you appiness and joy with all my art , ' said Mrs Gamp , dropping a curtsey as they entered the hall ; ` and you , too , sir .
Parsing [sent. 9372 len. 18]: Your lady looks a little tired with the journey , Mr Chuzzlewit , a pretty dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 9373 len. 13]: ` She has bothered enough about it , ' grumbled Mr Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 9374 len. 11]: ` Now , show a light , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 9375 len. 20]: ` This way , ma'am , if you please , ' said Mrs Gamp , going upstairs before them .
Parsing [sent. 9376 len. 34]: ` Things has been made as comfortable as they could be , but there 's many things you 'll have to alter your own self when you gets time to look about you !
Parsing [sent. 9377 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 9378 len. 3]: sweet thing !
Parsing [sent. 9379 len. 28]: But you do n't , ' added Mrs Gamp , internally , ` you do n't look much like a merry one , I must say ! '
Parsing [sent. 9380 len. 8]: It was true ; she did not .
Parsing [sent. 9381 len. 18]: The death that had gone before the bridal seemed to have left its shade upon the house .
Parsing [sent. 9382 len. 22]: The air was heavy and oppressive ; the rooms were dark ; a deep gloom filled up every chink and corner .
Parsing [sent. 9383 len. 28]: Upon the hearthstone , like a creature of ill omen , sat the aged clerk , with his eyes fixed on some withered branches in the stove .
Parsing [sent. 9384 len. 7]: He rose and looked at her .
Parsing [sent. 9385 len. 32]: ` So there you are , Mr Chuff , ' said Jonas carelessly , as he dusted his boots ; ` still in the land of the living , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 9386 len. 16]: ` Still in the land of the living , sir , ' retorted Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 9387 len. 22]: ` And Mr Chuffey may thank you for it , as many and many a time I 've told him . '
Parsing [sent. 9388 len. 36]: Mr Jonas was not in the best of humours , for he merely said , as he looked round , ` We do n't want you any more , you know , Mrs Gamp . '
Parsing [sent. 9389 len. 26]: ` I 'm a-going immediate , sir , ' returned the nurse ; ` unless there 's nothink I can do for you , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 9390 len. 41]: Ai n't there , ' said Mrs Gamp , with a look of great sweetness , and rummaging all the time in her pocket ; ` ai n't there nothink I can do for you , my little bird ? '
Parsing [sent. 9391 len. 10]: ` No , ' said Merry , almost crying .
Parsing [sent. 9392 len. 10]: ` You had better go away , please ! '
Parsing [sent. 9393 len. 69]: With a leer of mingled sweetness and slyness ; with one eye on the future , one on the bride , and an arch expression in her face , partly spiritual , partly spirituous , and wholly professional and peculiar to her art ; Mrs Gamp rummaged in her pocket again , and took from it a printed card , whereon was an inscription copied from her signboard .
Parsing [sent. 9394 len. 41]: ` Would you be so good , my darling dovey of a dear young married lady , ' Mrs Gamp observed , in a low voice , ` as put that somewheres where you can keep it in your mind ?
Parsing [sent. 9395 len. 14]: I 'm well beknown to many ladies , and it 's my card .
Parsing [sent. 9396 len. 10]: Gamp is my name , and Gamp my nater .
Parsing [sent. 9397 len. 32]: Livin ' quite handy , I will make so bold as call in now and then , and make inquiry how your health and spirits is , my precious chick ! '
Parsing [sent. 9398 len. 61]: And with innumerable leers , winks , coughs , nods , smiles , and curtseys , all leading to the establishment of a mysterious and confidential understanding between herself and the bride , Mrs Gamp , invoking a blessing upon the house , leered , winked , coughed , nodded , smiled , and curtseyed herself out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 9399 len. 51]: ` But I will say , and I would if I was led a Martha to the Stakes for it , ' Mrs Gamp remarked below stairs , in a whisper , ` that she do n't look much like a merry one at this present moment of time . '
Parsing [sent. 9400 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 9401 len. 8]: wait till you hear her laugh ! '
Parsing [sent. 9402 len. 3]: said Bailey .
Parsing [sent. 9403 len. 4]: ` Hem ! '
Parsing [sent. 9404 len. 11]: cried Mrs Gamp , in a kind of groan . '
Parsing [sent. 9405 len. 6]: I will , child . '
Parsing [sent. 9406 len. 55]: They said no more in the house , for Mrs Gamp put on her bonnet , Mr Sweedlepipe took up her box ; and Mr Bailey accompanied them towards Kingsgate Street ; recounting to Mrs Gamp as they went along , the origin and progress of his acquaintance with Mrs Chuzzlewit and her sister .
Parsing [sent. 9407 len. 32]: It was a pleasant instance of this youth 's precocity , that he fancied Mrs Gamp had conceived a tenderness for him , and was much tickled by her misplaced attachment .
Parsing [sent. 9408 len. 32]: As the door closed heavily behind them , Mrs Jonas sat down in a chair , and felt a strange chill creep upon her , whilst she looked about the room .
Parsing [sent. 9409 len. 15]: It was pretty much as she had known it , but appeared more dreary .
Parsing [sent. 9410 len. 11]: She had thought to see it brightened to receive her .
Parsing [sent. 9411 len. 13]: ` It ai n't good enough for you , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 9412 len. 7]: said Jonas , watching her looks .
Parsing [sent. 9413 len. 17]: ` Why , it IS dull , ' said Merry , trying to be more herself .
Parsing [sent. 9414 len. 26]: ` It 'll be duller before you 're done with it , ' retorted Jonas , ` if you give me any of your airs .
Parsing [sent. 9415 len. 14]: You 're a nice article , to turn sulky on first coming home !
Parsing [sent. 9416 len. 17]: Ecod , you used to have life enough , when you could plague me with it .
Parsing [sent. 9417 len. 5]: The gal 's downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 9418 len. 14]: Ring the bell for supper , while I take my boots off ! '
Parsing [sent. 9419 len. 33]: She roused herself from looking after him as he left the room , to do what he had desired ; when the old man Chuffey laid his hand softly on her arm .
Parsing [sent. 9420 len. 7]: ` You are not married ? '
Parsing [sent. 9421 len. 4]: he said eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 9422 len. 5]: ` Not married ? '
Parsing [sent. 9423 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 9424 len. 4]: A month ago .
Parsing [sent. 9425 len. 9]: Good Heaven , what is the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 9426 len. 12]: He answered nothing was the matter ; and turned from her .
Parsing [sent. 9427 len. 29]: But in her fear and wonder , turning also , she saw him raise his trembling hands above his head , and heard him say : ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9428 len. 12]: woe , woe , woe , upon this wicked house ! '
Parsing [sent. 9429 len. 7]: It was her welcome -- HOME .
Parsing [sent. 9430 len. 21]: CHAPTER TWENTY -- SEVEN SHOWING THAT OLD FRIENDS MAY NOT ONLY APPEAR WITH NEW FACES , BUT IN FALSE COLOURS .
Parsing [sent. 9431 len. 15]: THAT PEOPLE ARE PRONE TO BITE , AND THAT BITERS MAY SOMETIMES BE BITTEN .
Parsing [sent. 9432 len. 118]: Mr Bailey , Junior -- for the sporting character , whilom of general utility at Todgers 's , had now regularly set up in life under that name , without troubling himself to obtain from the legislature a direct licence in the form of a Private Bill , which of all kinds and classes of bills is without exception the most unreasonable in its charges -- Mr Bailey , Junior , just tall enough to be seen by an inquiring eye , gazing indolently at society from beneath the apron of his master 's cab , drove slowly up and down Pall Mall , about the hour of noon , in waiting for his ` Governor . '
Parsing [sent. 9433 len. 70]: The horse of distinguished family , who had Capricorn for his nephew , and Cauliflower for his brother , showed himself worthy of his high relations by champing at the bit until his chest was white with foam , and rearing like a horse in heraldry ; the plated harness and the patent leather glittered in the sun ; pedestrians admired ; Mr Bailey was complacent , but unmoved .
Parsing [sent. 9434 len. 28]: He seemed to say , ' A barrow , good people , a mere barrow ; nothing to what we could do , if we chose ! '
Parsing [sent. 9435 len. 26]: and on he went , squaring his short green arms outside the apron , as if he were hooked on to it by his armpits .
Parsing [sent. 9436 len. 17]: Mr Bailey had a great opinion of Brother to Cauliflower , and estimated his powers highly .
Parsing [sent. 9437 len. 7]: But he never told him so .
Parsing [sent. 9438 len. 31]: On the contrary , it was his practice , in driving that animal , to assail him with disrespectful , if not injurious , expressions , as , ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 9439 len. 4]: would you ! '
Parsing [sent. 9440 len. 9]: ` Did you think it , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 9441 len. 9]: ` Where are you going to now ? '
Parsing [sent. 9442 len. 11]: ` No , you wo n't , my lad ! '
Parsing [sent. 9443 len. 5]: and similar fragmentary remarks .
Parsing [sent. 9444 len. 61]: These being usually accompanied by a jerk of the rein , or a crack of the whip , led to many trials of strength between them , and to many contentions for the upper-hand , terminating , now and then , in china-shops , and other unusual goals , as Mr Bailey had already hinted to his friend Poll Sweedlepipe .
Parsing [sent. 9445 len. 61]: On the present occasion Mr Bailey , being in spirits , was more than commonly hard upon his charge ; in consequence of which that fiery animal confined himself almost entirely to his hind legs in displaying his paces , and constantly got himself into positions with reference to the cabriolet that very much amazed the passengers in the street .
Parsing [sent. 9446 len. 59]: But Mr Bailey , not at all disturbed , had still a shower of pleasantries to bestow on any one who crossed his path ; as , calling to a full-grown coal-heaver in a wagon , who for a moment blocked the way , ` Now , young ` un , who trusted YOU with a cart ? '
Parsing [sent. 9447 len. 32]: inquiring of elderly ladies who wanted to cross , and ran back again , ` Why they did n't go to the workhouse and get an order to be buried ? '
Parsing [sent. 9448 len. 70]: tempting boys , with friendly words , to get up behind , and immediately afterwards cutting them down ; and the like flashes of a cheerful humour , which he would occasionally relieve by going round St. James 's Square at a hand gallop , and coming slowly into Pall Mall by another entry , as if , in the interval , his pace had been a perfect crawl .
Parsing [sent. 9449 len. 56]: It was not until these amusements had been very often repeated , and the apple-stall at the corner had sustained so many miraculous escapes as to appear impregnable , that Mr Bailey was summoned to the door of a certain house in Pall Mall , and turning short , obeyed the call and jumped out .
Parsing [sent. 9450 len. 60]: It was not until he had held the bridle for some minutes longer , every jerk of Cauliflower 's brother 's head , and every twitch of Cauliflower 's brother 's nostril , taking him off his legs in the meanwhile , that two persons entered the vehicle , one of whom took the reins and drove rapidly off .
Parsing [sent. 9451 len. 42]: Nor was it until Mr Bailey had run after it some hundreds of yards in vain , that he managed to lift his short leg into the iron step , and finally to get his boots upon the little footboard behind .
Parsing [sent. 9452 len. 68]: Then , indeed , he became a sight to see ; and -- standing now on one foot and now upon the other , now trying to look round the cab on this side , now on that , and now endeavouring to peep over the top of it , as it went dashing in among the carts and coaches -- was from head to heel Newmarket .
Parsing [sent. 9453 len. 25]: The appearance of Mr Bailey 's governor as he drove along fully justified that enthusiastic youth 's description of him to the wondering Poll .
Parsing [sent. 9454 len. 25]: He had a world of jet-black shining hair upon his head , upon his cheeks , upon his chin , upon his upper lip .
Parsing [sent. 9455 len. 16]: His clothes , symmetrically made , were of the newest fashion and the costliest kind .
Parsing [sent. 9456 len. 47]: Flowers of gold and blue , and green and blushing red , were on his waistcoat ; precious chains and jewels sparkled on his breast ; his fingers , clogged with brilliant rings , were as unwieldly as summer flies but newly rescued from a honey-pot .
Parsing [sent. 9457 len. 15]: The daylight mantled in his gleaming hat and boots as in a polished glass .
Parsing [sent. 9458 len. 18]: And yet , though changed his name , and changed his outward surface , it was Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 9459 len. 45]: Though turned and twisted upside down , and inside out , as great men have been sometimes known to be ; though no longer Montague Tigg , but Tigg Montague ; still it was Tigg ; the same Satanic , gallant , military Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 9460 len. 19]: The brass was burnished , lacquered , newly stamped ; yet it was the true Tigg metal notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 9461 len. 21]: Beside him sat a smiling gentleman , of less pretensions and of business looks , whom he addressed as David .
Parsing [sent. 9462 len. 13]: Surely not the David of the -- how shall it be phrased ?
Parsing [sent. 9463 len. 7]: -- the triumvirate of golden balls ?
Parsing [sent. 9464 len. 10]: Not David , tapster at the Lombards ' Arms ?
Parsing [sent. 9465 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 9466 len. 4]: The very man .
Parsing [sent. 9467 len. 37]: ` The secretary 's salary , David , ' said Mr Montague , ` the office being now established , is eight hundred pounds per annum , with his house-rent , coals , and candles free .
Parsing [sent. 9468 len. 9]: His five-and-twenty shares he holds , of course .
Parsing [sent. 9469 len. 5]: Is that enough ? '
Parsing [sent. 9470 len. 29]: David smiled and nodded , and coughed behind a little locked portfolio which he carried ; with an air that proclaimed him to be the secretary in question .
Parsing [sent. 9471 len. 27]: ` If that 's enough , ' said Montague , ' I will propose it at the Board to-day , in my capacity as chairman . '
Parsing [sent. 9472 len. 38]: The secretary smiled again ; laughed , indeed , this time ; and said , rubbing his nose slily with one end of the portfolio : ` It was a capital thought , was n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 9473 len. 10]: ` What was a capital thought , David ? '
Parsing [sent. 9474 len. 4]: Mr Montague inquired .
Parsing [sent. 9475 len. 11]: ` The Anglo -- Bengalee , ' tittered the secretary .
Parsing [sent. 9476 len. 26]: ` The Anglo -- Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance Company is rather a capital concern , I hope , David , ' said Montague .
Parsing [sent. 9477 len. 5]: ` Capital indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 9478 len. 14]: cried the secretary , with another laugh -- ' in one sense . '
Parsing [sent. 9479 len. 21]: ` In the only important one , ' observed the chairman ; ` which is number one , David . '
Parsing [sent. 9480 len. 30]: ` What , ' asked the secretary , bursting into another laugh , ` what will be the paid up capital , according to the next prospectus ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9481 len. 26]: A figure of two , and as many oughts after it as the printer can get into the same line , ' replied his friend .
Parsing [sent. 9482 len. 6]: ` Ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 9483 len. 66]: At this they both laughed ; the secretary so vehemently , that in kicking up his feet , he kicked the apron open , and nearly started Cauliflower 's brother into an oyster shop ; not to mention Mr Bailey 's receiving such a sudden swing , that he held on for a moment quite a young Fame , by one strap and no legs .
Parsing [sent. 9484 len. 8]: ` What a chap you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 9485 len. 11]: exclaimed David admiringly , when this little alarm had subsided .
Parsing [sent. 9486 len. 11]: ` Say , genius , David , genius . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9487 len. 18]: `` Well , upon my soul , you ARE a genius then , ' said David . '
Parsing [sent. 9488 len. 26]: I always knew you had the gift of the gab , of course ; but I never believed you were half the man you are .
Parsing [sent. 9489 len. 6]: How could I ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 9490 len. 7]: I rise with circumstances , David .
Parsing [sent. 9491 len. 13]: That 's a point of genius in itself , ' said Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 9492 len. 44]: ` If you were to lose a hundred pound wager to me at this minute David , and were to pay it -LRB- which is most confoundedly improbable -RRB- , I should rise , in a mental point of view , directly . '
Parsing [sent. 9493 len. 33]: It is due to Mr Tigg to say that he had really risen with his opportunities ; and , peculating on a grander scale , he had become a grander man altogether .
Parsing [sent. 9494 len. 24]: ` Ha , ha , ' cried the secretary , laying his hand , with growing familiarity , upon the chairman 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 9495 len. 22]: ` When I look at you , and think of your property in Bengal being -- ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 9496 len. 25]: -- ' The half-expressed idea seemed no less ludicrous to Mr Tigg than to his friend , for he laughed too , heartily . '
Parsing [sent. 9497 len. 51]: -- Being , ' resumed David , ` being amenable -- your property in Bengal being amenable -- to all claims upon the company ; when I look at you and think of that , you might tickle me into fits by waving the feather of a pen at me .
Parsing [sent. 9498 len. 7]: Upon my soul you might ! '
Parsing [sent. 9499 len. 20]: ` It a devilish fine property , ' said Tigg Montague , ` to be amenable to any claims .
Parsing [sent. 9500 len. 15]: The preserve of tigers alone is worth a mint of money , David . '
Parsing [sent. 9501 len. 21]: David could only reply in the intervals of his laughter , ` Oh , what a chap you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 9502 len. 27]: and so continued to laugh , and hold his sides , and wipe his eyes , for some time , without offering any other observation . '
Parsing [sent. 9503 len. 5]: A capital idea ? '
Parsing [sent. 9504 len. 23]: said Tigg , returning after a time to his companion 's first remark ; ` no doubt it was a capital idea .
Parsing [sent. 9505 len. 6]: It was my idea . '
Parsing [sent. 9506 len. 5]: ` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 9507 len. 9]: It was my idea , ' said David .
Parsing [sent. 9508 len. 11]: ` Hang it , let a man have some credit .
Parsing [sent. 9509 len. 14]: Did n't I say to you that I 'd saved a few pounds ?
Parsing [sent. 9510 len. 6]: -- ' ` You said !
Parsing [sent. 9511 len. 22]: Did n't I say to you , ' interposed Tigg , ` that I had come into a few pounds ? '
Parsing [sent. 9512 len. 19]: ` Certainly you did , ' returned David , warmly , ` but that 's not the idea .
Parsing [sent. 9513 len. 22]: Who said , that if we put the money together we could furnish an office , and make a show ? '
Parsing [sent. 9514 len. 39]: ` And who said , ' retorted Mr Tigg , ` that , provided we did it on a sufficiently large scale , we could furnish an office and make a show , without any money at all ?
Parsing [sent. 9515 len. 18]: Be rational , and just , and calm , and tell me whose idea was that . '
Parsing [sent. 9516 len. 23]: ` Why , there , ' David was obliged to confess , ` you had the advantage of me , I admit .
Parsing [sent. 9517 len. 12]: But I do n't put myself on a level with you .
Parsing [sent. 9518 len. 11]: I only want a little credit in the business . '
Parsing [sent. 9519 len. 13]: ` All the credit you deserve to have , ' said Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 9520 len. 35]: ` The plain work of the company , David -- figures , books , circulars , advertisements , pen , ink , and paper , sealing-wax and wafers -- is admirably done by you .
Parsing [sent. 9521 len. 6]: You are a first-rate groveller .
Parsing [sent. 9522 len. 6]: I do n't dispute it .
Parsing [sent. 9523 len. 24]: But the ornamental department , David ; the inventive and poetical department -- ' ` Is entirely yours , ' said his friend .
Parsing [sent. 9524 len. 6]: ` No question of it .
Parsing [sent. 9525 len. 39]: But with such a swell turnout as this , and all the handsome things you 've got about you , and the life you lead , I mean to say it 's a precious comfortable department too . '
Parsing [sent. 9526 len. 7]: ` Does it gain the purpose ?
Parsing [sent. 9527 len. 7]: Is it Anglo -- Bengalee ? '
Parsing [sent. 9528 len. 3]: asked Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 9529 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' said David .
Parsing [sent. 9530 len. 8]: ` Could you undertake it yourself ? '
Parsing [sent. 9531 len. 3]: demanded Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 9532 len. 7]: ` No , ' said David .
Parsing [sent. 9533 len. 6]: ` Ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 9534 len. 3]: laughed Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 9535 len. 43]: ` Then be contented with your station and your profits , David , my fine fellow , and bless the day that made us acquainted across the counter of our common uncle , for it was a golden day to you . '
Parsing [sent. 9536 len. 62]: It will have been already gathered from the conversation of these worthies , that they were embarked in an enterprise of some magnitude , in which they addressed the public in general from the strong position of having everything to gain and nothing at all to lose ; and which , based upon this great principle , was thriving pretty comfortably .
Parsing [sent. 9537 len. 107]: The Anglo -- Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance Company started into existence one morning , not an Infant Institution , but a Grown-up Company running alone at a great pace , and doing business right and left : with a ` branch ' in a first floor over a tailor 's at the west-end of the town , and main offices in a new street in the City , comprising the upper part of a spacious house resplendent in stucco and plate-glass , with wire-blinds in all the windows , and ` Anglo -- Bengalee ' worked into the pattern of every one of them .
Parsing [sent. 9538 len. 75]: On the doorpost was painted again in large letters , ` offices of the Anglo -- Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance Company , ' and on the door was a large brass plate with the same inscription ; always kept very bright , as courting inquiry ; staring the City out of countenance after office hours on working days , and all day long on Sundays ; and looking bolder than the Bank .
Parsing [sent. 9539 len. 51]: Within , the offices were newly plastered , newly painted , newly papered , newly countered , newly floor-clothed , newly tabled , newly chaired , newly fitted up in every way , with goods that were substantial and expensive , and designed -LRB- like the company -RRB- to last .
Parsing [sent. 9540 len. 2]: Business !
Parsing [sent. 9541 len. 78]: Look at the green ledgers with red backs , like strong cricket-balls beaten flat ; the court-guides directories , day-books , almanacks , letter-boxes , weighing-machines for letters , rows of fire-buckets for dashing out a conflagration in its first spark , and saving the immense wealth in notes and bonds belonging to the company ; look at the iron safes , the clock , the office seal -- in its capacious self , security for anything .
Parsing [sent. 9542 len. 2]: Solidity !
Parsing [sent. 9543 len. 22]: Look at the massive blocks of marble in the chimney-pieces , and the gorgeous parapet on the top of the house !
Parsing [sent. 9544 len. 2]: Publicity !
Parsing [sent. 9545 len. 18]: Why , Anglo -- Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance company is painted on the very coal-scuttles .
Parsing [sent. 9546 len. 20]: It is repeated at every turn until the eyes are dazzled with it , and the head is giddy .
Parsing [sent. 9547 len. 136]: It is engraved upon the top of all the letter paper , and it makes a scroll-work round the seal , and it shines out of the porter 's buttons , and it is repeated twenty times in every circular and public notice wherein one David Crimple , Esquire , Secretary and resident Director , takes the liberty of inviting your attention to the accompanying statement of the advantages offered by the Anglo -- Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance Company ; and fully proves to you that any connection on your part with that establishment must result in a perpetual Christmas Box and constantly increasing Bonus to yourself , and that nobody can run any risk by the transaction except the office , which , in its great liberality is pretty sure to lose .
Parsing [sent. 9548 len. 42]: And this , David Crimple , Esquire , submits to you -LRB- and the odds are heavy you believe him -RRB- , is the best guarantee that can reasonably be suggested by the Board of Management for its permanence and stability .
Parsing [sent. 9549 len. 36]: This gentleman 's name , by the way , had been originally Crimp ; but as the word was susceptible of an awkward construction and might be misrepresented , he had altered it to Crimple .
Parsing [sent. 9550 len. 98]: Lest with all these proofs and confirmations , any man should be suspicious of the Anglo -- Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance company ; should doubt in tiger , cab , or person , Tigg Montague , Esquire , -LRB- of Pall Mall and Bengal -RRB- , or any other name in the imaginative List of Directors ; there was a porter on the premises -- a wonderful creature , in a vast red waistcoat and a short-tailed pepper-and-salt coat -- who carried more conviction to the minds of sceptics than the whole establishment without him .
Parsing [sent. 9551 len. 27]: No confidences existed between him and the Directorship ; nobody knew where he had served last ; no character or explanation had been given or required .
Parsing [sent. 9552 len. 9]: No questions had been asked on either side .
Parsing [sent. 9553 len. 26]: This mysterious being , relying solely on his figure , had applied for the situation , and had been instantly engaged on his own terms .
Parsing [sent. 9554 len. 36]: They were high ; but he knew , doubtless , that no man could carry such an extent of waistcoat as himself , and felt the full value of his capacity to such an institution .
Parsing [sent. 9555 len. 39]: When he sat upon a seat erected for him in a corner of the office , with his glazed hat hanging on a peg over his head , it was impossible to doubt the respectability of the concern .
Parsing [sent. 9556 len. 32]: It went on doubling itself with every square inch of his red waistcoat until , like the problem of the nails in the horse 's shoes , the total became enormous .
Parsing [sent. 9557 len. 42]: People had been known to apply to effect an insurance on their lives for a thousand pounds , and looking at him , to beg , before the form of proposal was filled up , that it might be made two .
Parsing [sent. 9558 len. 8]: And yet he was not a giant .
Parsing [sent. 9559 len. 8]: His coat was rather small than otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 9560 len. 8]: The whole charm was in his waistcoat .
Parsing [sent. 9561 len. 33]: Respectability , competence , property in Bengal or anywhere else , responsibility to any amount on the part of the company that employed him , were all expressed in that one garment .
Parsing [sent. 9562 len. 27]: Rival offices had endeavoured to lure him away ; Lombard Street itself had beckoned to him ; rich companies had whispered ` Be a Beadle ! '
Parsing [sent. 9563 len. 11]: but he still continued faithful to the Anglo -- Bengalee .
Parsing [sent. 9564 len. 30]: Whether he was a deep rogue , or a stately simpleton , it was impossible to make out , but he appeared to believe in the Anglo -- Bengalee .
Parsing [sent. 9565 len. 56]: He was grave with imaginary cares of office ; and having nothing whatever to do , and something less to take care of , would look as if the pressure of his numerous duties , and a sense of the treasure in the company 's strong-room , made him a solemn and a thoughtful man .
Parsing [sent. 9566 len. 35]: As the cabriolet drove up to the door , this officer appeared bare-headed on the pavement , crying aloud ` Room for the chairman , room for the chairman , if you please ! '
Parsing [sent. 9567 len. 32]: much to the admiration of the bystanders , who , it is needless to say , had their attention directed to the Anglo -- Bengalee Company thenceforth , by that means .
Parsing [sent. 9568 len. 46]: Mr Tigg leaped gracefully out , followed by the Managing Director -LRB- who was by this time very distant and respectful -RRB- , and ascended the stairs , still preceded by the porter , who cried as he went , ` By your leave there !
Parsing [sent. 9569 len. 4]: by your leave !
Parsing [sent. 9570 len. 10]: The Chairman of the Board , Gentle -- MEN !
Parsing [sent. 9571 len. 54]: In like manner , but in a still more stentorian voice , he ushered the chairman through the public office , where some humble clients were transacting business , into an awful chamber , labelled Board-room ; the door of which sanctuary immediately closed , and screened the great capitalist from vulgar eyes .
Parsing [sent. 9572 len. 62]: The board-room had a Turkey carpet in it , a sideboard , a portrait of Tigg Montague , Esquire , as chairman ; a very imposing chair of office , garnished with an ivory hammer and a little hand-bell ; and a long table , set out at intervals with sheets of blotting-paper , foolscap , clean pens , and inkstands .
Parsing [sent. 9573 len. 35]: The chairman having taken his seat with great solemnity , the secretary supported him on his right hand , and the porter stood bolt upright behind them , forming a warm background of waistcoat .
Parsing [sent. 9574 len. 13]: This was the board : everything else being a light-hearted little fiction .
Parsing [sent. 9575 len. 4]: ` Bullamy ! '
Parsing [sent. 9576 len. 4]: said Mr Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 9577 len. 4]: ` Sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 9578 len. 4]: replied the porter .
Parsing [sent. 9579 len. 19]: ` Let the Medical Officer know , with my compliments , that I wish to see him . '
Parsing [sent. 9580 len. 26]: Bullamy cleared his throat , and bustled out into the office , crying ` The Chairman of the Board wishes to see the Medical Officer .
Parsing [sent. 9581 len. 5]: By your leave there !
Parsing [sent. 9582 len. 5]: By your leave ! '
Parsing [sent. 9583 len. 53]: He soon returned with the gentleman in question ; and at both openings of the board-room door -- at his coming in and at his going out -- simple clients were seen to stretch their necks and stand upon their toes , thirsting to catch the slightest glimpse of that mysterious chamber .
Parsing [sent. 9584 len. 8]: ` Jobling , my dear friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 9585 len. 9]: said Mr Tigg , ` how are you ?
Parsing [sent. 9586 len. 5]: Bullamy , wait outside .
Parsing [sent. 9587 len. 7]: Crimple , do n't leave us .
Parsing [sent. 9588 len. 14]: Jobling , my good fellow , I am glad to see you . '
Parsing [sent. 9589 len. 12]: ` And how are you , Mr Montague , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 9590 len. 36]: said the Medical Officer , throwing himself luxuriously into an easy-chair -LRB- they were all easy-chairs in the board-room -RRB- , and taking a handsome gold snuff-box from the pocket of his black satin waistcoat .
Parsing [sent. 9591 len. 5]: ` How are you ?
Parsing [sent. 9592 len. 8]: A little worn with business , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 9593 len. 5]: If so , rest .
Parsing [sent. 9594 len. 8]: A little feverish from wine , humph ?
Parsing [sent. 9595 len. 5]: If so , water .
Parsing [sent. 9596 len. 10]: Nothing at all the matter , and quite comfortable ?
Parsing [sent. 9597 len. 5]: Then take some lunch .
Parsing [sent. 9598 len. 21]: A very wholesome thing at this time of day to strengthen the gastric juices with lunch , Mr Montague . '
Parsing [sent. 9599 len. 71]: The Medical Officer -LRB- he was the same medical officer who had followed poor old Anthony Chuzzlewit to the grave , and who had attended Mrs Gamp 's patient at the Bull -RRB- smiled in saying these words ; and casually added , as he brushed some grains of snuff from his shirt-frill , ' I always take it myself about this time of day , do you know ! '
Parsing [sent. 9600 len. 4]: ` Bullamy ! '
Parsing [sent. 9601 len. 9]: said the Chairman , ringing the little bell .
Parsing [sent. 9602 len. 4]: ` Sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 9603 len. 4]: ` Lunch . '
Parsing [sent. 9604 len. 10]: ` Not on my account , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 9605 len. 4]: said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 9606 len. 6]: ` You are very good .
Parsing [sent. 9607 len. 3]: Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 9608 len. 5]: I 'm quite ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 9609 len. 4]: Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 9610 len. 53]: if I had been a sharp practitioner , Mr Montague , I should n't have mentioned it without a fee ; for you may depend upon it , my dear sir , that if you do n't make a point of taking lunch , you 'll very soon come under my hands .
Parsing [sent. 9611 len. 6]: Allow me to illustrate this .
Parsing [sent. 9612 len. 50]: In Mr Crimple 's leg -- ' The resident Director gave an involuntary start , for the doctor , in the heat of his demonstration , caught it up and laid it across his own , as if he were going to take it off , then and there .
Parsing [sent. 9613 len. 64]: ` In Mr Crimple 's leg , you 'll observe , ' pursued the doctor , turning back his cuffs and spanning the limb with both hands , ` where Mr Crimple 's knee fits into the socket , here , there is -- that is to say , between the bone and the socket -- a certain quantity of animal oil . '
Parsing [sent. 9614 len. 11]: ` What do you pick MY leg out for ? '
Parsing [sent. 9615 len. 15]: said Mr Crimple , looking with something of an anxious expression at his limb .
Parsing [sent. 9616 len. 14]: ` It 's the same with other legs , ai n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 9617 len. 34]: ` Never you mind , my good sir , ' returned the doctor , shaking his head , ` whether it is the same with other legs , or not the same . '
Parsing [sent. 9618 len. 11]: ` But I do mind , ' said David . '
Parsing [sent. 9619 len. 23]: I take a particular case , Mr Montague , ' returned the doctor , ` as illustrating my remark , you observe .
Parsing [sent. 9620 len. 20]: In this portion of Mr Crimple 's leg , sir , there is a certain amount of animal oil .
Parsing [sent. 9621 len. 21]: In every one of Mr Crimple 's joints , sir , there is more or less of the same deposit .
Parsing [sent. 9622 len. 3]: Very good .
Parsing [sent. 9623 len. 25]: If Mr Crimple neglects his meals , or fails to take his proper quantity of rest , that oil wanes , and becomes exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 9624 len. 5]: What is the consequence ?
Parsing [sent. 9625 len. 27]: Mr Crimple 's bones sink down into their sockets , sir , and Mr Crimple becomes a weazen , puny , stunted , miserable man ! '
Parsing [sent. 9626 len. 33]: The doctor let Mr Crimple 's leg fall suddenly , as if he were already in that agreeable condition ; turned down his wristbands again , and looked triumphantly at the chairman .
Parsing [sent. 9627 len. 19]: ` We know a few secrets of nature in our profession , sir , ' said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 9628 len. 6]: ` Of course we do .
Parsing [sent. 9629 len. 25]: We study for that ; we pass the Hall and the College for that ; and we take our station in society BY that .
Parsing [sent. 9630 len. 12]: It 's extraordinary how little is known on these subjects generally .
Parsing [sent. 9631 len. 52]: Where do you suppose , now ' -- the doctor closed one eye , as he leaned back smilingly in his chair , and formed a triangle with his hands , of which his two thumbs composed the base -- ` where do you suppose Mr Crimple 's stomach is ? '
Parsing [sent. 9632 len. 16]: Mr Crimple , more agitated than before , clapped his hand immediately below his waistcoat .
Parsing [sent. 9633 len. 15]: ` Not at all , ' cried the doctor ; ` not at all .
Parsing [sent. 9634 len. 5]: Quite a popular mistake !
Parsing [sent. 9635 len. 11]: My good sir , you 're altogether deceived . ' '
Parsing [sent. 9636 len. 22]: I feel it there , when it 's out of order ; that 's all I know , ' said Crimple .
Parsing [sent. 9637 len. 17]: ` You think you do , ' replied the doctor ; ` but science knows better .
Parsing [sent. 9638 len. 144]: There was a patient of mine once , ' touching one of the many mourning rings upon his fingers , and slightly bowing his head , ' a gentleman who did me the honour to make a very handsome mention of me in his will -- `` in testimony , '' as he was pleased to say , `` of the unremitting zeal , talent , and attention of my friend and medical attendant , John Jobling , Esquire , M.R.C.S. , '' -- who was so overcome by the idea of having all his life laboured under an erroneous view of the locality of this important organ , that when I assured him on my professional reputation , he was mistaken , he burst into tears , put out his hand , and said , `` Jobling , God bless you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9639 len. 14]: Immediately afterwards he became speechless , and was ultimately buried at Brixton . '
Parsing [sent. 9640 len. 7]: ` By your leave there ! '
Parsing [sent. 9641 len. 5]: cried Bullamy , without .
Parsing [sent. 9642 len. 5]: ` By your leave !
Parsing [sent. 9643 len. 6]: Refreshment for the Board-room ! '
Parsing [sent. 9644 len. 4]: ` Ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 9645 len. 21]: said the doctor , jocularly , as he rubbed his hands , and drew his chair nearer to the table .
Parsing [sent. 9646 len. 9]: ` The true Life Assurance , Mr Montague .
Parsing [sent. 9647 len. 11]: The best Policy in the world , my dear sir .
Parsing [sent. 9648 len. 13]: We should be provident , and eat and drink whenever we can .
Parsing [sent. 9649 len. 6]: Eh , Mr Crimple ? '
Parsing [sent. 9650 len. 31]: The resident Director acquiesced rather sulkily , as if the gratification of replenishing his stomach had been impaired by the unsettlement of his preconceived opinions in reference to its situation .
Parsing [sent. 9651 len. 47]: But the appearance of the porter and under-porter with a tray covered with a snow-white cloth , which , being thrown back , displayed a pair of cold roast fowls , flanked by some potted meats and a cool salad , quickly restored his good humour .
Parsing [sent. 9652 len. 38]: It was enhanced still further by the arrival of a bottle of excellent madeira , and another of champagne ; and he soon attacked the repast with an appetite scarcely inferior to that of the medical officer .
Parsing [sent. 9653 len. 43]: The lunch was handsomely served , with a profusion of rich glass plate , and china ; which seemed to denote that eating and drinking on a showy scale formed no unimportant item in the business of the Anglo -- Bengalee Directorship .
Parsing [sent. 9654 len. 51]: As it proceeded , the Medical Officer grew more and more joyous and red-faced , insomuch that every mouthful he ate , and every drop of wine he swallowed , seemed to impart new lustre to his eyes , and to light up new sparks in his nose and forehead .
Parsing [sent. 9655 len. 28]: In certain quarters of the City and its neighbourhood , Mr Jobling was , as we have already seen in some measure , a very popular character .
Parsing [sent. 9656 len. 43]: He had a portentously sagacious chin , and a pompous voice , with a rich huskiness in some of its tones that went directly to the heart , like a ray of light shining through the ruddy medium of choice old burgundy .
Parsing [sent. 9657 len. 32]: His neckerchief and shirt-frill were ever of the whitest , his clothes of the blackest and sleekest , his gold watch-chain of the heaviest , and his seals of the largest .
Parsing [sent. 9658 len. 15]: His boots , which were always of the brightest , creaked as he walked .
Parsing [sent. 9659 len. 41]: Perhaps he could shake his head , rub his hands , or warm himself before a fire , better than any man alive ; and he had a peculiar way of smacking his lips and saying , ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 9660 len. 13]: at intervals while patients detailed their symptoms , which inspired great confidence .
Parsing [sent. 9661 len. 27]: It seemed to express , ' I know what you 're going to say better than you do ; but go on , go on . '
Parsing [sent. 9662 len. 54]: As he talked on all occasions whether he had anything to say or not , it was unanimously observed of him that he was ` full of anecdote ; ' and his experience and profit from it were considered , for the same reason , to be something much too extensive for description .
Parsing [sent. 9663 len. 68]: His female patients could never praise him too highly ; and the coldest of his male admirers would always say this for him to their friends , ` that whatever Jobling 's professional skill might be -LRB- and it could not be denied that he had a very high reputation -RRB- , he was one of the most comfortable fellows you ever saw in your life ! '
Parsing [sent. 9664 len. 40]: Jobling was for many reasons , and not last in the list because his connection lay principally among tradesmen and their families , exactly the sort of person whom the Anglo -- Bengalee Company wanted for a medical officer .
Parsing [sent. 9665 len. 43]: But Jobling was far too knowing to connect himself with the company in any closer ties than as a paid -LRB- and well paid -RRB- functionary , or to allow his connection to be misunderstood abroad , if he could help it .
Parsing [sent. 9666 len. 42]: Hence he always stated the case to an inquiring patient , after this manner : ` Why , my dear sir , with regard to the Anglo -- Bengalee , my information , you see , is limited ; very limited .
Parsing [sent. 9667 len. 14]: I am the medical officer , in consideration of a certain monthly payment .
Parsing [sent. 9668 len. 23]: The labourer is worthy of his hire ; BIS DAT QUI CITO DAT ' -- -LRB- ` classical scholar , Jobling ! '
Parsing [sent. 9669 len. 10]: thinks the patient , ` well-read man ! ' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 9670 len. 8]: -- ` and I receive it regularly .
Parsing [sent. 9671 len. 21]: Therefore I am bound , so far as my own knowledge goes , to speak well of the establishment . '
Parsing [sent. 9672 len. 26]: -LRB- ` Nothing can be fairer than Jobling 's conduct , ' thinks the patient , who has just paid Jobling 's bill himself . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 9673 len. 59]: ` If you put any question to me , my dear friend , ' says the doctor , ` touching the responsibility or capital of the company , there I am at fault ; for I have no head for figures , and not being a shareholder , am delicate of showing any curiosity whatever on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 9674 len. 26]: Delicacy -- your amiable lady will agree with me I am sure -- should be one of the first characteristics of a medical man . '
Parsing [sent. 9675 len. 20]: -LRB- ` Nothing can be finer or more gentlemanly than Jobling 's feeling , ' thinks the patient . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 9676 len. 13]: ` Very good , my dear sir , so the matter stands .
Parsing [sent. 9677 len. 7]: You do n't know Mr Montague ?
Parsing [sent. 9678 len. 6]: I 'm sorry for it .
Parsing [sent. 9679 len. 13]: A remarkably handsome man , and quite the gentleman in every respect .
Parsing [sent. 9680 len. 9]: Property , I am told , in India .
Parsing [sent. 9681 len. 9]: House and everything belonging to him , beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 9682 len. 10]: Costly furniture on the most elegant and lavish scale .
Parsing [sent. 9683 len. 16]: And pictures , which , even in an anatomical point of view , are per-fection .
Parsing [sent. 9684 len. 24]: In case you should ever think of doing anything with the company , I 'll pass you , you may depend upon it .
Parsing [sent. 9685 len. 9]: I can conscientiously report you a healthy subject .
Parsing [sent. 9686 len. 53]: If I understand any man 's constitution , it is yours ; and this little indisposition has done him more good , ma'am , ' says the doctor , turning to the patient 's wife , ` than if he had swallowed the contents of half the nonsensical bottles in my surgery .
Parsing [sent. 9687 len. 27]: For they ARE nonsense -- to tell the honest truth , one half of them are nonsense -- compared with such a constitution as his ! '
Parsing [sent. 9688 len. 37]: -LRB- ` Jobling is the most friendly creature I ever met with in my life , ' thinks the patient ; ` and upon my word and honour , I 'll consider of it ! ' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 9689 len. 21]: ` Commission to you , doctor , on four new policies , and a loan this morning , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 9690 len. 20]: said Crimple , looking , when they had finished lunch , over some papers brought in by the porter .
Parsing [sent. 9691 len. 5]: ` Well done ! '
Parsing [sent. 9692 len. 18]: ` Jobling , my dear friend , ' said Tigg , ` long life to you . '
Parsing [sent. 9693 len. 5]: ` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 9694 len. 2]: Nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 9695 len. 23]: Upon my word I 've no right to draw the commission , ' said the doctor , ' I have n't really .
Parsing [sent. 9696 len. 6]: It 's picking your pocket .
Parsing [sent. 9697 len. 7]: I do n't recommend anybody here .
Parsing [sent. 9698 len. 7]: I only say what I know .
Parsing [sent. 9699 len. 16]: My patients ask me what I know , and I tell 'em what I know .
Parsing [sent. 9700 len. 3]: Nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 9701 len. 18]: Caution is my weak side , that 's the truth ; and always was from a boy .
Parsing [sent. 9702 len. 20]: That is , ' said the doctor , filling his glass , ` caution in behalf of other people .
Parsing [sent. 9703 len. 29]: Whether I would repose confidence in this company myself , if I had not been paying money elsewhere for many years -- that 's quite another question . '
Parsing [sent. 9704 len. 30]: He tried to look as if there were no doubt about it ; but feeling that he did it but indifferently , changed the theme and praised the wine .
Parsing [sent. 9705 len. 37]: ` Talking of wine , ' said the doctor , ` reminds me of one of the finest glasses of light old port I ever drank in my life ; and that was at a funeral .
Parsing [sent. 9706 len. 18]: You have not seen anything of -- of THAT party , Mr Montague , have you ? '
Parsing [sent. 9707 len. 5]: handing him a card .
Parsing [sent. 9708 len. 10]: ` He is not buried , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 9709 len. 8]: said Tigg , as he took it .
Parsing [sent. 9710 len. 14]: ` The honour of his company is not requested if he is . '
Parsing [sent. 9711 len. 6]: ` Ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 9712 len. 4]: laughed the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 9713 len. 6]: ` No ; not quite .
Parsing [sent. 9714 len. 11]: He was honourably connected with that very occasion though . '
Parsing [sent. 9715 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 9716 len. 17]: said Tigg , smoothing his moustache , as he cast his eyes upon the name . '
Parsing [sent. 9717 len. 3]: I recollect .
Parsing [sent. 9718 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 9719 len. 7]: He has not been here . '
Parsing [sent. 9720 len. 20]: The words were on his lips , when Bullamy entered , and presented a card to the Medical Officer .
Parsing [sent. 9721 len. 15]: ` Talk of the what 's his name -- ' observed the doctor rising .
Parsing [sent. 9722 len. 11]: ` And he 's sure to appear , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 9723 len. 3]: said Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 9724 len. 15]: ` Why , no , Mr Montague , no , ' returned the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 9725 len. 21]: ` We will not say that in the present case , for this gentleman is very far from it . '
Parsing [sent. 9726 len. 10]: ` So much the better , ' retorted Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 9727 len. 12]: ` So much the more adaptable to the Anglo -- Bengalee .
Parsing [sent. 9728 len. 15]: Bullamy , clear the table and take the things out by the other door .
Parsing [sent. 9729 len. 6]: Mr Crimple , business . '
Parsing [sent. 9730 len. 7]: ` Shall I introduce him ? '
Parsing [sent. 9731 len. 4]: asked Jobling . '
Parsing [sent. 9732 len. 17]: I shall be eternally delighted , ' answered Tigg , kissing his hand and smiling sweetly .
Parsing [sent. 9733 len. 15]: The doctor disappeared into the outer office , and immediately returned with Jonas Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 9734 len. 8]: ` Mr Montague , ' said Jobling .
Parsing [sent. 9735 len. 4]: ` Allow me .
Parsing [sent. 9736 len. 5]: My friend Mr Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 9737 len. 7]: My dear friend -- our chairman .
Parsing [sent. 9738 len. 34]: Now do you know , ' he added checking himself with infinite policy , and looking round with a smile ; ` that 's a very singular instance of the force of example .
Parsing [sent. 9739 len. 13]: It really is a very remarkable instance of the force of example .
Parsing [sent. 9740 len. 5]: I say OUR chairman .
Parsing [sent. 9741 len. 7]: Why do I say our chairman ?
Parsing [sent. 9742 len. 10]: Because he is not MY chairman , you know .
Parsing [sent. 9743 len. 43]: I have no connection with the company , farther than giving them , for a certain fee and reward , my poor opinion as a medical man , precisely as I may give it any day to Jack Noakes or Tom Styles .
Parsing [sent. 9744 len. 8]: Then why do I say our chairman ?
Parsing [sent. 9745 len. 11]: Simply because I hear the phrase constantly repeated about me .
Parsing [sent. 9746 len. 15]: Such is the involuntary operation of the mental faculty in the imitative biped man .
Parsing [sent. 9747 len. 10]: Mr Crimple , I believe you never take snuff ?
Parsing [sent. 9748 len. 2]: Injudicious .
Parsing [sent. 9749 len. 4]: You should . '
Parsing [sent. 9750 len. 46]: Pending these remarks on the part of the doctor , and the lengthened and sonorous pinch with which he followed them up , Jonas took a seat at the board ; as ungainly a man as ever he has been within the reader 's knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 9751 len. 31]: It is too common with all of us , but it is especially in the nature of a mean mind , to be overawed by fine clothes and fine furniture .
Parsing [sent. 9752 len. 9]: They had a very decided influence on Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 9753 len. 25]: ` Now you two gentlemen have business to discuss , I know , ' said the doctor , ` and your time is precious .
Parsing [sent. 9754 len. 33]: So is mine ; for several lives are waiting for me in the next room , and I have a round of visits to make after -- after I have taken 'em .
Parsing [sent. 9755 len. 18]: Having had the happiness to introduce you to each other , I may go about my business .
Parsing [sent. 9756 len. 2]: Good-bye .
Parsing [sent. 9757 len. 51]: But allow me , Mr Montague , before I go , to say this of my friend who sits beside you : That gentleman has done more , sir , ' rapping his snuff-box solemnly , ` to reconcile me to human nature , than any man alive or dead .
Parsing [sent. 9758 len. 3]: Good-bye ! '
Parsing [sent. 9759 len. 127]: With these words Jobling bolted abruptly out of the room , and proceeded in his own official department , to impress the lives in waiting with a sense of his keen conscientiousness in the discharge of his duty , and the great difficulty of getting into the Anglo -- Bengalee ; by feeling their pulses , looking at their tongues , listening at their ribs , poking them in the chest , and so forth ; though , if he did n't well know beforehand that whatever kind of lives they were , the Anglo -- Bengalee would accept them readily , he was far from being the Jobling that his friend considered him ; and was not the original Jobling , but a spurious imitation .
Parsing [sent. 9760 len. 21]: Mr Crimple also departed on the business of the morning ; and Jonas Chuzzlewit and Tigg were left alone . '
Parsing [sent. 9761 len. 33]: I learn from our friend , ' said Tigg , drawing his chair towards Jonas with a winning ease of manner , ` that you have been thinking -- ' ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9762 len. 17]: Ecod then he 'd no right to say so , ' cried Jonas , interrupting . '
Parsing [sent. 9763 len. 8]: I did n't tell HIM my thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 9764 len. 26]: If he took it into his head that I was coming here for such or such a purpose , why , that 's his lookout .
Parsing [sent. 9765 len. 9]: I do n't stand committed by that . '
Parsing [sent. 9766 len. 49]: Jonas said this offensively enough ; for over and above the habitual distrust of his character , it was in his nature to seek to revenge himself on the fine clothes and the fine furniture , in exact proportion as he had been unable to withstand their influence .
Parsing [sent. 9767 len. 30]: ` If I come here to ask a question or two , and get a document or two to consider of , I do n't bind myself to anything .
Parsing [sent. 9768 len. 12]: Let 's understand that , you know , ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 9769 len. 6]: ` My dear fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 9770 len. 15]: cried Tigg , clapping him on the shoulder , ' I applaud your frankness .
Parsing [sent. 9771 len. 17]: If men like you and I speak openly at first , all possible misunderstanding is avoided .
Parsing [sent. 9772 len. 18]: Why should I disguise what you know so well , but what the crowd never dream of ?
Parsing [sent. 9773 len. 13]: We companies are all birds of prey ; mere birds of prey .
Parsing [sent. 9774 len. 34]: The only question is , whether in serving our own turn , we can serve yours too ; whether in double-lining our own nest , we can put a single living into yours .
Parsing [sent. 9775 len. 8]: Oh , you 're in our secret .
Parsing [sent. 9776 len. 6]: You 're behind the scenes .
Parsing [sent. 9777 len. 21]: We 'll make a merit of dealing plainly with you , when we know we ca n't help it . '
Parsing [sent. 9778 len. 49]: It was remarked , on the first introduction of Mr Jonas into these pages , that there is a simplicity of cunning no less than a simplicity of innocence , and that in all matters involving a faith in knavery , he was the most credulous of men .
Parsing [sent. 9779 len. 62]: If Mr Tigg had preferred any claim to high and honourable dealing , Jonas would have suspected him though he had been a very model of probity ; but when he gave utterance to Jonas 's own thoughts of everything and everybody , Jonas began to feel that he was a pleasant fellow , and one to be talked to freely .
Parsing [sent. 9780 len. 42]: He changed his position in the chair , not for a less awkward , but for a more boastful attitude ; and smiling in his miserable conceit rejoined : ` You a n't a bad man of business , Mr Montague .
Parsing [sent. 9781 len. 13]: You know how to set about it , I WILL say . '
Parsing [sent. 9782 len. 36]: ` Tut , tut , ' said Tigg , nodding confidentially , and showing his white teeth ; ` we are not children , Mr Chuzzlewit ; we are grown men , I hope . '
Parsing [sent. 9783 len. 52]: Jonas assented , and said after a short silence , first spreading out his legs , and sticking one arm akimbo to show how perfectly at home he was , ` The truth is -- ' ` Do n't say , the truth , ' interposed Tigg , with another grin .
Parsing [sent. 9784 len. 8]: ` It 's so like humbug . '
Parsing [sent. 9785 len. 9]: Greatly charmed by this , Jonas began again .
Parsing [sent. 9786 len. 18]: ` The long and the short of it is -- ' ` Better , ' muttered Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 9787 len. 6]: ` Much better ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 9788 len. 33]: -- That I did n't consider myself very well used by one or two of the old companies in some negotiations I have had with 'em -- once had , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 9789 len. 31]: They started objections they had no right to start , and put questions they had no right to put , and carried things much too high for my taste . '
Parsing [sent. 9790 len. 18]: As he made these observations he cast down his eyes , and looked curiously at the carpet .
Parsing [sent. 9791 len. 7]: Mr Tigg looked curiously at him .
Parsing [sent. 9792 len. 30]: He made so long a pause , that Tigg came to the rescue , and said , in his pleasantest manner : ` Take a glass of wine . '
Parsing [sent. 9793 len. 24]: ` No , no , ' returned Jonas , with a cunning shake of the head ; ` none of that , thankee .
Parsing [sent. 9794 len. 5]: No wine over business .
Parsing [sent. 9795 len. 15]: All very well for you , but it would n't do for me . '
Parsing [sent. 9796 len. 12]: ` What an old hand you are , Mr Chuzzlewit ! '
Parsing [sent. 9797 len. 18]: said Tigg , leaning back in his chair , and leering at him through his half-shut eyes .
Parsing [sent. 9798 len. 43]: Jonas shook his head again , as much as to say , ` You 're right there ; ' And then resumed , jocosely : ` Not such an old hand , either , but that I 've been and got married .
Parsing [sent. 9799 len. 9]: That 's rather green , you 'll say .
Parsing [sent. 9800 len. 10]: Perhaps it is , especially as she 's young .
Parsing [sent. 9801 len. 20]: But one never knows what may happen to these women , so I 'm thinking of insuring her life .
Parsing [sent. 9802 len. 25]: It is but fair , you know , that a man should secure some consolation in case of meeting with such a loss . '
Parsing [sent. 9803 len. 23]: ` If anything can console him under such heart-breaking circumstances , ' murmured Tigg , with his eyes shut up as before .
Parsing [sent. 9804 len. 12]: ` Exactly , ' returned Jonas ; ` if anything can .
Parsing [sent. 9805 len. 68]: Now , supposing I did it here , I should do it cheap , I know , and easy , without bothering her about it ; which I 'd much rather not do , for it 's just in a woman 's way to take it into her head , if you talk to her about such things , that she 's going to die directly . '
Parsing [sent. 9806 len. 18]: ` So it is , ' cried Tigg , kissing his hand in honour of the sex .
Parsing [sent. 9807 len. 6]: ` You 're quite right .
Parsing [sent. 9808 len. 9]: Sweet , silly , fluttering little simpletons ! '
Parsing [sent. 9809 len. 34]: ` Well , ' said Jonas , ` on that account , you know , and because offence has been given me in other quarters , I would n't mind patronizing this Company .
Parsing [sent. 9810 len. 18]: But I want to know what sort of security there is for the Company 's going on .
Parsing [sent. 9811 len. 11]: That 's the -- ' ` Not the truth ? '
Parsing [sent. 9812 len. 9]: cried Tigg , holding up his jewelled hand .
Parsing [sent. 9813 len. 12]: ` Do n't use that Sunday School expression , please ! '
Parsing [sent. 9814 len. 13]: ` The long and the short of it , ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 9815 len. 16]: ` The long and the short of it is , what 's the security ? '
Parsing [sent. 9816 len. 33]: ` The paid-up capital , my dear sir , ' said Tigg , referring to some papers on the table , ` is , at this present moment -- ' ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9817 len. 14]: I understand all about paid-up capitals , you know , ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 9818 len. 5]: ` You do ? '
Parsing [sent. 9819 len. 7]: cried Tigg , stopping short . '
Parsing [sent. 9820 len. 6]: I should hope so . '
Parsing [sent. 9821 len. 24]: He turned the papers down again , and moving nearer to him , said in his ear : ' I know you do .
Parsing [sent. 9822 len. 5]: I know you do .
Parsing [sent. 9823 len. 5]: Look at me ! '
Parsing [sent. 9824 len. 32]: It was not much in Jonas 's way to look straight at anybody ; but thus requested , he made shift to take a tolerable survey of the chairman 's features .
Parsing [sent. 9825 len. 14]: The chairman fell back a little , to give him the better opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 9826 len. 6]: ` You know me ? '
Parsing [sent. 9827 len. 7]: he inquired , elevating his eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 9828 len. 4]: ` You recollect ?
Parsing [sent. 9829 len. 7]: You 've seen me before ? '
Parsing [sent. 9830 len. 37]: ` Why , I thought I remembered your face when I first came in , ' said Jonas , gazing at it ; ` but I could n't call to mind where I had seen it .
Parsing [sent. 9831 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 9832 len. 8]: I do n't remember , even now .
Parsing [sent. 9833 len. 7]: Was it in the street ? '
Parsing [sent. 9834 len. 9]: ` Was it in Pecksniff 's parlour ? '
Parsing [sent. 9835 len. 9]: said Tigg ` In Pecksniff 's parlour ! '
Parsing [sent. 9836 len. 8]: echoed Jonas , fetching a long breath .
Parsing [sent. 9837 len. 38]: ` You do n't mean when -- ' ` Yes , ' cried Tigg , ` when there was a very charming and delightful little family party , at which yourself and your respected father assisted . '
Parsing [sent. 9838 len. 11]: ` Well , never mind HIM , ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 9839 len. 14]: ` He 's dead , and there 's no help for it . '
Parsing [sent. 9840 len. 7]: ` Dead , is he ! '
Parsing [sent. 9841 len. 12]: cried Tigg , ` Venerable old gentleman , is he dead !
Parsing [sent. 9842 len. 7]: You 're very like him . '
Parsing [sent. 9843 len. 45]: Jonas received this compliment with anything but a good grace , perhaps because of his own private sentiments in reference to the personal appearance of his deceased parent ; perhaps because he was not best pleased to find that Montague and Tigg were one .
Parsing [sent. 9844 len. 19]: That gentleman perceived it , and tapping him familiarly on the sleeve , beckoned him to the window .
Parsing [sent. 9845 len. 15]: From this moment , Mr Montague 's jocularity and flow of spirits were remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 9846 len. 13]: ` Do you find me at all changed since that time ? '
Parsing [sent. 9847 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 9848 len. 5]: ` Speak plainly . '
Parsing [sent. 9849 len. 17]: Jonas looked hard at his waistcoat and jewels ; and said ` Rather , ecod ! '
Parsing [sent. 9850 len. 11]: ` Was I at all seedy in those days ? '
Parsing [sent. 9851 len. 3]: asked Montague .
Parsing [sent. 9852 len. 8]: ` Precious seedy , ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 9853 len. 17]: Mr Montague pointed down into the street , where Bailey and the cab were in attendance .
Parsing [sent. 9854 len. 6]: ` Neat ; perhaps dashing .
Parsing [sent. 9855 len. 8]: Do you know whose it is ? '
Parsing [sent. 9856 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 9857 len. 3]: ` Mine .
Parsing [sent. 9858 len. 7]: Do you like this room ? '
Parsing [sent. 9859 len. 14]: ` It must have cost a lot of money , ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 9860 len. 5]: ` You 're right .
Parsing [sent. 9861 len. 3]: Mine too .
Parsing [sent. 9862 len. 33]: Why do n't you ' -- he whispered this , and nudged him in the side with his elbow -- ` why do n't you take premiums , instead of paying 'em ?
Parsing [sent. 9863 len. 10]: That 's what a man like you should do .
Parsing [sent. 9864 len. 4]: Join us ! '
Parsing [sent. 9865 len. 7]: Jonas stared at him in amazement .
Parsing [sent. 9866 len. 8]: ` Is that a crowded street ? '
Parsing [sent. 9867 len. 11]: asked Montague , calling his attention to the multitude without .
Parsing [sent. 9868 len. 20]: ` Very , ' said Jonas , only glancing at it , and immediately afterwards looking at him again .
Parsing [sent. 9869 len. 35]: ` There are printed calculations , ' said his companion , ` which will tell you pretty nearly how many people will pass up and down that thoroughfare in the course of a day .
Parsing [sent. 9870 len. 33]: I can tell you how many of 'em will come in here , merely because they find this office here ; knowing no more about it than they do of the Pyramids .
Parsing [sent. 9871 len. 4]: Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 9872 len. 3]: Join us .
Parsing [sent. 9873 len. 7]: You shall come in cheap . '
Parsing [sent. 9874 len. 9]: Jonas looked at him harder and harder . '
Parsing [sent. 9875 len. 65]: I can tell you , ' said Tigg in his ear , ` how many of 'em will buy annuities , effect insurances , bring us their money in a hundred shapes and ways , force it upon us , trust us as if we were the Mint ; yet know no more about us than you do of that crossing-sweeper at the corner .
Parsing [sent. 9876 len. 4]: Not so much .
Parsing [sent. 9877 len. 5]: Ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 9878 len. 7]: Jonas gradually broke into a smile .
Parsing [sent. 9879 len. 4]: ` Yah ! '
Parsing [sent. 9880 len. 31]: said Montague , giving him a pleasant thrust in the breast ; ` you 're too deep for us , you dog , or I would n't have told you .
Parsing [sent. 9881 len. 11]: Dine with me to-morrow , in Pall Mall ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 9882 len. 6]: I will ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 9883 len. 4]: ` Done ! '
Parsing [sent. 9884 len. 3]: cried Montague .
Parsing [sent. 9885 len. 5]: ` Wait a bit .
Parsing [sent. 9886 len. 10]: Take these papers with you and look 'em over .
Parsing [sent. 9887 len. 15]: See , ' he said , snatching some printed forms from the table . '
Parsing [sent. 9888 len. 21]: B is a little tradesman , clerk , parson , artist , author , any common thing you like . '
Parsing [sent. 9889 len. 13]: ` Yes , ' said Jonas , looking greedily over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 9890 len. 5]: ` Well ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 9891 len. 5]: B wants a loan .
Parsing [sent. 9892 len. 13]: Say fifty or a hundred pound ; perhaps more ; no matter .
Parsing [sent. 9893 len. 7]: B proposes self and two securities .
Parsing [sent. 9894 len. 4]: B is accepted .
Parsing [sent. 9895 len. 6]: Two securities give a bond .
Parsing [sent. 9896 len. 24]: B assures his own life for double the amount , and brings two friends ' lives also -- just to patronize the office .
Parsing [sent. 9897 len. 5]: Ha ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 9898 len. 7]: Is that a good notion ? '
Parsing [sent. 9899 len. 10]: ` Ecod , that 's a capital notion ! '
Parsing [sent. 9900 len. 3]: cried Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 9901 len. 9]: ` But does he really do it ? '
Parsing [sent. 9902 len. 5]: ` Do it ! '
Parsing [sent. 9903 len. 4]: repeated the chairman .
Parsing [sent. 9904 len. 15]: ` B 's hard up , my good fellow , and will do anything .
Parsing [sent. 9905 len. 5]: Do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 9906 len. 6]: It 's my idea . '
Parsing [sent. 9907 len. 6]: ` It does you honour .
Parsing [sent. 9908 len. 13]: I 'm blest if it do n't , ' said Jonas . '
Parsing [sent. 9909 len. 21]: I think it does , ' replied the chairman , ` and I 'm proud to hear you say so .
Parsing [sent. 9910 len. 18]: B pays the highest lawful interest -- ' ` That a n't much , ' interrupted Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 9911 len. 3]: ` Right !
Parsing [sent. 9912 len. 4]: quite right ! '
Parsing [sent. 9913 len. 3]: retorted Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 9914 len. 37]: ` And hard it is upon the part of the law that it should be so confoundedly down upon us unfortunate victims ; when it takes such amazing good interest for itself from all its clients .
Parsing [sent. 9915 len. 12]: But charity begins at home , and justice begins next door .
Parsing [sent. 9916 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 9917 len. 118]: The law being hard upon us , we 're not exactly soft upon B ; for besides charging B the regular interest , we get B 's premium , and B 's friends ' premiums , and we charge B for the bond , and , whether we accept him or not , we charge B for `` inquiries '' -LRB- we keep a man , at a pound a week , to make 'em -RRB- , and we charge B a trifle for the secretary ; and in short , my good fellow , we stick it into B , up hill and down dale , and make a devilish comfortable little property out of him .
Parsing [sent. 9918 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 9919 len. 26]: I drive B , in point of fact , ' said Tigg , pointing to the cabriolet , ` and a thoroughbred horse he is .
Parsing [sent. 9920 len. 7]: Ha , ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 9921 len. 8]: Jonas enjoyed this joke very much indeed .
Parsing [sent. 9922 len. 10]: It was quite in his peculiar vein of humour .
Parsing [sent. 9923 len. 39]: ` Then , ' said Tigg Montague , ` we grant annuities on the very lowest and most advantageous terms known in the money market ; and the old ladies and gentlemen down in the country buy 'em .
Parsing [sent. 9924 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 9925 len. 8]: And we pay 'em too -- perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 9926 len. 7]: Ha , ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 9927 len. 16]: ` But there 's responsibility in that , ' said Jonas , looking doubtful . '
Parsing [sent. 9928 len. 11]: I take it all myself , ' said Tigg Montague .
Parsing [sent. 9929 len. 8]: ` Here I am responsible for everything .
Parsing [sent. 9930 len. 8]: The only responsible person in the establishment !
Parsing [sent. 9931 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 9932 len. 13]: Then there are the Life Assurances without loans ; the common policies .
Parsing [sent. 9933 len. 6]: Very profitable , very comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 9934 len. 14]: Money down , you know ; repeated every year ; capital fun ! '
Parsing [sent. 9935 len. 13]: ` But when they begin to fall in , ' observed Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 9936 len. 30]: ` It 's all very well , while the office is young , but when the policies begin to die -- that 's what I am thinking of . '
Parsing [sent. 9937 len. 41]: ` At the first start , my dear fellow , ' said Montague , ` to show you how correct your judgment is , we had a couple of unlucky deaths that brought us down to a grand piano . '
Parsing [sent. 9938 len. 7]: ` Brought you down where ? '
Parsing [sent. 9939 len. 4]: cried Jonas . '
Parsing [sent. 9940 len. 39]: I give you my sacred word of honour , ' said Tigg Montague , ` that I raised money on every other individual piece of property , and was left alone in the world with a grand piano .
Parsing [sent. 9941 len. 17]: And it was an upright-grand too , so that I could n't even sit upon it .
Parsing [sent. 9942 len. 11]: But , my dear fellow , we got over it .
Parsing [sent. 9943 len. 28]: We granted a great many new policies that week -LRB- liberal allowance to solicitors , by the bye -RRB- , and got over it in no time .
Parsing [sent. 9944 len. 47]: Whenever they should chance to fall in heavily , as you very justly observe they may , one of these days ; then -- ' he finished the sentence in so low a whisper , that only one disconnected word was audible , and that imperfectly .
Parsing [sent. 9945 len. 8]: But it sounded like ` Bolt . '
Parsing [sent. 9946 len. 11]: ` Why , you 're as bold as brass ! '
Parsing [sent. 9947 len. 9]: said Jonas , in the utmost admiration . '
Parsing [sent. 9948 len. 24]: A man can well afford to be as bold as brass , my good fellow , when he gets gold in exchange ! '
Parsing [sent. 9949 len. 15]: cried the chairman , with a laugh that shook him from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 9950 len. 9]: ` You 'll dine with me to-morrow ? '
Parsing [sent. 9951 len. 6]: ` At what time ? '
Parsing [sent. 9952 len. 3]: asked Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 9953 len. 3]: ` Seven .
Parsing [sent. 9954 len. 5]: Here 's my card .
Parsing [sent. 9955 len. 4]: Take the documents .
Parsing [sent. 9956 len. 9]: I see you 'll join us ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 9957 len. 11]: I do n't know about that , ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 9958 len. 13]: ` There 's a good deal to be looked into first . '
Parsing [sent. 9959 len. 23]: ` You shall look , ' said Montague , slapping him on the back , ` into anything and everything you please .
Parsing [sent. 9960 len. 10]: But you 'll join us , I am convinced .
Parsing [sent. 9961 len. 6]: You were made for it .
Parsing [sent. 9962 len. 3]: Bullamy ! '
Parsing [sent. 9963 len. 13]: Obedient to the summons and the little bell , the waistcoat appeared .
Parsing [sent. 9964 len. 31]: Being charged to show Jonas out , it went before ; and the voice within it cried , as usual , ` By your leave there , by your leave !
Parsing [sent. 9965 len. 10]: Gentleman from the board-room , by your leave ! '
Parsing [sent. 9966 len. 28]: Mr Montague being left alone , pondered for some moments , and then said , raising his voice : ` Is Nadgett in the office there ? '
Parsing [sent. 9967 len. 8]: ` Here he is , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 9968 len. 24]: And he promptly entered ; shutting the board-room door after him , as carefully as if he were about to plot a murder .
Parsing [sent. 9969 len. 14]: He was the man at a pound a week who made the inquiries .
Parsing [sent. 9970 len. 33]: It was no virtue or merit in Nadgett that he transacted all his Anglo -- Bengalee business secretly and in the closest confidence ; for he was born to be a secret .
Parsing [sent. 9971 len. 40]: He was a short , dried-up , withered old man , who seemed to have secreted his very blood ; for nobody would have given him credit for the possession of six ounces of it in his whole body .
Parsing [sent. 9972 len. 24]: How he lived was a secret ; where he lived was a secret ; and even what he was , was a secret .
Parsing [sent. 9973 len. 51]: In his musty old pocket-book he carried contradictory cards , in some of which he called himself a coal-merchant , in others a wine-merchant , in others a commission-agent , in others a collector , in others an accountant ; as if he really did n't know the secret himself .
Parsing [sent. 9974 len. 18]: He was always keeping appointments in the City , and the other man never seemed to come .
Parsing [sent. 9975 len. 64]: He would sit on ` Change for hours , looking at everybody who walked in and out , and would do the like at Garraway 's , and in other business coffee-rooms , in some of which he would be occasionally seen drying a very damp pocket-handkerchief before the fire , and still looking over his shoulder for the man who never appeared .
Parsing [sent. 9976 len. 41]: He was mildewed , threadbare , shabby ; always had flue upon his legs and back ; and kept his linen so secretly buttoning up and wrapping over , that he might have had none -- perhaps he had n't .
Parsing [sent. 9977 len. 29]: He carried one stained beaver glove , which he dangled before him by the forefinger as he walked or sat ; but even its fellow was a secret .
Parsing [sent. 9978 len. 33]: Some people said he had been a bankrupt , others that he had gone an infant into an ancient Chancery suit which was still depending , but it was all a secret .
Parsing [sent. 9979 len. 69]: He carried bits of sealing-wax and a hieroglyphical old copper seal in his pocket , and often secretly indited letters in corner boxes of the trysting-places before mentioned ; but they never appeared to go to anybody , for he would put them into a secret place in his coat , and deliver them to himself weeks afterwards , very much to his own surprise , quite yellow .
Parsing [sent. 9980 len. 42]: He was that sort of man that if he had died worth a million of money , or had died worth twopence halfpenny , everybody would have been perfectly satisfied , and would have said it was just as they expected .
Parsing [sent. 9981 len. 33]: And yet he belonged to a class ; a race peculiar to the City ; who are secrets as profound to one another , as they are to the rest of mankind .
Parsing [sent. 9982 len. 45]: ` Mr Nadgett , ' said Montague , copying Jonas Chuzzlewit 's address upon a piece of paper , from the card which was still lying on the table , ` any information about this name , I shall be glad to have myself .
Parsing [sent. 9983 len. 8]: Do n't you mind what it is .
Parsing [sent. 9984 len. 9]: Any you can scrape together , bring me .
Parsing [sent. 9985 len. 9]: Bring it to me , Mr Nadgett . '
Parsing [sent. 9986 len. 45]: Nadgett put on his spectacles , and read the name attentively ; then looked at the chairman over his glasses , and bowed ; then took them off , and put them in their case ; and then put the case in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 9987 len. 39]: When he had done so , he looked , without his spectacles , at the paper as it lay before him , and at the same time produced his pocket-book from somewhere about the middle of his spine .
Parsing [sent. 9988 len. 42]: Large as it was , it was very full of documents , but he found a place for this one ; and having clasped it carefully , passed it by a kind of solemn legerdemain into the same region as before .
Parsing [sent. 9989 len. 31]: He withdrew with another bow and without a word ; opening the door no wider than was sufficient for his passage out ; and shutting it as carefully as before .
Parsing [sent. 9990 len. 27]: The chairman of the board employed the rest of the morning in affixing his sign-manual of gracious acceptance to various new proposals of annuity-purchase and assurance .
Parsing [sent. 9991 len. 12]: The Company was looking up , for they flowed in gayly .
Parsing [sent. 9992 len. 9]: CHAPTER TWENTY -- EIGHT MR MONTAGUE AT HOME .
Parsing [sent. 9993 len. 42]: AND MR JONAS CHUZZLEWIT AT HOME There were many powerful reasons for Jonas Chuzzlewit being strongly prepossessed in favour of the scheme which its great originator had so boldly laid open to him ; but three among them stood prominently forward .
Parsing [sent. 9994 len. 11]: Firstly , there was money to be made by it .
Parsing [sent. 9995 len. 18]: Secondly , the money had the peculiar charm of being sagaciously obtained at other people 's cost .
Parsing [sent. 9996 len. 30]: Thirdly , it involved much outward show of homage and distinction : a board being an awful institution in its own sphere , and a director a mighty man .
Parsing [sent. 9997 len. 49]: ` To make a swingeing profit , have a lot of chaps to order about , and get into regular good society by one and the same means , and them so easy to one 's hand , ai n't such a bad look-out , ' thought Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 9998 len. 56]: The latter considerations were only second to his avarice ; for , conscious that there was nothing in his person , conduct , character , or accomplishments , to command respect , he was greedy of power , and was , in his heart , as much a tyrant as any laureled conqueror on record .
Parsing [sent. 9999 len. 28]: But he determined to proceed with cunning and caution , and to be very keen on his observation of the gentility of Mr Montague 's private establishment .
Parsing [sent. 10000 len. 60]: For it no more occurred to this shallow knave that Montague wanted him to be so , or he would n't have invited him while his decision was yet in abeyance , than the possibility of that genius being able to overreach him in any way , pierced through his self-deceit by the inlet of a needle 's point .
Parsing [sent. 10001 len. 46]: He had said , in the outset , that Jonas was too sharp for him ; and Jonas , who would have been sharp enough to believe him in nothing else , though he had solemnly sworn it , believed him in that , instantly .
Parsing [sent. 10002 len. 35]: It was with a faltering hand , and yet with an imbecile attempt at a swagger , that he knocked at his new friend 's door in Pall Mall when the appointed hour arrived .
Parsing [sent. 10003 len. 8]: Mr Bailey quickly answered to the summons .
Parsing [sent. 10004 len. 20]: He was not proud and was kindly disposed to take notice of Jonas ; but Jonas had forgotten him .
Parsing [sent. 10005 len. 8]: ` Mr Montague at home ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 10006 len. 26]: I should hope he wos at home , and waiting dinner , too , ' said Bailey , with the ease of an old acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 10007 len. 17]: ` Will you take your hat up along with you , or leave it here ? '
Parsing [sent. 10008 len. 7]: Mr Jonas preferred leaving it there .
Parsing [sent. 10009 len. 9]: ` The hold name , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 10010 len. 7]: said Bailey , with a grin .
Parsing [sent. 10011 len. 9]: Mr Jonas stared at him in mute indignation .
Parsing [sent. 10012 len. 13]: ` What , do n't you remember hold mother Todgers 's ? '
Parsing [sent. 10013 len. 14]: said Mr Bailey , with his favourite action of the knees and boots .
Parsing [sent. 10014 len. 21]: ` Do n't you remember my taking your name up to the young ladies , when you came a-courting there ?
Parsing [sent. 10015 len. 12]: A reg ` lar scaly old shop , war n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 10016 len. 7]: Times is changed ai n't they .
Parsing [sent. 10017 len. 8]: I say how you 've growed ! '
Parsing [sent. 10018 len. 26]: Without pausing for any acknowledgement of this compliment , he ushered the visitor upstairs , and having announced him , retired with a private wink .
Parsing [sent. 10019 len. 28]: The lower story of the house was occupied by a wealthy tradesman , but Mr Montague had all the upper portion , and splendid lodging it was .
Parsing [sent. 10020 len. 67]: The room in which he received Jonas was a spacious and elegant apartment , furnished with extreme magnificence ; decorated with pictures , copies from the antique in alabaster and marble , china vases , lofty mirrors , crimson hangings of the richest silk , gilded carvings , luxurious couches , glistening cabinets inlaid with precious woods ; costly toys of every sort in negligent abundance .
Parsing [sent. 10021 len. 25]: The only guests besides Jonas were the doctor , the resident Director , and two other gentlemen , whom Montague presented in due form .
Parsing [sent. 10022 len. 12]: ` My dear friend , I am delighted to see you .
Parsing [sent. 10023 len. 9]: Jobling you know , I believe ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 10024 len. 22]: I think so , ' said the doctor pleasantly , as he stepped out of the circle to shake hands . '
Parsing [sent. 10025 len. 7]: I trust I have the honour .
Parsing [sent. 10026 len. 4]: I hope so .
Parsing [sent. 10027 len. 9]: My dear sir , I see you well .
Parsing [sent. 10028 len. 3]: Quite well ?
Parsing [sent. 10029 len. 5]: THAT 'S well ! '
Parsing [sent. 10030 len. 26]: ` Mr Wolf , ' said Montague , as soon as the doctor would allow him to introduce the two others , ` Mr Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 10031 len. 7]: Mr Pip , Mr Chuzzlewit . '
Parsing [sent. 10032 len. 16]: Both gentlemen were exceedingly happy to have the honour of making Mr Chuzzlewit 's acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 10033 len. 29]: The doctor drew Jonas a little apart , and whispered behind his hand : ` Men of the world , my dear sir -- men of the world .
Parsing [sent. 10034 len. 2]: Hem !
Parsing [sent. 10035 len. 22]: Mr Wolf -- literary character -- you need n't mention it -- remarkably clever weekly paper -- oh , remarkably clever !
Parsing [sent. 10036 len. 17]: Mr Pip -- theatrical man -- capital man to know -- oh , capital man ! '
Parsing [sent. 10037 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 10038 len. 18]: said Wolf , folding his arms and resuming a conversation which the arrival of Jonas had interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 10039 len. 11]: ` And what did Lord Nobley say to that ? '
Parsing [sent. 10040 len. 11]: ` Why , ' returned Pip , with an oath .
Parsing [sent. 10041 len. 9]: ` He did n't know what to say .
Parsing [sent. 10042 len. 14]: Same , sir , if he was n't as mute as a poker .
Parsing [sent. 10043 len. 11]: But you know what a good fellow Nobley is ! '
Parsing [sent. 10044 len. 9]: ` The best fellow in the world ! '
Parsing [sent. 10045 len. 3]: cried Wolf .
Parsing [sent. 10046 len. 54]: ` It as only last week that Nobley said to me , `` By Gad , Wolf , I 've got a living to bestow , and if you had but been brought up at the University , strike me blind if I would n't have made a parson of you ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 10047 len. 12]: ` Just like him , ' said Pip with another oath .
Parsing [sent. 10048 len. 9]: ` And he 'd have done it ! '
Parsing [sent. 10049 len. 11]: ` Not a doubt of it , ' said Wolf .
Parsing [sent. 10050 len. 16]: ` But you were going to tell us -- ' ` Oh , yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 10051 len. 3]: cried Pip .
Parsing [sent. 10052 len. 5]: ` To be sure .
Parsing [sent. 10053 len. 4]: So I was .
Parsing [sent. 10054 len. 28]: At first he was dumb -- sewn up , dead , sir -- but after a minute he said to the Duke , `` Here 's Pip .
Parsing [sent. 10055 len. 3]: Ask Pip .
Parsing [sent. 10056 len. 6]: Pip 's our mutual friend .
Parsing [sent. 10057 len. 3]: Ask Pip .
Parsing [sent. 10058 len. 4]: He knows . ''
Parsing [sent. 10059 len. 4]: `` Damme ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10060 len. 11]: said the Duke , `` I appeal to Pip then .
Parsing [sent. 10061 len. 4]: Come , Pip .
Parsing [sent. 10062 len. 5]: Bandy or not bandy ?
Parsing [sent. 10063 len. 4]: Speak out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10064 len. 12]: `` Bandy , your Grace , by the Lord Harry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10065 len. 8]: said I. `` Ha , ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10066 len. 4]: laughed the Duke .
Parsing [sent. 10067 len. 7]: `` To be sure she is .
Parsing [sent. 10068 len. 4]: Bravo , Pip .
Parsing [sent. 10069 len. 4]: Well said Pip .
Parsing [sent. 10070 len. 14]: I wish I may die if you 're not a trump , Pip .
Parsing [sent. 10071 len. 16]: Pop me down among your fashionable visitors whenever I 'm in town , Pip . ''
Parsing [sent. 10072 len. 10]: And so I do , to this day . '
Parsing [sent. 10073 len. 21]: The conclusion of this story gave immense satisfaction , which was in no degree lessened by the announcement of dinner .
Parsing [sent. 10074 len. 29]: Jonas repaired to the dining room , along with his distinguished host , and took his seat at the board between that individual and his friend the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 10075 len. 28]: The rest fell into their places like men who were well accustomed to the house ; and dinner was done full justice to , by all parties .
Parsing [sent. 10076 len. 19]: It was a good a one as money -LRB- or credit , no matter which -RRB- could produce .
Parsing [sent. 10077 len. 13]: The dishes , wines , and fruits were of the choicest kind .
Parsing [sent. 10078 len. 5]: Everything was elegantly served .
Parsing [sent. 10079 len. 5]: The plate was gorgeous .
Parsing [sent. 10080 len. 24]: Mr Jonas was in the midst of a calculation of the value of this item alone , when his host disturbed him . '
Parsing [sent. 10081 len. 6]: A glass of wine ? '
Parsing [sent. 10082 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 10083 len. 10]: said Jonas , who had had several glasses already .
Parsing [sent. 10084 len. 9]: ` As much of that as you like !
Parsing [sent. 10085 len. 8]: It 's too good to refuse . '
Parsing [sent. 10086 len. 8]: ` Well said , Mr Chuzzlewit ! '
Parsing [sent. 10087 len. 3]: cried Wolf .
Parsing [sent. 10088 len. 9]: ` Tom Gag , upon my soul ! '
Parsing [sent. 10089 len. 3]: said Pip .
Parsing [sent. 10090 len. 16]: ` Positively , you know , that 's -- ha , ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 10091 len. 31]: observed the doctor , laying down his knife and fork for one instant , and then going to work again , pell-mell -- ` that 's epigrammatic ; quite ! '
Parsing [sent. 10092 len. 10]: ` You 're tolerably comfortable , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 10093 len. 7]: said Tigg , apart to Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 10094 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 10095 len. 18]: You need n't trouble your head about ME , ' he replied , ` Famous ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 10096 len. 14]: I thought it best not to have a party , ' said Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 10097 len. 6]: ` You feel that ? '
Parsing [sent. 10098 len. 10]: ` Why , what do you call this ? '
Parsing [sent. 10099 len. 3]: retorted Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 10100 len. 17]: ` You do n't mean to say you do this every day , do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 10101 len. 26]: ` My dear fellow , ' said Montague , shrugging his shoulders , ` every day of my life , when I dine at home .
Parsing [sent. 10102 len. 6]: This is my common style .
Parsing [sent. 10103 len. 11]: It was of no use having anything uncommon for you .
Parsing [sent. 10104 len. 7]: You 'd have seen through it .
Parsing [sent. 10105 len. 8]: `` You 'll have a party ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10106 len. 3]: said Crimple .
Parsing [sent. 10107 len. 11]: `` No , I wo n't , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 10108 len. 10]: `` he shall take us in the rough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10109 len. 10]: ` And pretty smooth , too , ecod ! '
Parsing [sent. 10110 len. 8]: said Jonas , glancing round the table .
Parsing [sent. 10111 len. 9]: ` This do n't cost a trifle . '
Parsing [sent. 10112 len. 18]: ` Why , to be candid with you , it does not , ' returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 10113 len. 9]: ` But I like this sort of thing .
Parsing [sent. 10114 len. 10]: It 's the way I spend my money . '
Parsing [sent. 10115 len. 16]: Jonas thrust his tongue into his cheek , and said , ` Was it ? '
Parsing [sent. 10116 len. 23]: ` When you join us , you wo n't get rid of your share of the profits in the same way ? '
Parsing [sent. 10117 len. 3]: said Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 10118 len. 8]: ` Quite different , ' retorted Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 10119 len. 16]: ` Well , and you 're right , ' said Tigg , with friendly candour .
Parsing [sent. 10120 len. 5]: ` You need n't .
Parsing [sent. 10121 len. 5]: It 's not necessary .
Parsing [sent. 10122 len. 28]: One of a Company must do it to hold the connection together ; but , as I take a pleasure in it , that 's my department .
Parsing [sent. 10123 len. 16]: You do n't mind dining expensively at another man 's expense , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 10124 len. 9]: ` Not a bit , ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 10125 len. 12]: ` Then I hope you 'll often dine with me ? '
Parsing [sent. 10126 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 10127 len. 9]: said Jonas , ' I do n't mind .
Parsing [sent. 10128 len. 5]: On the contrary . '
Parsing [sent. 10129 len. 23]: ` And I 'll never attempt to talk business to you over wine , I take my oath , ' said Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 10130 len. 12]: ` Oh deep , deep , deep of you this morning !
Parsing [sent. 10131 len. 6]: I must tell 'em that .
Parsing [sent. 10132 len. 9]: They 're the very men to enjoy it .
Parsing [sent. 10133 len. 46]: Pip , my good fellow , I 've a splendid little trait to tell you of my friend Chuzzlewit who is the deepest dog I know ; I give you my sacred word of honour he is the deepest dog I know , Pip ! '
Parsing [sent. 10134 len. 36]: Pip swore a frightful oath that he was sure of it already ; and the anecdote , being told , was received with loud applause , as an incontestable proof of Mr Jonas 's greatness .
Parsing [sent. 10135 len. 42]: Pip , in a natural spirit of emulation , then related some instances of his own depth ; and Wolf not to be left behind-hand , recited the leading points of one or two vastly humorous articles he was then preparing .
Parsing [sent. 10136 len. 29]: These lucubrations being of what he called ' a warm complexion , ' were highly approved ; and all the company agreed that they were full of point .
Parsing [sent. 10137 len. 23]: ` Men of the world , my dear sir , ' Jobling whispered to Jonas ; ` thorough men of the world !
Parsing [sent. 10138 len. 18]: To a professional person like myself it 's quite refreshing to come into this kind of society .
Parsing [sent. 10139 len. 19]: It 's not only agreeable -- and nothing CAN be more agreeable -- but it 's philosophically improving .
Parsing [sent. 10140 len. 11]: It 's character , my dear sir ; character ! '
Parsing [sent. 10141 len. 71]: It is so pleasant to find real merit appreciated , whatever its particular walk in life may be , that the general harmony of the company was doubtless much promoted by their knowing that the two men of the world were held in great esteem by the upper classes of society , and by the gallant defenders of their country in the army and navy , but particularly the former .
Parsing [sent. 10142 len. 33]: The least of their stories had a colonel in it ; lords were as plentiful as oaths ; and even the Blood Royal ran in the muddy channel of their personal recollections .
Parsing [sent. 10143 len. 34]: ` Mr Chuzzlewit did n't know him , I 'm afraid , ' said Wolf , in reference to a certain personage of illustrious descent , who had previously figured in a reminiscence .
Parsing [sent. 10144 len. 7]: ` No , ' said Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 10145 len. 15]: ` But we must bring him into contact with this sort of fellows . '
Parsing [sent. 10146 len. 12]: ` He was very fond of literature , ' observed Wolf .
Parsing [sent. 10147 len. 5]: ` Was he ? '
Parsing [sent. 10148 len. 3]: said Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 10149 len. 14]: ` Oh , yes ; he took my paper regularly for many years .
Parsing [sent. 10150 len. 12]: Do you know he said some good things now and then ?
Parsing [sent. 10151 len. 33]: He asked a certain Viscount , who 's a friend of mine -- Pip knows him -- `` What 's the editor 's name , what 's the editor 's name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10152 len. 4]: `` Wolf . ''
Parsing [sent. 10153 len. 5]: `` Wolf , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 10154 len. 5]: Sharp biter , Wolf .
Parsing [sent. 10155 len. 14]: We must keep the Wolf from the door , as the proverb says .
Parsing [sent. 10156 len. 5]: It was very well .
Parsing [sent. 10157 len. 9]: And being complimentary , I printed it . '
Parsing [sent. 10158 len. 9]: ` But the Viscount 's the boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 10159 len. 16]: cried Pip , who invented a new oath for the introduction of everything he said .
Parsing [sent. 10160 len. 7]: ` The Viscount 's the boy !
Parsing [sent. 10161 len. 27]: He came into our place one night to take Her home ; rather slued , but not much ; and said , `` Where 's Pip ?
Parsing [sent. 10162 len. 6]: I want to see Pip .
Parsing [sent. 10163 len. 4]: Produce Pip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10164 len. 11]: -- `` What 's the row , my lord ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10165 len. 10]: -- `` Shakspeare 's an infernal humbug , Pip !
Parsing [sent. 10166 len. 9]: What 's the good of Shakspeare , Pip ?
Parsing [sent. 10167 len. 5]: I never read him .
Parsing [sent. 10168 len. 10]: What the devil is it all about , Pip ?
Parsing [sent. 10169 len. 29]: There 's a lot of feet in Shakspeare 's verse , but there a n't any legs worth mentioning in Shakspeare 's plays , are there , Pip ?
Parsing [sent. 10170 len. 38]: Juliet , Desdemona , Lady Macbeth , and all the rest of 'em , whatever their names are , might as well have no legs at all , for anything the audience know about it , Pip .
Parsing [sent. 10171 len. 16]: Why , in that respect they 're all Miss Biffins to the audience , Pip .
Parsing [sent. 10172 len. 8]: I 'll tell you what it is .
Parsing [sent. 10173 len. 12]: What the people call dramatic poetry is a collection of sermons .
Parsing [sent. 10174 len. 10]: Do I go to the theatre to be lectured ?
Parsing [sent. 10175 len. 4]: No , Pip .
Parsing [sent. 10176 len. 11]: If I wanted that , I 'd go to church .
Parsing [sent. 10177 len. 11]: What 's the legitimate object of the drama , Pip ?
Parsing [sent. 10178 len. 3]: Human nature .
Parsing [sent. 10179 len. 4]: What are legs ?
Parsing [sent. 10180 len. 3]: Human nature .
Parsing [sent. 10181 len. 22]: Then let us have plenty of leg pieces , Pip , and I 'll stand by you , my buck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10182 len. 22]: and I am proud to say , ' added Pip , ` that he DID stand by me , handsomely . '
Parsing [sent. 10183 len. 36]: The conversation now becoming general , Mr Jonas 's opinion was requested on this subject ; and as it was in full accordance with the sentiments of Mr Pip , that gentleman was extremely gratified .
Parsing [sent. 10184 len. 35]: Indeed , both himself and Wolf had so much in common with Jonas , that they became very amicable ; and between their increasing friendship and the fumes of wine , Jonas grew talkative .
Parsing [sent. 10185 len. 40]: It does not follow in the case of such a person that the more talkative he becomes , the more agreeable he is ; on the contrary , his merits show to most advantage , perhaps , in silence .
Parsing [sent. 10186 len. 66]: Having no means , as he thought , of putting himself on an equality with the rest , but by the assertion of that depth and sharpness on which he had been complimented , Jonas exhibited that faculty to the utmost ; and was so deep and sharp that he lost himself in his own profundity , and cut his fingers with his own edge-tools .
Parsing [sent. 10187 len. 47]: It was especially in his way and character to exhibit his quality at his entertainer 's expense ; and while he drank of his sparkling wines , and partook of his monstrous profusion , to ridicule the extravagance which had set such costly fare before him .
Parsing [sent. 10188 len. 56]: Even at such a wanton board , and in such more than doubtful company , this might have proved a disagreeable experiment , but that Tigg and Crimple , studying to understand their man thoroughly , gave him what license he chose : knowing that the more he took , the better for their purpose .
Parsing [sent. 10189 len. 47]: And thus while the blundering cheat -- gull that he was , for all his cunning -- thought himself rolled up hedgehog fashion , with his sharpest points towards them , he was , in fact , betraying all his vulnerable parts to their unwinking watchfulness .
Parsing [sent. 10190 len. 59]: Whether the two gentlemen who contributed so much to the doctor 's philosophical knowledge -LRB- by the way , the doctor slipped off quietly , after swallowing his usual amount of wine -RRB- had had their cue distinctly from the host , or took it from what they saw and heard , they acted their parts very well .
Parsing [sent. 10191 len. 56]: They solicited the honour of Jonas 's better acquaintance ; trusted that they would have the pleasure of introducing him into that elevated society in which he was so well qualified to shine ; and informed him , in the most friendly manner that the advantages of their respective establishments were entirely at his control .
Parsing [sent. 10192 len. 13]: In a word , they said ` Be one of us ! '
Parsing [sent. 10193 len. 37]: And Jonas said he was infinitely obliged to them , and he would be ; adding within himself , that so long as they ` stood treat , ' there was nothing he would like better .
Parsing [sent. 10194 len. 33]: After coffee , which was served in the drawing-room , there was a short interval -LRB- mainly sustained by Pip and Wolf -RRB- of conversation ; rather highly spiced and strongly seasoned .
Parsing [sent. 10195 len. 36]: When it flagged , Jonas took it up and showed considerable humour in appraising the furniture ; inquiring whether such an article was paid for ; what it had originally cost , and the like .
Parsing [sent. 10196 len. 26]: In all of this , he was , as he considered , desperately hard on Montague , and very demonstrative of his own brilliant parts .
Parsing [sent. 10197 len. 16]: Some Champagne Punch gave a new though temporary fillip to the entertainments of the evening .
Parsing [sent. 10198 len. 39]: For after leading to some noisy proceedings , which were not intelligible , it ended in the unsteady departure of the two gentlemen of the world , and the slumber of Mr Jonas upon one of the sofas .
Parsing [sent. 10199 len. 42]: As he could not be made to understand where he was , Mr Bailey received orders to call a hackney-coach , and take him home ; which that young gentleman roused himself from an uneasy sleep in the hall to do .
Parsing [sent. 10200 len. 10]: It being now almost three o'clock in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 10201 len. 10]: ` Is he hooked , do you think ? '
Parsing [sent. 10202 len. 21]: whispered Crimple , as himself and partner stood in a distant part of the room observing him as he lay .
Parsing [sent. 10203 len. 4]: ` Aye ! '
Parsing [sent. 10204 len. 8]: said Tigg , in the same tone .
Parsing [sent. 10205 len. 8]: ` With a strong iron , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 10206 len. 7]: Has Nadgett been here to-night ? '
Parsing [sent. 10207 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 10208 len. 6]: I went out to him .
Parsing [sent. 10209 len. 10]: Hearing you had company , he went away . '
Parsing [sent. 10210 len. 8]: ` Why did he do that ? '
Parsing [sent. 10211 len. 20]: ` He said he would come back early in the morning , before you were out of bed . '
Parsing [sent. 10212 len. 14]: ` Tell them to be sure and send him up to my bedside .
Parsing [sent. 10213 len. 2]: Hush !
Parsing [sent. 10214 len. 5]: Here 's the boy !
Parsing [sent. 10215 len. 15]: Now Mr Bailey , take this gentleman home , and see him safely in .
Parsing [sent. 10216 len. 4]: Hallo , here !
Parsing [sent. 10217 len. 6]: Why Chuzzlewit , halloa ! '
Parsing [sent. 10218 len. 29]: They got him upright with some difficulty , and assisted him downstairs , where they put his hat upon his head , and tumbled him into the coach .
Parsing [sent. 10219 len. 50]: Mr Bailey , having shut him in , mounted the box beside the coachman , and smoked his cigar with an air of particular satisfaction ; the undertaking in which he was engaged having a free and sporting character about it , which was quite congenial to his taste .
Parsing [sent. 10220 len. 46]: Arriving in due time at the house in the City , Mr Bailey jumped down , and expressed the lively nature of his feelings in a knock the like of which had probably not been heard in that quarter since the great fire of London .
Parsing [sent. 10221 len. 36]: Going out into the road to observe the effect of this feat , he saw that a dim light , previously visible at an upper window , had been already removed and was travelling downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 10222 len. 28]: To obtain a foreknowledge of the bearer of this taper , Mr Bailey skipped back to the door again , and put his eye to the keyhole .
Parsing [sent. 10223 len. 7]: It was the merry one herself .
Parsing [sent. 10224 len. 6]: But sadly , strangely altered !
Parsing [sent. 10225 len. 35]: So careworn and dejected , so faltering and full of fear ; so fallen , humbled , broken ; that to have seen her quiet in her coffin would have been a less surprise .
Parsing [sent. 10226 len. 28]: She set the light upon a bracket in the hall , and laid her hand upon her heart ; upon her eyes ; upon her burning head .
Parsing [sent. 10227 len. 37]: Then she came on towards the door with such a wild and hurried step that Mr Bailey lost his self-possession , and still had his eye where the keyhole had been , when she opened it .
Parsing [sent. 10228 len. 4]: ` Aha ! '
Parsing [sent. 10229 len. 8]: said Mr Bailey , with an effort .
Parsing [sent. 10230 len. 8]: ` There you are , are you ?
Parsing [sent. 10231 len. 5]: What 's the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 10232 len. 8]: Ai n't you well , though ? '
Parsing [sent. 10233 len. 31]: In the midst of her astonishment as she recognized him in his altered dress , so much of her old smile came back to her face that Bailey was glad .
Parsing [sent. 10234 len. 19]: But next moment he was sorry again , for he saw tears standing in her poor dim eyes .
Parsing [sent. 10235 len. 10]: ` Do n't be frightened , ' said Bailey .
Parsing [sent. 10236 len. 8]: ` There ai n't nothing the matter .
Parsing [sent. 10237 len. 7]: I 've brought home Mr Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 10238 len. 5]: He ai n't ill .
Parsing [sent. 10239 len. 11]: He 's only a little swipey , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 10240 len. 11]: Mr Bailey reeled in his boots , to express intoxication .
Parsing [sent. 10241 len. 10]: ` Have you come from Mrs Todgers 's ? '
Parsing [sent. 10242 len. 5]: asked Merry , trembling .
Parsing [sent. 10243 len. 7]: ` Todgers 's , bless you !
Parsing [sent. 10244 len. 3]: No ! '
Parsing [sent. 10245 len. 5]: cried Mr Bailey . '
Parsing [sent. 10246 len. 12]: I have n't got nothin , to do with Todgers 's .
Parsing [sent. 10247 len. 7]: I cut that connection long ago .
Parsing [sent. 10248 len. 11]: He 's been a-dining with my governor at the west-end .
Parsing [sent. 10249 len. 12]: Did n't you know he was a-coming to see us ? '
Parsing [sent. 10250 len. 9]: ` No , ' she said , faintly .
Parsing [sent. 10251 len. 4]: ` Oh yes !
Parsing [sent. 10252 len. 12]: We 're heavy swells too , and so I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 10253 len. 12]: Do n't you come out , a-catching cold in your head .
Parsing [sent. 10254 len. 6]: I 'll wake him ! '
Parsing [sent. 10255 len. 47]: Mr Bailey expressing in his demeanour a perfect confidence that he could carry him in with ease , if necessary , opened the coach door , let down the steps , and giving Jonas a shake , cried ` We 've got home , my flower !
Parsing [sent. 10256 len. 6]: Tumble up , then ! '
Parsing [sent. 10257 len. 37]: He was so far recovered as to be able to respond to this appeal , and to come stumbling out of the coach in a heap , to the great hazard of Mr Bailey 's person .
Parsing [sent. 10258 len. 39]: When he got upon the pavement , Mr Bailey first butted at him in front , and then dexterously propped him up behind ; and having steadied him by these means , he assisted him into the house .
Parsing [sent. 10259 len. 22]: ` You go up first with the light , ' said Bailey to Mr Jonas , ` and we 'll foller .
Parsing [sent. 10260 len. 5]: Do n't tremble so .
Parsing [sent. 10261 len. 6]: He wo n't hurt you .
Parsing [sent. 10262 len. 18]: When I 've had a drop too much , I 'm full of good natur myself . '
Parsing [sent. 10263 len. 40]: She went on before ; and her husband and Bailey , by dint of tumbling over each other , and knocking themselves about , got at last into the sitting-room above stairs , where Jonas staggered into a seat .
Parsing [sent. 10264 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 10265 len. 4]: said Mr Bailey .
Parsing [sent. 10266 len. 7]: ` He 's all right now .
Parsing [sent. 10267 len. 12]: You ai n't got nothing to cry for , bless you !
Parsing [sent. 10268 len. 8]: He 's righter than a trivet ! '
Parsing [sent. 10269 len. 47]: The ill-favoured brute , with dress awry , and sodden face , and rumpled hair , sat blinking and drooping , and rolling his idiotic eyes about , until , becoming conscious by degrees , he recognized his wife , and shook his fist at her .
Parsing [sent. 10270 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 10271 len. 12]: cried Mr Bailey , squaring his arms with a sudden emotion .
Parsing [sent. 10272 len. 10]: ` What , you 're wicious , are you ?
Parsing [sent. 10273 len. 4]: Would you though !
Parsing [sent. 10274 len. 6]: You 'd better not ! '
Parsing [sent. 10275 len. 7]: ` Pray , go away ! '
Parsing [sent. 10276 len. 3]: said Merry .
Parsing [sent. 10277 len. 10]: ` Bailey , my good boy , go home .
Parsing [sent. 10278 len. 3]: Jonas ! '
Parsing [sent. 10279 len. 19]: she said ; timidly laying her hand upon his shoulder , and bending her head down over him .
Parsing [sent. 10280 len. 4]: ` Jonas ! '
Parsing [sent. 10281 len. 6]: ` Look at her ! '
Parsing [sent. 10282 len. 11]: cried Jonas , pushing her off with his extended arm .
Parsing [sent. 10283 len. 4]: ` Look here !
Parsing [sent. 10284 len. 4]: Look at her !
Parsing [sent. 10285 len. 9]: Here 's a bargain for a man ! '
Parsing [sent. 10286 len. 5]: ` Dear Jonas ! '
Parsing [sent. 10287 len. 5]: ` Dear Devil ! '
Parsing [sent. 10288 len. 8]: he replied , with a fierce gesture .
Parsing [sent. 10289 len. 21]: ` You 're a pretty clog to be tied to a man for life , you mewling , white-faced cat !
Parsing [sent. 10290 len. 8]: Get out of my sight ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 10291 len. 10]: I know you do n't mean it , Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 10292 len. 11]: You would n't say it if you were sober . '
Parsing [sent. 10293 len. 19]: With affected gayety she gave Bailey a piece of money , and again implored him to be gone .
Parsing [sent. 10294 len. 17]: Her entreaty was so earnest , that the boy had not the heart to stay there .
Parsing [sent. 10295 len. 14]: But he stopped at the bottom of the stairs , and listened . '
Parsing [sent. 10296 len. 11]: I would n't say it if I was sober ! '
Parsing [sent. 10297 len. 3]: retorted Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 10298 len. 5]: ` You know better .
Parsing [sent. 10299 len. 11]: Have I never said it when I was sober ? '
Parsing [sent. 10300 len. 6]: ` Often , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 10301 len. 6]: she answered through her tears .
Parsing [sent. 10302 len. 5]: ` Hark ye ! '
Parsing [sent. 10303 len. 10]: cried Jonas , stamping his foot upon the ground .
Parsing [sent. 10304 len. 20]: ` You made me bear your pretty humours once , and ecod I 'll make you bear mine now .
Parsing [sent. 10305 len. 7]: I always promised myself I would .
Parsing [sent. 10306 len. 7]: I married you that I might .
Parsing [sent. 10307 len. 13]: I 'll know who 's master , and who 's slave ! '
Parsing [sent. 10308 len. 8]: ` Heaven knows I am obedient ! '
Parsing [sent. 10309 len. 5]: said the sobbing girl .
Parsing [sent. 10310 len. 12]: ` Much more so than I ever thought to be ! '
Parsing [sent. 10311 len. 7]: Jonas laughed in his drunken exultation .
Parsing [sent. 10312 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 10313 len. 9]: you 're finding it out , are you !
Parsing [sent. 10314 len. 8]: Patience , and you will in time !
Parsing [sent. 10315 len. 7]: Griffins have claws , my girl .
Parsing [sent. 10316 len. 39]: There 's not a pretty slight you ever put upon me , nor a pretty trick you ever played me , nor a pretty insolence you ever showed me , that I wo n't pay back a hundred-fold .
Parsing [sent. 10317 len. 8]: What else did I marry you for ?
Parsing [sent. 10318 len. 5]: YOU , too ! '
Parsing [sent. 10319 len. 7]: he said , with coarse contempt .
Parsing [sent. 10320 len. 40]: It might have softened him -- indeed it might -- to hear her turn a little fragment of a song he used to say he liked ; trying , with a heart so full , to win him back .
Parsing [sent. 10321 len. 4]: ` Oho ! '
Parsing [sent. 10322 len. 11]: he said , ` you 're deaf , are you ?
Parsing [sent. 10323 len. 8]: You do n't hear me , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 10324 len. 7]: So much the better for you .
Parsing [sent. 10325 len. 4]: I hate you .
Parsing [sent. 10326 len. 28]: I hate myself , for having , been fool enough to strap a pack upon my back for the pleasure of treading on it whenever I choose .
Parsing [sent. 10327 len. 20]: Why , things have opened to me , now , so that I might marry almost where I liked .
Parsing [sent. 10328 len. 10]: But I would n't ; I 'd keep single .
Parsing [sent. 10329 len. 12]: I ought to be single , among the friends I know .
Parsing [sent. 10330 len. 15]: Instead of that , here I am , tied like a log to you .
Parsing [sent. 10331 len. 2]: Pah !
Parsing [sent. 10332 len. 12]: Why do you show your pale face when I come home ?
Parsing [sent. 10333 len. 8]: Am I never to forget you ? '
Parsing [sent. 10334 len. 7]: ` How late it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 10335 len. 13]: she said cheerfully , opening the shutter after an interval of silence .
Parsing [sent. 10336 len. 7]: ` Broad day , Jonas ! '
Parsing [sent. 10337 len. 13]: ` Broad day or black night , what do I care ! '
Parsing [sent. 10338 len. 5]: was the kind rejoinder .
Parsing [sent. 10339 len. 8]: ` The night passed quickly , too .
Parsing [sent. 10340 len. 11]: I do n't mind sitting up , at all . '
Parsing [sent. 10341 len. 12]: ` Sit up for me again , if you dare ! '
Parsing [sent. 10342 len. 4]: growled Jonas . '
Parsing [sent. 10343 len. 13]: I was reading , ' she proceeded , ` all night long .
Parsing [sent. 10344 len. 15]: I began when you went out , and read till you came home again .
Parsing [sent. 10345 len. 6]: The strangest story , Jonas !
Parsing [sent. 10346 len. 7]: And true , the book says .
Parsing [sent. 10347 len. 8]: I 'll tell it you to-morrow . '
Parsing [sent. 10348 len. 7]: ` True , was it ? '
Parsing [sent. 10349 len. 5]: said Jonas , doggedly .
Parsing [sent. 10350 len. 7]: ` So the book says . '
Parsing [sent. 10351 len. 44]: ` Was there anything in it , about a man 's being determined to conquer his wife , break her spirit , bend her temper , crush all her humours like so many nut-shells -- kill her , for aught I know ? '
Parsing [sent. 10352 len. 3]: said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 10353 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 10354 len. 9]: Not a word , ' she answered quickly .
Parsing [sent. 10355 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 10356 len. 3]: he returned .
Parsing [sent. 10357 len. 21]: ` That 'll be a true story though , before long ; for all the book says nothing about it .
Parsing [sent. 10358 len. 9]: It 's a lying book , I see .
Parsing [sent. 10359 len. 8]: A fit book for a lying reader .
Parsing [sent. 10360 len. 5]: But you 're deaf .
Parsing [sent. 10361 len. 5]: I forgot that . '
Parsing [sent. 10362 len. 26]: There was another interval of silence ; and the boy was stealing away , when he heard her footstep on the floor , and stopped .
Parsing [sent. 10363 len. 46]: She went up to him , as it seemed , and spoke lovingly ; saying that she would defer to him in everything and would consult his wishes and obey them , and they might be very happy if he would be gentle with her .
Parsing [sent. 10364 len. 13]: He answered with an imprecation , and -- Not with a blow ?
Parsing [sent. 10365 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 10366 len. 11]: Stern truth against the base-souled villain ; with a blow .
Parsing [sent. 10367 len. 8]: No angry cries ; no loud reproaches .
Parsing [sent. 10368 len. 14]: Even her weeping and her sobs were stifled by her clinging round him .
Parsing [sent. 10369 len. 27]: She only said , repeating it in agony of heart , how could he , could he , could he -- and lost utterance in tears .
Parsing [sent. 10370 len. 9]: Oh woman , God beloved in old Jerusalem !
Parsing [sent. 10371 len. 34]: The best among us need deal lightly with thy faults , if only for the punishment thy nature will endure , in bearing heavy evidence against us , on the Day of Judgment !
Parsing [sent. 10372 len. 89]: CHAPTER TWENTY -- NINE IN WHICH SOME PEOPLE ARE PRECOCIOUS , OTHERS PROFESSIONAL , AND OTHERS MYSTERIOUS ; ALL IN THEIR SEVERAL WAYS It may have been the restless remembrance of what he had seen and heard overnight , or it may have been no deeper mental operation than the discovery that he had nothing to do , which caused Mr Bailey , on the following afternoon , to feel particularly disposed for agreeable society , and prompted him to pay a visit to his friend Poll Sweedlepipe .
Parsing [sent. 10373 len. 57]: On the little bell giving clamorous notice of a visitor 's approach -LRB- for Mr Bailey came in at the door with a lunge , to get as much sound out of the bell as possible -RRB- , Poll Sweedlepipe desisted from the contemplation of a favourite owl , and gave his young friend hearty welcome .
Parsing [sent. 10374 len. 20]: ` Why , you look smarter by day , ' said Poll , ` than you do by candle-light .
Parsing [sent. 10375 len. 10]: I never see such a tight young dasher . '
Parsing [sent. 10376 len. 6]: ` Reether so , Polly .
Parsing [sent. 10377 len. 9]: How 's our fair friend , Sairah ? '
Parsing [sent. 10378 len. 12]: ` Oh , she 's pretty well , ' said Poll .
Parsing [sent. 10379 len. 7]: ` She 's at home . '
Parsing [sent. 10380 len. 23]: ` There 's the remains of a fine woman about Sairah , Poll , ' observed Mr Bailey , with genteel indifference .
Parsing [sent. 10381 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 10382 len. 8]: thought Poll , ` he 's old .
Parsing [sent. 10383 len. 7]: He must be very old ! '
Parsing [sent. 10384 len. 19]: ` Too much crumb , you know , ' said Mr Bailey ; ` too fat , Poll .
Parsing [sent. 10385 len. 21]: But there 's many worse at her time of life ' ` The very owl 's a-opening his eyes ! '
Parsing [sent. 10386 len. 4]: thought Poll . '
Parsing [sent. 10387 len. 14]: I do n't wonder at it in a bird of his opinions . '
Parsing [sent. 10388 len. 26]: He happened to have been sharpening his razors , which were lying open in a row , while a huge strop dangled from the wall .
Parsing [sent. 10389 len. 20]: Glancing at these preparations , Mr Bailey stroked his chin , and a thought appeared to occur to him .
Parsing [sent. 10390 len. 21]: ` Poll , ' he said , ' I ai n't as neat as I could wish about the gills .
Parsing [sent. 10391 len. 17]: Being here , I may as well have a shave , and get trimmed close . '
Parsing [sent. 10392 len. 31]: The barber stood aghast ; but Mr Bailey divested himself of his neck-cloth , and sat down in the easy shaving chair with all the dignity and confidence in life .
Parsing [sent. 10393 len. 7]: There was no resisting his manner .
Parsing [sent. 10394 len. 10]: The evidence of sight and touch became as nothing .
Parsing [sent. 10395 len. 38]: His chin was as smooth as a new-laid egg or a scraped Dutch cheese ; but Poll Sweedlepipe would n't have ventured to deny , on affidavit , that he had the beard of a Jewish rabbi .
Parsing [sent. 10396 len. 29]: ` Go WITH the grain , Poll , all round , please , ' said Mr Bailey , screwing up his face for the reception of the lather .
Parsing [sent. 10397 len. 13]: ` You may do wot you like with the bits of whisker .
Parsing [sent. 10398 len. 8]: I do n't care for 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 10399 len. 38]: The meek little barber stood gazing at him with the brush and soap-dish in his hand , stirring them round and round in a ludicrous uncertainty , as if he were disabled by some fascination from beginning .
Parsing [sent. 10400 len. 12]: At last he made a dash at Mr Bailey 's cheek .
Parsing [sent. 10401 len. 46]: Then he stopped again , as if the ghost of a beard had suddenly receded from his touch ; but receiving mild encouragement from Mr Bailey , in the form of an adjuration to ` Go in and win , ' he lathered him bountifully .
Parsing [sent. 10402 len. 10]: Mr Bailey smiled through the suds in his satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 10403 len. 8]: ` Gently over the stones , Poll .
Parsing [sent. 10404 len. 8]: Go a tip-toe over the pimples ! '
Parsing [sent. 10405 len. 14]: Poll Sweedlepipe obeyed , and scraped the lather off again with particular care .
Parsing [sent. 10406 len. 52]: Mr Bailey squinted at every successive dab , as it was deposited on a cloth on his left shoulder , and seemed , with a microscopic eye , to detect some bristles in it ; for he murmured more than once ` Reether redder than I could wish , Poll . '
Parsing [sent. 10407 len. 45]: The operation being concluded , Poll fell back and stared at him again , while Mr Bailey , wiping his face on the jack-towel , remarked , ` that arter late hours nothing freshened up a man so much as a easy shave . '
Parsing [sent. 10408 len. 50]: He was in the act of tying his cravat at the glass , without his coat , and Poll had wiped his razor , ready for the next customer , when Mrs Gamp , coming downstairs , looked in at the shop-door to give the barber neighbourly good day .
Parsing [sent. 10409 len. 38]: Feeling for her unfortunate situation , in having conceived a regard for himself which it was not in the nature of things that he could return , Mr Bailey hastened to soothe her with words of kindness .
Parsing [sent. 10410 len. 4]: ` Hallo ! '
Parsing [sent. 10411 len. 6]: he said , ` Sairah !
Parsing [sent. 10412 len. 20]: I need n't ask you how you 've been this long time , for you 're in full bloom .
Parsing [sent. 10413 len. 12]: All a-blowin and a-growin ; ai n't she , Polly ? '
Parsing [sent. 10414 len. 12]: ` Why , drat the Bragian boldness of that boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 10415 len. 8]: cried Mrs Gamp , though not displeased .
Parsing [sent. 10416 len. 9]: ` What a imperent young sparrow it is !
Parsing [sent. 10417 len. 14]: I would n't be that creetur 's mother not for fifty pound ! '
Parsing [sent. 10418 len. 28]: Mr Bailey regarded this as a delicate confession of her attachment , and a hint that no pecuniary gain could recompense her for its being rendered hopeless .
Parsing [sent. 10419 len. 4]: He felt flattered .
Parsing [sent. 10420 len. 6]: Disinterested affection is always flattering .
Parsing [sent. 10421 len. 6]: ` Ah , dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 10422 len. 28]: moaned Mrs Gamp , sinking into the shaving chair , ` that there blessed Bull , Mr Sweedlepipe , has done his wery best to conker me .
Parsing [sent. 10423 len. 21]: Of all the trying inwalieges in this walley of the shadder , that one beats 'em black and blue . '
Parsing [sent. 10424 len. 50]: It was the practice of Mrs Gamp and her friends in the profession , to say this of all the easy customers ; as having at once the effect of discouraging competitors for office , and accounting for the necessity of high living on the part of the nurses .
Parsing [sent. 10425 len. 6]: ` Talk of constitooshun ! '
Parsing [sent. 10426 len. 5]: Mrs Gamp observed . '
Parsing [sent. 10427 len. 13]: A person 's constitooshun need be made of bricks to stand it .
Parsing [sent. 10428 len. 16]: Mrs Harris jestly says to me , but t ` other day , `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 10429 len. 14]: Sairey Gamp , '' she says , `` how is it done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10430 len. 39]: `` Mrs Harris , ma'am , '' I says to her , `` we gives no trust ourselves , and puts a deal o'trust elsevere ; these is our religious feelins , and we finds 'em answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 10431 len. 13]: `` Sairey , '' says Mrs Harris , `` sech is life .
Parsing [sent. 10432 len. 11]: Vich likeways is the hend of all things ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 10433 len. 44]: The barber gave a soft murmur , as much as to say that Mrs Harris 's remark , though perhaps not quite so intelligible as could be desired from such an authority , did equal honour to her head and to her heart .
Parsing [sent. 10434 len. 38]: ` And here , ' continued Mrs Gamp , ` and here am I a-goin twenty mile in distant , on as wentersome a chance as ever any one as monthlied ever run , I do believe .
Parsing [sent. 10435 len. 37]: Says Mrs Harris , with a woman 's and a mother 's art a-beatin in her human breast , she says to me , `` You 're not a-goin , Sairey , Lord forgive you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10436 len. 11]: `` Why am I not a-goin , Mrs Harris ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10437 len. 3]: I replies .
Parsing [sent. 10438 len. 40]: `` Mrs Gill , '' I says , `` wos never wrong with six ; and is it likely , ma'am -- I ast you as a mother -- that she will begin to be unreg ` lar now ?
Parsing [sent. 10439 len. 44]: Often and often have I heerd him say , '' I says to Mrs Harris , meaning Mr Gill , `` that he would back his wife agen Moore 's almanack , to name the very day and hour , for ninepence farden .
Parsing [sent. 10440 len. 19]: IS it likely , ma'am , '' I says , `` as she will fail this once ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10441 len. 15]: Says Mrs Harris `` No , ma'am , not in the course of natur .
Parsing [sent. 10442 len. 31]: But , '' she says , the tears a-fillin in her eyes , `` you knows much betterer than me , with your experienge , how little puts us out .
Parsing [sent. 10443 len. 32]: A Punch 's show , '' she says , `` a chimbley sweep , a newfundlan dog , or a drunkin man a-comin round the corner sharp may do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 10444 len. 48]: So it may , Mr Sweedlepipes , ' said Mrs Gamp , ` there 's no deniging of it ; and though my books is clear for a full week , I takes a anxious art along with me , I do assure you , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 10445 len. 12]: ` You 're so full of zeal , you see ! '
Parsing [sent. 10446 len. 3]: said Poll .
Parsing [sent. 10447 len. 7]: ` You worrit yourself so . '
Parsing [sent. 10448 len. 5]: ` Worrit myself ! '
Parsing [sent. 10449 len. 13]: cried Mrs Gamp , raising her hands and turning up her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 10450 len. 25]: ` You speak truth in that , sir , if you never speaks no more ` twixt this and when two Sundays jines together .
Parsing [sent. 10451 len. 22]: I feels the sufferins of other people more than I feels my own , though no one may n't suppoge it .
Parsing [sent. 10452 len. 39]: The families I 've had , ' said Mrs Gamp , ` if all was knowd and credit done where credit 's doo , would take a week to chris ` en at Saint Polge 's fontin ! '
Parsing [sent. 10453 len. 8]: ` Where 's the patient goin ? '
Parsing [sent. 10454 len. 3]: asked Sweedlepipe .
Parsing [sent. 10455 len. 12]: ` Into Har ` fordshire , which is his native air .
Parsing [sent. 10456 len. 21]: But native airs nor native graces neither , ' Mrs Gamp observed , ` wo n't bring HIM round . '
Parsing [sent. 10457 len. 7]: ` So bad as that ? '
Parsing [sent. 10458 len. 5]: inquired the wistful barber .
Parsing [sent. 10459 len. 4]: ` Indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 10460 len. 13]: Mrs Gamp shook her head mysteriously , and pursed up her lips .
Parsing [sent. 10461 len. 18]: ` There 's fevers of the mind , ' she said , ` as well as body .
Parsing [sent. 10462 len. 23]: You may take your slime drafts till you files into the air with efferwescence ; but you wo n't cure that . '
Parsing [sent. 10463 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 10464 len. 19]: said the barber , opening his eyes , and putting on his raven aspect ; ` Lor ! '
Parsing [sent. 10465 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 10466 len. 16]: You may make yourself as light as any gash balloon , ' said Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 10467 len. 33]: ` But talk , when you 're wrong in your head and when you 're in your sleep , of certain things ; and you 'll be heavy in your mind . '
Parsing [sent. 10468 len. 9]: ` Of what kind of things now ? '
Parsing [sent. 10469 len. 12]: inquired Poll , greedily biting his nails in his great interest .
Parsing [sent. 10470 len. 4]: ` Ghosts ? '
Parsing [sent. 10471 len. 39]: Mrs Gamp , who perhaps had been already tempted further than she had intended to go , by the barber 's stimulating curiosity , gave a sniff of uncommon significance , and said , it did n't signify .
Parsing [sent. 10472 len. 18]: ` I 'm a-goin down with my patient in the coach this arternoon , ' she proceeded .
Parsing [sent. 10473 len. 53]: ` I 'm a-goin to stop with him a day or so , till he gets a country nuss -LRB- drat them country nusses , much the orkard hussies knows about their bis ` ness -RRB- ; and then I 'm a-comin back ; and that 's my trouble , Mr Sweedlepipes .
Parsing [sent. 10474 len. 53]: But I hope that everythink 'll only go on right and comfortable as long as I 'm away ; perwisin which , as Mrs Harris says , Mrs Gill is welcome to choose her own time ; all times of the day and night bein ' equally the same to me . '
Parsing [sent. 10475 len. 41]: During the progress of the foregoing remarks , which Mrs Gamp had addressed exclusively to the barber , Mr Bailey had been tying his cravat , getting on his coat , and making hideous faces at himself in the glass .
Parsing [sent. 10476 len. 18]: Being now personally addressed by Mrs Gamp , he turned round , and mingled in the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 10477 len. 34]: ` You ai n't been in the City , I suppose , sir , since we was all three there together , ' said Mrs Gamp , ` at Mr Chuzzlewit 's ? '
Parsing [sent. 10478 len. 8]: ` Yes , I have , Sairah .
Parsing [sent. 10479 len. 7]: I was there last night . '
Parsing [sent. 10480 len. 5]: ` Last night ! '
Parsing [sent. 10481 len. 4]: cried the barber .
Parsing [sent. 10482 len. 8]: ` Yes , Poll , reether so .
Parsing [sent. 10483 len. 14]: You can call it this morning , if you like to be particular .
Parsing [sent. 10484 len. 6]: He dined with us . '
Parsing [sent. 10485 len. 13]: ` Who does that young Limb mean by `` hus ? '' '
Parsing [sent. 10486 len. 9]: said Mrs Gamp , with most impatient emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 10487 len. 8]: ` Me and my Governor , Sairah .
Parsing [sent. 10488 len. 6]: He dined at our house .
Parsing [sent. 10489 len. 7]: We wos very merry , Sairah .
Parsing [sent. 10490 len. 24]: So much so , that I was obliged to see him home in a hackney coach at three o'clock in the morning . '
Parsing [sent. 10491 len. 64]: It was on the tip of the boy 's tongue to relate what had followed ; but remembering how easily it might be carried to his master 's ears , and the repeated cautions he had had from Mr Crimple ` not to chatter , ' he checked himself ; adding , only , ` She was sitting up , expecting him . '
Parsing [sent. 10492 len. 34]: ` And all things considered , ' said Mrs Gamp sharply , ` she might have know 'd better than to go a-tirin herself out , by doin ' anythink of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 10493 len. 10]: Did they seem pretty pleasant together , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 10494 len. 14]: ` Oh , yes , ' answered Bailey , ` pleasant enough . '
Parsing [sent. 10495 len. 19]: ` I 'm glad on it , ' said Mrs Gamp , with a second sniff of significance .
Parsing [sent. 10496 len. 29]: ` They have n't been married so long , ' observed Poll , rubbing his hands , ` that they need be anything but pleasant yet awhile . '
Parsing [sent. 10497 len. 14]: ` No , ' said Mrs Gamp , with a third significant signal .
Parsing [sent. 10498 len. 23]: ` Especially , ' pursued the barber , ` when the gentleman bears such a character as you gave him . ' '
Parsing [sent. 10499 len. 15]: I speak ; as I find , Mr Sweedlepipes , ' said Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 10500 len. 7]: ` Forbid it should be otherways !
Parsing [sent. 10501 len. 39]: But we never knows wot 's hidden in each other 's hearts ; and if we had glass winders there , we 'd need keep the shetters up , some on us , I do assure you ! '
Parsing [sent. 10502 len. 14]: ` But you do n't mean to say -- ' Poll Sweedlepipe began .
Parsing [sent. 10503 len. 18]: ` No , ' said Mrs Gamp , cutting him very short , ' I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 10504 len. 6]: Do n't think I do .
Parsing [sent. 10505 len. 13]: The torters of the Imposition should n't make me own I did .
Parsing [sent. 10506 len. 36]: All I says is , ' added the good woman , rising and folding her shawl about her , ` that the Bull 's a-waitin , and the precious moments is a-flyin ' fast . '
Parsing [sent. 10507 len. 39]: The little barber having in his eager curiosity a great desire to see Mrs Gamp 's patient , proposed to Mr Bailey that they should accompany her to the Bull , and witness the departure of the coach .
Parsing [sent. 10508 len. 11]: That young gentleman assenting , they all went out together .
Parsing [sent. 10509 len. 50]: Arriving at the tavern , Mrs Gamp -LRB- who was full-dressed for the journey , in her latest suit of mourning -RRB- left her friends to entertain themselves in the yard , while she ascended to the sick room , where her fellow-labourer Mrs Prig was dressing the invalid .
Parsing [sent. 10510 len. 19]: He was so wasted , that it seemed as if his bones would rattle when they moved him .
Parsing [sent. 10511 len. 11]: His cheeks were sunken , and his eyes unnaturally large .
Parsing [sent. 10512 len. 38]: He lay back in the easy-chair like one more dead than living ; and rolled his languid eyes towards the door when Mrs Gamp appeared , as painfully as if their weight alone were burdensome to move .
Parsing [sent. 10513 len. 10]: ` And how are we by this time ? '
Parsing [sent. 10514 len. 4]: Mrs Gamp observed .
Parsing [sent. 10515 len. 6]: ` We looks charming . '
Parsing [sent. 10516 len. 24]: ` We looks a deal charminger than we are , then , ' returned Mrs Prig , a little chafed in her temper .
Parsing [sent. 10517 len. 22]: ` We got out of bed back ` ards , I think , for we 're as cross as two sticks .
Parsing [sent. 10518 len. 7]: I never see sich a man .
Parsing [sent. 10519 len. 16]: He would n't have been washed , if he 'd had his own way . '
Parsing [sent. 10520 len. 16]: ` She put the soap in my mouth , ' said the unfortunate patient feebly .
Parsing [sent. 10521 len. 10]: ` Could n't you keep it shut then ? '
Parsing [sent. 10522 len. 4]: retorted Mrs Prig .
Parsing [sent. 10523 len. 36]: ` Who do you think 's to wash one feater , and miss another , and wear one 's eyes out with all manner of fine work of that description , for half-a-crown a day !
Parsing [sent. 10524 len. 14]: If you wants to be tittivated , you must pay accordin ' . '
Parsing [sent. 10525 len. 6]: ` Oh dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 10526 len. 11]: cried the patient , ` oh dear , dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 10527 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 10528 len. 34]: said Mrs Prig , ` that 's the way he 's been a-conductin of himself , Sarah , ever since I got him out of bed , if you 'll believe it . '
Parsing [sent. 10529 len. 18]: ` Instead of being grateful , ' Mrs Gamp observed , ` for all our little ways .
Parsing [sent. 10530 len. 13]: Oh , fie for shame , sir , fie for shame ! '
Parsing [sent. 10531 len. 22]: Here Mrs Prig seized the patient by the chin , and began to rasp his unhappy head with a hair-brush . '
Parsing [sent. 10532 len. 11]: I suppose you do n't like that , neither ! '
Parsing [sent. 10533 len. 9]: she observed , stopping to look at him .
Parsing [sent. 10534 len. 35]: It was just possible that he did n't for the brush was a specimen of the hardest kind of instrument producible by modern art ; and his very eyelids were red with the friction .
Parsing [sent. 10535 len. 23]: Mrs Prig was gratified to observe the correctness of her supposition , and said triumphantly ` she know 'd as much . '
Parsing [sent. 10536 len. 48]: When his hair was smoothed down comfortably into his eyes , Mrs Prig and Mrs Gamp put on his neckerchief ; adjusting his shirt collar with great nicety , so that the starched points should also invade those organs , and afflict them with an artificial ophthalmia .
Parsing [sent. 10537 len. 39]: His waistcoat and coat were next arranged ; and as every button was wrenched into a wrong button-hole , and the order of his boots was reversed , he presented on the whole rather a melancholy appearance . '
Parsing [sent. 10538 len. 16]: I do n't think it 's right , ' said the poor weak invalid . '
Parsing [sent. 10539 len. 12]: I feel as if I was in somebody else 's clothes .
Parsing [sent. 10540 len. 20]: I 'm all on one side ; and you 've made one of my legs shorter than the other .
Parsing [sent. 10541 len. 9]: There 's a bottle in my pocket too .
Parsing [sent. 10542 len. 12]: What do you make me sit upon a bottle for ? '
Parsing [sent. 10543 len. 7]: ` Deuce take the man ! '
Parsing [sent. 10544 len. 8]: cried Mrs Gamp , drawing it forth .
Parsing [sent. 10545 len. 12]: ` If he ai n't been and got my night-bottle here .
Parsing [sent. 10546 len. 22]: I made a little cupboard of his coat when it hung behind the door , and quite forgot it , Betsey .
Parsing [sent. 10547 len. 37]: You 'll find a ingun or two , and a little tea and sugar in his t ` other pocket , my dear , if you 'll just be good enough to take 'em out . '
Parsing [sent. 10548 len. 34]: Betsey produced the property in question , together with some other articles of general chandlery ; and Mrs Gamp transferred them to her own pocket , which was a species of nankeen pannier .
Parsing [sent. 10549 len. 36]: Refreshment then arrived in the form of chops and strong ale for the ladies , and a basin of beef-tea for the patient ; which refection was barely at an end when John Westlock appeared .
Parsing [sent. 10550 len. 6]: ` Up and dressed ! '
Parsing [sent. 10551 len. 8]: cried John , sitting down beside him .
Parsing [sent. 10552 len. 5]: ` That 's brave .
Parsing [sent. 10553 len. 6]: How do you feel ? '
Parsing [sent. 10554 len. 4]: ` Much better .
Parsing [sent. 10555 len. 5]: But very weak . '
Parsing [sent. 10556 len. 4]: ` No wonder .
Parsing [sent. 10557 len. 9]: You have had a hard bout of it .
Parsing [sent. 10558 len. 21]: But country air , and change of scene , ' said John , ` will make another man of you !
Parsing [sent. 10559 len. 33]: Why , Mrs Gamp , ' he added , laughing , as he kindly arranged the sick man 's garments , ` you have odd notions of a gentleman 's dress ! '
Parsing [sent. 10560 len. 43]: ` Mr Lewsome a n't a easy gent to get into his clothes , sir , ' Mrs Gamp replied with dignity ; ` as me and Betsey Prig can certify afore the Lord Mayor and Uncommon Counsellors , if needful ! '
Parsing [sent. 10561 len. 40]: John at that moment was standing close in front of the sick man , in the act of releasing him from the torture of the collars before mentioned , when he said in a whisper : ` Mr Westlock !
Parsing [sent. 10562 len. 8]: I do n't wish to be overheard .
Parsing [sent. 10563 len. 29]: I have something very particular and strange to say to you ; something that has been a dreadful weight on my mind , through this long illness . '
Parsing [sent. 10564 len. 29]: Quick in all his motions , John was turning round to desire the women to leave the room ; when the sick man held him by the sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 10565 len. 4]: ` Not now .
Parsing [sent. 10566 len. 6]: I 've not the strength .
Parsing [sent. 10567 len. 6]: I 've not the courage .
Parsing [sent. 10568 len. 8]: May I tell it when I have ?
Parsing [sent. 10569 len. 14]: May I write it , if I find that easier and better ? '
Parsing [sent. 10570 len. 5]: ` May you ! '
Parsing [sent. 10571 len. 3]: cried John .
Parsing [sent. 10572 len. 10]: ` Why , Lewsome , what is this ! '
Parsing [sent. 10573 len. 9]: ` Do n't ask me what it is .
Parsing [sent. 10574 len. 6]: It 's unnatural and cruel .
Parsing [sent. 10575 len. 5]: Frightful to think of .
Parsing [sent. 10576 len. 4]: Frightful to tell .
Parsing [sent. 10577 len. 4]: Frightful to know .
Parsing [sent. 10578 len. 6]: Frightful to have helped in .
Parsing [sent. 10579 len. 12]: Let me kiss your hand for all your goodness to me .
Parsing [sent. 10580 len. 14]: Be kinder still , and do n't ask me what it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 10581 len. 45]: At first , John gazed at him in great surprise ; but remembering how very much reduced he was , and how recently his brain had been on fire with fever , believed that he was labouring under some imaginary horror or despondent fancy .
Parsing [sent. 10582 len. 40]: For farther information on this point , he took an opportunity of drawing Mrs Gamp aside , while Betsey Prig was wrapping him in cloaks and shawls , and asked her whether he was quite collected in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 10583 len. 8]: ` Oh bless you , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 10584 len. 4]: said Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 10585 len. 9]: ` He hates his nusses to this hour .
Parsing [sent. 10586 len. 7]: They always does it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 10587 len. 6]: It 's a certain sign .
Parsing [sent. 10588 len. 40]: If you could have heerd the poor dear soul a-findin fault with me and Betsey Prig , not half an hour ago , you would have wondered how it is we do n't get fretted to the tomb . '
Parsing [sent. 10589 len. 51]: This almost confirmed John in his suspicion ; so , not taking what had passed into any serious account , he resumed his former cheerful manner , and assisted by Mrs Gamp and Betsey Prig , conducted Lewsome downstairs to the coach ; just then upon the point of starting .
Parsing [sent. 10590 len. 35]: Poll Sweedlepipe was at the door with his arms tight folded and his eyes wide open , and looked on with absorbing interest , while the sick man was slowly moved into the vehicle .
Parsing [sent. 10591 len. 30]: His bony hands and haggard face impressed Poll wonderfully ; and he informed Mr Bailey in confidence , that he would n't have missed seeing him for a pound .
Parsing [sent. 10592 len. 21]: Mr Bailey , who was of a different constitution , remarked that he would have stayed away for five shillings .
Parsing [sent. 10593 len. 62]: It was a troublesome matter to adjust Mrs Gamp 's luggage to her satisfaction ; for every package belonging to that lady had the inconvenient property of requiring to be put in a boot by itself , and to have no other luggage near it , on pain of actions at law for heavy damages against the proprietors of the coach .
Parsing [sent. 10594 len. 39]: The umbrella with the circular patch was particularly hard to be got rid of , and several times thrust out its battered brass nozzle from improper crevices and chinks , to the great terror of the other passengers .
Parsing [sent. 10595 len. 39]: Indeed , in her intense anxiety to find a haven of refuge for this chattel , Mrs Gamp so often moved it , in the course of five minutes , that it seemed not one umbrella but fifty .
Parsing [sent. 10596 len. 52]: At length it was lost , or said to be ; and for the next five minutes she was face to face with the coachman , go wherever he might , protesting that it should be ` made good , ' though she took the question to the House of Commons .
Parsing [sent. 10597 len. 54]: At last , her bundle , and her pattens , and her basket , and everything else , being disposed of , she took a friendly leave of Poll and Mr Bailey , dropped a curtsey to John Westlock , and parted as from a cherished member of the sisterhood with Betsey Prig .
Parsing [sent. 10598 len. 21]: ` Wishin you lots of sickness , my darlin creetur , ' Mrs Gamp observed , ` and good places .
Parsing [sent. 10599 len. 60]: It wo n't be long , I hope , afore we works together , off and on , again , Betsey ; and may our next meetin ' be at a large family 's , where they all takes it reg ` lar , one from another , turn and turn about , and has it business-like . ' '
Parsing [sent. 10600 len. 23]: I do n't care how soon it is , ' said Mrs Prig ; ` nor how many weeks it lasts . '
Parsing [sent. 10601 len. 32]: Mrs Gamp with a reply in a congenial spirit was backing to the coach , when she came in contact with a lady and gentleman who were passing along the footway .
Parsing [sent. 10602 len. 9]: ` Take care , take care here ! '
Parsing [sent. 10603 len. 4]: cried the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 10604 len. 3]: ` Halloo !
Parsing [sent. 10605 len. 3]: My dear !
Parsing [sent. 10606 len. 8]: Why , it 's Mrs Gamp ! '
Parsing [sent. 10607 len. 7]: ` What , Mr Mould ! '
Parsing [sent. 10608 len. 4]: exclaimed the nurse .
Parsing [sent. 10609 len. 5]: ` And Mrs Mould !
Parsing [sent. 10610 len. 19]: who would have thought as we should ever have a meetin ' here , I 'm sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 10611 len. 10]: ` Going out of town , Mrs Gamp ? '
Parsing [sent. 10612 len. 3]: cried Mould .
Parsing [sent. 10613 len. 10]: ` That 's unusual , is n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 10614 len. 12]: ` It IS unusual , sir , ' said Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 10615 len. 11]: ` But only for a day or two at most .
Parsing [sent. 10616 len. 14]: The gent , ' she whispered , ` as I spoke about . '
Parsing [sent. 10617 len. 8]: ` What , in the coach ! '
Parsing [sent. 10618 len. 3]: cried Mould .
Parsing [sent. 10619 len. 8]: ` The one you thought of recommending ?
Parsing [sent. 10620 len. 3]: Very odd .
Parsing [sent. 10621 len. 8]: My dear , this will interest you .
Parsing [sent. 10622 len. 19]: The gentleman that Mrs Gamp thought likely to suit us is in the coach , my love . '
Parsing [sent. 10623 len. 6]: Mrs Mould was greatly interested .
Parsing [sent. 10624 len. 6]: ` Here , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 10625 len. 19]: You can stand upon the door-step , ' said Mould , ` and take a look at him .
Parsing [sent. 10626 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 10627 len. 4]: There he is .
Parsing [sent. 10628 len. 5]: Where 's my glass ?
Parsing [sent. 10629 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 10630 len. 3]: all right .
Parsing [sent. 10631 len. 5]: I 've got it .
Parsing [sent. 10632 len. 9]: Do you see him , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 10633 len. 9]: ` Quite plain , ' said Mrs Mould .
Parsing [sent. 10634 len. 22]: ` Upon my life , you know , this is a very singular circumstance , ' said Mould , quite delighted .
Parsing [sent. 10635 len. 20]: ` This is the sort of thing , my dear , I would n't have missed on any account .
Parsing [sent. 10636 len. 4]: It tickles one .
Parsing [sent. 10637 len. 4]: It 's interesting .
Parsing [sent. 10638 len. 10]: It 's almost a little play , you know .
Parsing [sent. 10639 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 10640 len. 4]: There he is !
Parsing [sent. 10641 len. 4]: To be sure .
Parsing [sent. 10642 len. 11]: Looks poorly , Mrs M. , do n't he ? '
Parsing [sent. 10643 len. 4]: Mrs Mould assented .
Parsing [sent. 10644 len. 16]: ` He 's coming our way , perhaps , after all , ' said Mould .
Parsing [sent. 10645 len. 4]: ` Who knows !
Parsing [sent. 10646 len. 15]: I feel as if I ought to show him some little attention , really .
Parsing [sent. 10647 len. 9]: He do n't seem a stranger to me .
Parsing [sent. 10648 len. 14]: I 'm very much inclined to move my hat , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 10649 len. 13]: ` He 's looking hard this way , ' said Mrs Mould .
Parsing [sent. 10650 len. 6]: ` Then I will ! '
Parsing [sent. 10651 len. 3]: cried Mould .
Parsing [sent. 10652 len. 7]: ` How d'ye do , sir !
Parsing [sent. 10653 len. 6]: I wish you good day .
Parsing [sent. 10654 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 10655 len. 4]: He bows too .
Parsing [sent. 10656 len. 3]: Very gentlemanly .
Parsing [sent. 10657 len. 14]: Mrs Gamp has the cards in her pocket , I have no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 10658 len. 12]: This is very singular , my dear -- and very pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 10659 len. 30]: I am not superstitious , but it really seems as if one was destined to pay him those little melancholy civilities which belong to our peculiar line of business .
Parsing [sent. 10660 len. 19]: There can be no kind of objection to your kissing your hand to him , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 10661 len. 5]: Mrs Mould did so .
Parsing [sent. 10662 len. 4]: ` Ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 10663 len. 3]: said Mould .
Parsing [sent. 10664 len. 6]: ` He 's evidently gratified .
Parsing [sent. 10665 len. 3]: Poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 10666 len. 11]: I am quite glad you did it , my love .
Parsing [sent. 10667 len. 7]: Bye bye , Mrs Gamp ! '
Parsing [sent. 10668 len. 4]: waving his hand .
Parsing [sent. 10669 len. 10]: ` There he goes ; there he goes ! '
Parsing [sent. 10670 len. 15]: So he did ; for the coach rolled off as the words were spoken .
Parsing [sent. 10671 len. 15]: Mr and Mrs Mould , in high good humour , went their merry way .
Parsing [sent. 10672 len. 58]: Mr Bailey retired with Poll Sweedlepipe as soon as possible ; but some little time elapsed before he could remove his friend from the ground , owing to the impression wrought upon the barber 's nerves by Mrs Prig , whom he pronounced , in admiration of her beard , to be a woman of transcendent charms .
Parsing [sent. 10673 len. 47]: When the light cloud of bustle hanging round the coach was thus dispersed , Nadgett was seen in the darkest box of the Bull coffee-room , looking wistfully up at the clock -- as if the man who never appeared were a little behind his time .
Parsing [sent. 10674 len. 100]: CHAPTER THIRTY PROVES THAT CHANGES MAY BE RUNG IN THE BEST -- REGULATED FAMILIES , AND THAT MR PECKNIFF WAS A SPECIAL HAND AT A TRIPLE -- BOB -- MAJOR As the surgeon 's first care after amputating a limb , is to take up the arteries the cruel knife has severed , so it is the duty of this history , which in its remorseless course has cut from the Pecksniffian trunk its right arm , Mercy , to look to the parent stem , and see how in all its various ramifications it got on without her .
Parsing [sent. 10675 len. 70]: And first of Mr Pecksniff it may be observed , that having provided for his youngest daughter that choicest of blessings , a tender and indulgent husband ; and having gratified the dearest wish of his parental heart by establishing her in life so happily ; he renewed his youth , and spreading the plumage of his own bright conscience , felt himself equal to all kinds of flights .
Parsing [sent. 10676 len. 50]: It is customary with fathers in stage-plays , after giving their daughters to the men of their hearts , to congratulate themselves on having no other business on their hands but to die immediately ; though it is rarely found that they are in a hurry to do it .
Parsing [sent. 10677 len. 39]: Mr Pecksniff , being a father of a more sage and practical class , appeared to think that his immediate business was to live ; and having deprived himself of one comfort , to surround himself with others .
Parsing [sent. 10678 len. 45]: But however much inclined the good man was to be jocose and playful , and in the garden of his fancy to disport himself -LRB- if one may say so -RRB- like an architectural kitten , he had one impediment constantly opposed to him .
Parsing [sent. 10679 len. 37]: The gentle Cherry , stung by a sense of slight and injury , which far from softening down or wearing out , rankled and festered in her heart -- the gentle Cherry was in flat rebellion .
Parsing [sent. 10680 len. 33]: She waged fierce war against her dear papa , she led her parent what is usually called , for want of a better figure of speech , the life of a dog .
Parsing [sent. 10681 len. 30]: But never did that dog live , in kennel , stable-yard , or house , whose life was half as hard as Mr Pecksniff 's with his gentle child .
Parsing [sent. 10682 len. 10]: The father and daughter were sitting at their breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 10683 len. 9]: Tom had retired , and they were alone .
Parsing [sent. 10684 len. 18]: Mr Pecksniff frowned at first ; but having cleared his brow , looked stealthily at his child .
Parsing [sent. 10685 len. 16]: Her nose was very red indeed , and screwed up tight , with hostile preparation .
Parsing [sent. 10686 len. 15]: ` Cherry , ' cried Mr Pecksniff , ` what is amiss between us ?
Parsing [sent. 10687 len. 9]: My child , why are we disunited ? '
Parsing [sent. 10688 len. 25]: Miss Pecksniff 's answer was scarcely a response to this gush of affection , for it was simply , ` Bother , Pa ! '
Parsing [sent. 10689 len. 4]: ` Bother ! '
Parsing [sent. 10690 len. 10]: repeated Mr Pecksniff , in a tone of anguish .
Parsing [sent. 10691 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 10692 len. 21]: 't is too late , Pa , ' said his daughter , calmly ` to talk to me like this .
Parsing [sent. 10693 len. 13]: I know what it means , and what its value is . '
Parsing [sent. 10694 len. 6]: ` This is hard ! '
Parsing [sent. 10695 len. 8]: cried Mr Pecksniff , addressing his breakfast-cup .
Parsing [sent. 10696 len. 6]: ` This is very hard !
Parsing [sent. 10697 len. 5]: She is my child .
Parsing [sent. 10698 len. 24]: I carried her in my arms when she wore shapeless worsted shoes -- I might say , mufflers -- many years ago ! '
Parsing [sent. 10699 len. 21]: ` You need n't taunt me with that , Pa , ' retorted Cherry , with a spiteful look . '
Parsing [sent. 10700 len. 22]: I am not so many years older than my sister , either , though she IS married to your friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 10701 len. 9]: ` Ah , human nature , human nature !
Parsing [sent. 10702 len. 5]: Poor human nature ! '
Parsing [sent. 10703 len. 20]: said Mr Pecksniff , shaking his head at human nature , as if he did n't belong to it .
Parsing [sent. 10704 len. 13]: ` To think that this discord should arise from such a cause !
Parsing [sent. 10705 len. 7]: oh dear , oh dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 10706 len. 8]: ` From such a cause indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 10707 len. 3]: cried Cherry .
Parsing [sent. 10708 len. 15]: ` State the real cause , Pa , or I 'll state it myself .
Parsing [sent. 10709 len. 2]: Mind !
Parsing [sent. 10710 len. 4]: I will ! '
Parsing [sent. 10711 len. 11]: Perhaps the energy with which she said this was infectious .
Parsing [sent. 10712 len. 34]: However that may be , Mr Pecksniff changed his tone and the expression of his face for one of anger , if not downright violence , when he said : ` You will !
Parsing [sent. 10713 len. 3]: you have .
Parsing [sent. 10714 len. 4]: You did yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 10715 len. 4]: You do always .
Parsing [sent. 10716 len. 25]: You have no decency ; you make no secret of your temper ; you have exposed yourself to Mr Chuzzlewit a hundred times . '
Parsing [sent. 10717 len. 4]: ` Myself ! '
Parsing [sent. 10718 len. 8]: cried Cherry , with a bitter smile .
Parsing [sent. 10719 len. 4]: ` Oh indeed !
Parsing [sent. 10720 len. 7]: I do n't mind that . '
Parsing [sent. 10721 len. 12]: ` Me , too , then , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 10722 len. 8]: His daughter answered with a scornful laugh .
Parsing [sent. 10723 len. 34]: ` And since we have come to an explanation , Charity , ' said Mr Pecksniff , rolling his head portentously , ` let me tell you that I wo n't allow it .
Parsing [sent. 10724 len. 7]: None of your nonsense , Miss !
Parsing [sent. 10725 len. 11]: I wo n't permit it to be done . ' '
Parsing [sent. 10726 len. 40]: I shall do , ' said Charity , rocking her chair backwards and forwards , and raising her voice to a high pitch , ' I shall do , Pa , what I please and what I have done .
Parsing [sent. 10727 len. 14]: I am not going to be crushed in everything , depend upon it .
Parsing [sent. 10728 len. 36]: I 've been more shamefully used than anybody ever was in this world , ' here she began to cry and sob , ` and may expect the worse treatment from you , I know .
Parsing [sent. 10729 len. 8]: But I do n't care for that .
Parsing [sent. 10730 len. 7]: No , I do n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 10731 len. 50]: Mr Pecksniff was made so desperate by the loud tone in which she spoke , that , after looking about him in frantic uncertainty for some means of softening it , he rose and shook her until the ornamental bow of hair upon her head nodded like a plume .
Parsing [sent. 10732 len. 18]: She was so very much astonished by this assault , that it really had the desired effect .
Parsing [sent. 10733 len. 8]: ` I 'll do it again ! '
Parsing [sent. 10734 len. 25]: cried Mr Pecksniff , as he resumed his seat and fetched his breath , ` if you dare to talk in that loud manner .
Parsing [sent. 10735 len. 9]: How do you mean about being shamefully used ?
Parsing [sent. 10736 len. 22]: If Mr Jonas chose your sister in preference to you , who could help it , I should wish to know ?
Parsing [sent. 10737 len. 9]: What have I to do with it ? '
Parsing [sent. 10738 len. 9]: ` Was n't I made a convenience of ?
Parsing [sent. 10739 len. 7]: Were n't my feelings trifled with ?
Parsing [sent. 10740 len. 10]: Did n't he address himself to me first ? '
Parsing [sent. 10741 len. 23]: sobbed Cherry , clasping her hands ; ` and oh , good gracious , that I should live to be shook ! '
Parsing [sent. 10742 len. 31]: ` You 'll live to be shaken again , ' returned her parent , ` if you drive me to that means of maintaining the decorum of this humble roof .
Parsing [sent. 10743 len. 4]: You surprise me .
Parsing [sent. 10744 len. 8]: I wonder you have not more spirit .
Parsing [sent. 10745 len. 19]: If Mr Jonas did n't care for you , how could you wish to have him ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 10746 len. 7]: I wish to have him ! '
Parsing [sent. 10747 len. 4]: exclaimed Cherry . '
Parsing [sent. 10748 len. 9]: I wish to have him , Pa ! '
Parsing [sent. 10749 len. 29]: ` Then what are you making all this piece of work for , ' retorted her father , ` if you did n't wish to have him ? '
Parsing [sent. 10750 len. 26]: ` Because I was treated with duplicity , ' said Cherry ; ` and because my own sister and my own father conspired against me .
Parsing [sent. 10751 len. 19]: I am not angry with HER , ' said Cherry ; looking much more angry than ever . '
Parsing [sent. 10752 len. 4]: I pity her .
Parsing [sent. 10753 len. 6]: I 'm sorry for her .
Parsing [sent. 10754 len. 16]: I know the fate that 's in store for her , with that Wretch . '
Parsing [sent. 10755 len. 42]: ` Mr Jonas will survive your calling him a wretch , my child , I dare say , ' said Mr Pecksniff , with returning resignation ; ` but call him what you like and make an end of it . '
Parsing [sent. 10756 len. 11]: ` Not an end , Pa , ' said Charity .
Parsing [sent. 10757 len. 7]: ` No , not an end .
Parsing [sent. 10758 len. 13]: That 's not the only point on which we 're not agreed .
Parsing [sent. 10759 len. 7]: I wo n't submit to it .
Parsing [sent. 10760 len. 10]: It 's better you should know that at once .
Parsing [sent. 10761 len. 12]: No ; I wo n't submit to it indeed , Pa !
Parsing [sent. 10762 len. 13]: I am not quite a fool , and I am not blind .
Parsing [sent. 10763 len. 16]: All I have got to say is , I wo n't submit to it . '
Parsing [sent. 10764 len. 24]: Whatever she meant , she shook Mr Pecksniff now ; for his lame attempt to seem composed was melancholy in the last degree .
Parsing [sent. 10765 len. 14]: His anger changed to meekness , and his words were mild and fawning .
Parsing [sent. 10766 len. 56]: ` My dear , ' he said ; ` if in the short excitement of an angry moment I resorted to an unjustifiable means of suppressing a little outbreak calculated to injure you as well as myself -- it 's possible I may have done so ; perhaps I did -- I ask your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 10767 len. 29]: A father asking pardon of his child , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` is , I believe , a spectacle to soften the most rugged nature . '
Parsing [sent. 10768 len. 19]: But it did n't at all soften Miss Pecksniff ; perhaps because her nature was not rugged enough .
Parsing [sent. 10769 len. 34]: On the contrary , she persisted in saying , over and over again , that she was n't quite a fool , and was n't blind , and would n't submit to it .
Parsing [sent. 10770 len. 11]: ` You labour under some mistake , my child ! '
Parsing [sent. 10771 len. 4]: said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 10772 len. 18]: ` but I will not ask you what it is ; I do n't desire to know .
Parsing [sent. 10773 len. 5]: No , pray ! '
Parsing [sent. 10774 len. 26]: he added , holding out his hand and colouring again , ` let us avoid the subject , my dear , whatever it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 10775 len. 20]: ` It 's quite right that the subject should be avoided between us , sir , ' said Cherry .
Parsing [sent. 10776 len. 25]: ` But I wish to be able to avoid it altogether , and consequently must beg you to provide me with a home . '
Parsing [sent. 10777 len. 18]: Mr Pecksniff looked about the room , and said , ' A home , my child ! '
Parsing [sent. 10778 len. 44]: ` Another home , papa , ' said Cherry , with increasing stateliness ` Place me at Mrs Todgers 's or somewhere , on an independent footing ; but I will not live here , if such is to be the case . '
Parsing [sent. 10779 len. 26]: It is possible that Miss Pecksniff saw in Mrs Todgers 's a vision of enthusiastic men , pining to fall in adoration at her feet .
Parsing [sent. 10780 len. 40]: It is possible that Mr Pecksniff , in his new-born juvenility , saw , in the suggestion of that same establishment , an easy means of relieving himself from an irksome charge in the way of temper and watchfulness .
Parsing [sent. 10781 len. 29]: It is undoubtedly a fact that in the attentive ears of Mr Pecksniff , the proposition did not sound quite like the dismal knell of all his hopes .
Parsing [sent. 10782 len. 36]: But he was a man of great feeling and acute sensibility ; and he squeezed his pocket-handkerchief against his eyes with both hands -- as such men always do , especially when they are observed .
Parsing [sent. 10783 len. 30]: ` One of my birds , ' Mr Pecksniff said , ` has left me for the stranger 's breast ; the other would take wing to Todgers 's !
Parsing [sent. 10784 len. 8]: Well , well , what am I ?
Parsing [sent. 10785 len. 10]: I do n't know what I am , exactly .
Parsing [sent. 10786 len. 4]: Never mind ! '
Parsing [sent. 10787 len. 24]: Even this remark , made more pathetic perhaps by his breaking down in the middle of it , had no effect upon Charity .
Parsing [sent. 10788 len. 9]: She was grim , rigid , and inflexible .
Parsing [sent. 10789 len. 47]: ` But I have ever , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` sacrificed my children 's happiness to my own -- I mean my own happiness to my children 's -- and I will not begin to regulate my life by other rules of conduct now .
Parsing [sent. 10790 len. 25]: If you can be happier at Mrs Todgers 's than in your father 's house , my dear , go to Mrs Todgers 's !
Parsing [sent. 10791 len. 10]: Do not think of me , my girl ! '
Parsing [sent. 10792 len. 18]: said Mr Pecksniff with emotion ; ' I shall get on pretty well , no doubt . '
Parsing [sent. 10793 len. 30]: Miss Charity , who knew he had a secret pleasure in the contemplation of the proposed change , suppressed her own , and went on to negotiate the terms .
Parsing [sent. 10794 len. 41]: His views upon this subject were at first so very limited that another difference , involving possibly another shaking , threatened to ensue ; but by degrees they came to something like an understanding , and the storm blew over .
Parsing [sent. 10795 len. 28]: Indeed , Miss Charity 's idea was so agreeable to both , that it would have been strange if they had not come to an amicable agreement .
Parsing [sent. 10796 len. 65]: It was soon arranged between them that the project should be tried , and that immediately ; and that Cherry 's not being well , and needing change of scene , and wishing to be near her sister , should form the excuse for her departure to Mr Chuzzlewit and Mary , to both of whom she had pleaded indisposition for some time past .
Parsing [sent. 10797 len. 40]: These premises agreed on , Mr Pecksniff gave her his blessing , with all the dignity of a self-denying man who had made a hard sacrifice , but comforted himself with the reflection that virtue is its own reward .
Parsing [sent. 10798 len. 42]: Thus they were reconciled for the first time since that not easily forgiven night , when Mr Jonas , repudiating the elder , had confessed his passion for the younger sister , and Mr Pecksniff had abetted him on moral grounds .
Parsing [sent. 10799 len. 46]: But how happened it -- in the name of an unexpected addition to that small family , the Seven Wonders of the World , whatever and wherever they may be , how happened it -- that Mr Pecksniff and his daughter were about to part ?
Parsing [sent. 10800 len. 12]: How happened it that their mutual relations were so greatly altered ?
Parsing [sent. 10801 len. 25]: Why was Miss Pecksniff so clamorous to have it understood that she was neither blind nor foolish , and she would n't bear it ?
Parsing [sent. 10802 len. 32]: It is not possible that Mr Pecksniff had any thoughts of marrying again ; or that his daughter , with the sharp eye of a single woman , fathomed his design !
Parsing [sent. 10803 len. 6]: Let us inquire into this .
Parsing [sent. 10804 len. 35]: Mr Pecksniff , as a man without reproach , from whom the breath of slander passed like common breath from any other polished surface , could afford to do what common men could not .
Parsing [sent. 10805 len. 33]: He knew the purity of his own motives ; and when he had a motive worked at it as only a very good man -LRB- or a very bad one -RRB- can .
Parsing [sent. 10806 len. 16]: Did he set before himself any strong and palpable motives for taking a second wife ?
Parsing [sent. 10807 len. 17]: Yes ; and not one or two of them , but a combination of very many .
Parsing [sent. 10808 len. 10]: Old Martin Chuzzlewit had gradually undergone an important change .
Parsing [sent. 10809 len. 27]: Even upon the night when he made such an ill-timed arrival at Mr Pecksniff 's house , he was comparatively subdued and easy to deal with .
Parsing [sent. 10810 len. 21]: This Mr Pecksniff attributed , at the time , to the effect his brother 's death had had upon him .
Parsing [sent. 10811 len. 31]: But from that hour his character seemed to have modified by regular degrees , and to have softened down into a dull indifference for almost every one but Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 10812 len. 16]: His looks were much the same as ever , but his mind was singularly altered .
Parsing [sent. 10813 len. 28]: It was not that this or that passion stood out in brighter or in dimmer hues ; but that the colour of the whole man was faded .
Parsing [sent. 10814 len. 15]: As one trait disappeared , no other trait sprung up to take its place .
Parsing [sent. 10815 len. 5]: His senses dwindled too .
Parsing [sent. 10816 len. 29]: He was less keen of sight ; was deaf sometimes ; took little notice of what passed before him ; and would be profoundly taciturn for days together .
Parsing [sent. 10817 len. 22]: The process of this alteration was so easy that almost as soon as it began to be observed it was complete .
Parsing [sent. 10818 len. 27]: But Mr Pecksniff saw it first , and having Anthony Chuzzlewit fresh in his recollection , saw in his brother Martin the same process of decay .
Parsing [sent. 10819 len. 16]: To a gentleman of Mr Pecksniff 's tenderness , this was a very mournful sight .
Parsing [sent. 10820 len. 28]: He could not but foresee the probability of his respected relative being made the victim of designing persons , and of his riches falling into worthless hands .
Parsing [sent. 10821 len. 41]: It gave him so much pain that he resolved to secure the property to himself ; to keep bad testamentary suitors at a distance ; to wall up the old gentleman , as it were , for his own use .
Parsing [sent. 10822 len. 55]: By little and little , therefore , he began to try whether Mr Chuzzlewit gave any promise of becoming an instrument in his hands , and finding that he did , and indeed that he was very supple in his plastic fingers , he made it the business of his life -- kind soul !
Parsing [sent. 10823 len. 41]: -- to establish an ascendancy over him ; and every little test he durst apply meeting with a success beyond his hopes , he began to think he heard old Martin 's cash already chinking in his own unworldly pockets .
Parsing [sent. 10824 len. 64]: But when Mr Pecksniff pondered on this subject -LRB- as , in his zealous way , he often did -RRB- , and thought with an uplifted heart of the train of circumstances which had delivered the old gentleman into his hands for the confusion of evil-doers and the triumph of a righteous nature , he always felt that Mary Graham was his stumbling-block .
Parsing [sent. 10825 len. 20]: Let the old man say what he would , Mr Pecksniff knew he had a strong affection for her .
Parsing [sent. 10826 len. 33]: He knew that he showed it in a thousand little ways ; that he liked to have her near him , and was never quite at ease when she was absent long .
Parsing [sent. 10827 len. 19]: That he had ever really sworn to leave her nothing in his will , Mr Pecksniff greatly doubted .
Parsing [sent. 10828 len. 26]: That even if he had , there were many ways by which he could evade the oath and satisfy his conscience , Mr Pecksniff knew .
Parsing [sent. 10829 len. 28]: That her unprotected state was no light burden on the old man 's mind , he also knew , for Mr Chuzzlewit had plainly told him so .
Parsing [sent. 10830 len. 14]: ` Then , ' said Mr Pecksniff ` what if I married her !
Parsing [sent. 10831 len. 43]: What , ' repeated Mr Pecksniff , sticking up his hair and glancing at his bust by Spoker ; ` what if , making sure of his approval first -- he is nearly imbecile , poor gentleman -- I married her ! '
Parsing [sent. 10832 len. 14]: Mr Pecksniff had a lively sense of the Beautiful ; especially in women .
Parsing [sent. 10833 len. 12]: His manner towards the sex was remarkable for its insinuating character .
Parsing [sent. 10834 len. 42]: It is recorded of him in another part of these pages , that he embraced Mrs Todgers on the smallest provocation ; and it was a way he had ; it was a part of the gentle placidity of his disposition .
Parsing [sent. 10835 len. 23]: Before any thought of matrimony was in his mind , he had bestowed on Mary many little tokens of his spiritual admiration .
Parsing [sent. 10836 len. 11]: They had been indignantly received , but that was nothing .
Parsing [sent. 10837 len. 41]: True , as the idea expanded within him , these had become too ardent to escape the piercing eye of Cherry , who read his scheme at once ; but he had always felt the power of Mary 's charms .
Parsing [sent. 10838 len. 18]: So Interest and Inclination made a pair , and drew the curricle of Mr Pecksniff 's plan .
Parsing [sent. 10839 len. 50]: As to any thought of revenging himself on young Martin for his insolent expressions when they parted , and of shutting him out still more effectually from any hope of reconciliation with his grandfather , Mr Pecksniff was much too meek and forgiving to be suspected of harbouring it .
Parsing [sent. 10840 len. 31]: As to being refused by Mary , Mr Pecksniff was quite satisfied that in her position she could never hold out if he and Mr Chuzzlewit were both against her .
Parsing [sent. 10841 len. 44]: As to consulting the wishes of her heart in such a case , it formed no part of Mr Pecksniff 's moral code ; for he knew what a good man he was , and what a blessing he must be to anybody .
Parsing [sent. 10842 len. 36]: His daughter having broken the ice , and the murder being out between them , Mr Pecksniff had now only to pursue his design as cleverly as he could , and by the craftiest approaches .
Parsing [sent. 10843 len. 51]: ` Well , my good sir , ' said Mr Pecksniff , meeting old Martin in the garden , for it was his habit to walk in and out by that way , as the fancy took him ; ` and how is my dear friend this delicious morning ? '
Parsing [sent. 10844 len. 7]: ` Do you mean me ? '
Parsing [sent. 10845 len. 5]: asked the old man .
Parsing [sent. 10846 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 10847 len. 14]: said Mr Pecksniff , ` one of his deaf days , I see .
Parsing [sent. 10848 len. 12]: Could I mean any one else , my dear sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 10849 len. 13]: ` You might have meant Mary , ' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 10850 len. 5]: ` Indeed I might .
Parsing [sent. 10851 len. 3]: Quite true .
Parsing [sent. 10852 len. 16]: I might speak of her as a dear , dear friend , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 10853 len. 5]: observed Mr Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 10854 len. 10]: I hope so , ' returned old Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 10855 len. 7]: I think she deserves it . '
Parsing [sent. 10856 len. 4]: ` Think ! '
Parsing [sent. 10857 len. 10]: cried Pecksniff , ` think , Mr Chuzzlewit ! '
Parsing [sent. 10858 len. 22]: ` You are speaking , I know , ' returned Martin , ` but I do n't catch what you say .
Parsing [sent. 10859 len. 4]: Speak up ! '
Parsing [sent. 10860 len. 14]: ` He 's getting deafer than a flint , ' said Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 10861 len. 24]: I was saying , my dear sir , that I am afraid I must make up my mind to part with Cherry . '
Parsing [sent. 10862 len. 8]: ` What has SHE been doing ? '
Parsing [sent. 10863 len. 5]: asked the old man .
Parsing [sent. 10864 len. 12]: ` He puts the most ridiculous questions I ever heard ! '
Parsing [sent. 10865 len. 4]: muttered Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 10866 len. 8]: ` He 's a child to-day . '
Parsing [sent. 10867 len. 23]: After which he added , in a mild roar : ` She has n't been doing anything , my dear friend . '
Parsing [sent. 10868 len. 12]: ` What are you going to part with her for ? '
Parsing [sent. 10869 len. 3]: demanded Martin .
Parsing [sent. 10870 len. 15]: ` She has n't her health by any means , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 10871 len. 19]: ` She misses her sister , my dear sir ; they doted on each other from the cradle .
Parsing [sent. 10872 len. 14]: And I think of giving her a run in London for a change .
Parsing [sent. 10873 len. 15]: A good long run , sir , if I find she likes it . '
Parsing [sent. 10874 len. 8]: ` Quite right , ' cried Martin .
Parsing [sent. 10875 len. 7]: ` It 's judicious . ' '
Parsing [sent. 10876 len. 9]: I am glad to hear you say so .
Parsing [sent. 10877 len. 19]: I hope you mean to bear me company in this dull part , while she 's away ? '
Parsing [sent. 10878 len. 5]: said Mr Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 10879 len. 15]: I have no intention of removing from it , ' was Martin 's answer .
Parsing [sent. 10880 len. 39]: ` Then why , ' said Mr Pecksniff , taking the old man 's arm in his , and walking slowly on ; ` Why , my good sir , ca n't you come and stay with me ?
Parsing [sent. 10881 len. 28]: I am sure I could surround you with more comforts -- lowly as is my Cot -- than you can obtain at a village house of entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 10882 len. 53]: And pardon me , Mr Chuzzlewit , pardon me if I say that such a place as the Dragon , however well-conducted -LRB- and , as far as I know , Mrs Lupin is one of the worthiest creatures in this county -RRB- , is hardly a home for Miss Graham . '
Parsing [sent. 10883 len. 20]: Martin mused a moment ; and then said , as he shook him by the hand : ` No .
Parsing [sent. 10884 len. 10]: You 're quite right ; it is not . '
Parsing [sent. 10885 len. 25]: ` The very sight of skittles , ' Mr Pecksniff eloquently pursued , ` is far from being congenial to a delicate mind . '
Parsing [sent. 10886 len. 18]: ` It 's an amusement of the vulgar , ' said old Martin , ` certainly . '
Parsing [sent. 10887 len. 11]: ` Of the very vulgar , ' Mr Pecksniff answered .
Parsing [sent. 10888 len. 11]: ` Then why not bring Miss Graham here , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 10889 len. 5]: Here is the house .
Parsing [sent. 10890 len. 18]: Here am I alone in it , for Thomas Pinch I do not count as any one .
Parsing [sent. 10891 len. 25]: Our lovely friend shall occupy my daughter 's chamber ; you shall choose your own ; we shall not quarrel , I hope ! '
Parsing [sent. 10892 len. 13]: ` We are not likely to do that , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 10893 len. 6]: Mr Pecksniff pressed his hand .
Parsing [sent. 10894 len. 13]: ` We understand each other , my dear sir , I see !
Parsing [sent. 10895 len. 20]: -- I can wind him , ' he thought , with exultation , ` round my little finger . '
Parsing [sent. 10896 len. 9]: ` You leave the recompense to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 10897 len. 11]: said the old man , after a minute 's silence .
Parsing [sent. 10898 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 10899 len. 7]: do not speak of recompense ! '
Parsing [sent. 10900 len. 4]: cried Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 10901 len. 23]: I say , ' repeated Martin , with a glimmer of his old obstinacy , ` you leave the recompense to me .
Parsing [sent. 10902 len. 4]: Do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 10903 len. 12]: ` Since you desire it , my good sir . ' '
Parsing [sent. 10904 len. 11]: I always desire it , ' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 10905 len. 8]: ` You know I always desire it .
Parsing [sent. 10906 len. 15]: I wish to pay as I go , even when I buy of you .
Parsing [sent. 10907 len. 17]: Not that I do not leave a balance to be settled one day , Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 10908 len. 9]: The architect was too much overcome to speak .
Parsing [sent. 10909 len. 22]: He tried to drop a tear upon his patron 's hand , but could n't find one in his dry distillery .
Parsing [sent. 10910 len. 9]: ` May that day be very distant ! '
Parsing [sent. 10911 len. 5]: was his pious exclamation .
Parsing [sent. 10912 len. 5]: ` Ah , sir !
Parsing [sent. 10913 len. 15]: If I could say how deep an interest I have in you and yours !
Parsing [sent. 10914 len. 9]: I allude to our beautiful young friend . '
Parsing [sent. 10915 len. 7]: ` True , ' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 10916 len. 3]: ` True .
Parsing [sent. 10917 len. 9]: She need have some one interested in her .
Parsing [sent. 10918 len. 11]: I did her wrong to train her as I did .
Parsing [sent. 10919 len. 21]: Orphan though she was , she would have found some one to protect her whom she might have loved again .
Parsing [sent. 10920 len. 33]: When she was a child , I pleased myself with the thought that in gratifying my whim of placing her between me and false-hearted knaves , I had done her a kindness .
Parsing [sent. 10921 len. 12]: Now she is a woman , I have no such comfort .
Parsing [sent. 10922 len. 7]: She has no protector but herself .
Parsing [sent. 10923 len. 24]: I have put her at such odds with the world , that any dog may bark or fawn upon her at his pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 10924 len. 9]: Indeed she stands in need of delicate consideration .
Parsing [sent. 10925 len. 7]: Yes ; indeed she does ! '
Parsing [sent. 10926 len. 13]: ` If her position could be altered and defined , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 10927 len. 4]: Mr Pecksniff hinted .
Parsing [sent. 10928 len. 7]: ` How can that be done ?
Parsing [sent. 10929 len. 13]: Should I make a seamstress of her , or a governess ? '
Parsing [sent. 10930 len. 5]: ` Heaven forbid ! '
Parsing [sent. 10931 len. 4]: said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 10932 len. 10]: ` My dear sir , there are other ways .
Parsing [sent. 10933 len. 4]: There are indeed .
Parsing [sent. 10934 len. 18]: But I am much excited and embarrassed at present , and would rather not pursue the subject .
Parsing [sent. 10935 len. 7]: I scarcely know what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 10936 len. 10]: Permit me to resume it at another time . '
Parsing [sent. 10937 len. 7]: ` You are not unwell ? '
Parsing [sent. 10938 len. 4]: asked Martin anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 10939 len. 6]: ` No , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 10940 len. 3]: cried Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 10941 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 10942 len. 9]: Permit me to resume it at another time .
Parsing [sent. 10943 len. 6]: I 'll walk a little .
Parsing [sent. 10944 len. 4]: Bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 10945 len. 12]: Old Martin blessed him in return , and squeezed his hand .
Parsing [sent. 10946 len. 51]: As he turned away , and slowly walked towards the house , Mr Pecksniff stood gazing after him ; being pretty well recovered from his late emotion , which , in any other man , one might have thought had been assumed as a machinery for feeling Martin 's pulse .
Parsing [sent. 10947 len. 41]: The change in the old man found such a slight expression in his figure , that Mr Pecksniff , looking after him , could not help saying to himself : ` And I can wind him round my little finger !
Parsing [sent. 10948 len. 4]: Only think ! '
Parsing [sent. 10949 len. 12]: Old Martin happening to turn his head , saluted him affectionately .
Parsing [sent. 10950 len. 6]: Mr Pecksniff returned the gesture .
Parsing [sent. 10951 len. 26]: ` Why , the time was , ' said Mr Pecksniff ; ` and not long ago , when he would n't look at me !
Parsing [sent. 10952 len. 6]: How soothing is this change .
Parsing [sent. 10953 len. 20]: Such is the delicate texture of the human heart ; so complicated is the process of its being softened !
Parsing [sent. 10954 len. 16]: Externally he looks the same , and I can wind him round my little finger .
Parsing [sent. 10955 len. 4]: Only think ! '
Parsing [sent. 10956 len. 39]: In sober truth , there did appear to be nothing on which Mr Pecksniff might not have ventured with Martin Chuzzlewit ; for whatever Mr Pecksniff said or did was right , and whatever he advised was done .
Parsing [sent. 10957 len. 37]: Martin had escaped so many snares from needy fortune-hunters , and had withered in the shell of his suspicion and distrust for so many years , but to become the good man 's tool and plaything .
Parsing [sent. 10958 len. 20]: With the happiness of this conviction painted on his face , the architect went forth upon his morning walk .
Parsing [sent. 10959 len. 14]: The summer weather in his bosom was reflected in the breast of Nature .
Parsing [sent. 10960 len. 70]: Through deep green vistas where the boughs arched overhead , and showed the sunlight flashing in the beautiful perspective ; through dewy fern from which the startled hares leaped up , and fled at his approach ; by mantled pools , and fallen trees , and down in hollow places , rustling among last year 's leaves whose scent woke memory of the past ; the placid Pecksniff strolled .
Parsing [sent. 10961 len. 36]: By meadow gates and hedges fragrant with wild roses ; and by thatched-roof cottages whose inmates humbly bowed before him as a man both good and wise ; the worthy Pecksniff walked in tranquil meditation .
Parsing [sent. 10962 len. 70]: The bee passed onward , humming of the work he had to do ; the idle gnats for ever going round and round in one contracting and expanding ring , yet always going on as fast as he , danced merrily before him ; the colour of the long grass came and went , as if the light clouds made it timid as they floated through the distant air .
Parsing [sent. 10963 len. 33]: The birds , so many Pecksniff consciences , sang gayly upon every branch ; and Mr Pecksniff paid HIS homage to the day by ruminating on his projects as he walked along .
Parsing [sent. 10964 len. 32]: Chancing to trip , in his abstraction , over the spreading root of an old tree , he raised his pious eyes to take a survey of the ground before him .
Parsing [sent. 10965 len. 15]: It startled him to see the embodied image of his thoughts not far ahead .
Parsing [sent. 10966 len. 3]: Mary herself .
Parsing [sent. 10967 len. 3]: And alone .
Parsing [sent. 10968 len. 53]: At first Mr Pecksniff stopped as if with the intention of avoiding her ; but his next impulse was to advance , which he did at a brisk pace ; caroling as he went so sweetly and with so much innocence that he only wanted feathers and wings to be a bird .
Parsing [sent. 10969 len. 18]: Hearing notes behind her , not belonging to the songsters of the grove , she looked round .
Parsing [sent. 10970 len. 13]: Mr Pecksniff kissed his hand , and was at her side immediately .
Parsing [sent. 10971 len. 6]: ` Communing with nature ? '
Parsing [sent. 10972 len. 4]: said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 10973 len. 25]: ` So am I. ' She said the morning was so beautiful that she had walked further than she intended , and would return .
Parsing [sent. 10974 len. 16]: Mr Pecksniff said it was exactly his case , and he would return with her .
Parsing [sent. 10975 len. 13]: ` Take my arm , sweet girl , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 10976 len. 13]: Mary declined it , and walked so very fast that he remonstrated .
Parsing [sent. 10977 len. 15]: ` You were loitering when I came upon you , ' Mr Pecksniff said .
Parsing [sent. 10978 len. 10]: ` Why be so cruel as to hurry now ?
Parsing [sent. 10979 len. 10]: You would not shun me , would you ? '
Parsing [sent. 10980 len. 24]: ` Yes , I would , ' she answered , turning her glowing cheek indignantly upon him , ` you know I would .
Parsing [sent. 10981 len. 6]: Release me , Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 10982 len. 8]: Your touch is disagreeable to me . '
Parsing [sent. 10983 len. 3]: His touch !
Parsing [sent. 10984 len. 2]: What ?
Parsing [sent. 10985 len. 26]: That chaste patriarchal touch which Mrs Todgers -- surely a discreet lady -- had endured , not only without complaint , but with apparent satisfaction !
Parsing [sent. 10986 len. 5]: This was positively wrong .
Parsing [sent. 10987 len. 10]: Mr Pecksniff was sorry to hear her say it .
Parsing [sent. 10988 len. 40]: ` If you have not observed , ' said Mary , ` that it is so , pray take assurance from my lips , and do not , as you are a gentleman , continue to offend me . '
Parsing [sent. 10989 len. 6]: ` Well , well ! '
Parsing [sent. 10990 len. 34]: said Mr Pecksniff , mildly , ' I feel that I might consider this becoming in a daughter of my own , and why should I object to it in one so beautiful !
Parsing [sent. 10991 len. 4]: It 's harsh .
Parsing [sent. 10992 len. 24]: It cuts me to the soul , ' said Mr Pecksniff ; ` but I can not quarrel with you , Mary . '
Parsing [sent. 10993 len. 16]: She tried to say she was sorry to hear it , but burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 10994 len. 60]: Mr Pecksniff now repeated the Todgers performance on a comfortable scale , as if he intended it to last some time ; and in his disengaged hand , catching hers , employed himself in separating the fingers with his own , and sometimes kissing them , as he pursued the conversation thus : ' I am glad we met .
Parsing [sent. 10995 len. 7]: I am very glad we met .
Parsing [sent. 10996 len. 20]: I am able now to ease my bosom of a heavy load , and speak to you in confidence .
Parsing [sent. 10997 len. 26]: Mary , ' said Mr Pecksniff in his tenderest tones , indeed they were so very tender that he almost squeaked : ` My soul !
Parsing [sent. 10998 len. 5]: I love you ! '
Parsing [sent. 10999 len. 8]: A fantastic thing , that maiden affectation !
Parsing [sent. 11000 len. 7]: She made believe to shudder . '
Parsing [sent. 11001 len. 26]: I love you , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` my gentle life , with a devotion which is quite surprising , even to myself .
Parsing [sent. 11002 len. 36]: I did suppose that the sensation was buried in the silent tomb of a lady , only second to you in qualities of the mind and form ; but I find I am mistaken . '
Parsing [sent. 11003 len. 36]: She tried to disengage her hand , but might as well have tried to free herself from the embrace of an affectionate boa-constrictor ; if anything so wily may be brought into comparison with Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 11004 len. 49]: ` Although I am a widower , ' said Mr Pecksniff , examining the rings upon her fingers , and tracing the course of one delicate blue vein with his fat thumb , ' a widower with two daughters , still I am not encumbered , my love .
Parsing [sent. 11005 len. 11]: One of them , as you know , is married .
Parsing [sent. 11006 len. 20]: The other , by her own desire , but with a view , I will confess -- why not ?
Parsing [sent. 11007 len. 16]: -- to my altering my condition , is about to leave her father 's house .
Parsing [sent. 11008 len. 8]: I have a character , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 11009 len. 12]: People are pleased to speak well of me , I think .
Parsing [sent. 11010 len. 15]: My person and manner are not absolutely those of a monster , I trust .
Parsing [sent. 11011 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 11012 len. 4]: naughty Hand ! '
Parsing [sent. 11013 len. 17]: said Mr Pecksniff , apostrophizing the reluctant prize , ` why did you take me prisoner ?
Parsing [sent. 11014 len. 5]: Go , go ! '
Parsing [sent. 11015 len. 21]: He slapped the hand to punish it ; but relenting , folded it in his waistcoat to comfort it again .
Parsing [sent. 11016 len. 29]: ` Blessed in each other , and in the society of our venerable friend , my darling , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` we shall be happy .
Parsing [sent. 11017 len. 16]: When he is wafted to a haven of rest , we will console each other .
Parsing [sent. 11018 len. 10]: My pretty primrose , what do you say ? '
Parsing [sent. 11019 len. 28]: ` It is possible , ' Mary answered , in a hurried manner , ` that I ought to feel grateful for this mark of your confidence .
Parsing [sent. 11020 len. 20]: I can not say that I do , but I am willing to suppose you may deserve my thanks .
Parsing [sent. 11021 len. 12]: Take them ; and pray leave me , Mr Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 11022 len. 15]: The good man smiled a greasy smile ; and drew her closer to him .
Parsing [sent. 11023 len. 10]: ` Pray , pray release me , Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 11024 len. 8]: I can not listen to your proposal .
Parsing [sent. 11025 len. 6]: I can not receive it .
Parsing [sent. 11026 len. 18]: There are many to whom it may be acceptable , but it is not so to me .
Parsing [sent. 11027 len. 15]: As an act of kindness and an act of pity , leave me ! '
Parsing [sent. 11028 len. 41]: Mr Pecksniff walked on with his arm round her waist , and her hand in his , as contentedly as if they had been all in all to each other , and were joined in the bonds of truest love .
Parsing [sent. 11029 len. 72]: ` If you force me by your superior strength , ' said Mary , who finding that good words had not the least effect upon him , made no further effort to suppress her indignation ; ` if you force me by your superior strength to accompany you back , and to be the subject of your insolence upon the way , you can not constrain the expression of my thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 11030 len. 8]: I hold you in the deepest abhorrence .
Parsing [sent. 11031 len. 10]: I know your real nature and despise it . '
Parsing [sent. 11032 len. 12]: ` No , no , ' said Mr Pecksniff , sweetly .
Parsing [sent. 11033 len. 8]: ` No , no , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 11034 len. 49]: ` By what arts or unhappy chances you have gained your influence over Mr Chuzzlewit , I do not know , ' said Mary ; ` it may be strong enough to soften even this , but he shall know of this , trust me , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 11035 len. 14]: Mr Pecksniff raised his heavy eyelids languidly , and let them fall again .
Parsing [sent. 11036 len. 12]: It was saying with perfect coolness , ` Aye , aye !
Parsing [sent. 11037 len. 3]: Indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 11038 len. 88]: ` Is it not enough , ' said Mary , ` that you warp and change his nature , adapt his every prejudice to your bad ends , and harden a heart naturally kind by shutting out the truth and allowing none but false and distorted views to reach it ; is it not enough that you have the power of doing this , and that you exercise it , but must you also be so coarse , so cruel , and so cowardly to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 11039 len. 22]: Still Mr Pecksniff led her calmly on , and looked as mild as any lamb that ever pastured in the fields .
Parsing [sent. 11040 len. 9]: ` Will nothing move you , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11041 len. 3]: cried Mary .
Parsing [sent. 11042 len. 32]: ` My dear , ' observed Mr Pecksniff , with a placid leer , ' a habit of self-examination , and the practice of -- shall I say of virtue ? '
Parsing [sent. 11043 len. 8]: ` Of hypocrisy , ' said Mary .
Parsing [sent. 11044 len. 39]: ` No , no , ' resumed Mr Pecksniff , chafing the captive hand reproachfully , ` of virtue -- have enabled me to set such guards upon myself , that it is really difficult to ruffle me .
Parsing [sent. 11045 len. 22]: It is a curious fact , but it is difficult , do you know , for any one to ruffle me .
Parsing [sent. 11046 len. 22]: And did she think , ' said Mr Pecksniff , with a playful tightening of his grasp ` that SHE could !
Parsing [sent. 11047 len. 9]: How little did she know his heart ! '
Parsing [sent. 11048 len. 4]: Little , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 11049 len. 39]: Her mind was so strangely constituted that she would have preferred the caresses of a toad , an adder , or a serpent -- nay , the hug of a bear -- to the endearments of Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 11050 len. 30]: ` Come , come , ' said that good gentleman , ' a word or two will set this matter right , and establish a pleasant understanding between us .
Parsing [sent. 11051 len. 9]: I am not angry , my love . '
Parsing [sent. 11052 len. 5]: ` YOU angry ! '
Parsing [sent. 11053 len. 13]: ` No , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ' I am not .
Parsing [sent. 11054 len. 4]: I say so .
Parsing [sent. 11055 len. 5]: Neither are you . '
Parsing [sent. 11056 len. 15]: There was a beating heart beneath his hand that told another story though . '
Parsing [sent. 11057 len. 20]: I am sure you are not , ' said Mr Pecksniff : ` and I will tell you why .
Parsing [sent. 11058 len. 25]: There are two Martin Chuzzlewits , my dear ; and your carrying your anger to one might have a serious effect -- who knows !
Parsing [sent. 11059 len. 5]: -- upon the other .
Parsing [sent. 11060 len. 12]: You would n't wish to hurt him , would you ? '
Parsing [sent. 11061 len. 20]: She trembled violently , and looked at him with such a proud disdain that he turned his eyes away .
Parsing [sent. 11062 len. 17]: No doubt lest he should be offended with her in spite of his better self . '
Parsing [sent. 11063 len. 23]: A passive quarrel , my love , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` may be changed into an active one , remember .
Parsing [sent. 11064 len. 24]: It would be sad to blight even a disinherited young man in his already blighted prospects ; but how easy to do it .
Parsing [sent. 11065 len. 5]: Ah , how easy !
Parsing [sent. 11066 len. 12]: HAVE I influence with our venerable friend , do you think ?
Parsing [sent. 11067 len. 6]: Well , perhaps I have .
Parsing [sent. 11068 len. 5]: Perhaps I have . '
Parsing [sent. 11069 len. 18]: He raised his eyes to hers ; and nodded with an air of banter that was charming .
Parsing [sent. 11070 len. 9]: ` No , ' he continued , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 11071 len. 20]: ` Upon the whole , my sweet , if I were you I 'd keep my secret to myself .
Parsing [sent. 11072 len. 52]: I am not at all sure -- very far from it -- that it would surprise our friend in any way , for he and I have had some conversation together only this morning , and he is anxious , very anxious , to establish you in some more settled manner .
Parsing [sent. 11073 len. 20]: But whether he was surprised or not surprised , the consequence of your imparting it might be the same .
Parsing [sent. 11074 len. 6]: Martin junior might suffer severely .
Parsing [sent. 11075 len. 13]: I 'd have compassion on Martin junior , do you know ? '
Parsing [sent. 11076 len. 9]: said Mr Pecksniff , with a persuasive smile .
Parsing [sent. 11077 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 11078 len. 11]: He do n't deserve it , but I would . '
Parsing [sent. 11079 len. 30]: She wept so bitterly now , and was so much distressed , that he thought it prudent to unclasp her waist , and hold her only by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 11080 len. 39]: ` As to our own share in the precious little mystery , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` we will keep it to ourselves , and talk of it between ourselves , and you shall think it over .
Parsing [sent. 11081 len. 14]: You will consent , my love ; you will consent , I know .
Parsing [sent. 11082 len. 8]: Whatever you may think ; you will .
Parsing [sent. 11083 len. 48]: I seem to remember to have heard -- I really do n't know where , or how ' -- he added , with bewitching frankness , ` that you and Martin junior , when you were children , had a sort of childish fondness for each other .
Parsing [sent. 11084 len. 49]: When we are married , you shall have the satisfaction of thinking that it did n't last to ruin him , but passed away to do him good ; for we 'll see then what we can do to put some trifling help in Martin junior 's way .
Parsing [sent. 11085 len. 9]: HAVE I any influence with our venerable friend ?
Parsing [sent. 11086 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 11087 len. 4]: Perhaps I have .
Parsing [sent. 11088 len. 5]: Perhaps I have . '
Parsing [sent. 11089 len. 20]: The outlet from the wood in which these tender passages occurred , was close to Mr Pecksniff 's house .
Parsing [sent. 11090 len. 34]: They were now so near it that he stopped , and holding up her little finger , said in playful accents , as a parting fancy : ` Shall I bite it ? '
Parsing [sent. 11091 len. 66]: Receiving no reply he kissed it instead ; and then stooping down , inclined his flabby face to hers -- he had a flabby face , although he WAS a good man -- and with a blessing , which from such a source was quite enough to set her up in life , and prosper her from that time forth permitted her to leave him .
Parsing [sent. 11092 len. 23]: Gallantry in its true sense is supposed to ennoble and dignify a man ; and love has shed refinements on innumerable Cymons .
Parsing [sent. 11093 len. 33]: But Mr Pecksniff -- perhaps because to one of his exalted nature these were mere grossnesses -- certainly did not appear to any unusual advantage , now that he was left alone .
Parsing [sent. 11094 len. 34]: On the contrary , he seemed to be shrunk and reduced ; to be trying to hide himself within himself ; and to be wretched at not having the power to do it .
Parsing [sent. 11095 len. 38]: His shoes looked too large ; his sleeve looked too long ; his hair looked too limp ; his features looked too mean ; his exposed throat looked as if a halter would have done it good .
Parsing [sent. 11096 len. 32]: For a minute or two , in fact , he was hot , and pale , and mean , and shy , and slinking , and consequently not at all Pecksniffian .
Parsing [sent. 11097 len. 30]: But after that , he recovered himself , and went home with as beneficent an air as if he had been the High Priest of the summer weather . '
Parsing [sent. 11098 len. 16]: I have arranged to go , Papa , ' said Charity , ` to-morrow . '
Parsing [sent. 11099 len. 9]: ` So soon , my child ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 11100 len. 16]: I ca n't go too soon , ' said Charity , ` under the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 11101 len. 26]: I have written to Mrs Todgers to propose an arrangement , and have requested her to meet me at the coach , at all events .
Parsing [sent. 11102 len. 13]: You 'll be quite your own master now , Mr Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 11103 len. 18]: Mr Pecksniff had just gone out of the room , and Tom had just come into it .
Parsing [sent. 11104 len. 6]: ` My own master ! '
Parsing [sent. 11105 len. 3]: repeated Tom .
Parsing [sent. 11106 len. 16]: ` Yes , you 'll have nobody to interfere with you , ' said Charity .
Parsing [sent. 11107 len. 9]: ` At least I hope you wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 11108 len. 2]: Hem !
Parsing [sent. 11109 len. 7]: It 's a changing world . '
Parsing [sent. 11110 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 11111 len. 11]: are YOU going to be married , Miss Pecksniff ? '
Parsing [sent. 11112 len. 6]: asked Tom in great surprise .
Parsing [sent. 11113 len. 9]: ` Not exactly , ' faltered Cherry . '
Parsing [sent. 11114 len. 10]: I have n't made up my mind to be .
Parsing [sent. 11115 len. 14]: I believe I could be , if I chose , Mr Pinch . '
Parsing [sent. 11116 len. 7]: ` Of course you could ! '
Parsing [sent. 11117 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 11118 len. 9]: And he said it in perfect good faith .
Parsing [sent. 11119 len. 10]: He believed it from the bottom of his heart .
Parsing [sent. 11120 len. 16]: ` No , ' said Cherry , ' I am not going to be married .
Parsing [sent. 11121 len. 8]: Nobody is , that I know of .
Parsing [sent. 11122 len. 2]: Hem !
Parsing [sent. 11123 len. 10]: But I am not going to live with Papa .
Parsing [sent. 11124 len. 12]: I have my reasons , but it 's all a secret .
Parsing [sent. 11125 len. 21]: I shall always feel very kindly towards you , I assure you , for the boldness you showed that night .
Parsing [sent. 11126 len. 17]: As to you and me , Mr Pinch , WE part the best friends possible ! '
Parsing [sent. 11127 len. 25]: Tom thanked her for her confidence , and for her friendship , but there was a mystery in the former which perfectly bewildered him .
Parsing [sent. 11128 len. 44]: In his extravagant devotion to the family , he had felt the loss of Merry more than any one but those who knew that for all the slights he underwent he thought his own demerits were to blame , could possibly have understood .
Parsing [sent. 11129 len. 16]: He had scarcely reconciled himself to that when here was Charity about to leave them .
Parsing [sent. 11130 len. 14]: She had grown up , as it were , under Tom 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 11131 len. 26]: The sisters were a part of Pecksniff , and a part of Tom ; items in Pecksniff 's goodness , and in Tom 's service .
Parsing [sent. 11132 len. 26]: He could n't bear it ; not two hours ' sleep had Tom that night , through dwelling in his bed upon these dreadful changes .
Parsing [sent. 11133 len. 45]: When morning dawned he thought he must have dreamed this piece of ambiguity ; but no , on going downstairs he found them packing trunks and cording boxes , and making other preparations for Miss Charity 's departure , which lasted all day long .
Parsing [sent. 11134 len. 62]: In good time for the evening coach , Miss Charity deposited her housekeeping keys with much ceremony upon the parlour table ; took a gracious leave of all the house ; and quitted her paternal roof -- a blessing for which the Pecksniffian servant was observed by some profane persons to be particularly active in the thanksgiving at church next Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 11135 len. 56]: CHAPTER THIRTY -- ONE MR PINCH IS DISCHARGED OF A DUTY WHICH HE NEVER OWED TO ANYBODY , AND MR PECKSNIFF DISCHARGES A DUTY WHICH HE OWES TO SOCIETY The closing words of the last chapter lead naturally to the commencement of this , its successor ; for it has to do with a church .
Parsing [sent. 11136 len. 19]: With the church , so often mentioned heretofore , in which Tom Pinch played the organ for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 11137 len. 34]: One sultry afternoon , about a week after Miss Charity 's departure for London , Mr Pecksniff being out walking by himself , took it into his head to stray into the churchyard .
Parsing [sent. 11138 len. 48]: As he was lingering among the tombstones , endeavouring to extract an available sentiment or two from the epitaphs -- for he never lost an opportunity of making up a few moral crackers , to be let off as occasion served -- Tom Pinch began to practice .
Parsing [sent. 11139 len. 47]: Tom could run down to the church and do so whenever he had time to spare ; for it was a simple little organ , provided with wind by the action of the musician 's feet ; and he was independent , even of a bellows-blower .
Parsing [sent. 11140 len. 47]: Though if Tom had wanted one at any time , there was not a man or boy in all the village , and away to the turnpike -LRB- tollman included -RRB- , but would have blown away for him till he was black in the face .
Parsing [sent. 11141 len. 12]: Mr Pecksniff had no objection to music ; not the least .
Parsing [sent. 11142 len. 11]: He was tolerant of everything ; he often said so .
Parsing [sent. 11143 len. 19]: He considered it a vagabond kind of trifling , in general , just suited to Tom 's capacity .
Parsing [sent. 11144 len. 50]: But in regard to Tom 's performance upon this same organ , he was remarkably lenient , singularly amiable ; for when Tom played it on Sundays , Mr Pecksniff in his unbounded sympathy felt as if he played it himself , and were a benefactor to the congregation .
Parsing [sent. 11145 len. 32]: So whenever it was impossible to devise any other means of taking the value of Tom 's wages out of him , Mr Pecksniff gave him leave to cultivate this instrument .
Parsing [sent. 11146 len. 11]: For which mark of his consideration Tom was very grateful .
Parsing [sent. 11147 len. 16]: The afternoon was remarkably warm , and Mr Pecksniff had been strolling a long way .
Parsing [sent. 11148 len. 43]: He had not what may be called a fine ear for music , but he knew when it had a tranquilizing influence on his soul ; and that was the case now , for it sounded to him like a melodious snore .
Parsing [sent. 11149 len. 38]: He approached the church , and looking through the diamond lattice of a window near the porch , saw Tom , with the curtains in the loft drawn back , playing away with great expression and tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 11150 len. 9]: The church had an inviting air of coolness .
Parsing [sent. 11151 len. 28]: The old oak roof supported by cross-beams , the hoary walls , the marble tablets , and the cracked stone pavement , were refreshing to look at .
Parsing [sent. 11152 len. 31]: There were leaves of ivy tapping gently at the opposite windows ; and the sun poured in through only one ; leaving the body of the church in tempting shade .
Parsing [sent. 11153 len. 38]: But the most tempting spot of all , was one red-curtained and soft-cushioned pew , wherein the official dignitaries of the place -LRB- of whom Mr Pecksniff was the head and chief -RRB- enshrined themselves on Sundays .
Parsing [sent. 11154 len. 36]: Mr Pecksniff 's seat was in the corner ; a remarkably comfortable corner ; where his very large Prayer -- Book was at that minute making the most of its quarto self upon the desk .
Parsing [sent. 11155 len. 8]: He determined to go in and rest .
Parsing [sent. 11156 len. 44]: He entered very softly ; in part because it was a church ; in part because his tread was always soft ; in part because Tom played a solemn tune ; in part because he thought he would surprise him when he stopped .
Parsing [sent. 11157 len. 44]: Unbolting the door of the high pew of state , he glided in and shut it after him ; then sitting in his usual place , and stretching out his legs upon the hassocks , he composed himself to listen to the music .
Parsing [sent. 11158 len. 33]: It is an unaccountable circumstance that he should have felt drowsy there , where the force of association might surely have been enough to keep him wide awake ; but he did .
Parsing [sent. 11159 len. 17]: He had not been in the snug little corner five minutes before he began to nod .
Parsing [sent. 11160 len. 14]: He had not recovered himself one minute before he began to nod again .
Parsing [sent. 11161 len. 14]: In the very act of opening his eyes indolently , he nodded again .
Parsing [sent. 11162 len. 12]: In the very act of shutting them , he nodded again .
Parsing [sent. 11163 len. 28]: So he fell out of one nod into another until at last he ceased to nod at all , and was as fast as the church itself .
Parsing [sent. 11164 len. 37]: He had a consciousness of the organ , long after he fell asleep , though as to its being an organ he had no more idea of that than he had of its being a bull .
Parsing [sent. 11165 len. 30]: After a while he began to have at intervals the same dreamy impressions of voices ; and awakening to an indolent curiosity upon the subject , opened his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 11166 len. 54]: He was so indolent , that after glancing at the hassocks and the pew , he was already half-way off to sleep again , when it occurred to him that there really were voices in the church ; low voices , talking earnestly hard by ; while the echoes seemed to mutter responses .
Parsing [sent. 11167 len. 7]: He roused himself , and listened .
Parsing [sent. 11168 len. 24]: Before he had listened half a dozen seconds , he became as broad awake as ever he had been in all his life .
Parsing [sent. 11169 len. 34]: With eyes , and ears , and mouth , wide open , he moved himself a very little with the utmost caution , and gathering the curtain in his hand , peeped out .
Parsing [sent. 11170 len. 5]: Tom Pinch and Mary .
Parsing [sent. 11171 len. 3]: Of course .
Parsing [sent. 11172 len. 14]: He had recognized their voices , and already knew the topic they discussed .
Parsing [sent. 11173 len. 42]: Looking like the small end of a guillotined man , with his chin on a level with the top of the pew , so that he might duck down immediately in case of either of them turning round , he listened .
Parsing [sent. 11174 len. 19]: Listened with such concentrated eagerness , that his very hair and shirt-collar stood bristling up to help him .
Parsing [sent. 11175 len. 7]: ` No , ' cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 11176 len. 15]: ` No letters have ever reached me , except that one from New York .
Parsing [sent. 11177 len. 32]: But do n't be uneasy on that account , for it 's very likely they have gone away to some far-off place , where the posts are neither regular nor frequent .
Parsing [sent. 11178 len. 29]: He said in that very letter that it might be so , even in that city to which they thought of travelling -- Eden , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 11179 len. 14]: ` It is a great weight upon my mind , ' said Mary .
Parsing [sent. 11180 len. 15]: ` Oh , but you must n't let it be , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 11181 len. 38]: ` There 's a true saying that nothing travels so fast as ill news ; and if the slightest harm had happened to Martin , you may be sure you would have heard of it long ago .
Parsing [sent. 11182 len. 34]: I have often wished to say this to you , ' Tom continued with an embarrassment that became him very well , ` but you have never given me an opportunity . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11183 len. 27]: I have sometimes been almost afraid , ' said Mary , ` that you might suppose I hesitated to confide in you , Mr Pinch . '
Parsing [sent. 11184 len. 20]: ` No , ' Tom stammered , ` I -- I am not aware that I ever supposed that .
Parsing [sent. 11185 len. 21]: I am sure that if I have , I have checked the thought directly , as an injustice to you .
Parsing [sent. 11186 len. 41]: I feel the delicacy of your situation in having to confide in me at all , ' said Tom , ` but I would risk my life to save you from one day 's uneasiness ; indeed I would ! '
Parsing [sent. 11187 len. 4]: Poor Tom ! '
Parsing [sent. 11188 len. 32]: I have dreaded sometimes , ' Tom continued , ` that I might have displeased you by -- by having the boldness to try and anticipate your wishes now and then .
Parsing [sent. 11189 len. 18]: At other times I have fancied that your kindness prompted you to keep aloof from me . '
Parsing [sent. 11190 len. 4]: ` Indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 11191 len. 58]: ` It was very foolish ; very presumptuous and ridiculous , to think so , ' Tom pursued ; ` but I feared you might suppose it possible that I -- I -- should admire you too much for my own peace ; and so denied yourself the slight assistance you would otherwise have accepted from me .
Parsing [sent. 11192 len. 20]: If such an idea has ever presented itself to you , ' faltered Tom , ` pray dismiss it .
Parsing [sent. 11193 len. 21]: I am easily made happy ; and I shall live contented here long after you and Martin have forgotten me .
Parsing [sent. 11194 len. 40]: I am a poor , shy , awkward creature ; not at all a man of the world ; and you should think no more of me , bless you , than if I were an old friar ! '
Parsing [sent. 11195 len. 26]: If friars bear such hearts as thine , Tom , let friars multiply ; though they have no such rule in all their stern arithmetic .
Parsing [sent. 11196 len. 6]: ` Dear Mr Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 11197 len. 20]: said Mary , giving him her hand ; ' I can not tell you how your kindness moves me .
Parsing [sent. 11198 len. 34]: I have never wronged you by the lightest doubt , and have never for an instant ceased to feel that you were all -- much more than all -- that Martin found you .
Parsing [sent. 11199 len. 20]: Without the silent care and friendship I have experienced from you , my life here would have been unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 11200 len. 24]: But you have been a good angel to me ; filling me with gratitude of heart , hope , and courage . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11201 len. 43]: I am as little like an angel , I am afraid , ' replied Tom , shaking his head , ` as any stone cherubim among the grave-stones ; and I do n't think there are many real angels of THAT pattern .
Parsing [sent. 11202 len. 24]: But I should like to know -LRB- if you will tell me -RRB- why you have been so very silent about Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 11203 len. 17]: ` Because I have been afraid , ' said Mary , ` of injuring you . '
Parsing [sent. 11204 len. 6]: ` Of injuring me ! '
Parsing [sent. 11205 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 11206 len. 11]: ` Of doing you an injury with your employer . '
Parsing [sent. 11207 len. 6]: The gentleman in question dived .
Parsing [sent. 11208 len. 5]: ` With Pecksniff ! '
Parsing [sent. 11209 len. 7]: rejoined Tom , with cheerful confidence .
Parsing [sent. 11210 len. 11]: ` Oh dear , he 'd never think of us !
Parsing [sent. 11211 len. 7]: He 's the best of men .
Parsing [sent. 11212 len. 13]: The more at ease you were , the happier he would be .
Parsing [sent. 11213 len. 11]: Oh dear , you need n't be afraid of Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 11214 len. 7]: He is not a spy . '
Parsing [sent. 11215 len. 45]: Many a man in Mr Pecksniff 's place , if he could have dived through the floor of the pew of state and come out at Calcutta or any inhabited region on the other side of the earth , would have done it instantly .
Parsing [sent. 11216 len. 17]: Mr Pecksniff sat down upon a hassock , and listening more attentively than ever , smiled .
Parsing [sent. 11217 len. 60]: Mary seemed to have expressed some dissent in the meanwhile , for Tom went on to say , with honest energy : ` Well , I do n't know how it is , but it always happens , whenever I express myself in this way to anybody almost , that I find they wo n't do justice to Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 11218 len. 20]: It is one of the most extraordinary circumstances that ever came within my knowledge , but it is so .
Parsing [sent. 11219 len. 45]: There 's John Westlock , who used to be a pupil here , one of the best-hearted young men in the world , in all other matters -- I really believe John would have Pecksniff flogged at the cart 's tail if he could .
Parsing [sent. 11220 len. 28]: And John is not a solitary case , for every pupil we have had in my time has gone away with the same inveterate hatred of him .
Parsing [sent. 11221 len. 36]: There was Mark Tapley , too , quite in another station of life , ' said Tom ; ` the mockery he used to make of Pecksniff when he was at the Dragon was shocking .
Parsing [sent. 11222 len. 11]: Martin too : Martin was worse than any of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 11223 len. 4]: But I forgot .
Parsing [sent. 11224 len. 10]: He prepared you to dislike Pecksniff , of course .
Parsing [sent. 11225 len. 21]: So you came with a prejudice , you know , Miss Graham , and are not a fair witness . '
Parsing [sent. 11226 len. 16]: Tom triumphed very much in this discovery , and rubbed his hands with great satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 11227 len. 14]: ` Mr Pinch , ' said Mary , ` you mistake him . '
Parsing [sent. 11228 len. 6]: ` No , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 11229 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 11230 len. 5]: ` YOU mistake him .
Parsing [sent. 11231 len. 20]: But , ' he added , with a rapid change in his tone , ` what is the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 11232 len. 9]: Miss Graham , what is the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 11233 len. 27]: Mr Pecksniff brought up to the top of the pew , by slow degrees , his hair , his forehead , his eyebrow , his eye .
Parsing [sent. 11234 len. 23]: She was sitting on a bench beside the door with her hands before her face ; and Tom was bending over her .
Parsing [sent. 11235 len. 7]: ` What is the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 11236 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 11237 len. 9]: ` Have I said anything to hurt you ?
Parsing [sent. 11238 len. 9]: Has any one said anything to hurt you ?
Parsing [sent. 11239 len. 4]: Do n't cry .
Parsing [sent. 11240 len. 7]: Pray tell me what it is .
Parsing [sent. 11241 len. 10]: I can not bear to see you so distressed .
Parsing [sent. 11242 len. 17]: Mercy on us , I never was so surprised and grieved in all my life ! '
Parsing [sent. 11243 len. 10]: Mr Pecksniff kept his eye in the same place .
Parsing [sent. 11244 len. 18]: He could have moved it now for nothing short of a gimlet or a red-hot wire . '
Parsing [sent. 11245 len. 70]: I would n't have told you , Mr Pinch , ' said Mary , ` if I could have helped it ; but your delusion is so absorbing , and it is so necessary that we should be upon our guard ; that you should not be compromised ; and to that end that you should know by whom I am beset ; that no alternative is left me .
Parsing [sent. 11246 len. 34]: I came here purposely to tell you , but I think I should have wanted courage if you had not chanced to lead me so directly to the object of my coming . '
Parsing [sent. 11247 len. 16]: Tom gazed at her steadfastly , and seemed to say , ` What else ? '
Parsing [sent. 11248 len. 7]: But he said not a word .
Parsing [sent. 11249 len. 28]: ` That person whom you think the best of men , ' said Mary , looking up , and speaking with a quivering lip and flashing eye .
Parsing [sent. 11250 len. 6]: ` Lord bless me ! '
Parsing [sent. 11251 len. 6]: muttered Tom , staggering back .
Parsing [sent. 11252 len. 5]: ` Wait a moment .
Parsing [sent. 11253 len. 10]: That person whom I think the best of men !
Parsing [sent. 11254 len. 7]: You mean Pecksniff , of course .
Parsing [sent. 11255 len. 8]: Yes , I see you mean Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 11256 len. 10]: Good gracious me , do n't speak without authority .
Parsing [sent. 11257 len. 5]: What has he done ?
Parsing [sent. 11258 len. 14]: If he is not the best of men , what is he ? '
Parsing [sent. 11259 len. 4]: ` The worst .
Parsing [sent. 11260 len. 26]: The falsest , craftiest , meanest , cruellest , most sordid , most shameless , ' said the trembling girl -- trembling with her indignation .
Parsing [sent. 11261 len. 12]: Tom sat down on a seat , and clasped his hands .
Parsing [sent. 11262 len. 67]: ` What is he , ' said Mary , ` who receiving me in his house as his guest ; his unwilling guest ; knowing my history , and how defenceless and alone I am , presumes before his daughters to affront me so , that if I had a brother but a child , who saw it , he would instinctively have helped me ? '
Parsing [sent. 11263 len. 7]: ` He is a scoundrel ! '
Parsing [sent. 11264 len. 3]: exclaimed Tom .
Parsing [sent. 11265 len. 12]: ` Whoever he may be , he is a scoundrel . '
Parsing [sent. 11266 len. 5]: Mr Pecksniff dived again .
Parsing [sent. 11267 len. 52]: ` What is he , ' said Mary , ` who , when my only friend -- a dear and kind one , too -- was in full health of mind , humbled himself before him , but was spurned away -LRB- for he knew him then -RRB- like a dog .
Parsing [sent. 11268 len. 54]: Who , in his forgiving spirit , now that that friend is sunk into a failing state , can crawl about him again , and use the influence he basely gains for every base and wicked purpose , and not for one -- not one -- that 's true or good ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 11269 len. 8]: I say he is a scoundrel ! '
Parsing [sent. 11270 len. 3]: answered Tom .
Parsing [sent. 11271 len. 78]: ` But what is he -- oh , Mr Pinch , what IS he -- who , thinking he could compass these designs the better if I were his wife , assails me with the coward 's argument that if I marry him , Martin , on whom I have brought so much misfortune , shall be restored to something of his former hopes ; and if I do not , shall be plunged in deeper ruin ?
Parsing [sent. 11272 len. 46]: What is he who makes my very constancy to one I love with all my heart a torture to myself and wrong to him ; who makes me , do what I will , the instrument to hurt a head I would heap blessings on !
Parsing [sent. 11273 len. 87]: What is he who , winding all these cruel snares about me , explains their purpose to me , with a smooth tongue and a smiling face , in the broad light of day ; dragging me on , the while , in his embrace , and holding to his lips a hand , ' pursued the agitated girl , extending it , ` which I would have struck off , if with it I could lose the shame and degradation of his touch ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 11274 len. 20]: I say , ' cried Tom , in great excitement , ` he is a scoundrel and a villain !
Parsing [sent. 11275 len. 20]: I do n't care who he is , I say he is a double-dyed and most intolerable villain ! '
Parsing [sent. 11276 len. 36]: Covering her face with her hands again , as if the passion which had sustained her through these disclosures lost itself in an overwhelming sense of shame and grief , she abandoned herself to tears .
Parsing [sent. 11277 len. 17]: Any sight of distress was sure to move the tenderness of Tom , but this especially .
Parsing [sent. 11278 len. 11]: Tears and sobs from her were arrows in his heart .
Parsing [sent. 11279 len. 30]: He tried to comfort her ; sat down beside her ; expended all his store of homely eloquence ; and spoke in words of praise and hope of Martin .
Parsing [sent. 11280 len. 28]: Aye , though he loved her from his soul with such a self-denying love as woman seldom wins ; he spoke from first to last of Martin .
Parsing [sent. 11281 len. 21]: Not the wealth of the rich Indies would have tempted Tom to shirk one mention of her lover 's name .
Parsing [sent. 11282 len. 110]: When she was more composed , she impressed upon Tom that this man she had described , was Pecksniff in his real colours ; and word by word and phrase by phrase , as well as she remembered it , related what had passed between them in the wood : which was no doubt a source of high gratification to that gentleman himself , who in his desire to see and his dread of being seen , was constantly diving down into the state pew , and coming up again like the intelligent householder in Punch 's Show , who avoids being knocked on the head with a cudgel .
Parsing [sent. 11283 len. 54]: When she had concluded her account , and had besought Tom to be very distant and unconscious in his manner towards her after this explanation , and had thanked him very much , they parted on the alarm of footsteps in the burial-ground ; and Tom was left alone in the church again .
Parsing [sent. 11284 len. 16]: And now the full agitation and misery of the disclosure came rushing upon Tom indeed .
Parsing [sent. 11285 len. 18]: The star of his whole life from boyhood had become , in a moment , putrid vapour .
Parsing [sent. 11286 len. 22]: It was not that Pecksniff , Tom 's Pecksniff , had ceased to exist , but that he never had existed .
Parsing [sent. 11287 len. 33]: In his death Tom would have had the comfort of remembering what he used to be , but in this discovery , he had the anguish of recollecting what he never was .
Parsing [sent. 11288 len. 22]: For , as Tom 's blindness in this matter had been total and not partial , so was his restored sight .
Parsing [sent. 11289 len. 52]: HIS Pecksniff could never have worked the wickedness of which he had just now heard , but any other Pecksniff could ; and the Pecksniff who could do that could do anything , and no doubt had been doing anything and everything except the right thing , all through his career .
Parsing [sent. 11290 len. 41]: From the lofty height on which poor Tom had placed his idol it was tumbled down headlong , and Not all the king 's horses , nor all the king 's men , Could have set Mr Pecksniff up again .
Parsing [sent. 11291 len. 18]: Legions of Titans could n't have got him out of the mud ; and serve him right !
Parsing [sent. 11292 len. 12]: But it was not he who suffered ; it was Tom .
Parsing [sent. 11293 len. 32]: His compass was broken , his chart destroyed , his chronometer had stopped , his masts were gone by the board ; his anchor was adrift , ten thousand leagues away .
Parsing [sent. 11294 len. 29]: Mr Pecksniff watched him with a lively interest , for he divined the purpose of Tom 's ruminations , and was curious to see how he conducted himself .
Parsing [sent. 11295 len. 94]: For some time , Tom wandered up and down the aisle like a man demented , stopping occasionally to lean against a pew and think it over ; then he stood staring at a blank old monument bordered tastefully with skulls and cross-bones , as if it were the finest work of Art he had ever seen , although at other times he held it in unspeakable contempt ; then he sat down ; then walked to and fro again ; then went wandering up into the organ-loft , and touched the keys .
Parsing [sent. 11296 len. 32]: But their minstrelsy was changed , their music gone ; and sounding one long melancholy chord , Tom drooped his head upon his hands and gave it up as hopeless . '
Parsing [sent. 11297 len. 72]: I would n't have cared , ' said Tom Pinch , rising from his stool and looking down into the church as if he had been the Clergyman , ' I would n't have cared for anything he might have done to Me , for I have tried his patience often , and have lived upon his sufferance and have never been the help to him that others could have been .
Parsing [sent. 11298 len. 53]: I would n't have minded , Pecksniff , ' Tom continued , little thinking who heard him , ` if you had done Me any wrong ; I could have found plenty of excuses for that ; and though you might have hurt me , could have still gone on respecting you .
Parsing [sent. 11299 len. 14]: But why did you ever fall so low as this in my esteem !
Parsing [sent. 11300 len. 28]: Oh Pecksniff , Pecksniff , there is nothing I would not have given , to have had you deserve my old opinion of you ; nothing ! '
Parsing [sent. 11301 len. 23]: Mr Pecksniff sat upon the hassock pulling up his shirt-collar , while Tom , touched to the quick , delivered this apostrophe .
Parsing [sent. 11302 len. 38]: After a pause he heard Tom coming down the stairs , jingling the church keys ; and bringing his eye to the top of the pew again , saw him go slowly out and lock the door .
Parsing [sent. 11303 len. 49]: Mr Pecksniff durst not issue from his place of concealment ; for through the windows of the church he saw Tom passing on among the graves , and sometimes stopping at a stone , and leaning there as if he were a mourner who had lost a friend .
Parsing [sent. 11304 len. 34]: Even when he had left the churchyard , Mr Pecksniff still remained shut up ; not being at all secure but that in his restless state of mind Tom might come wandering back .
Parsing [sent. 11305 len. 38]: At length he issued forth , and walked with a pleasant countenance into the vestry ; where he knew there was a window near the ground , by which he could release himself by merely stepping out .
Parsing [sent. 11306 len. 55]: He was in a curious frame of mind , Mr Pecksniff ; being in no hurry to go , but rather inclining to a dilatory trifling with the time , which prompted him to open the vestry cupboard , and look at himself in the parson 's little glass that hung within the door .
Parsing [sent. 11307 len. 20]: Seeing that his hair was rumpled , he took the liberty of borrowing the canonical brush and arranging it .
Parsing [sent. 11308 len. 53]: He also took the liberty of opening another cupboard ; but he shut it up again quickly , being rather startled by the sight of a black and a white surplice dangling against the wall ; which had very much the appearance of two curates who had committed suicide by hanging themselves .
Parsing [sent. 11309 len. 51]: Remembering that he had seen in the first cupboard a port-wine bottle and some biscuits , he peeped into it again , and helped himself with much deliberation ; cogitating all the time though , in a very deep and weighty manner , as if his thoughts were otherwise employed .
Parsing [sent. 11310 len. 27]: He soon made up his mind , if it had ever been in doubt ; and putting back the bottle and biscuits , opened the casement .
Parsing [sent. 11311 len. 21]: He got out into the churchyard without any difficulty ; shut the window after him ; and walked straight home .
Parsing [sent. 11312 len. 7]: ` Is Mr Pinch indoors ? '
Parsing [sent. 11313 len. 7]: asked Mr Pecksniff of his serving-maid .
Parsing [sent. 11314 len. 8]: ` Just come in , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 11315 len. 8]: ` Just come in , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 11316 len. 6]: repeated Mr Pecksniff , cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 11317 len. 9]: ` And gone upstairs , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 11318 len. 4]: ` Yes sir .
Parsing [sent. 11319 len. 3]: Gone upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 11320 len. 8]: Shall I call him , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11321 len. 11]: ` No , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` no .
Parsing [sent. 11322 len. 8]: You need n't call him , Jane .
Parsing [sent. 11323 len. 5]: Thank you , Jane .
Parsing [sent. 11324 len. 8]: How are your relations , Jane ? '
Parsing [sent. 11325 len. 12]: ` Pretty well , I thank you , sir . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11326 len. 7]: I am glad to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 11327 len. 10]: Let them know I asked about them , Jane .
Parsing [sent. 11328 len. 10]: Is Mr Chuzzlewit in the way , Jane ? '
Parsing [sent. 11329 len. 5]: ` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 11330 len. 9]: He 's in the parlour , reading . '
Parsing [sent. 11331 len. 15]: ` He 's in the parlour , reading , is he , Jane ? '
Parsing [sent. 11332 len. 4]: said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 11333 len. 4]: ` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 11334 len. 13]: Then I think I 'll go and see him , Jane . '
Parsing [sent. 11335 len. 12]: Never had Mr Pecksniff been beheld in a more pleasant humour !
Parsing [sent. 11336 len. 53]: But when he walked into the parlour where the old man was engaged as Jane had said ; with pen and ink and paper on a table close at hand -LRB- for Mr Pecksniff was always very particular to have him well supplied with writing materials -RRB- , he became less cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 11337 len. 30]: He was not angry , he was not vindictive , he was not cross , he was not moody , but he was grieved ; he was sorely grieved .
Parsing [sent. 11338 len. 45]: As he sat down by the old man 's side , two tears -- not tears like those with which recording angels blot their entries out , but drops so precious that they use them for their ink -- stole down his meritorious cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 11339 len. 7]: ` What is the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 11340 len. 4]: asked old Martin .
Parsing [sent. 11341 len. 11]: ` Pecksniff , what ails you , man ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 11342 len. 21]: I am sorry to interrupt you , my dear sir , and I am still more sorry for the cause .
Parsing [sent. 11343 len. 12]: My good , my worthy friend , I am deceived . '
Parsing [sent. 11344 len. 6]: ` You are deceived ! '
Parsing [sent. 11345 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 11346 len. 15]: cried Mr Pecksniff , in an agony , ` deceived in the tenderest point .
Parsing [sent. 11347 len. 17]: Cruelly deceived in that quarter , sir , in which I placed the most unbounded confidence .
Parsing [sent. 11348 len. 10]: Deceived , Mr Chuzzlewit , by Thomas Pinch . '
Parsing [sent. 11349 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 11350 len. 7]: bad , bad , bad ! '
Parsing [sent. 11351 len. 8]: said Martin , laying down his book .
Parsing [sent. 11352 len. 4]: ` Very bad !
Parsing [sent. 11353 len. 4]: I hope not .
Parsing [sent. 11354 len. 5]: Are you certain ? '
Parsing [sent. 11355 len. 7]: ` Certain , my good sir !
Parsing [sent. 11356 len. 7]: My eyes and ears are witnesses .
Parsing [sent. 11357 len. 8]: I would n't have believed it otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 11358 len. 24]: I would n't have believed it , Mr Chuzzlewit , if a Fiery Serpent had proclaimed it from the top of Salisbury Cathedral .
Parsing [sent. 11359 len. 16]: I would have said , ' cried Mr Pecksniff , ` that the Serpent lied .
Parsing [sent. 11360 len. 31]: Such was my faith in Thomas Pinch , that I would have cast the falsehood back into the Serpent 's teeth , and would have taken Thomas to my heart .
Parsing [sent. 11361 len. 26]: But I am not a Serpent , sir , myself , I grieve to say , and no excuse or hope is left me . '
Parsing [sent. 11362 len. 18]: Martin was greatly disturbed to see him so much agitated , and to hear such unexpected news .
Parsing [sent. 11363 len. 20]: He begged him to compose himself , and asked upon what subject Mr Pinch 's treachery had been developed .
Parsing [sent. 11364 len. 16]: ` That is almost the worst of all , sir , ' Mr Pecksniff answered .
Parsing [sent. 11365 len. 8]: ` on a subject nearly concerning YOU .
Parsing [sent. 11366 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 11367 len. 31]: is it not enough , ' said Mr Pecksniff , looking upward , ` that these blows must fall on me , but must they also hit my friends ! '
Parsing [sent. 11368 len. 15]: ` You alarm me , ' cried the old man , changing colour . '
Parsing [sent. 11369 len. 9]: I am not so strong as I was .
Parsing [sent. 11370 len. 7]: You terrify me , Pecksniff ! '
Parsing [sent. 11371 len. 27]: ` Cheer up , my noble sir , ' said Mr Pecksniff , taking courage , ` and we will do what is required of us .
Parsing [sent. 11372 len. 12]: You shall know all , sir , and shall be righted .
Parsing [sent. 11373 len. 10]: But first excuse me , sir , excuse me .
Parsing [sent. 11374 len. 14]: I have a duty to discharge , which I owe to society . '
Parsing [sent. 11375 len. 9]: He rang the bell , and Jane appeared .
Parsing [sent. 11376 len. 13]: ` Send Mr Pinch here , if you please , Jane . '
Parsing [sent. 11377 len. 3]: Tom came .
Parsing [sent. 11378 len. 23]: Constrained and altered in his manner , downcast and dejected , visibly confused ; not liking to look Pecksniff in the face .
Parsing [sent. 11379 len. 19]: The honest man bestowed a glance on Mr Chuzzlewit , as who should say ` You see ! '
Parsing [sent. 11380 len. 20]: and addressed himself to Tom in these terms : ` Mr Pinch , I have left the vestry-window unfastened .
Parsing [sent. 11381 len. 24]: Will you do me the favour to go and secure it ; then bring the keys of the sacred edifice to me ! '
Parsing [sent. 11382 len. 7]: ` The vestry-window , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11383 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 11384 len. 16]: ` You understand me , Mr Pinch , I think , ' returned his patron .
Parsing [sent. 11385 len. 9]: ` Yes , Mr Pinch , the vestry-window .
Parsing [sent. 11386 len. 58]: I grieve to say that sleeping in the church after a fatiguing ramble , I overheard just now some fragments , ' he emphasised that word , ` of a dialogue between two parties ; and one of them locking the church when he went out , I was obliged to leave it myself by the vestry-window .
Parsing [sent. 11387 len. 20]: Do me the favour to secure that vestry-window , Mr Pinch , and then come back to me . '
Parsing [sent. 11388 len. 19]: No physiognomist that ever dwelt on earth could have construed Tom 's face when he heard these words .
Parsing [sent. 11389 len. 30]: Wonder was in it , and a mild look of reproach , but certainly no fear or guilt , although a host of strong emotions struggled to display themselves .
Parsing [sent. 11390 len. 15]: He bowed , and without saying one word , good or bad , withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 11391 len. 18]: ` Pecksniff , ' cried Martin , in a tremble , ` what does all this mean ?
Parsing [sent. 11392 len. 15]: You are not going to do anything in haste , you may regret ! '
Parsing [sent. 11393 len. 17]: ` No , my good sir , ' said Mr Pecksniff , firmly , ` No .
Parsing [sent. 11394 len. 27]: But I have a duty to discharge which I owe to society ; and it shall be discharged , my friend , at any cost ! '
Parsing [sent. 11395 len. 34]: Oh , late-remembered , much-forgotten , mouthing , braggart duty , always owed , and seldom paid in any other coin than punishment and wrath , when will mankind begin to know thee !
Parsing [sent. 11396 len. 30]: When will men acknowledge thee in thy neglected cradle , and thy stunted youth , and not begin their recognition in thy sinful manhood and thy desolate old age !
Parsing [sent. 11397 len. 59]: Oh , ermined Judge whose duty to society is , now , to doom the ragged criminal to punishment and death , hadst thou never , Man , a duty to discharge in barring up the hundred open gates that wooed him to the felon 's dock , and throwing but ajar the portals to a decent life !
Parsing [sent. 11398 len. 69]: Oh , prelate , prelate , whose duty to society it is to mourn in melancholy phrase the sad degeneracy of these bad times in which thy lot of honours has been cast , did nothing go before thy elevation to the lofty seat , from which thou dealest out thy homilies to other tarriers for dead men 's shoes , whose duty to society has not begun !
Parsing [sent. 11399 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 11400 len. 49]: magistrate , so rare a country gentleman and brave a squire , had you no duty to society , before the ricks were blazing and the mob were mad ; or did it spring up , armed and booted from the earth , a corps of yeomanry full-grown !
Parsing [sent. 11401 len. 15]: Mr Pecksniff 's duty to society could not be paid till Tom came back .
Parsing [sent. 11402 len. 38]: The interval which preceded the return of that young man , he occupied in a close conference with his friend ; so that when Tom did arrive , he found the two quite ready to receive him .
Parsing [sent. 11403 len. 35]: Mary was in her own room above , whither Mr Pecksniff , always considerate , had besought old Martin to entreat her to remain some half-hour longer , that her feelings might be spared .
Parsing [sent. 11404 len. 25]: When Tom came back , he found old Martin sitting by the window , and Mr Pecksniff in an imposing attitude at the table .
Parsing [sent. 11405 len. 31]: On one side of him was his pocket-handkerchief ; and on the other a little heap -LRB- a very little heap -RRB- of gold and silver , and odd pence .
Parsing [sent. 11406 len. 18]: Tom saw , at a glance , that it was his own salary for the current quarter .
Parsing [sent. 11407 len. 11]: ` Have you fastened the vestry-window , Mr Pinch ? '
Parsing [sent. 11408 len. 3]: said Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 11409 len. 6]: ` Yes , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 11410 len. 4]: ` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 11411 len. 12]: Put down the keys if you please , Mr Pinch . '
Parsing [sent. 11412 len. 7]: Tom placed them on the table .
Parsing [sent. 11413 len. 31]: He held the bunch by the key of the organ-loft -LRB- though it was one of the smallest -RRB- , and looked hard at it as he laid it down .
Parsing [sent. 11414 len. 24]: It had been an old , old friend of Tom 's ; a kind companion to him , many and many a day .
Parsing [sent. 11415 len. 18]: ` Mr Pinch , ' said Pecksniff , shaking his head ; ` oh , Mr Pinch !
Parsing [sent. 11416 len. 11]: I wonder you can look me in the face ! '
Parsing [sent. 11417 len. 26]: Tom did it though ; and notwithstanding that he has been described as stooping generally , he stood as upright then as man could stand .
Parsing [sent. 11418 len. 33]: ` Mr Pinch , ' said Pecksniff , taking up his handkerchief , as if he felt that he should want it soon , ' I will not dwell upon the past .
Parsing [sent. 11419 len. 17]: I will spare you , and I will spare myself , that pain at least . '
Parsing [sent. 11420 len. 32]: Tom 's was not a very bright eye , but it was a very expressive one when he looked at Mr Pecksniff , and said : ` Thank you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 11421 len. 13]: I am very glad you will not refer to the past . '
Parsing [sent. 11422 len. 26]: ` The present is enough , ' said Mr Pecksniff , dropping a penny , ` and the sooner THAT is past , the better .
Parsing [sent. 11423 len. 14]: Mr Pinch , I will not dismiss you without a word of explanation .
Parsing [sent. 11424 len. 46]: Even such a course would be quite justifiable under the circumstances ; but it might wear an appearance of hurry , and I will not do it ; for I am , ' said Mr Pecksniff , knocking down another penny , ` perfectly self-possessed .
Parsing [sent. 11425 len. 17]: Therefore I will say to you , what I have already said to Mr Chuzzlewit . '
Parsing [sent. 11426 len. 31]: Tom glanced at the old gentleman , who nodded now and then as approving of Mr Pecksniff 's sentences and sentiments , but interposed between them in no other way .
Parsing [sent. 11427 len. 129]: ` From fragments of a conversation which I overheard in the church , just now , Mr Pinch , ' said Pecksniff , ` between yourself and Miss Graham -- I say fragments , because I was slumbering at a considerable distance from you , when I was roused by your voices -- and from what I saw , I ascertained -LRB- I would have given a great deal not to have ascertained , Mr Pinch -RRB- that you , forgetful of all ties of duty and of honour , sir ; regardless of the sacred laws of hospitality , to which you were pledged as an inmate of this house ; have presumed to address Miss Graham with unreturned professions of attachment and proposals of love . '
Parsing [sent. 11428 len. 6]: Tom looked at him steadily .
Parsing [sent. 11429 len. 9]: ` Do you deny it , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11430 len. 22]: asked Mr Pecksniff , dropping one pound two and fourpence , and making a great business of picking it up again .
Parsing [sent. 11431 len. 10]: ` No , sir , ' replied Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 11432 len. 5]: I do not . '
Parsing [sent. 11433 len. 16]: ` You do not , ' said Mr Pecksniff , glancing at the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 11434 len. 19]: ` Oblige me by counting this money , Mr Pinch , and putting your name to this receipt .
Parsing [sent. 11435 len. 5]: You do not ? '
Parsing [sent. 11436 len. 6]: No , Tom did not .
Parsing [sent. 11437 len. 6]: He scorned to deny it .
Parsing [sent. 11438 len. 23]: He saw that Mr Pecksniff having overheard his own disgrace , cared not a jot for sinking lower yet in his contempt .
Parsing [sent. 11439 len. 30]: He saw that he had devised this fiction as the readiest means of getting rid of him at once , but that it must end in that any way .
Parsing [sent. 11440 len. 46]: He saw that Mr Pecksniff reckoned on his not denying it , because his doing so and explaining would incense the old man more than ever against Martin and against Mary ; while Pecksniff himself would only have been mistaken in his ` fragments . '
Parsing [sent. 11441 len. 3]: Deny it !
Parsing [sent. 11442 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 11443 len. 14]: ` You find the amount correct , do you , Mr Pinch ? '
Parsing [sent. 11444 len. 3]: said Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 11445 len. 11]: ` Quite correct , sir , ' answered Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 11446 len. 22]: A person is waiting in the kitchen , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` to carry your luggage wherever you please .
Parsing [sent. 11447 len. 17]: We part , Mr Pinch , at once , and are strangers from this time . '
Parsing [sent. 11448 len. 36]: Something without a name ; compassion , sorrow , old tenderness , mistaken gratitude , habit ; none of these , and yet all of them ; smote upon Tom 's gentle heart at parting .
Parsing [sent. 11449 len. 43]: There was no such soul as Pecksniff 's in that carcase ; and yet , though his speaking out had not involved the compromise of one he loved , he could n't have denounced the very shape and figure of the man .
Parsing [sent. 11450 len. 5]: Not even then . '
Parsing [sent. 11451 len. 20]: I will not say , ' cried Mr Pecksniff , shedding tears , ` what a blow this is .
Parsing [sent. 11452 len. 24]: I will not say how much it tries me ; how it works upon my nature ; how it grates upon my feelings .
Parsing [sent. 11453 len. 7]: I do not care for that .
Parsing [sent. 11454 len. 9]: I can endure as well as another man .
Parsing [sent. 11455 len. 60]: But what I have to hope , and what you have to hope , Mr Pinch -LRB- otherwise a great responsibility rests upon you -RRB- , is , that this deception may not alter my ideas of humanity ; that it may not impair my freshness , or contract , if I may use the expression , my Pinions .
Parsing [sent. 11456 len. 13]: I hope it will not ; I do n't think it will .
Parsing [sent. 11457 len. 41]: It may be a comfort to you , if not now , at some future time , to know that I shall endeavour not to think the worse of my fellow-creatures in general , for what has passed between us .
Parsing [sent. 11458 len. 3]: Farewell ! '
Parsing [sent. 11459 len. 48]: Tom had meant to spare him one little puncturation with a lancet , which he had it in his power to administer , but he changed his mind on hearing this , and said : ' I think you left something in the church , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 11460 len. 12]: ` Thank you , Mr Pinch , ' said Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 11461 len. 9]: I am not aware that I did . '
Parsing [sent. 11462 len. 11]: ` This is your double eye-glass , I believe ? '
Parsing [sent. 11463 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 11464 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 11465 len. 10]: cried Pecksniff , with some degree of confusion . '
Parsing [sent. 11466 len. 6]: I am obliged to you .
Parsing [sent. 11467 len. 10]: Put it down , if you please . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11468 len. 24]: I found it , ' said Tom , slowly -- ` when I went to bolt the vestry-window -- in the pew . '
Parsing [sent. 11469 len. 4]: So he had .
Parsing [sent. 11470 len. 27]: Mr Pecksniff had taken it off when he was bobbing up and down , lest it should strike against the panelling ; and had forgotten it .
Parsing [sent. 11471 len. 37]: Going back to the church with his mind full of having been watched , and wondering very much from what part , Tom 's attention was caught by the door of the state pew standing open .
Parsing [sent. 11472 len. 8]: Looking into it he found the glass .
Parsing [sent. 11473 len. 45]: And thus he knew , and by returning it gave Mr Pecksniff the information that he knew , where the listener had been ; and that instead of overhearing fragments of the conversation , he must have rejoiced in every word of it . '
Parsing [sent. 11474 len. 22]: I am glad he 's gone , ' said Martin , drawing a long breath when Tom had left the room .
Parsing [sent. 11475 len. 11]: ` It IS a relief , ' assented Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 11476 len. 7]: ` It is a great relief .
Parsing [sent. 11477 len. 50]: But having discharged -- I hope with tolerable firmness -- the duty which I owed to society , I will now , my dear sir , if you will give me leave , retire to shed a few tears in the back garden , as an humble individual . '
Parsing [sent. 11478 len. 62]: Tom went upstairs ; cleared his shelf of books ; packed them up with his music and an old fiddle in his trunk ; got out his clothes -LRB- they were not so many that they made his head ache -RRB- ; put them on the top of his books ; and went into the workroom for his case of instruments .
Parsing [sent. 11479 len. 51]: There was a ragged stool there , with the horsehair all sticking out of the top like a wig : a very Beast of a stool in itself ; on which he had taken up his daily seat , year after year , during the whole period of his service .
Parsing [sent. 11480 len. 9]: They had grown older and shabbier in company .
Parsing [sent. 11481 len. 12]: Pupils had served their time ; seasons had come and gone .
Parsing [sent. 11482 len. 12]: Tom and the worn-out stool had held together through it all .
Parsing [sent. 11483 len. 14]: That part of the room was traditionally called ` Tom 's Corner . '
Parsing [sent. 11484 len. 34]: It had been assigned to him at first because of its being situated in a strong draught , and a great way from the fire ; and he had occupied it ever since .
Parsing [sent. 11485 len. 17]: There were portraits of him on the walls , with all his weak points monstrously portrayed .
Parsing [sent. 11486 len. 19]: Diabolical sentiments , foreign to his character , were represented as issuing from his mouth in fat balloons .
Parsing [sent. 11487 len. 50]: Every pupil had added something , even unto fancy portraits of his father with one eye , and of his mother with a disproportionate nose , and especially of his sister ; who always being presented as extremely beautiful , made full amends to Tom for any other jokes .
Parsing [sent. 11488 len. 34]: Under less uncommon circumstances , it would have cut Tom to the heart to leave these things and think that he saw them for the last time ; but it did n't now .
Parsing [sent. 11489 len. 23]: There was no Pecksniff ; there never had been a Pecksniff ; and all his other griefs were swallowed up in that .
Parsing [sent. 11490 len. 49]: So , when he returned into the bedroom , and , having fastened his box and a carpet-bag , put on his walking gaiters , and his great-coat , and his hat , and taken his stick in his hand , looked round it for the last time .
Parsing [sent. 11491 len. 27]: Early on summer mornings , and by the light of private candle-ends on winter nights , he had read himself half blind in this same room .
Parsing [sent. 11492 len. 30]: He had tried in this same room to learn the fiddle under the bedclothes , but yielding to objections from the other pupils , had reluctantly abandoned the design .
Parsing [sent. 11493 len. 39]: At any other time he would have parted from it with a pang , thinking of all he had learned there , of the many hours he had passed there ; for the love of his very dreams .
Parsing [sent. 11494 len. 65]: But there was no Pecksniff ; there never had been a Pecksniff , and the unreality of Pecksniff extended itself to the chamber , in which , sitting on one particular bed , the thing supposed to be that Great Abstraction had often preached morality with such effect that Tom had felt a moisture in his eyes , while hanging breathless on the words .
Parsing [sent. 11495 len. 66]: The man engaged to bear his box -- Tom knew him well : a Dragon man -- came stamping up the stairs , and made a roughish bow to Tom -LRB- to whom in common times he would have nodded with a grin -RRB- as though he were aware of what had happened , and wished him to perceive it made no difference to HIM .
Parsing [sent. 11496 len. 29]: It was clumsily done ; he was a mere waterer of horses ; but Tom liked the man for it , and felt it more than going away .
Parsing [sent. 11497 len. 67]: Tom would have helped him with the box , but he made no more of it , though it was a heavy one , than an elephant would have made of a castle ; just swinging it on his back and bowling downstairs as if , being naturally a heavy sort of fellow , he could carry a box infinitely better than he could go alone .
Parsing [sent. 11498 len. 12]: Tom took the carpet-bag , and went downstairs along with him .
Parsing [sent. 11499 len. 34]: At the outer door stood Jane , crying with all her might ; and on the steps was Mrs Lupin , sobbing bitterly , and putting out her hand for Tom to shake .
Parsing [sent. 11500 len. 12]: ` You 're coming to the Dragon , Mr Pinch ? '
Parsing [sent. 11501 len. 10]: ` No , ' said Tom , ` no .
Parsing [sent. 11502 len. 7]: I shall walk to Salisbury to-night .
Parsing [sent. 11503 len. 6]: I could n't stay here .
Parsing [sent. 11504 len. 16]: For goodness ' sake , do n't make me so unhappy , Mrs Lupin . '
Parsing [sent. 11505 len. 12]: ` But you 'll come to the Dragon , Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 11506 len. 7]: If it 's only for tonight .
Parsing [sent. 11507 len. 13]: To see me , you know ; not as a traveller . '
Parsing [sent. 11508 len. 7]: ` God bless my soul ! '
Parsing [sent. 11509 len. 7]: said Tom , wiping his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 11510 len. 13]: ` The kindness of people is enough to break one 's heart !
Parsing [sent. 11511 len. 13]: I mean to go to Salisbury to-night , my dear good creature .
Parsing [sent. 11512 len. 30]: If you 'll take care of my box for me till I write for it , I shall consider it the greatest kindness you can do me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11513 len. 25]: I wish , ' cried Mrs Lupin , ` there were twenty boxes , Mr Pinch , that I might have 'em all . '
Parsing [sent. 11514 len. 9]: ` Thank ` ee , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 11515 len. 6]: ` It 's like you .
Parsing [sent. 11516 len. 2]: Good-bye .
Parsing [sent. 11517 len. 3]: Good-bye . '
Parsing [sent. 11518 len. 79]: There were several people , young and old , standing about the door , some of whom cried with Mrs Lupin ; while others tried to keep up a stout heart , as Tom did ; and others were absorbed in admiration of Mr Pecksniff -- a man who could build a church , as one may say , by squinting at a sheet of paper ; and others were divided between that feeling and sympathy with Tom .
Parsing [sent. 11519 len. 40]: Mr Pecksniff had appeared on the top of the steps , simultaneously with his old pupil , and while Tom was talking with Mrs Lupin kept his hand stretched out , as though he said ` Go forth ! '
Parsing [sent. 11520 len. 30]: When Tom went forth , and had turned the corner Mr Pecksniff shook his head , shut his eyes , and heaving a deep sigh , shut the door .
Parsing [sent. 11521 len. 32]: On which , the best of Tom 's supporters said he must have done some dreadful deed , or such a man as Mr Pecksniff never could have felt like that .
Parsing [sent. 11522 len. 32]: If it had been a common quarrel -LRB- they observed -RRB- , he would have said something , but when he did n't , Mr Pinch must have shocked him dreadfully .
Parsing [sent. 11523 len. 41]: Tom was out of hearing of their shrewd opinions , and plodded on as steadily as he could go , until he came within sight of the turnpike where the tollman 's family had cried out ` Mr Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 11524 len. 12]: that frosty morning , when he went to meet young Martin .
Parsing [sent. 11525 len. 42]: He had got through the village , and this toll-bar was his last trial ; but when the infant toll-takers came screeching out , he had half a mind to run for it , and make a bolt across the country .
Parsing [sent. 11526 len. 7]: ` Why , deary Mr Pinch !
Parsing [sent. 11527 len. 6]: oh , deary sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 11528 len. 6]: cried the tollman 's wife .
Parsing [sent. 11529 len. 18]: ` What an unlikely time for you to be a-going this way with a bag ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 11530 len. 10]: I am going to Salisbury , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 11531 len. 13]: ` Why , goodness , where 's the gig , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 11532 len. 25]: cried the tollman 's wife , looking down the road , as if she thought Tom might have been upset without observing it . '
Parsing [sent. 11533 len. 10]: I have n't got it , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 11534 len. 29]: ` I -- ' he could n't evade it ; he felt she would have him in the next question , if he got over this one . '
Parsing [sent. 11535 len. 7]: I have left Mr Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 11536 len. 74]: The tollman -- a crusty customer , always smoking solitary pipes in a Windsor chair , inside , set artfully between two little windows that looked up and down the road , so that when he saw anything coming up he might hug himself on having toll to take , and when he saw it going down , might hug himself on having taken it -- the tollman was out in an instant .
Parsing [sent. 11537 len. 6]: ` Left Mr Pecksniff ! '
Parsing [sent. 11538 len. 4]: cried the tollman .
Parsing [sent. 11539 len. 12]: ` Yes , ' said Tom , ` left him . '
Parsing [sent. 11540 len. 28]: The tollman looked at his wife , uncertain whether to ask her if she had anything to suggest , or to order her to mind the children .
Parsing [sent. 11541 len. 23]: Astonishment making him surly , he preferred the latter , and sent her into the toll-house with a flea in her ear .
Parsing [sent. 11542 len. 7]: ` You left Mr Pecksniff ! '
Parsing [sent. 11543 len. 14]: cried the tollman , folding his arms , and spreading his legs . '
Parsing [sent. 11544 len. 13]: I should as soon have thought of his head leaving him . '
Parsing [sent. 11545 len. 4]: ` Aye ! '
Parsing [sent. 11546 len. 10]: said Tom , ` so should I , yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 11547 len. 4]: Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 11548 len. 28]: If a heavy drove of oxen had n't come by immediately , the tollman would have gone down to the village straight , to inquire into it .
Parsing [sent. 11549 len. 18]: As things turned out , he smoked another pipe , and took his wife into his confidence .
Parsing [sent. 11550 len. 22]: But their united sagacity could make nothing of it , and they went to bed -- metaphorically -- in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 11551 len. 26]: But several times that night , when a waggon or other vehicle came through , and the driver asked the tollkeeper ` What news ? '
Parsing [sent. 11552 len. 46]: he looked at the man by the light of his lantern , to assure himself that he had an interest in the subject , and then said , wrapping his watch-coat round his legs : ` You 've heerd of Mr Pecksniff down yonder ? '
Parsing [sent. 11553 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 11554 len. 3]: sure-ly ! '
Parsing [sent. 11555 len. 14]: ` And of his young man Mr Pinch , p ` raps ? '
Parsing [sent. 11556 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 11557 len. 6]: ` They 've parted . '
Parsing [sent. 11558 len. 31]: After every one of these disclosures , the tollman plunged into his house again , and was seen no more , while the other side went on in great amazement .
Parsing [sent. 11559 len. 26]: But this was long after Tom was abed , and Tom was now with his face towards Salisbury , doing his best to get there .
Parsing [sent. 11560 len. 24]: The evening was beautiful at first , but it became cloudy and dull at sunset , and the rain fell heavily soon afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 11561 len. 29]: For ten long miles he plodded on , wet through , until at last the lights appeared , and he came into the welcome precincts of the city .
Parsing [sent. 11562 len. 25]: He went to the inn where he had waited for Martin , and briefly answering their inquiries after Mr Pecksniff , ordered a bed .
Parsing [sent. 11563 len. 59]: He had no heart for tea or supper , meat or drink of any kind , but sat by himself before an empty table in the public room while the bed was getting ready , revolving in his mind all that had happened that eventful day , and wondering what he could or should do for the future .
Parsing [sent. 11564 len. 18]: It was a great relief when the chambermaid came in , and said the bed was ready .
Parsing [sent. 11565 len. 34]: It was a low four-poster , shelving downward in the centre like a trough , and the room was crowded with impracticable tables and exploded chests of drawers , full of damp linen .
Parsing [sent. 11566 len. 49]: A graphic representation in oil of a remarkably fat ox hung over the fireplace , and the portrait of some former landlord -LRB- who might have been the ox 's brother , he was so like him -RRB- stared roundly in , at the foot of the bed .
Parsing [sent. 11567 len. 44]: A variety of queer smells were partially quenched in the prevailing scent of very old lavender ; and the window had not been opened for such a long space of time that it pleaded immemorial usage , and would n't come open now .
Parsing [sent. 11568 len. 27]: These were trifles in themselves , but they added to the strangeness of the place , and did not induce Tom to forget his new position .
Parsing [sent. 11569 len. 30]: Pecksniff had gone out of the world -- had never been in it -- and it was as much as Tom could do to say his prayers without him .
Parsing [sent. 11570 len. 20]: But he felt happier afterwards , and went to sleep , and dreamed about him as he Never Was .
Parsing [sent. 11571 len. 78]: CHAPTER THIRTY -- TWO TREATS OF TODGER 'S AGAIN ; AND OF ANOTHER BLIGHTED PLANT BESIDES THE PLANTS UPON THE LEADS Early on the day next after that on which she bade adieu to the halls of her youth and the scenes of her childhood , Miss Pecksniff , arriving safely at the coach-office in London , was there received , and conducted to her peaceful home beneath the shadow of the Monument , by Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 11572 len. 30]: M. Todgers looked a little worn by cares of gravy and other such solicitudes arising out of her establishment , but displayed her usual earnestness and warmth of manner .
Parsing [sent. 11573 len. 21]: ` And how , my sweet Miss Pecksniff , ' said she , ` how is your princely pa ? '
Parsing [sent. 11574 len. 40]: Miss Pecksniff signified -LRB- in confidence -RRB- that he contemplated the introduction of a princely ma ; and repeated the sentiment that she was n't blind , and was n't quite a fool , and would n't bear it .
Parsing [sent. 11575 len. 15]: Mrs Todgers was more shocked by the intelligence than any one could have expected .
Parsing [sent. 11576 len. 5]: She was quite bitter .
Parsing [sent. 11577 len. 29]: She said there was no truth in man and that the warmer he expressed himself , as a general principle , the falser and more treacherous he was .
Parsing [sent. 11578 len. 58]: She foresaw with astonishing clearness that the object of Mr Pecksniff 's attachment was designing , worthless , and wicked ; and receiving from Charity the fullest confirmation of these views , protested with tears in her eyes that she loved Miss Pecksniff like a sister , and felt her injuries as if they were her own .
Parsing [sent. 11579 len. 32]: ` Your real darling sister , I have not seen her more than once since her marriage , ' said Mrs Todgers , ` and then I thought her looking poorly .
Parsing [sent. 11580 len. 17]: My sweet Miss Pecksniff , I always thought that you was to be the lady ? '
Parsing [sent. 11581 len. 6]: ` Oh dear no ! '
Parsing [sent. 11582 len. 7]: cried Cherry , shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 11583 len. 7]: ` Oh no , Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 11584 len. 3]: Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 11585 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 11586 len. 10]: not for any consideration he could offer . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11587 len. 16]: I dare say you are right , ' said Mrs Todgers with a sigh . '
Parsing [sent. 11588 len. 6]: I feared it all along .
Parsing [sent. 11589 len. 28]: But the misery we have had from that match , here among ourselves , in this house , my dear Miss Pecksniff , nobody would believe . '
Parsing [sent. 11590 len. 7]: ` Lor , Mrs Todgers ! '
Parsing [sent. 11591 len. 6]: ` Awful , awful ! '
Parsing [sent. 11592 len. 8]: repeated Mrs Todgers , with strong emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 11593 len. 11]: ` You recollect our youngest gentleman , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 11594 len. 10]: ` Of course I do , ' said Cherry .
Parsing [sent. 11595 len. 38]: ` You might have observed , ' said Mrs Todgers , ` how he used to watch your sister ; and that a kind of stony dumbness came over him whenever she was in company ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 11596 len. 20]: I am sure I never saw anything of the sort , ' said Cherry , in a peevish manner .
Parsing [sent. 11597 len. 8]: ` What nonsense , Mrs Todgers ! '
Parsing [sent. 11598 len. 44]: ` My dear , ' returned that lady in a hollow voice , ' I have seen him again and again , sitting over his pie at dinner , with his spoon a perfect fixture in his mouth , looking at your sister .
Parsing [sent. 11599 len. 43]: I have seen him standing in a corner of our drawing-room , gazing at her , in such a lonely , melancholy state , that he was more like a Pump than a man , and might have drawed tears . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11600 len. 6]: I never saw it ! '
Parsing [sent. 11601 len. 12]: cried Cherry ; ` that 's all I can say . '
Parsing [sent. 11602 len. 48]: ` But when the marriage took place , ' said Mrs Todgers , proceeding with her subject , ` when it was in the paper , and was read out here at breakfast , I thought he had taken leave of his senses , I did indeed .
Parsing [sent. 11603 len. 65]: The violence of that young man , my dear Miss Pecksniff ; the frightful opinions he expressed upon the subject of self-destruction ; the extraordinary actions he performed with his tea ; the clenching way in which he bit his bread and butter ; the manner in which he taunted Mr Jinkins ; all combined to form a picture never to be forgotten . '
Parsing [sent. 11604 len. 19]: ` It 's a pity he did n't destroy himself , I think , ' observed Miss Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 11605 len. 4]: ` Himself ! '
Parsing [sent. 11606 len. 12]: said Mrs Todgers , ` it took another turn at night .
Parsing [sent. 11607 len. 8]: He was for destroying other people then .
Parsing [sent. 11608 len. 78]: There was a little chaffing going on -- I hope you do n't consider that a low expression , Miss Pecksniff ; it is always in our gentlemen 's mouths -- a little chaffing going on , my dear , among 'em , all in good nature , when suddenly he rose up , foaming with his fury , and but for being held by three would have had Mr Jinkins 's life with a bootjack . '
Parsing [sent. 11609 len. 8]: Miss Pecksniff 's face expressed supreme indifference .
Parsing [sent. 11610 len. 18]: ` And now , ' said Mrs Todgers , ` now he is the meekest of men .
Parsing [sent. 11611 len. 14]: You can almost bring the tears into his eyes by looking at him .
Parsing [sent. 11612 len. 37]: He sits with me the whole day long on Sundays , talking in such a dismal way that I find it next to impossible to keep my spirits up equal to the accommodation of the boarders .
Parsing [sent. 11613 len. 8]: His only comfort is in female society .
Parsing [sent. 11614 len. 44]: He takes me half-price to the play , to an extent which I sometimes fear is beyond his means ; and I see the tears a-standing in his eyes during the whole performance -- particularly if it is anything of a comic nature .
Parsing [sent. 11615 len. 45]: The turn I experienced only yesterday , ' said Mrs Todgers putting her hand to her side , ` when the house-maid threw his bedside carpet out of the window of his room , while I was sitting here , no one can imagine .
Parsing [sent. 11616 len. 16]: I thought it was him , and that he had done it at last ! '
Parsing [sent. 11617 len. 37]: The contempt with which Miss Charity received this pathetic account of the state to which the youngest gentleman in company was reduced , did not say much for her power of sympathising with that unfortunate character .
Parsing [sent. 11618 len. 29]: She treated it with great levity , and went on to inform herself , then and afterwards , whether any other changes had occurred in the commercial boarding-house .
Parsing [sent. 11619 len. 19]: Mr Bailey was gone , and had been succeeded -LRB- such is the decay of human greatness ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 11620 len. 17]: by an old woman whose name was reported to be Tamaroo -- which seemed an impossibility .
Parsing [sent. 11621 len. 73]: Indeed it appeared in the fullness of time that the jocular boarders had appropriated the word from an English ballad , in which it is supposed to express the bold and fiery nature of a certain hackney coachman ; and that it was bestowed upon Mr Bailey 's successor by reason of her having nothing fiery about her , except an occasional attack of that fire which is called St. Anthony 's .
Parsing [sent. 11622 len. 45]: This ancient female had been engaged , in fulfillment of a vow , registered by Mrs Todgers , that no more boys should darken the commercial doors ; and she was chiefly remarkable for a total absence of all comprehension upon every subject whatever .
Parsing [sent. 11623 len. 52]: She was a perfect Tomb for messages and small parcels ; and when dispatched to the Post Office with letters , had been frequently seen endeavouring to insinuate them into casual chinks in private doors , under the delusion that any door with a hole in it would answer the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 11624 len. 41]: She was a very little old woman , and always wore a very coarse apron with a bib before and a loop behind , together with bandages on her wrists , which appeared to be afflicted with an everlasting sprain .
Parsing [sent. 11625 len. 28]: She was on all occasions chary of opening the street door , and ardent to shut it again ; and she waited at table in a bonnet .
Parsing [sent. 11626 len. 19]: This was the only great change over and above the change which had fallen on the youngest gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 11627 len. 26]: As for him , he more than corroborated the account of Mrs Todgers ; possessing greater sensibility than even she had given him credit for .
Parsing [sent. 11628 len. 52]: He entertained some terrible notions of Destiny , among other matters , and talked much about people 's ` Missions ' ; upon which he seemed to have some private information not generally attainable , as he knew it had been poor Merry 's mission to crush him in the bud .
Parsing [sent. 11629 len. 77]: He was very frail and tearful ; for being aware that a shepherd 's mission was to pipe to his flocks , and that a boatswain 's mission was to pipe all hands , and that one man 's mission was to be a paid piper , and another man 's mission was to pay the piper , so he had got it into his head that his own peculiar mission was to pipe his eye .
Parsing [sent. 11630 len. 5]: Which he did perpetually .
Parsing [sent. 11631 len. 43]: He often informed Mrs Todgers that the sun had set upon him ; that the billows had rolled over him ; that the car of Juggernaut had crushed him , and also that the deadly Upas tree of Java had blighted him .
Parsing [sent. 11632 len. 5]: His name was Moddle .
Parsing [sent. 11633 len. 32]: Towards this most unhappy Moddle , Miss Pecksniff conducted herself at first with distant haughtiness , being in no humour to be entertained with dirges in honour of her married sister .
Parsing [sent. 11634 len. 19]: The poor young gentleman was additionally crushed by this , and remonstrated with Mrs Todgers on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 11635 len. 14]: ` Even she turns from me , Mrs Todgers , ' said Moddle .
Parsing [sent. 11636 len. 18]: ` Then why do n't you try and be a little bit more cheerful , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11637 len. 4]: retorted Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 11638 len. 6]: ` Cheerful , Mrs Todgers !
Parsing [sent. 11639 len. 3]: cheerful ! '
Parsing [sent. 11640 len. 20]: cried the youngest gentleman ; ` when she reminds me of days for ever fled , Mrs Todgers ! '
Parsing [sent. 11641 len. 32]: ` Then you had better avoid her for a short time , if she does , ' said Mrs Todgers , ` and come to know her again , by degrees .
Parsing [sent. 11642 len. 6]: That 's my advice . '
Parsing [sent. 11643 len. 23]: ` But I ca n't avoid her , ' replied Moddle , ' I have n't strength of mind to do it .
Parsing [sent. 11644 len. 18]: Oh , Mrs Todgers , if you knew what a comfort her nose is to me ! '
Parsing [sent. 11645 len. 7]: ` Her nose , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 11646 len. 4]: Mrs Todgers cried .
Parsing [sent. 11647 len. 19]: ` Her profile , in general , ' said the youngest gentleman , ` but particularly her nose .
Parsing [sent. 11648 len. 15]: It 's so like ; ' here he yielded to a burst of grief .
Parsing [sent. 11649 len. 15]: ` it 's so like hers who is Another 's , Mrs Todgers ! '
Parsing [sent. 11650 len. 42]: The observant matron did not fail to report this conversation to Charity , who laughed at the time , but treated Mr Moddle that very evening with increased consideration , and presented her side face to him as much as possible .
Parsing [sent. 11651 len. 32]: Mr Moddle was not less sentimental than usual ; was rather more so , if anything ; but he sat and stared at her with glistening eyes , and seemed grateful .
Parsing [sent. 11652 len. 6]: ` Well , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 11653 len. 11]: said the lady of the Boarding -- House next day .
Parsing [sent. 11654 len. 9]: ` You held up your head last night .
Parsing [sent. 11655 len. 9]: You 're coming round , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 11656 len. 21]: ` Only because she 's so like her who is Another 's , Mrs Todgers , ' rejoined the youth .
Parsing [sent. 11657 len. 24]: ` When she talks , and when she smiles , I think I 'm looking on HER brow again , Mrs Todgers . '
Parsing [sent. 11658 len. 39]: This was likewise carried to Charity , who talked and smiled next evening in her most engaging manner , and rallying Mr Moddle on the lowness of his spirits , challenged him to play a rubber at cribbage .
Parsing [sent. 11659 len. 20]: Mr Moddle taking up the gauntlet , they played several rubbers for sixpences , and Charity won them all .
Parsing [sent. 11660 len. 57]: This may have been partially attributable to the gallantry of the youngest gentleman , but it was certainly referable to the state of his feelings also ; for his eyes being frequently dimmed by tears , he thought that aces were tens , and knaves queens , which at times occasioned some confusion in his play .
Parsing [sent. 11661 len. 35]: On the seventh night of cribbage , when Mrs Todgers , sitting by , proposed that instead of gambling they should play for ` love , ' Mr Moddle was seen to change colour .
Parsing [sent. 11662 len. 34]: On the fourteenth night , he kissed Miss Pecksniff 's snuffers , in the passage , when she went upstairs to bed ; meaning to have kissed her hand , but missing it .
Parsing [sent. 11663 len. 42]: In short , Mr Moddle began to be impressed with the idea that Miss Pecksniff 's mission was to comfort him ; and Miss Pecksniff began to speculate on the probability of its being her mission to become ultimately Mrs Moddle .
Parsing [sent. 11664 len. 28]: He was a young gentleman -LRB- Miss Pecksniff was not a very young lady -RRB- with rising prospects , and ` almost ' enough to live on .
Parsing [sent. 11665 len. 6]: Really it looked very well .
Parsing [sent. 11666 len. 13]: Besides -- besides -- he had been regarded as devoted to Merry .
Parsing [sent. 11667 len. 19]: Merry had joked about him , and had once spoken of it to her sister as a conquest .
Parsing [sent. 11668 len. 19]: He was better looking , better shaped , better spoken , better tempered , better mannered than Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 11669 len. 31]: He was easy to manage , could be made to consult the humours of his Betrothed , and could be shown off like a lamb when Jonas was a bear .
Parsing [sent. 11670 len. 5]: There was the rub !
Parsing [sent. 11671 len. 32]: In the meantime the cribbage went on , and Mrs Todgers went off ; for the youngest gentleman , dropping her society , began to take Miss Pecksniff to the play .
Parsing [sent. 11672 len. 73]: He also began , as Mrs Todgers said , to slip home ` in his dinner-times , ' and to get away from ` the office ' at unholy seasons ; and twice , as he informed Mrs Todgers himself , he received anonymous letters , enclosing cards from Furniture Warehouses -- clearly the act of that ungentlemanly ruffian Jinkins ; only he had n't evidence enough to call him out upon .
Parsing [sent. 11673 len. 20]: All of which , so Mrs Todgers told Miss Pecksniff , spoke as plain English as the shining sun .
Parsing [sent. 11674 len. 26]: ` My dear Miss Pecksniff , you may depend upon it , ' said Mrs Todgers , ` that he is burning to propose . '
Parsing [sent. 11675 len. 12]: ` My goodness me , why do n't he then ? '
Parsing [sent. 11676 len. 3]: cried Cherry .
Parsing [sent. 11677 len. 20]: ` Men are so much more timid than we think 'em , my dear , ' returned Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 11678 len. 6]: ` They baulk themselves continually .
Parsing [sent. 11679 len. 21]: I saw the words on Todgers 's lips for months and months and months , before he said 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 11680 len. 13]: Miss Pecksniff submitted that Todgers might not have been a fair specimen .
Parsing [sent. 11681 len. 7]: ` Oh yes , he was .
Parsing [sent. 11682 len. 9]: Oh bless you , yes , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 11683 len. 19]: I was very particular in those days , I assure you , ' said Mrs Todgers , bridling .
Parsing [sent. 11684 len. 5]: ` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 11685 len. 31]: You give Mr Moddle a little encouragement , Miss Pecksniff , if you wish him to speak ; and he 'll speak fast enough , depend upon it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11686 len. 20]: I am sure I do n't know what encouragement he would have , Mrs Todgers , ' returned Charity .
Parsing [sent. 11687 len. 22]: ` He walks with me , and plays cards with me , and he comes and sits alone with me . '
Parsing [sent. 11688 len. 9]: ` Quite right , ' said Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 11689 len. 9]: ` That 's indispensable , my dear . '
Parsing [sent. 11690 len. 10]: ` And he sits very close to me . '
Parsing [sent. 11691 len. 10]: ` Also quite correct , ' said Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 11692 len. 8]: ` And he looks at me . '
Parsing [sent. 11693 len. 12]: ` To be sure he does , ' said Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 11694 len. 28]: ` And he has his arm upon the back of the chair or sofa , or whatever it is -- behind me , you know . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11695 len. 10]: I should think so , ' said Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 11696 len. 9]: ` And then he begins to cry ! '
Parsing [sent. 11697 len. 31]: Mrs Todgers admitted that he might do better than that ; and might undoubtedly profit by the recollection of the great Lord Nelson 's signal at the battle of Trafalgar .
Parsing [sent. 11698 len. 42]: Still , she said , he would come round , or , not to mince the matter , would be brought round , if Miss Pecksniff took up a decided position , and plainly showed him that it must be done .
Parsing [sent. 11699 len. 66]: Determining to regulate her conduct by this opinion , the young lady received Mr Moddle , on the earliest subsequent occasion , with an air of constraint ; and gradually leading him to inquire , in a dejected manner , why she was so changed , confessed to him that she felt it necessary for their mutual peace and happiness to take a decided step .
Parsing [sent. 11700 len. 25]: They had been much together lately , she observed , much together , and had tasted the sweets of a genuine reciprocity of sentiment .
Parsing [sent. 11701 len. 59]: She never could forget him , nor could she ever cease to think of him with feelings of the liveliest friendship , but people had begun to talk , the thing had been observed , and it was necessary that they should be nothing more to each other , than any gentleman and lady in society usually are .
Parsing [sent. 11702 len. 51]: She was glad she had had the resolution to say thus much before her feelings had been tried too far ; they had been greatly tried , she would admit ; but though she was weak and silly , she would soon get the better of it , she hoped .
Parsing [sent. 11703 len. 68]: Moddle , who had by this time become in the last degree maudlin , and wept abundantly , inferred from the foregoing avowal , that it was his mission to communicate to others the blight which had fallen on himself ; and that , being a kind of unintentional Vampire , he had had Miss Pecksniff assigned to him by the Fates , as Victim Number One .
Parsing [sent. 11704 len. 46]: Miss Pecksniff controverting this opinion as sinful , Moddle was goaded on to ask whether she could be contented with a blighted heart ; and it appearing on further examination that she could be , plighted his dismal troth , which was accepted and returned .
Parsing [sent. 11705 len. 10]: He bore his good fortune with the utmost moderation .
Parsing [sent. 11706 len. 28]: Instead of being triumphant , he shed more tears than he had ever been known to shed before ; and , sobbing , said : ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 11707 len. 7]: what a day this has been !
Parsing [sent. 11708 len. 11]: I ca n't go back to the office this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 11709 len. 10]: Oh , what a trying day this has been !
Parsing [sent. 11710 len. 4]: Good Gracious ! '
Parsing [sent. 11711 len. 16]: CHAPTER THIRTY -- THREE FURTHER PROCEEDINGS IN EDEN , AND A PROCEEDING OUT OF IT .
Parsing [sent. 11712 len. 19]: MARTIN MAKES A DISCOVERY OF SOME IMPORTANCE From Mr Moddle to Eden is an easy and natural transition .
Parsing [sent. 11713 len. 27]: Mr Moddle , living in the atmosphere of Miss Pecksniff 's love , dwelt -LRB- if he had but known it -RRB- in a terrestrial Paradise .
Parsing [sent. 11714 len. 18]: The thriving city of Eden was also a terrestrial Paradise , upon the showing of its proprietors .
Parsing [sent. 11715 len. 23]: The beautiful Miss Pecksniff might have been poetically described as a something too good for man in his fallen and degraded state .
Parsing [sent. 11716 len. 65]: That was exactly the character of the thriving city of Eden , as poetically heightened by Zephaniah Scadder , General Choke , and other worthies ; part and parcel of the talons of that great American Eagle , which is always airing itself sky-high in purest aether , and never , no never , never , tumbles down with draggled wings into the mud .
Parsing [sent. 11717 len. 62]: When Mark Tapley , leaving Martin in the architectural and surveying offices , had effectually strengthened and encouraged his own spirits by the contemplation of their joint misfortunes , he proceeded , with new cheerfulness , in search of help ; congratulating himself , as he went along , on the enviable position to which he had at last attained . '
Parsing [sent. 11718 len. 52]: I used to think , sometimes , ' said Mr Tapley , ` as a desolate island would suit me , but I should only have had myself to provide for there , and being naturally a easy man to manage , there would n't have been much credit in THAT .
Parsing [sent. 11719 len. 25]: Now here I 've got my partner to take care on , and he 's something like the sort of man for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 11720 len. 19]: I want a man as is always a-sliding off his legs when he ought to be on 'em .
Parsing [sent. 11721 len. 33]: I want a man as is so low down in the school of life that he 's always a-making figures of one in his copy-book , and ca n't get no further .
Parsing [sent. 11722 len. 22]: I want a man as is his own great coat and cloak , and is always a-wrapping himself up in himself .
Parsing [sent. 11723 len. 18]: And I have got him too , ' said Mr Tapley , after a moment 's silence .
Parsing [sent. 11724 len. 6]: ` What a happiness ! '
Parsing [sent. 11725 len. 17]: He paused to look round , uncertain to which of the log-houses he should repair . '
Parsing [sent. 11726 len. 18]: I do n't know which to take , ' he observed ; ` that 's the truth .
Parsing [sent. 11727 len. 36]: They 're equally prepossessing outside , and equally commodious , no doubt , within ; being fitted up with every convenience that a Alligator , in a state of natur ' , could possibly require .
Parsing [sent. 11728 len. 4]: Let me see !
Parsing [sent. 11729 len. 21]: The citizen as turned out last night , lives under water , in the right hand dog-kennel at the corner .
Parsing [sent. 11730 len. 32]: I do n't want to trouble him if I can help it , poor man , for he is a melancholy object ; a reg ` lar Settler in every respect .
Parsing [sent. 11731 len. 16]: There 's house with a winder , but I am afraid of their being proud .
Parsing [sent. 11732 len. 21]: I do n't know whether a door ai n't too aristocratic ; but here goes for the first one ! '
Parsing [sent. 11733 len. 14]: He went up to the nearest cabin , and knocked with his hand .
Parsing [sent. 11734 len. 8]: Being desired to enter , he complied .
Parsing [sent. 11735 len. 26]: ` Neighbour , ' said Mark ; ` for I AM a neighbour , though you do n't know me ; I 've come a-begging .
Parsing [sent. 11736 len. 2]: Hallo !
Parsing [sent. 11737 len. 4]: hal -- lo !
Parsing [sent. 11738 len. 8]: Am I a-bed , and dreaming ! '
Parsing [sent. 11739 len. 51]: He made this exclamation on hearing his own name pronounced , and finding himself clasped about the skirts by two little boys , whose faces he had often washed , and whose suppers he had often cooked , on board of that noble and fast-sailing line-of-packet ship , the Screw .
Parsing [sent. 11740 len. 7]: ` My eyes is wrong ! '
Parsing [sent. 11741 len. 4]: said Mark . '
Parsing [sent. 11742 len. 6]: I do n't believe 'em .
Parsing [sent. 11743 len. 39]: That ai n't my fellow-passenger younder , a-nursing her little girl , who , I am sorry to see , is so delicate ; and that ai n't her husband as come to New York to fetch her .
Parsing [sent. 11744 len. 34]: Nor these , ' he added , looking down upon the boys , ` ai n't them two young shavers as was so familiar to me ; though they are uncommon like 'em .
Parsing [sent. 11745 len. 6]: That I must confess . '
Parsing [sent. 11746 len. 61]: The woman shed tears , in very joy to see him ; the man shook both his hands and would not let them go ; the two boys hugged his legs ; the sick child in the mother 's arms stretched out her burning little fingers , and muttered , in her hoarse , dry throat , his well-remembered name .
Parsing [sent. 11747 len. 9]: It was the same family , sure enough .
Parsing [sent. 11748 len. 8]: Altered by the salubrious air of Eden .
Parsing [sent. 11749 len. 4]: But the same .
Parsing [sent. 11750 len. 20]: ` This is a new sort of a morning call , ' said Mark , drawing a long breath .
Parsing [sent. 11751 len. 9]: ` It strikes one all of a heap .
Parsing [sent. 11752 len. 5]: Wait a little bit !
Parsing [sent. 11753 len. 6]: I 'm a-coming round fast .
Parsing [sent. 11754 len. 4]: That 'll do !
Parsing [sent. 11755 len. 7]: These gentlemen ai n't my friends .
Parsing [sent. 11756 len. 11]: Are they on the visiting list of the house ? '
Parsing [sent. 11757 len. 26]: The inquiry referred to certain gaunt pigs , who had walked in after him , and were much interested in the heels of the family .
Parsing [sent. 11758 len. 19]: As they did not belong to the mansion , they were expelled by the two little boys . '
Parsing [sent. 11759 len. 54]: I ai n't superstitious about toads , ' said Mark , looking round the room , ` but if you could prevail upon the two or three I see in company , to step out at the same time , my young friends , I think they 'd find the open air refreshing .
Parsing [sent. 11760 len. 9]: Not that I at all object to 'em .
Parsing [sent. 11761 len. 45]: A very handsome animal is a toad , ' said Mr Tapley , sitting down upon a stool ; ` very spotted ; very like a partickler style of old gentleman about the throat ; very bright-eyed , very cool , and very slippy .
Parsing [sent. 11762 len. 14]: But one sees 'em to the best advantage out of doors perhaps . '
Parsing [sent. 11763 len. 37]: While pretending , with such talk as this , to be perfectly at his ease , and to be the most indifferent and careless of men , Mark Tapley had an eye on all around him .
Parsing [sent. 11764 len. 51]: The wan and meagre aspect of the family , the changed looks of the poor mother , the fevered child she held in her lap , the air of great despondency and little hope on everything , were plain to him , and made a deep impression on his mind .
Parsing [sent. 11765 len. 79]: He saw it all as clearly and as quickly , as with his bodily eyes he saw the rough shelves supported by pegs driven between the logs , of which the house was made ; the flour-cask in the corner , serving also for a table ; the blankets , spades , and other articles against the walls ; the damp that blotched the ground ; or the crop of vegetable rottenness in every crevice of the hut .
Parsing [sent. 11766 len. 11]: ` How is it that you have come here ? '
Parsing [sent. 11767 len. 13]: asked the man , when their first expressions of surprise were over .
Parsing [sent. 11768 len. 15]: ` Why , we come by the steamer last night , ' replied Mark .
Parsing [sent. 11769 len. 27]: ` Our intention is to make our fortuns with punctuality and dispatch ; and to retire upon our property as soon as ever it 's realised .
Parsing [sent. 11770 len. 6]: But how are you all ?
Parsing [sent. 11771 len. 6]: You 're looking noble ! '
Parsing [sent. 11772 len. 18]: ` We are but sickly now , ' said the poor woman , bending over her child .
Parsing [sent. 11773 len. 15]: ` But we shall do better when we are seasoned to the place . '
Parsing [sent. 11774 len. 18]: ` There are some here , ' thought Mark ` whose seasoning will last for ever . '
Parsing [sent. 11775 len. 9]: But he said cheerfully , ` Do better !
Parsing [sent. 11776 len. 6]: To be sure you will .
Parsing [sent. 11777 len. 6]: We shall all do better .
Parsing [sent. 11778 len. 18]: What we 've got to do is , to keep up our spirits , and be neighbourly .
Parsing [sent. 11779 len. 12]: We shall come all right in the end , never fear .
Parsing [sent. 11780 len. 28]: That reminds me , by the bye , that my partner 's all wrong just at present ; and that I looked in to beg for him .
Parsing [sent. 11781 len. 16]: I wish you 'd come and give me your opinion of him , master . '
Parsing [sent. 11782 len. 37]: That must have been a very unreasonable request on the part of Mark Tapley , with which , in their gratitude for his kind offices on board the ship , they would not have complied instantly .
Parsing [sent. 11783 len. 12]: The man rose to accompany him without a moment 's delay .
Parsing [sent. 11784 len. 33]: Before they went , Mark took the sick child in his arms , and tried to comfort the mother ; but the hand of death was on it then , he saw .
Parsing [sent. 11785 len. 17]: They found Martin in the house , lying wrapped up in his blanket on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 11786 len. 40]: He was , to all appearance , very ill indeed , and shook and shivered horribly ; not as people do from cold , but in a frightful kind of spasm or convulsion , that racked his whole body .
Parsing [sent. 11787 len. 39]: Mark 's friend pronounced his disease an aggravated kind of fever , accompanied with ague ; which was very common in those parts , and which he predicted would be worse to-morrow , and for many more to-morrows .
Parsing [sent. 11788 len. 43]: He had had it himself off and on , he said , for a couple of years or so ; but he was thankful that , while so many he had known had died about him , he had escaped with life .
Parsing [sent. 11789 len. 18]: ` And with not too much of that , ' thought Mark , surveying his emaciated form .
Parsing [sent. 11790 len. 6]: ` Eden for ever ! '
Parsing [sent. 11791 len. 34]: They had some medicine in their chest ; and this man of sad experience showed Mark how and when to administer it , and how he could best alleviate the sufferings of Martin .
Parsing [sent. 11792 len. 32]: His attentions did not stop there ; for he was backwards and forwards constantly , and rendered Mark good service in all his brisk attempts to make their situation more endurable .
Parsing [sent. 11793 len. 11]: Hope or comfort for the future he could not bestow .
Parsing [sent. 11794 len. 12]: The season was a sickly one ; the settlement a grave .
Parsing [sent. 11795 len. 27]: His child died that night ; and Mark , keeping the secret from Martin , helped to bury it , beneath a tree , next day .
Parsing [sent. 11796 len. 53]: With all his various duties of attendance upon Martin -LRB- who became the more exacting in his claims , the worse he grew -RRB- , Mark worked out of doors , early and late ; and with the assistance of his friend and others , laboured to do something with their land .
Parsing [sent. 11797 len. 63]: Not that he had the least strength of heart or hope , or steady purpose in so doing , beyond the habitual cheerfulness of his disposition , and his amazing power of self-sustainment ; for within himself , he looked on their condition as beyond all hope , and , in his own words , ` came out strong ' in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 11798 len. 55]: ` As to coming out as strong as I could wish , sir , ' he confided to Martin in a leisure moment ; that is to say , one evening , while he was washing the linen of the establishment , after a hard day 's work , ` that I give up .
Parsing [sent. 11799 len. 19]: It 's a piece of good fortune as never is to happen to me , I see ! '
Parsing [sent. 11800 len. 11]: ` Would you wish for circumstances stronger than these ? '
Parsing [sent. 11801 len. 11]: Martin retorted with a groan , from underneath his blanket .
Parsing [sent. 11802 len. 45]: ` Why , only see how easy they might have been stronger , sir , ' said Mark , ` if it was n't for the envy of that uncommon fortun of mine , which is always after me , and tripping me up .
Parsing [sent. 11803 len. 14]: The night we landed here , I thought things did look pretty jolly .
Parsing [sent. 11804 len. 6]: I wo n't deny it .
Parsing [sent. 11805 len. 9]: I thought they did look pretty jolly . '
Parsing [sent. 11806 len. 8]: ` How do they look now ? '
Parsing [sent. 11807 len. 3]: groaned Martin .
Parsing [sent. 11808 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 11809 len. 10]: said Mark , ` Ah , to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 11810 len. 5]: That 's the question .
Parsing [sent. 11811 len. 6]: How do they look now ?
Parsing [sent. 11812 len. 15]: On the very first morning of my going out , what do I do ?
Parsing [sent. 11813 len. 25]: Stumble on a family I know , who are constantly assisting of us in all sorts of ways , from that time to this !
Parsing [sent. 11814 len. 19]: That wo n't do , you know ; that ai n't what I 'd a right to expect .
Parsing [sent. 11815 len. 51]: If I had stumbled on a serpent and got bit ; or stumbled on a first-rate patriot , and got bowie-knifed , or stumbled on a lot of Sympathisers with inverted shirt-collars , and got made a lion of ; I might have distinguished myself , and earned some credit .
Parsing [sent. 11816 len. 16]: As it is , the great object of my voyage is knocked on the head .
Parsing [sent. 11817 len. 9]: So it would be , wherever I went .
Parsing [sent. 11818 len. 9]: How do you feel to-night , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11819 len. 10]: ` Worse than ever , ' said poor Martin .
Parsing [sent. 11820 len. 14]: ` That 's something , ' returned Mark , ` but not enough .
Parsing [sent. 11821 len. 20]: Nothing but being very bad myself , and jolly to the last , will ever do me justice . '
Parsing [sent. 11822 len. 21]: ` In Heaven 's name , do n't talk of that , ' said Martin with a thrill of terror .
Parsing [sent. 11823 len. 15]: ` What should I do , Mark , if you were taken ill ! '
Parsing [sent. 11824 len. 21]: Mr Tapley 's spirits appeared to be stimulated by this remark , although it was not a very flattering one .
Parsing [sent. 11825 len. 20]: He proceeded with his washing in a brighter mood ; and observed ` that his glass was arising . '
Parsing [sent. 11826 len. 47]: ` There 's one good thing in this place , sir , ' said Mr Tapley , scrubbing away at the linen , ` as disposes me to be jolly ; and that is that it 's a reg ` lar little United States in itself .
Parsing [sent. 11827 len. 34]: There 's two or three American settlers left ; and they coolly comes over one , even here , sir , as if it was the wholesomest and loveliest spot in the world .
Parsing [sent. 11828 len. 26]: But they 're like the cock that went and hid himself to save his life , and was found out by the noise he made .
Parsing [sent. 11829 len. 6]: They ca n't help crowing .
Parsing [sent. 11830 len. 19]: They was born to do it , and do it they must , whatever comes of it . '
Parsing [sent. 11831 len. 80]: Glancing from his work out at the door as he said these words , Mark 's eyes encountered a lean person in a blue frock and a straw hat , with a short black pipe in his mouth , and a great hickory stick studded all over with knots , in his hand ; who smoking and chewing as he came along , and spitting frequently , recorded his progress by a train of decomposed tobacco on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 11832 len. 16]: ` Here 's one on 'em , ' cried Mark , ` Hannibal Chollop . '
Parsing [sent. 11833 len. 13]: ` Do n't let him in , ' said Martin , feebly .
Parsing [sent. 11834 len. 13]: ` He wo n't want any letting in , ' replied Mark .
Parsing [sent. 11835 len. 9]: ` He 'll come in , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 11836 len. 12]: Which turned out to be quite true , for he did .
Parsing [sent. 11837 len. 18]: His face was almost as hard and knobby as his stick ; and so were his hands .
Parsing [sent. 11838 len. 9]: His head was like an old black hearth-broom .
Parsing [sent. 11839 len. 34]: He sat down on the chest with his hat on ; and crossing his legs and looking up at Mark , said , without removing his pipe : ` Well , Mr Co. !
Parsing [sent. 11840 len. 10]: and how do you git along , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11841 len. 21]: It may be necessary to observe that Mr Tapley had gravely introduced himself to all strangers , by that name .
Parsing [sent. 11842 len. 13]: ` Pretty well , sir ; pretty well , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 11843 len. 13]: ` If this ai n't Mr Chuzzlewit , ai n't it ! '
Parsing [sent. 11844 len. 13]: exclaimed the visitor ` How do YOU git along , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11845 len. 36]: Martin shook his head , and drew the blanket over it involuntarily ; for he felt that Hannibal was going to spit ; and his eye , as the song says , was upon him .
Parsing [sent. 11846 len. 17]: ` You need not regard me , sir , ' observed Mr Chollop , complacently . '
Parsing [sent. 11847 len. 9]: I am fever-proof , and likewise agur . '
Parsing [sent. 11848 len. 17]: ` Mine was a more selfish motive , ' said Martin , looking out again . '
Parsing [sent. 11849 len. 31]: I was afraid you were going to -- ' ' I can calc ` late my distance , sir , ' returned Mr Chollop , ` to an inch . '
Parsing [sent. 11850 len. 13]: With a proof of which happy faculty he immediately favoured him . '
Parsing [sent. 11851 len. 29]: I re-quire , sir , ' said Hannibal , ` two foot clear in a circ ` lar di-rection , and can engage my-self toe keep within it .
Parsing [sent. 11852 len. 22]: I HAVE gone ten foot , in a circ ` lar di-rection , but that was for a wager . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11853 len. 12]: I hope you won it , sir , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 11854 len. 14]: ` Well , sir , I realised the stakes , ' said Chollop .
Parsing [sent. 11855 len. 6]: ` Yes , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 11856 len. 28]: He was silent for a time , during which he was actively engaged in the formation of a magic circle round the chest on which he sat .
Parsing [sent. 11857 len. 11]: When it was completed , he began to talk again .
Parsing [sent. 11858 len. 11]: ` How do you like our country , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11859 len. 7]: he inquired , looking at Martin .
Parsing [sent. 11860 len. 12]: ` Not at all , ' was the invalid 's reply .
Parsing [sent. 11861 len. 19]: Chollop continued to smoke without the least appearance of emotion , until he felt disposed to speak again .
Parsing [sent. 11862 len. 28]: That time at length arriving , he took his pipe from his mouth , and said : ' I am not surprised to hear you say so .
Parsing [sent. 11863 len. 12]: It re-quires An elevation , and A preparation of the intellect .
Parsing [sent. 11864 len. 63]: The mind of man must be prepared for Freedom , Mr Co. ' He addressed himself to Mark ; because he saw that Martin , who wished him to go , being already half-mad with feverish irritation , which the droning voice of this new horror rendered almost insupportable , had closed his eyes , and turned on his uneasy bed . '
Parsing [sent. 11865 len. 33]: A little bodily preparation would n't be amiss , either , would it , sir , ' said Mark , ` in the case of a blessed old swamp like this ? '
Parsing [sent. 11866 len. 11]: ` Do you con-sider this a swamp , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11867 len. 4]: inquired Chollop gravely .
Parsing [sent. 11868 len. 11]: ` Why yes , sir , ' returned Mark . '
Parsing [sent. 11869 len. 10]: I have n't a doubt about it myself . '
Parsing [sent. 11870 len. 35]: ` The sentiment is quite Europian , ' said the major , ` and does not surprise me ; what would your English millions say to such a swamp in England , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11871 len. 34]: ` They 'd say it was an uncommon nasty one , I should think , said Mark ; ` and that they would rather be inoculated for fever in some other way . '
Parsing [sent. 11872 len. 4]: ` Europian ! '
Parsing [sent. 11873 len. 7]: remarked Chollop , with sardonic pity .
Parsing [sent. 11874 len. 5]: ` Quite Europian ! '
Parsing [sent. 11875 len. 5]: And there he sat .
Parsing [sent. 11876 len. 18]: Silent and cool , as if the house were his ; smoking away like a factory chimney .
Parsing [sent. 11877 len. 26]: Mr Chollop was , of course , one of the most remarkable men in the country ; but he really was a notorious person besides .
Parsing [sent. 11878 len. 62]: He was usually described by his friends , in the South and West , as ' a splendid sample of our na-tive raw material , sir , ' and was much esteemed for his devotion to rational Liberty ; for the better propagation whereof he usually carried a brace of revolving pistols in his coat pocket , with seven barrels a-piece .
Parsing [sent. 11879 len. 19]: He also carried , amongst other trinkets , a sword-stick , which he called his ` Tickler . '
Parsing [sent. 11880 len. 45]: and a great knife , which -LRB- for he was a man of a pleasant turn of humour -RRB- he called ` Ripper , ' in allusion to its usefulness as a means of ventilating the stomach of any adversary in a close contest .
Parsing [sent. 11881 len. 54]: He had used these weapons with distinguished effect in several instances , all duly chronicled in the newspapers ; and was greatly beloved for the gallant manner in which he had ` jobbed out ' the eye of one gentleman , as he was in the act of knocking at his own street-door .
Parsing [sent. 11882 len. 27]: Mr Chollop was a man of a roving disposition ; and , in any less advanced community , might have been mistaken for a violent vagabond .
Parsing [sent. 11883 len. 61]: But his fine qualities being perfectly understood and appreciated in those regions where his lot was cast , and where he had many kindred spirits to consort with , he may be regarded as having been born under a fortunate star , which is not always the case with a man so much before the age in which he lives .
Parsing [sent. 11884 len. 90]: Preferring , with a view to the gratification of his tickling and ripping fancies , to dwell upon the outskirts of society , and in the more remote towns and cities , he was in the habit of emigrating from place to place , and establishing in each some business -- usually a newspaper -- which he presently sold ; for the most part closing the bargain by challenging , stabbing , pistolling , or gouging the new editor , before he had quite taken possession of the property .
Parsing [sent. 11885 len. 23]: He had come to Eden on a speculation of this kind , but had abandoned it , and was about to leave .
Parsing [sent. 11886 len. 48]: He always introduced himself to strangers as a worshipper of Freedom ; was the consistent advocate of Lynch law , and slavery ; and invariably recommended , both in print and speech , the ` tarring and feathering ' of any unpopular person who differed from himself .
Parsing [sent. 11887 len. 18]: He called this ` planting the standard of civilization in the wilder gardens of My country . '
Parsing [sent. 11888 len. 60]: There is little doubt that Chollop would have planted this standard in Eden at Mark 's expense , in return for his plainness of speech -LRB- for the genuine Freedom is dumb , save when she vaunts herself -RRB- , but for the utter desolation and decay prevailing in the settlement , and his own approaching departure from it .
Parsing [sent. 11889 len. 25]: As it was , he contented himself with showing Mark one of the revolving-pistols , and asking him what he thought of that weapon .
Parsing [sent. 11890 len. 26]: ` It ai n't long since I shot a man down with that , sir , in the State of IllinOY , ' observed Chollop .
Parsing [sent. 11891 len. 7]: ` Did you , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 11892 len. 8]: said Mark , without the smallest agitation .
Parsing [sent. 11893 len. 6]: ` Very free of you .
Parsing [sent. 11894 len. 6]: And very independent ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 11895 len. 36]: I shot him down , sir , ' pursued Chollop , ` for asserting in the Spartan Portico , a tri-weekly journal , that the ancient Athenians went a-head of the present Locofoco Ticket . '
Parsing [sent. 11896 len. 7]: ` And what 's that ? '
Parsing [sent. 11897 len. 3]: asked Mark .
Parsing [sent. 11898 len. 13]: ` Europian not to know , ' said Chollop , smoking placidly .
Parsing [sent. 11899 len. 5]: ` Europian quite ! '
Parsing [sent. 11900 len. 34]: After a short devotion to the interests of the magic circle , he resumed the conversation by observing : ` You wo n't half feel yourself at home in Eden , now ? '
Parsing [sent. 11901 len. 13]: ` No , ' said Mark , ' I do n't . '
Parsing [sent. 11902 len. 9]: ` You miss the imposts of your country .
Parsing [sent. 11903 len. 7]: You miss the house dues ? '
Parsing [sent. 11904 len. 3]: observed Chollop .
Parsing [sent. 11905 len. 11]: ` And the houses -- rather , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 11906 len. 12]: ` No window dues here , sir , ' observed Chollop .
Parsing [sent. 11907 len. 13]: ` And no windows to put 'em on , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 11908 len. 29]: ` No stakes , no dungeons , no blocks , no racks , no scaffolds , no thumbscrews , no pikes , no pillories , ' said Chollop .
Parsing [sent. 11909 len. 11]: ` Nothing but rewolwers and bowie-knives , ' returned Mark .
Parsing [sent. 11910 len. 6]: ` And what are they ?
Parsing [sent. 11911 len. 5]: Not worth mentioning ! '
Parsing [sent. 11912 len. 26]: The man who had met them on the night of their arrival came crawling up at this juncture , and looked in at the door .
Parsing [sent. 11913 len. 9]: ` Well , sir , ' said Chollop .
Parsing [sent. 11914 len. 8]: ` How do YOU git along ? '
Parsing [sent. 11915 len. 17]: He had considerable difficulty in getting along at all , and said as much in reply .
Parsing [sent. 11916 len. 4]: ` Mr Co. .
Parsing [sent. 11917 len. 15]: And me , sir , ' observed Chollop , ` are disputating a piece .
Parsing [sent. 11918 len. 23]: He ought to be slicked up pretty smart to disputate between the Old World and the New , I do expect ? '
Parsing [sent. 11919 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 11920 len. 5]: returned the miserable shadow .
Parsing [sent. 11921 len. 7]: ` So he had . ' '
Parsing [sent. 11922 len. 36]: I was merely observing , sir , ' said Mark , addressing this new visitor , ` that I looked upon the city in which we have the honour to live , as being swampy .
Parsing [sent. 11923 len. 7]: What 's your sentiments ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 11924 len. 16]: I opinionate it 's moist perhaps , at certain times , ' returned the man .
Parsing [sent. 11925 len. 11]: ` But not as moist as England , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11926 len. 11]: cried Chollop , with a fierce expression in his face .
Parsing [sent. 11927 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 11928 len. 17]: Not as moist as England ; let alone its Institutions , ' said the man . '
Parsing [sent. 11929 len. 30]: I should hope there ai n't a swamp in all Americay , as do n't whip THAT small island into mush and molasses , ' observed Chollop , decisively .
Parsing [sent. 11930 len. 17]: ` You bought slick , straight , and right away , of Scadder , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11931 len. 3]: to Mark .
Parsing [sent. 11932 len. 6]: He answered in the affirmative .
Parsing [sent. 11933 len. 8]: Mr Chollop winked at the other citizen .
Parsing [sent. 11934 len. 9]: ` Scadder is a smart man , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 11935 len. 6]: He is a rising man ?
Parsing [sent. 11936 len. 18]: He is a man as will come up ` ards , right side up , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 11937 len. 9]: Mr Chollop winked again at the other citizen .
Parsing [sent. 11938 len. 21]: ` He should have his right side very high up , if I had my way , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 11939 len. 16]: ` As high up as the top of a good tall gallows , perhaps . '
Parsing [sent. 11940 len. 45]: Mr Chollop was so delighted at the smartness of his excellent countryman having been too much for the Britisher , and at the Britisher 's resenting it , that he could contain himself no longer , and broke forth in a shout of delight .
Parsing [sent. 11941 len. 77]: But the strangest exposition of this ruling passion was in the other -- the pestilence-stricken , broken , miserable shadow of a man -- who derived so much entertainment from the circumstance that he seemed to forget his own ruin in thinking of it , and laughed outright when he said ` that Scadder was a smart man , and had draw 'd a lot of British capital that way , as sure as sun-up . '
Parsing [sent. 11942 len. 82]: After a full enjoyment of this joke , Mr Hannibal Chollop sat smoking and improving the circle , without making any attempts either to converse or to take leave ; apparently labouring under the not uncommon delusion that for a free and enlightened citizen of the United States to convert another man 's house into a spittoon for two or three hours together , was a delicate attention , full of interest and politeness , of which nobody could ever tire .
Parsing [sent. 11943 len. 6]: At last he rose . '
Parsing [sent. 11944 len. 9]: I am a-going easy , ' he observed .
Parsing [sent. 11945 len. 10]: Mark entreated him to take particular care of himself .
Parsing [sent. 11946 len. 22]: ` Afore I go , ' he said sternly , ' I have got a leetle word to say to you .
Parsing [sent. 11947 len. 10]: You are darnation ` cute , you are . '
Parsing [sent. 11948 len. 7]: Mark thanked him for the compliment .
Parsing [sent. 11949 len. 11]: ` But you are much too ` cute to last .
Parsing [sent. 11950 len. 29]: I ca n't con-ceive of any spotted Painter in the bush , as ever was so riddled through and through as you will be , I bet . '
Parsing [sent. 11951 len. 5]: ` What for ? '
Parsing [sent. 11952 len. 3]: asked Mark .
Parsing [sent. 11953 len. 19]: ` We must be cracked up , sir , ' retorted Chollop , in a tone of menace .
Parsing [sent. 11954 len. 10]: ` You are not now in A despotic land .
Parsing [sent. 11955 len. 19]: We are a model to the airth , and must be jist cracked-up , I tell you . '
Parsing [sent. 11956 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 11957 len. 9]: I speak too free , do I ? '
Parsing [sent. 11958 len. 4]: cried Mark . '
Parsing [sent. 11959 len. 23]: I have draw 'd upon A man , and fired upon A man for less , ' said Chollop , frowning . '
Parsing [sent. 11960 len. 15]: I have know 'd strong men obleeged to make themselves uncommon skase for less .
Parsing [sent. 11961 len. 24]: I have know 'd men Lynched for less , and beaten into punkin ' - sarse for less , by an enlightened people .
Parsing [sent. 11962 len. 24]: We are the intellect and virtue of the airth , the cream of human natur ' , and the flower Of moral force .
Parsing [sent. 11963 len. 6]: Our backs is easy ris .
Parsing [sent. 11964 len. 13]: We must be cracked-up , or they rises , and we snarls .
Parsing [sent. 11965 len. 11]: We shows our teeth , I tell you , fierce .
Parsing [sent. 11966 len. 11]: You 'd better crack us up , you had ! '
Parsing [sent. 11967 len. 29]: After the delivery of this caution , Mr Chollop departed ; with Ripper , Tickler , and the revolvers , all ready for action on the shortest notice .
Parsing [sent. 11968 len. 19]: ` Come out from under the blanket , sir , ' said Mark , ` he 's gone .
Parsing [sent. 11969 len. 5]: What 's this ! '
Parsing [sent. 11970 len. 20]: he added softly ; kneeling down to look into his partner 's face , and taking his hot hand .
Parsing [sent. 11971 len. 11]: ` What 's come of all that chattering and swaggering ?
Parsing [sent. 11972 len. 15]: He 's wandering in his mind to-night , and do n't know me ! '
Parsing [sent. 11973 len. 11]: Martin indeed was dangerously ill ; very near his death .
Parsing [sent. 11974 len. 23]: He lay in that state many days , during which time Mark 's poor friends , regardless of themselves , attended him .
Parsing [sent. 11975 len. 50]: Mark , fatigued in mind and body ; working all the day and sitting up at night ; worn with hard living and the unaccustomed toil of his new life ; surrounded by dismal and discouraging circumstances of every kind ; never complained or yielded in the least degree .
Parsing [sent. 11976 len. 36]: If ever he had thought Martin selfish or inconsiderate , or had deemed him energetic only by fits and starts , and then too passive for their desperate fortunes , he now forgot it all .
Parsing [sent. 11977 len. 21]: He remembered nothing but the better qualities of his fellow-wanderer , and was devoted to him , heart and hand .
Parsing [sent. 11978 len. 41]: Many weeks elapsed before Martin was strong enough to move about with the help of a stick and Mark 's arm ; and even then his recovery , for want of wholesome air and proper nourishment , was very slow .
Parsing [sent. 11979 len. 22]: He was yet in a feeble and weak condition , when the misfourtune he had so much dreaded fell upon them .
Parsing [sent. 11980 len. 5]: Mark was taken ill .
Parsing [sent. 11981 len. 18]: Mark fought against it ; but the malady fought harder , and his efforts were in vain .
Parsing [sent. 11982 len. 25]: ` Floored for the present , sir , ' he said one morning , sinking back upon his bed ; ` but jolly ! '
Parsing [sent. 11983 len. 9]: Floored indeed , and by a heavy blow !
Parsing [sent. 11984 len. 10]: As any one but Martin might have known beforehand .
Parsing [sent. 11985 len. 25]: If Mark 's friends had been kind to Martin -LRB- and they had been very -RRB- , they were twenty times kinder to Mark .
Parsing [sent. 11986 len. 88]: And now it was Martin 's turn to work , and sit beside the bed and watch , and listen through the long , long nights , to every sound in the gloomy wilderness ; and hear poor Mr Tapley , in his wandering fancy , playing at skittles in the Dragon , making love-remonstrances to Mrs Lupin , getting his sea-legs on board the Screw , travelling with old Tom Pinch on English roads , and burning stumps of trees in Eden , all at once .
Parsing [sent. 11987 len. 49]: But whenever Martin gave him drink or medicine , or tended him in any way , or came into the house returning from some drudgery without , the patient Mr Tapley brightened up and cried : ` I 'm jolly , sir ; ` I 'm jolly ! '
Parsing [sent. 11988 len. 73]: Now , when Martin began to think of this , and to look at Mark as he lay there ; never reproaching him by so much as an expression of regret ; never murmuring ; always striving to be manful and staunch ; he began to think , how was it that this man who had had so few advantages , was so much better than he who had had so many ?
Parsing [sent. 11989 len. 44]: And attendance upon a sick bed , but especially the sick bed of one whom we have been accustomed to see in full activity and vigour , being a great breeder of reflection , he began to ask himself in what they differed .
Parsing [sent. 11990 len. 47]: He was assisted in coming to a conclusion on this head by the frequent presence of Mark 's friend , their fellow-passenger across the ocean , which suggested to him that in regard to having aided her , for example , they had differed very much .
Parsing [sent. 11991 len. 53]: Somehow he coupled Tom Pinch with this train of reflection ; and thinking that Tom would be very likely to have struck up the same sort of acquaintance under similar circumstances , began to think in what respects two people so extremely different were like each other , and were unlike him .
Parsing [sent. 11992 len. 22]: At first sight there was nothing very distressing in these meditations , but they did undoubtedly distress him for all that .
Parsing [sent. 11993 len. 41]: Martin 's nature was a frank and generous one ; but he had been bred up in his grandfather 's house ; and it will usually be found that the meaner domestic vices propagate themselves to be their own antagonists .
Parsing [sent. 11994 len. 17]: Selfishness does this especially ; so do suspicion , cunning , stealth , and covetous propensities .
Parsing [sent. 11995 len. 33]: Martin had unconsciously reasoned as a child , ` My guardian takes so much thought of himself , that unless I do the like by MYself , I shall be forgotten . '
Parsing [sent. 11996 len. 6]: So he had grown selfish .
Parsing [sent. 11997 len. 7]: But he had never known it .
Parsing [sent. 11998 len. 24]: If any one had taxed him with the vice , he would have indignantly repelled the accusation , and conceived himself unworthily aspersed .
Parsing [sent. 11999 len. 48]: He never would have known it , but that being newly risen from a bed of dangerous sickness , to watch by such another couch , he felt how nearly Self had dropped into the grave , and what a poor dependent , miserable thing it was .
Parsing [sent. 12000 len. 26]: It was natural for him to reflect -- he had months to do it in -- upon his own escape , and Mark 's extremity .
Parsing [sent. 12001 len. 17]: This led him to consider which of them could be the better spared , and why ?
Parsing [sent. 12002 len. 21]: Then the curtain slowly rose a very little way ; and Self , Self , Self , was shown below .
Parsing [sent. 12003 len. 48]: He asked himself , besides , when dreading Mark 's decease -LRB- as all men do and must , at such a time -RRB- , whether he had done his duty by him , and had deserved and made a good response to his fidelity and zeal .
Parsing [sent. 12004 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 12005 len. 47]: Short as their companionship had been , he felt in many , many instances , that there was blame against himself ; and still inquiring why , the curtain slowly rose a little more , and Self , Self , Self , dilated on the scene .
Parsing [sent. 12006 len. 84]: It was long before he fixed the knowledge of himself so firmly in his mind that he could thoroughly discern the truth ; but in the hideous solitude of that most hideous place , with Hope so far removed , Ambition quenched , and Death beside him rattling at the very door , reflection came , as in a plague-beleaguered town ; and so he felt and knew the failing of his life , and saw distinctly what an ugly spot it was .
Parsing [sent. 12007 len. 37]: Eden was a hard school to learn so hard a lesson in ; but there were teachers in the swamp and thicket , and the pestilential air , who had a searching method of their own .
Parsing [sent. 12008 len. 44]: He made a solemn resolution that when his strength returned he would not dispute the point or resist the conviction , but would look upon it as an established fact , that selfishness was in his breast , and must be rooted out .
Parsing [sent. 12009 len. 67]: He was so doubtful -LRB- and with justice -RRB- of his own character , that he determined not to say one word of vain regret or good resolve to Mark , but steadily to keep his purpose before his own eyes solely ; and there was not a jot of pride in this ; nothing but humility and steadfastness ; the best armour he could wear .
Parsing [sent. 12010 len. 8]: So low had Eden brought him down .
Parsing [sent. 12011 len. 8]: So high had Eden raised him up .
Parsing [sent. 12012 len. 29]: After a long and lingering illness -LRB- in certain forlorn stages of which , when too far gone to speak , he had feebly written ` jolly ! '
Parsing [sent. 12013 len. 13]: on a slate -RRB- , Mark showed some symptoms of returning health .
Parsing [sent. 12014 len. 31]: They came and went , and flickered for a time ; but he began to mend at last decidedly ; and after that continued to improve from day to day .
Parsing [sent. 12015 len. 45]: As soon as he was well enough to talk without fatigue , Martin consulted him upon a project he had in his mind , and which a few months back he would have carried into execution without troubling anybody 's head but his own .
Parsing [sent. 12016 len. 11]: ` Ours is a desperate case , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12017 len. 3]: ` Plainly .
Parsing [sent. 12018 len. 34]: The place is deserted ; its failure must have become known ; and selling what we have bought to any one , for anything , is hopeless , even if it were honest .
Parsing [sent. 12019 len. 12]: We left home on a mad enterprise , and have failed .
Parsing [sent. 12020 len. 32]: The only hope left us , the only one end for which we have now to try , is to quit this settlement for ever , and get back to England .
Parsing [sent. 12021 len. 2]: Anyhow !
Parsing [sent. 12022 len. 4]: by any means !
Parsing [sent. 12023 len. 9]: only to get back there , Mark . '
Parsing [sent. 12024 len. 25]: ` That 's all , sir , ' returned Mr Tapley , with a significant stress upon the words ; ` only that ! '
Parsing [sent. 12025 len. 33]: ` Now , upon this side of the water , ' said Martin , ` we have but one friend who can help us , and that is Mr Bevan . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12026 len. 13]: I thought of him when you was ill , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 12027 len. 45]: ` But for the time that would be lost , I would even write to my grandfather , ' Martin went on to say , ` and implore him for money to free us from this trap into which we were so cruelly decoyed .
Parsing [sent. 12028 len. 8]: Shall I try Mr Bevan first ? '
Parsing [sent. 12029 len. 16]: ` He 's a very pleasant sort of a gentleman , ' said Mark . '
Parsing [sent. 12030 len. 5]: I think so . '
Parsing [sent. 12031 len. 37]: ` The few goods we brought here , and in which we spent our money , would produce something if sold , ' resumed Martin ; ` and whatever they realise shall be paid him instantly .
Parsing [sent. 12032 len. 9]: But they ca n't be sold here . '
Parsing [sent. 12033 len. 28]: ` There 's nobody but corpses to buy 'em , ' said Mr Tapley , shaking his head with a rueful air , ` and pigs . '
Parsing [sent. 12034 len. 46]: ` Shall I tell him so , and only ask him for money enough to enable us by the cheapest means to reach New York , or any port from which we may hope to get a passage home , by serving in any capacity ?
Parsing [sent. 12035 len. 34]: Explaining to him at the same time how I am connected , and that I will endeavour to repay him , even through my grandfather , immediately on our arrival in England ? '
Parsing [sent. 12036 len. 23]: ` Why to be sure , ' said Mark : ` he can only say no , and he may say yes .
Parsing [sent. 12037 len. 15]: If you do n't mind trying him , sir -- ' ` Mind ! '
Parsing [sent. 12038 len. 4]: exclaimed Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 12039 len. 17]: I am to blame for coming here , and I would do anything to get away .
Parsing [sent. 12040 len. 8]: I grieve to think of the past .
Parsing [sent. 12041 len. 22]: If I had taken your opinion sooner , Mark , we never should have been here , I am certain . '
Parsing [sent. 12042 len. 50]: Mr Tapley was very much surprised at this admission , but protested , with great vehemence , that they would have been there all the same ; and that he had set his heart upon coming to Eden , from the first word he had ever heard of it .
Parsing [sent. 12043 len. 16]: Martin then read him a letter to Mr Bevan , which he had already prepared .
Parsing [sent. 12044 len. 34]: It was frankly and ingenuously written , and described their situation without the least concealment ; plainly stated the miseries they had undergone ; and preferred their request in modest but straightforward terms .
Parsing [sent. 12045 len. 39]: Mark highly commended it ; and they determined to dispatch it by the next steamboat going the right way , that might call to take in wood at Eden -- where there was plenty of wood to spare .
Parsing [sent. 12046 len. 44]: Not knowing how to address Mr Bevan at his own place of abode , Martin superscribed it to the care of the memorable Mr Norris of New York , and wrote upon the cover an entreaty that it might be forwarded without delay .
Parsing [sent. 12047 len. 50]: More than a week elapsed before a boat appeared ; but at length they were awakened very early one morning by the high-pressure snorting of the ` Esau Slodge ; ' named after one of the most remarkable men in the country , who had been very eminent somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 12048 len. 94]: Hurrying down to the landing-place , they got it safe on board ; and waiting anxiously to see the boat depart , stopped up the gangway ; an instance of neglect which caused the ` Capting ' of the Esau Slodge to ` wish he might be sifted fine as flour , and whittled small as chips ; that if they did n't come off that there fixing right smart too , he 'd spill 'em in the drink ; ' whereby the Capting metaphorically said he 'd throw them in the river .
Parsing [sent. 12049 len. 17]: They were not likely to receive an answer for eight or ten weeks at the earliest .
Parsing [sent. 12050 len. 31]: In the meantime they devoted such strength as they had to the attempted improvement of their land ; to clearing some of it , and preparing it for useful purposes .
Parsing [sent. 12051 len. 72]: Monstrously defective as their farming was , still it was better than their neighbours ' ; for Mark had some practical knowledge of such matters , and Martin learned of him ; whereas the other settlers who remained upon the putrid swamp -LRB- a mere handful , and those withered by disease -RRB- , appeared to have wandered there with the idea that husbandry was the natural gift of all mankind .
Parsing [sent. 12052 len. 34]: They helped each other after their own manner in these struggles , and in all others ; but they worked as hopelessly and sadly as a gang of convicts in a penal settlement .
Parsing [sent. 12053 len. 58]: Often at night when Mark and Martin were alone , and lying down to sleep , they spoke of home , familiar places , houses , roads , and people whom they knew ; sometimes in the lively hope of seeing them again , and sometimes with a sorrowful tranquillity , as if that hope were dead .
Parsing [sent. 12054 len. 25]: It was a source of great amazement to Mark Tapley to find , pervading all these conversations , a singular alteration in Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 12055 len. 24]: I do n't know what to make of him , ' he thought one night , ` he ai n't what I supposed .
Parsing [sent. 12056 len. 10]: He do n't think of himself half as much .
Parsing [sent. 12057 len. 6]: I 'll try him again .
Parsing [sent. 12058 len. 5]: Asleep , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 12059 len. 6]: ` No , Mark . '
Parsing [sent. 12060 len. 8]: ` Thinking of home , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 12061 len. 6]: ` Yes , Mark . '
Parsing [sent. 12062 len. 7]: ` So was I , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12063 len. 14]: I was wondering how Mr Pinch and Mr Pecksniff gets on now . '
Parsing [sent. 12064 len. 5]: ` Poor Tom ! '
Parsing [sent. 12065 len. 5]: said Martin , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 12066 len. 11]: ` Weak-minded man , sir , ' observed Mr Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 12067 len. 9]: ` Plays the organ for nothing , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12068 len. 8]: Takes no care of himself ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12069 len. 14]: I wish he took a little more , indeed , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12070 len. 10]: ` Though I do n't know why I should .
Parsing [sent. 12071 len. 12]: We should n't like him half as well , perhaps . '
Parsing [sent. 12072 len. 12]: ` He gets put upon , sir , ' hinted Mark .
Parsing [sent. 12073 len. 4]: ` Yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 12074 len. 9]: said Martin , after a short silence . '
Parsing [sent. 12075 len. 7]: I know that , Mark . '
Parsing [sent. 12076 len. 25]: He spoke so regretfully that his partner abandoned the theme , and was silent for a short time until he had thought of another .
Parsing [sent. 12077 len. 6]: ` Ah , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 12078 len. 7]: said Mark , with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 12079 len. 4]: ` Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 12080 len. 15]: You 've ventured a good deal for a young lady 's love ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 12081 len. 5]: I tell you what .
Parsing [sent. 12082 len. 33]: I 'm not so sure of that , Mark , ' was the reply ; so hastily and energetically spoken , that Martin sat up in his bed to give it . '
Parsing [sent. 12083 len. 10]: I begin to be far from clear upon it .
Parsing [sent. 12084 len. 10]: You may depend upon it she is very unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 12085 len. 39]: She has sacrificed her peace of mind ; she has endangered her interests very much ; she ca n't run away from those who are jealous of her , and opposed to her , as I have done .
Parsing [sent. 12086 len. 18]: She has to endure , Mark ; to endure without the possibility of action , poor girl !
Parsing [sent. 12087 len. 15]: I begin to think that she has more to bear than ever I had .
Parsing [sent. 12088 len. 7]: Upon my soul I do ! '
Parsing [sent. 12089 len. 15]: Mr Tapley opened his eyes wide in the dark ; but did not interrupt .
Parsing [sent. 12090 len. 23]: ` And I 'll tell you a secret , Mark , ' said Martin , ` since we ARE upon this subject .
Parsing [sent. 12091 len. 11]: That ring -- ' ` Which ring , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 12092 len. 9]: Mark inquired , opening his eyes still wider .
Parsing [sent. 12093 len. 12]: ` That ring she gave me when we parted , Mark .
Parsing [sent. 12094 len. 18]: She bought it ; bought it ; knowing I was poor and proud -LRB- Heaven help me !
Parsing [sent. 12095 len. 3]: Proud ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 12096 len. 5]: and wanted money . '
Parsing [sent. 12097 len. 8]: ` Who says so , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 12098 len. 4]: asked Mark . '
Parsing [sent. 12099 len. 4]: I say so .
Parsing [sent. 12100 len. 4]: I know it .
Parsing [sent. 12101 len. 19]: I thought of it , my good fellow , hundreds of times , while you were lying ill .
Parsing [sent. 12102 len. 47]: And like a beast , I took it from her hand , and wore it on my own , and never dreamed of this even at the moment when I parted with it , when some faint glimmering of the truth might surely have possessed me !
Parsing [sent. 12103 len. 23]: But it 's late , ' said Martin , checking himself , ` and you are weak and tired , I know .
Parsing [sent. 12104 len. 8]: You only talk to cheer me up .
Parsing [sent. 12105 len. 3]: Good night !
Parsing [sent. 12106 len. 7]: God bless you , Mark ! '
Parsing [sent. 12107 len. 7]: ` God bless you , sir !
Parsing [sent. 12108 len. 20]: But I 'm reg ` larly defrauded , ' thought Mr Tapley , turning round with a happy face .
Parsing [sent. 12109 len. 6]: ` It 's a swindle .
Parsing [sent. 12110 len. 9]: I never entered for this sort of service .
Parsing [sent. 12111 len. 12]: There 'll be no credit in being jolly with HIM ! '
Parsing [sent. 12112 len. 33]: The time wore on , and other steamboats coming from the point on which their hopes were fixed , arrived to take in wood ; but still no answer to the letter .
Parsing [sent. 12113 len. 23]: Rain , heat , foul slime , and noxious vapour , with all the ills and filthy things they bred , prevailed .
Parsing [sent. 12114 len. 22]: The earth , the air , the vegetation , and the water that they drank , all teemed with deadly properties .
Parsing [sent. 12115 len. 15]: Their fellow-passenger had lost two children long before ; and buried now her last .
Parsing [sent. 12116 len. 14]: Such things are much too common to be widely known or cared for .
Parsing [sent. 12117 len. 16]: Smart citizens grow rich , and friendless victims smart and die , and are forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 12118 len. 4]: That is all .
Parsing [sent. 12119 len. 16]: At last a boat came panting up the ugly river , and stopped at Eden .
Parsing [sent. 12120 len. 22]: Mark was waiting at the wood hut when it came , and had a letter handed to him from on board .
Parsing [sent. 12121 len. 7]: He bore it off to Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12122 len. 8]: They looked at one another , trembling .
Parsing [sent. 12123 len. 9]: ` It feels heavy , ' faltered Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12124 len. 14]: And opening it a little roll of dollar-notes fell out upon the ground .
Parsing [sent. 12125 len. 20]: What either of them said , or did , or felt , at first , neither of them knew .
Parsing [sent. 12126 len. 38]: All Mark could ever tell was , that he was at the river 's bank again out of breath , before the boat had gone , inquiring when it would retrace its track and put in there .
Parsing [sent. 12127 len. 28]: The answer was , in ten or twelve days ; notwithstanding which they began to get their goods together and to tie them up that very night .
Parsing [sent. 12128 len. 34]: When this stage of excitement was passed , each of them believed -LRB- they found this out , in talking of it afterwards -RRB- that he would surely die before the boat returned .
Parsing [sent. 12129 len. 18]: They lived , however , and it came , after the lapse of three long crawling weeks .
Parsing [sent. 12130 len. 14]: At sunrise , on an autumn day , they stood upon her deck .
Parsing [sent. 12131 len. 3]: ` Courage !
Parsing [sent. 12132 len. 6]: We shall meet again ! '
Parsing [sent. 12133 len. 14]: cried Martin , waving his hand to two thin figures on the bank .
Parsing [sent. 12134 len. 7]: ` In the Old World ! '
Parsing [sent. 12135 len. 14]: ` Or in the next one , ' added Mark below his breath .
Parsing [sent. 12136 len. 22]: ` To see them standing side by side , so quiet , is a ` most the worst of all ! '
Parsing [sent. 12137 len. 24]: They looked at one another as the vessel moved away , and then looked backward at the spot from which it hurried fast .
Parsing [sent. 12138 len. 57]: The log-house , with the open door , and drooping trees about it ; the stagnant morning mist , and red sun , dimly seen beyond ; the vapour rising up from land and river ; the quick stream making the loathsome banks it washed more flat and dull ; how often they returned in dreams !
Parsing [sent. 12139 len. 15]: How often it was happiness to wake and find them Shadows that had vanished !
Parsing [sent. 12140 len. 66]: CHAPTER THIRTY -- FOUR IN WHICH THE TRAVELLERS MOVE HOMEWARD , AND ENCOUNTER SOME DISTINGUISHED CHARACTERS UPON THE WAY Among the passengers on board the steamboat , there was a faint gentleman sitting on a low camp-stool , with his legs on a high barrel of flour , as if he were looking at the prospect with his ankles , who attracted their attention speedily .
Parsing [sent. 12141 len. 59]: He had straight black hair , parted up the middle of his head and hanging down upon his coat ; a little fringe of hair upon his chin ; wore no neckcloth ; a white hat ; a suit of black , long in the sleeves and short in the legs ; soiled brown stockings and laced shoes .
Parsing [sent. 12142 len. 48]: His complexion , naturally muddy , was rendered muddier by too strict an economy of soap and water ; and the same observation will apply to the washable part of his attire , which he might have changed with comfort to himself and gratification to his friends .
Parsing [sent. 12143 len. 35]: He was about five and thirty ; was crushed and jammed up in a heap , under the shade of a large green cotton umbrella ; and ruminated over his tobacco-plug like a cow .
Parsing [sent. 12144 len. 38]: He was not singular , to be sure , in these respects ; for every gentleman on board appeared to have had a difference with his laundress and to have left off washing himself in early youth .
Parsing [sent. 12145 len. 24]: Every gentleman , too , was perfectly stopped up with tight plugging , and was dislocated in the greater part of his joints .
Parsing [sent. 12146 len. 33]: But about this gentleman there was a peculiar air of sagacity and wisdom , which convinced Martin that he was no common character ; and this turned out to be the case .
Parsing [sent. 12147 len. 8]: ` How do you do sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 12148 len. 15]: said a voice in Martin 's ear ` How do you do sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 12149 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12150 len. 33]: It was a tall thin gentleman who spoke to him , with a carpet-cap on , and a long loose coat of green baize , ornamented about the pockets with black velvet .
Parsing [sent. 12151 len. 10]: ` You air from Europe , sir ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12152 len. 7]: I am , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12153 len. 8]: ` You air fortunate , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 12154 len. 21]: Martin thought so too ; but he soon discovered that the gentleman and he attached different meanings to this remark .
Parsing [sent. 12155 len. 20]: ` You air fortunate , sir , in having an opportunity of beholding our Elijah Pogram , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 12156 len. 5]: ` Your Elijahpogram ! '
Parsing [sent. 12157 len. 17]: said Martin , thinking it was all one word , and a building of some sort .
Parsing [sent. 12158 len. 5]: ` Yes sir . '
Parsing [sent. 12159 len. 18]: Martin tried to look as if he understood him , but he could n't make it out .
Parsing [sent. 12160 len. 10]: ` Yes , sir , ' repeated the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 12161 len. 22]: ` our Elijah Pogram , sir , is , at this minute , identically settin ' by the en-gine biler . '
Parsing [sent. 12162 len. 22]: The gentleman under the umbrella put his right forefinger to his eyebrow , as if he were revolving schemes of state .
Parsing [sent. 12163 len. 10]: ` That is Elijah Pogram , is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 12164 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12165 len. 10]: ` Yes , sir , ' replied the other .
Parsing [sent. 12166 len. 7]: ` That is Elijah Pogram . '
Parsing [sent. 12167 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 12168 len. 4]: said Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 12169 len. 5]: I am astonished . '
Parsing [sent. 12170 len. 23]: But he had not the least idea who this Elijah Pogram was ; having never heard the name in all his life .
Parsing [sent. 12171 len. 58]: ` If the biler of this vessel was Toe bust , sir , ' said his new acquaintance , ` and Toe bust now , this would be a festival day in the calendar of despotism ; pretty nigh equallin ' , sir , in its effects upon the human race , our Fourth of glorious July .
Parsing [sent. 12172 len. 25]: Yes , sir , that is the Honourable Elijah Pogram , Member of Congress ; one of the master-minds of our country , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12173 len. 10]: There is a brow , sir , there ! '
Parsing [sent. 12174 len. 8]: ` Quite remarkable , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12175 len. 5]: ` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12176 len. 41]: Our own immortal Chiggle , sir , is said to have observed , when he made the celebrated Pogram statter in marble , which rose so much con-test and preju-dice in Europe , that the brow was more than mortal .
Parsing [sent. 12177 len. 19]: This was before the Pogram Defiance , and was , therefore , a pre-diction , cruel smart . '
Parsing [sent. 12178 len. 8]: ` What is the Pogram Defiance ? '
Parsing [sent. 12179 len. 15]: asked Martin , thinking , perhaps , it was the sign of a public-house .
Parsing [sent. 12180 len. 11]: ` An o-ration , sir , ' returned his friend .
Parsing [sent. 12181 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 12182 len. 8]: to be sure , ' cried Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12183 len. 7]: ` What am I thinking of !
Parsing [sent. 12184 len. 19]: It defied -- ' ` It defied the world , sir , ' said the other , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 12185 len. 29]: ` Defied the world in general to com-pete with our country upon any hook ; and devellop 'd our internal resources for making war upon the universal airth .
Parsing [sent. 12186 len. 11]: You would like to know Elijah Pogram , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 12187 len. 9]: ` If you please , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12188 len. 34]: ` Mr Pogram , ' said the stranger -- Mr Pogram having overheard every word of the dialogue -- ` this is a gentleman from Europe , sir ; from England , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12189 len. 19]: But gen ` rous ene-mies may meet upon the neutral sile of private life , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 12190 len. 19]: The languid Mr Pogram shook hands with Martin , like a clock-work figure that was just running down .
Parsing [sent. 12191 len. 14]: But he made amends by chewing like one that was just wound up .
Parsing [sent. 12192 len. 17]: ` Mr Pogram , ' said the introducer , ` is a public servant , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12193 len. 24]: When Congress is recessed , he makes himself acquainted with those free United States , of which he is the gifted son . '
Parsing [sent. 12194 len. 46]: It occurred to Martin that if the Honourable Elijah Pogram had stayed at home , and sent his shoes upon a tour , they would have answered the same purpose ; for they were the only part of him in a situation to see anything .
Parsing [sent. 12195 len. 53]: In course of time , however , Mr Pogram rose ; and having ejected certain plugging consequences which would have impeded his articulation , took up a position where there was something to lean against , and began to talk to Martin ; shading himself with the green umbrella all the time .
Parsing [sent. 12196 len. 15]: As he began with the words , ` How do you like -- ? '
Parsing [sent. 12197 len. 15]: Martin took him up and said : ` The country , I presume ? '
Parsing [sent. 12198 len. 10]: ` Yes , sir , ' said Elijah Pogram .
Parsing [sent. 12199 len. 43]: A knot of passengers gathered round to hear what followed ; and Martin heard his friend say , as he whispered to another friend , and rubbed his hands , ` Pogram will smash him into sky-blue fits , I know ! '
Parsing [sent. 12200 len. 36]: ` Why , ' said Martin , after a moment 's hesitation , ' I have learned by experience , that you take an unfair advantage of a stranger , when you ask that question .
Parsing [sent. 12201 len. 14]: You do n't mean it to be answered , except in one way .
Parsing [sent. 12202 len. 24]: Now , I do n't choose to answer it in that way , for I can not honestly answer it in that way .
Parsing [sent. 12203 len. 13]: And therefore , I would rather not answer it at all . '
Parsing [sent. 12204 len. 86]: But Mr Pogram was going to make a great speech in the next session about foreign relations , and was going to write strong articles on the subject ; and as he greatly favoured the free and independent custom -LRB- a very harmless and agreeable one -RRB- of procuring information of any sort in any kind of confidence , and afterwards perverting it publicly in any manner that happened to suit him , he had determined to get at Martin 's opinions somehow or other .
Parsing [sent. 12205 len. 28]: For if he could have got nothing out of him , he would have had to invent it for him , and that would have been laborious .
Parsing [sent. 12206 len. 14]: He made a mental note of his answer , and went in again .
Parsing [sent. 12207 len. 8]: ` You are from Eden , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 12208 len. 7]: How did you like Eden ? '
Parsing [sent. 12209 len. 17]: Martin said what he thought of that part of the country , in pretty strong terms .
Parsing [sent. 12210 len. 26]: ` It is strange , ' said Pogram , looking round upon the group , ` this hatred of our country , and her Institutions !
Parsing [sent. 12211 len. 12]: This national antipathy is deeply rooted in the British mind ! '
Parsing [sent. 12212 len. 10]: ` Good Heaven , sir , ' cried Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12213 len. 31]: ` Is the Eden Land Corporation , with Mr Scadder at its head , and all the misery it has worked , at its door , an Institution of America ?
Parsing [sent. 12214 len. 17]: A part of any form of government that ever was known or heard of ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12215 len. 53]: I con-sider the cause of this to be , ' said Pogram , looking round again and taking himself up where Martin had interrupted him , ` partly jealousy and pre-judice , and partly the nat ` ral unfitness of the British people to appreciate the ex-alted Institutions of our native land .
Parsing [sent. 12216 len. 31]: I expect , sir , ' turning to Martin again , ` that a gentleman named Chollop happened in upon you during your lo-cation in the town of Eden ? '
Parsing [sent. 12217 len. 28]: ` Yes , ' answered Martin ; ` but my friend can answer this better than I can , for I was very ill at the time .
Parsing [sent. 12218 len. 2]: Mark !
Parsing [sent. 12219 len. 9]: The gentleman is speaking of Mr Chollop . '
Parsing [sent. 12220 len. 3]: ` Oh .
Parsing [sent. 12221 len. 4]: Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12222 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 12223 len. 9]: I see him , ' observed Mark . '
Parsing [sent. 12224 len. 12]: A splendid example of our na-tive raw material , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 12225 len. 5]: said Pogram , interrogatively .
Parsing [sent. 12226 len. 6]: ` Indeed , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 12227 len. 3]: cried Mark .
Parsing [sent. 12228 len. 19]: The Honourable Elijah Pogram glanced at his friends as though he would have said , ` Observe this !
Parsing [sent. 12229 len. 5]: See what follows ! '
Parsing [sent. 12230 len. 13]: and they rendered tribute to the Pogram genius by a gentle murmur .
Parsing [sent. 12231 len. 18]: ` Our fellow-countryman is a model of a man , quite fresh from Natur 's mould ! '
Parsing [sent. 12232 len. 6]: said Pogram , with enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 12233 len. 11]: ` He is a true-born child of this free hemisphere !
Parsing [sent. 12234 len. 28]: Verdant as the mountains of our country ; bright and flowing as our mineral Licks ; unspiled by withering conventionalities as air our broad and boundless Perearers !
Parsing [sent. 12235 len. 5]: Rough he may be .
Parsing [sent. 12236 len. 5]: So air our Barrs .
Parsing [sent. 12237 len. 5]: Wild he may be .
Parsing [sent. 12238 len. 5]: So air our Buffalers .
Parsing [sent. 12239 len. 38]: But he is a child of Natur ' , and a child of Freedom ; and his boastful answer to the Despot and the Tyrant is , that his bright home is in the Settin Sun . '
Parsing [sent. 12240 len. 72]: Part of this referred to Chollop , and part to a Western postmaster , who , being a public defaulter not very long before -LRB- a character not at all uncommon in America -RRB- , had been removed from office ; and on whose behalf Mr Pogram -LRB- he voted for Pogram -RRB- had thundered the last sentence from his seat in Congress , at the head of an unpopular President .
Parsing [sent. 12241 len. 43]: It told brilliantly ; for the bystanders were delighted , and one of them said to Martin , ` that he guessed he had now seen something of the eloquential aspect of our country , and was chawed up pritty small . '
Parsing [sent. 12242 len. 27]: Mr Pogram waited until his hearers were calm again , before he said to Mark : ` You do not seem to coincide , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 12243 len. 23]: ` Why , ' said Mark , ' I did n't like him much ; and that 's the truth , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12244 len. 29]: I thought he was a bully ; and I did n't admire his carryin ' them murderous little persuaders , and being so ready to use 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 12245 len. 6]: ` It 's singler ! '
Parsing [sent. 12246 len. 16]: said Pogram , lifting his umbrella high enough to look all round from under it .
Parsing [sent. 12247 len. 5]: ` It 's strange !
Parsing [sent. 12248 len. 15]: You observe the settled opposition to our Institutions which pervades the British mind ! '
Parsing [sent. 12249 len. 9]: ` What an extraordinary people you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 12250 len. 3]: cried Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12251 len. 14]: ` Are Mr Chollop and the class he represents , an Institution here ?
Parsing [sent. 12252 len. 21]: Are pistols with revolving barrels , sword-sticks , bowie-knives , and such things , Institutions on which you pride yourselves ?
Parsing [sent. 12253 len. 21]: Are bloody duels , brutal combats , savage assaults , shooting down and stabbing in the streets , your Institutions !
Parsing [sent. 12254 len. 20]: Why , I shall hear next that Dishonour and Fraud are among the Institutions of the great republic ! '
Parsing [sent. 12255 len. 16]: The moment the words passed his lips , the Honourable Elijah Pogram looked round again .
Parsing [sent. 12256 len. 22]: ` This morbid hatred of our Institutions , ' he observed , ` is quite a study for the psychological observer .
Parsing [sent. 12257 len. 9]: He 's alludin ' to Repudiation now ! '
Parsing [sent. 12258 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 12259 len. 33]: you may make anything an Institution if you like , ' said Martin , laughing , ` and I confess you had me there , for you certainly have made that one .
Parsing [sent. 12260 len. 26]: But the greater part of these things are one Institution with us , and we call it by the generic name of Old Bailey ! '
Parsing [sent. 12261 len. 54]: The bell being rung for dinner at this moment , everybody ran away into the cabin , whither the Honourable Elijah Pogram fled with such precipitation that he forgot his umbrella was up , and fixed it so tightly in the cabin door that it could neither be let down nor got out .
Parsing [sent. 12262 len. 78]: For a minute or so this accident created a perfect rebellion among the hungry passengers behind , who , seeing the dishes , and hearing the knives and forks at work , well knew what would happen unless they got there instantly , and were nearly mad ; while several virtuous citizens at the table were in deadly peril of choking themselves in their unnatural efforts to get rid of all the meat before these others came .
Parsing [sent. 12263 len. 16]: They carried the umbrella by storm , however , and rushed in at the breach .
Parsing [sent. 12264 len. 57]: The Honourable Elijah Pogram and Martin found themselves , after a severe struggle , side by side , as they might have come together in the pit of a London theatre ; and for four whole minutes afterwards , Pogram was snapping up great blocks of everything he could get hold of , like a raven .
Parsing [sent. 12265 len. 40]: When he had taken this unusually protracted dinner , he began to talk to Martin ; and begged him not to have the least delicacy in speaking with perfect freedom to him , for he was a calm philosopher .
Parsing [sent. 12266 len. 54]: Which Martin was extremely glad to hear ; for he had begun to speculate on Elijah being a disciple of that other school of republican philosophy , whose noble sentiments are carved with knives upon a pupil 's body , and written , not with pen and ink , but tar and feathers .
Parsing [sent. 12267 len. 15]: ` What do you think of my countrymen who are present , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 12268 len. 4]: inquired Elijah Pogram .
Parsing [sent. 12269 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 12270 len. 7]: very pleasant , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12271 len. 7]: They were a very pleasant party .
Parsing [sent. 12272 len. 34]: No man had spoken a word ; every one had been intent , as usual , on his own private gorging ; and the greater part of the company were decidedly dirty feeders .
Parsing [sent. 12273 len. 22]: The Honourable Elijah Pogram looked at Martin as if he thought ` You do n't mean that , I know ! '
Parsing [sent. 12274 len. 9]: and he was soon confirmed in this opinion .
Parsing [sent. 12275 len. 96]: Sitting opposite to them was a gentleman in a high state of tobacco , who wore quite a little beard , composed of the overflowing of that weed , as they had dried about his mouth and chin ; so common an ornament that it would scarcely have attracted Martin 's observation , but that this good citizen , burning to assert his equality against all comers , sucked his knife for some moments , and made a cut with it at the butter , just as Martin was in the act of taking some .
Parsing [sent. 12276 len. 14]: There was a juiciness about the deed that might have sickened a scavenger .
Parsing [sent. 12277 len. 36]: When Elijah Pogram -LRB- to whom this was an every-day incident -RRB- saw that Martin put the plate away , and took no butter , he was quite delighted , and said , ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 12278 len. 18]: The morbid hatred of you British to the Institutions of our country is as -- TONishing ! '
Parsing [sent. 12279 len. 6]: ` Upon my life ! '
Parsing [sent. 12280 len. 7]: cried Martin , in his turn .
Parsing [sent. 12281 len. 11]: ` This is the most wonderful community that ever existed .
Parsing [sent. 12282 len. 16]: A man deliberately makes a hog of himself , and THAT 'S an Institution ! '
Parsing [sent. 12283 len. 16]: ` We have no time to ac-quire forms , sir , ' said Elijah Pogram .
Parsing [sent. 12284 len. 4]: ` Acquire ! '
Parsing [sent. 12285 len. 3]: cried Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12286 len. 11]: ` But it 's not a question of acquiring anything .
Parsing [sent. 12287 len. 29]: It 's a question of losing the natural politeness of a savage , and that instinctive good breeding which admonishes one man not to offend and disgust another .
Parsing [sent. 12288 len. 35]: Do n't you think that man over the way , for instance , naturally knows better , but considers it a very fine and independent thing to be a brute in small matters ? '
Parsing [sent. 12289 len. 26]: ` He is a na-tive of our country , and is nat ` rally bright and spry , of course , ' said Mr Pogram .
Parsing [sent. 12290 len. 16]: ` Now , observe what this comes to , Mr Pogram , ' pursued Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12291 len. 44]: ` The mass of your countrymen begin by stubbornly neglecting little social observances , which have nothing to do with gentility , custom , usage , government , or country , but are acts of common , decent , natural , human politeness .
Parsing [sent. 12292 len. 23]: You abet them in this , by resenting all attacks upon their social offences as if they were a beautiful national feature .
Parsing [sent. 12293 len. 22]: From disregarding small obligations they come in regular course to disregard great ones ; and so refuse to pay their debts .
Parsing [sent. 12294 len. 54]: What they may do , or what they may refuse to do next , I do n't know ; but any man may see if he will , that it will be something following in natural succession , and a part of one great growth , which is rotten at the root . '
Parsing [sent. 12295 len. 40]: The mind of Mr Pogram was too philosophical to see this ; so they went on deck again , where , resuming his former post , he chewed until he was in a lethargic state , amounting to insensibility .
Parsing [sent. 12296 len. 32]: After a weary voyage of several days , they came again to that same wharf where Mark had been so nearly left behind , on the night of starting for Eden .
Parsing [sent. 12297 len. 22]: Captain Kedgick , the landlord , was standing there , and was greatly surprised to see them coming from the boat .
Parsing [sent. 12298 len. 9]: ` Why , what the ` tarnal ! '
Parsing [sent. 12299 len. 4]: cried the Captain .
Parsing [sent. 12300 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 12301 len. 10]: I do admire at this , I do ! '
Parsing [sent. 12302 len. 16]: ` We can stay at your house until to-morrow , Captain , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 12303 len. 4]: said Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 12304 len. 18]: I reckon you can stay there for a twelvemonth if you like , ' retorted Kedgick coolly .
Parsing [sent. 12305 len. 13]: ` But our people wo n't best like your coming back . '
Parsing [sent. 12306 len. 10]: ` Wo n't like it , Captain Kedgick ! '
Parsing [sent. 12307 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12308 len. 20]: ` They did ex-pect you was a-going to settle , ' Kedgick answered , as he shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 12309 len. 13]: ` They 've been took in , you ca n't deny ! '
Parsing [sent. 12310 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 12311 len. 3]: cried Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12312 len. 15]: ` You did n't ought to have received 'em , ' said the Captain .
Parsing [sent. 12313 len. 7]: ` No you did n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 12314 len. 17]: ` My good friend , ' returned Martin , ` did I want to receive them ?
Parsing [sent. 12315 len. 7]: Was it any act of mine ?
Parsing [sent. 12316 len. 37]: Did n't you tell me they would rile up , and that I should be flayed like a wild cat -- and threaten all kinds of vengeance , if I did n't receive them ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12317 len. 12]: I do n't know about that , ' returned the Captain .
Parsing [sent. 12318 len. 22]: ` But when our people 's frills is out , they 're starched up pretty stiff , I tell you ! '
Parsing [sent. 12319 len. 24]: With that , he fell into the rear to walk with Mark , while Martin and Elijah Pogram went on to the National .
Parsing [sent. 12320 len. 11]: ` We 've come back alive , you see ! '
Parsing [sent. 12321 len. 3]: said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 12322 len. 16]: ` It ai n't the thing I did expect , ' the Captain grumbled . '
Parsing [sent. 12323 len. 20]: A man ai n't got no right to be a public man , unless he meets the public views .
Parsing [sent. 12324 len. 18]: Our fashionable people would n't have attended his le-vee , if they had know 'd it . '
Parsing [sent. 12325 len. 21]: Nothing mollified the Captain , who persisted in taking it very ill that they had not both died in Eden .
Parsing [sent. 12326 len. 50]: The boarders at the National felt strongly on the subject too ; but it happened by good fortune that they had not much time to think about this grievance , for it was suddenly determined to pounce upon the Honourable Elijah Pogram , and give HIM a le-vee forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 12327 len. 55]: As the general evening meal of the house was over before the arrival of the boat , Martin , Mark , and Pogram were taking tea and fixings at the public table by themselves , when the deputation entered to announce this honour ; consisting of six gentlemen boarders and a very shrill boy .
Parsing [sent. 12328 len. 4]: ` Sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 12329 len. 4]: said the spokesman .
Parsing [sent. 12330 len. 5]: ` Mr Pogram ! '
Parsing [sent. 12331 len. 5]: cried the shrill boy .
Parsing [sent. 12332 len. 14]: The spokesman thus reminded of the shrill boy 's presence , introduced him .
Parsing [sent. 12333 len. 7]: ` Doctor Ginery Dunkle , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12334 len. 7]: A gentleman of great poetical elements .
Parsing [sent. 12335 len. 23]: He has recently jined us here , sir , and is an acquisition to us , sir , I do assure you .
Parsing [sent. 12336 len. 4]: Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12337 len. 5]: Mr Jodd , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12338 len. 5]: Mr Izzard , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12339 len. 7]: Mr Julius Bib , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 12340 len. 15]: ` Julius Washington Merryweather Bib , ' said the gentleman himself TO himself . '
Parsing [sent. 12341 len. 7]: I beg your pardon , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12342 len. 3]: Excuse me .
Parsing [sent. 12343 len. 21]: Mr Julius Washington Merryweather Bib , sir ; a gentleman in the lumber line , sir , and much esteemed .
Parsing [sent. 12344 len. 5]: Colonel Groper , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12345 len. 5]: Pro-fessor Piper , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12346 len. 11]: My own name , sir , is Oscar Buffum . '
Parsing [sent. 12347 len. 29]: Each man took one slide forward as he was named ; butted at the Honourable Elijah Pogram with his head ; shook hands , and slid back again .
Parsing [sent. 12348 len. 9]: The introductions being completed , the spokesman resumed .
Parsing [sent. 12349 len. 4]: ` Sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 12350 len. 5]: ` Mr Pogram ! '
Parsing [sent. 12351 len. 5]: cried the shrill boy .
Parsing [sent. 12352 len. 39]: ` Perhaps , ' said the spokesman , with a hopeless look , ` you will be so good , Dr. Ginery Dunkle , as to charge yourself with the execution of our little office , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 12353 len. 15]: As there was nothing the shrill boy desired more , he immediately stepped forward .
Parsing [sent. 12354 len. 4]: ` Mr Pogram !
Parsing [sent. 12355 len. 2]: Sir !
Parsing [sent. 12356 len. 66]: A handful of your fellow-citizens , sir , hearing of your arrival at the National Hotel , and feeling the patriotic character of your public services , wish , sir , to have the gratification of beholding you , and mixing with you , sir ; and unbending with you , sir , in those moments which -- ' ` Air , ' suggested Buffum .
Parsing [sent. 12357 len. 18]: ` Which air so peculiarly the lot , sir , of our great and happy country . '
Parsing [sent. 12358 len. 4]: ` Hear ! '
Parsing [sent. 12359 len. 9]: cried Colonel Grouper , in a loud voice .
Parsing [sent. 12360 len. 3]: ` Good !
Parsing [sent. 12361 len. 3]: Hear him !
Parsing [sent. 12362 len. 3]: Good ! '
Parsing [sent. 12363 len. 47]: ` And therefore , sir , ' pursued the Doctor , ` they request ; as A mark Of their respect ; the honour of your company at a little le -- Vee , sir , in the ladies ' ordinary , at eight o'clock . '
Parsing [sent. 12364 len. 12]: Mr Pogram bowed , and said : ` Fellow countrymen ! '
Parsing [sent. 12365 len. 4]: ` Good ! '
Parsing [sent. 12366 len. 4]: cried the Colonel .
Parsing [sent. 12367 len. 5]: ` Hear , him !
Parsing [sent. 12368 len. 3]: Good ! '
Parsing [sent. 12369 len. 12]: Mr Pogram bowed to the Colonel individually , and then resumed .
Parsing [sent. 12370 len. 15]: ` Your approbation of My labours in the common cause goes to My heart .
Parsing [sent. 12371 len. 30]: At all times and in all places ; in the ladies ' ordinary , My friends , and in the Battle Field -- ' ` Good , very good !
Parsing [sent. 12372 len. 3]: Hear him !
Parsing [sent. 12373 len. 4]: Hear him ! '
Parsing [sent. 12374 len. 4]: said the Colonel .
Parsing [sent. 12375 len. 12]: ` The name of Pogram will be proud to jine you .
Parsing [sent. 12376 len. 37]: And may it , My friends , be written on My tomb , `` He was a member of the Congress of our common country , and was ac -- Tive in his trust . '' '
Parsing [sent. 12377 len. 23]: ` The Com-mittee , sir , ' said the shrill boy , ` will wait upon you at five minutes afore eight .
Parsing [sent. 12378 len. 8]: I take My leave , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 12379 len. 47]: Mr Pogram shook hands with him , and everybody else , once more ; and when they came back again at five minutes before eight , they said , one by one , in a melancholy voice , ` How do you do , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 12380 len. 33]: and shook hands with Mr Pogram all over again , as if he had been abroad for a twelvemonth in the meantime , and they met , now , at a funeral .
Parsing [sent. 12381 len. 40]: But by this time Mr Pogram had freshened himself up , and had composed his hair and features after the Pogram statue , so that any one with half an eye might cry out , ` There he is !
Parsing [sent. 12382 len. 7]: as he delivered the Defiance ! '
Parsing [sent. 12383 len. 36]: The Committee were embellished also ; and when they entered the ladies ' ordinary in a body , there was much clapping of hands from ladies and gentlemen , accompanied by cries of ` Pogram !
Parsing [sent. 12384 len. 3]: Pogram ! '
Parsing [sent. 12385 len. 10]: and some standing up on chairs to see him .
Parsing [sent. 12386 len. 59]: The object of the popular caress looked round the room as he walked up it , and smiled ; at the same time observing to the shrill boy , that he knew something of the beauty of the daughters of their common country , but had never seen it in such lustre and perfection as at that moment .
Parsing [sent. 12387 len. 18]: Which the shrill boy put in the paper next day ; to Elijah Pogram 's great surprise .
Parsing [sent. 12388 len. 59]: ` We will re-quest you , sir , if you please , ' said Buffum , laying hands on Mr Pogram as if he were taking his measure for a coat , ` to stand up with your back agin the wall right in the furthest corner , that there may be more room for our fellow cit-izens .
Parsing [sent. 12389 len. 31]: If you could set your back right slap agin that curtain-peg , sir , keeping your left leg everlastingly behind the stove , we should be fixed quite slick . '
Parsing [sent. 12390 len. 26]: Mr Pogram did as he was told , and wedged himself into such a little corner that the Pogram statue would n't have known him .
Parsing [sent. 12391 len. 8]: The entertainments of the evening then began .
Parsing [sent. 12392 len. 52]: Gentlemen brought ladies up , and brought themselves up , and brought each other up ; and asked Elijah Pogram what he thought of this political question , and what he thought of that ; and looked at him , and looked at one another , and seemed very unhappy indeed .
Parsing [sent. 12393 len. 24]: The ladies on the chairs looked at Elijah Pogram through their glasses , and said audibly , ' I wish he 'd speak .
Parsing [sent. 12394 len. 6]: Why do n't he speak ?
Parsing [sent. 12395 len. 9]: Oh , do ask him to speak ! '
Parsing [sent. 12396 len. 23]: And Elijah Pogram looked sometimes at the ladies and sometimes elsewhere , delivering senatorial opinions , as he was asked for them .
Parsing [sent. 12397 len. 36]: But the great end and object of the meeting seemed to be , not to let Elijah Pogram out of the corner on any account ; so there they kept him , hard and fast .
Parsing [sent. 12398 len. 51]: A great bustle at the door , in the course of the evening , announced the arrival of some remarkable person ; and immediately afterwards an elderly gentleman , much excited , was seen to precipitate himself upon the crowd , and battle his way towards the Honourable Elijah Pogram .
Parsing [sent. 12399 len. 80]: Martin , who had found a snug place of observation in a distant corner , where he stood with Mark beside him -LRB- for he did not so often forget him now as formerly , though he still did sometimes -RRB- , thought he knew this gentleman , but had no doubt of it , when he cried as loud as he could , with his eyes starting out of his head : ` Sir , Mrs Hominy ! '
Parsing [sent. 12400 len. 8]: ` Lord bless that woman , Mark .
Parsing [sent. 12401 len. 7]: She has turned up again ! '
Parsing [sent. 12402 len. 12]: ` Here she comes , sir , ' answered Mr Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 12403 len. 5]: ` Pogram knows her .
Parsing [sent. 12404 len. 4]: A public character !
Parsing [sent. 12405 len. 10]: Always got her eye upon her country , sir !
Parsing [sent. 12406 len. 21]: If that there lady 's husband is of my opinion , what a jolly old gentleman he must be ! '
Parsing [sent. 12407 len. 38]: A lane was made ; and Mrs Hominy , with the aristocratic stalk , the pocket handkerchief , the clasped hands , and the classical cap , came slowly up it , in a procession of one .
Parsing [sent. 12408 len. 16]: Mr Pogram testified emotions of delight on seeing her , and a general hush prevailed .
Parsing [sent. 12409 len. 23]: For it was known that when a woman like Mrs Hominy encountered a man like Pogram , something interesting must be said .
Parsing [sent. 12410 len. 40]: Their first salutations were exchanged in a voice too low to reach the impatient ears of the throng ; but they soon became audible , for Mrs Hominy felt her position , and knew what was expected of her .
Parsing [sent. 12411 len. 59]: Mrs H. was hard upon him at first ; and put him through a rigid catechism in reference to a certain vote he had given , which she had found it necessary , as the mother of the modern Gracchi , to deprecate in a line by itself , set up expressly for the purpose in German text .
Parsing [sent. 12412 len. 40]: But Mr Pogram evading it by a well-timed allusion to the star-spangled banner , which , it appeared , had the remarkable peculiarity of flouting the breeze whenever it was hoisted where the wind blew , she forgave him .
Parsing [sent. 12413 len. 21]: They now enlarged on certain questions of tariff , commercial treaty , boundary , importation and exportation with great effect .
Parsing [sent. 12414 len. 28]: And Mrs Hominy not only talked , as the saying is , like a book , but actually did talk her own books , word for word .
Parsing [sent. 12415 len. 3]: ` My !
Parsing [sent. 12416 len. 5]: what is this ! '
Parsing [sent. 12417 len. 17]: cried Mrs Hominy , opening a little note which was handed her by her excited gentleman-usher .
Parsing [sent. 12418 len. 4]: ` Do tell !
Parsing [sent. 12419 len. 6]: oh , well , now !
Parsing [sent. 12420 len. 6]: on ' y think ! '
Parsing [sent. 12421 len. 63]: And then she read aloud , as follows : ` Two literary ladies present their compliments to the mother of the modern Gracchi , and claim her kind introduction , as their talented countrywoman , to the honourable -LRB- and distinguished -RRB- Elijah Pogram , whom the two L. L. 's have often contemplated in the speaking marble of the soul-subduing Chiggle .
Parsing [sent. 12422 len. 48]: On a verbal intimation from the mother of the M. G. , that she will comply with the request of the two L. L. 's , they will have the immediate pleasure of joining the galaxy assembled to do honour to the patriotic conduct of a Pogram .
Parsing [sent. 12423 len. 33]: It may be another bond of union between the two L. L. 's and the mother of the M. G. to observe , that the two L. L. 's are Transcendental . '
Parsing [sent. 12424 len. 59]: Mrs Hominy promptly rose , and proceeded to the door , whence she returned , after a minute 's interval , with the two L. L. 's , whom she led , through the lane in the crowd , with all that stateliness of deportment which was so remarkably her own , up to the great Elijah Pogram .
Parsing [sent. 12425 len. 20]: It was -LRB- as the shrill boy cried out in an ecstasy -RRB- quite the Last Scene from Coriolanus .
Parsing [sent. 12426 len. 14]: One of the L. L. 's wore a brown wig of uncommon size .
Parsing [sent. 12427 len. 42]: Sticking on the forehead of the other , by invisible means , was a massive cameo , in size and shape like the raspberry tart which is ordinarily sold for a penny , representing on its front the Capitol at Washington .
Parsing [sent. 12428 len. 9]: ` Miss Toppit , and Miss Codger ! '
Parsing [sent. 12429 len. 4]: said Mrs Hominy .
Parsing [sent. 12430 len. 22]: ` Codger 's the lady so often mentioned in the English newspapers I should think , sir , ' whispered Mark .
Parsing [sent. 12431 len. 10]: ` The oldest inhabitant as never remembers anything . '
Parsing [sent. 12432 len. 35]: ` To be presented to a Pogram , ' said Miss Codger , ` by a Hominy , indeed , a thrilling moment is it in its impressiveness on what we call our feelings .
Parsing [sent. 12433 len. 38]: But why we call them so , or why impressed they are , or if impressed they are at all , or if at all we are , or if there really is , oh gasping one !
Parsing [sent. 12434 len. 40]: a Pogram or a Hominy , or any active principle to which we give those titles , is a topic , Spirit searching , light abandoned , much too vast to enter on , at this unlooked-for crisis . '
Parsing [sent. 12435 len. 22]: ` Mind and matter , ' said the lady in the wig , ` glide swift into the vortex of immensity .
Parsing [sent. 12436 len. 18]: Howls the sublime , and softly sleeps the calm Ideal , in the whispering chambers of Imagination .
Parsing [sent. 12437 len. 8]: To hear it , sweet it is .
Parsing [sent. 12438 len. 18]: But then , outlaughs the stern philosopher , and saith to the Grotesque , `` What ho !
Parsing [sent. 12439 len. 6]: arrest for me that Agency .
Parsing [sent. 12440 len. 7]: Go , bring it here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12441 len. 7]: And so the vision fadeth . '
Parsing [sent. 12442 len. 24]: After this , they both took Mr Pogram by the hand , and pressed it to their lips , as a patriotic palm .
Parsing [sent. 12443 len. 42]: That homage paid , the mother of the modern Gracchi called for chairs , and the three literary ladies went to work in earnest , to bring poor Pogram out , and make him show himself in all his brilliant colours .
Parsing [sent. 12444 len. 30]: How Pogram got out of his depth instantly , and how the three L. L. 's were never in theirs , is a piece of history not worth recording .
Parsing [sent. 12445 len. 31]: Suffice it , that being all four out of their depths , and all unable to swim , they splashed up words in all directions , and floundered about famously .
Parsing [sent. 12446 len. 21]: On the whole , it was considered to have been the severest mental exercise ever heard in the National Hotel .
Parsing [sent. 12447 len. 29]: Tears stood in the shrill boy 's eyes several times ; and the whole company observed that their heads ached with the effort -- as well they might .
Parsing [sent. 12448 len. 34]: When it at last became necessary to release Elijah Pogram from the corner , and the Committee saw him safely back again to the next room , they were fervent in their admiration .
Parsing [sent. 12449 len. 18]: ` Which , ' said Mr Buffum , ` must have vent , or it will bust .
Parsing [sent. 12450 len. 10]: Toe you , Mr Pogram , I am grateful .
Parsing [sent. 12451 len. 17]: Toe-wards you , sir , I am inspired with lofty veneration , and with deep e-mo-tion .
Parsing [sent. 12452 len. 31]: The sentiment Toe which I would propose to give ex-pression , sir , is this : `` May you ever be as firm , sir , as your marble statter !
Parsing [sent. 12453 len. 16]: May it ever be as great a terror Toe its ene-mies as you . '' '
Parsing [sent. 12454 len. 55]: There is some reason to suppose that it was rather terrible to its friends ; being a statue of the Elevated or Goblin School , in which the Honourable Elijah Pogram was represented as in a very high wind , with his hair all standing on end , and his nostrils blown wide open .
Parsing [sent. 12455 len. 70]: But Mr Pogram thanked his friend and countryman for the aspiration to which he had given utterance , and the Committee , after another solemn shaking of hands , retired to bed , except the Doctor ; who immediately repaired to the newspaper-office , and there wrote a short poem suggested by the events of the evening , beginning with fourteen stars , and headed , ' A Fragment .
Parsing [sent. 12456 len. 20]: Suggested by witnessing the Honourable Elijah Pogram engaged in a philosophical disputation with three of Columbia 's fairest daughters .
Parsing [sent. 12457 len. 5]: By Doctor Ginery Dunkle .
Parsing [sent. 12458 len. 4]: Of Troy . '
Parsing [sent. 12459 len. 23]: If Pogram was as glad to get to bed as Martin was , he must have been well rewarded for his labours .
Parsing [sent. 12460 len. 45]: They started off again next day -LRB- Martin and Mark previously disposing of their goods to the storekeepers of whom they had purchased them , for anything they would bring -RRB- , and were fellow travellers to within a short distance of New York .
Parsing [sent. 12461 len. 22]: When Pogram was about to leave them he grew thoughtful , and after pondering for some time , took Martin aside .
Parsing [sent. 12462 len. 13]: ` We air going to part , sir , ' said Pogram .
Parsing [sent. 12463 len. 18]: ` Pray do n't distress yourself , ' said Martin ; ` we must bear it . '
Parsing [sent. 12464 len. 17]: ` It ai n't that , sir , ' returned Pogram , ` not at all .
Parsing [sent. 12465 len. 14]: But I should wish you to accept a copy of My oration . '
Parsing [sent. 12466 len. 14]: ` Thank you , ' said Martin , ` you are very good .
Parsing [sent. 12467 len. 7]: I shall be most happy . '
Parsing [sent. 12468 len. 29]: ` It ai n't quite that , sir , neither , ' resumed Pogram ; ` air you bold enough to introduce a copy into your country ? '
Parsing [sent. 12469 len. 7]: ` Certainly , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12470 len. 5]: ` Why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 12471 len. 14]: ` Its sentiments air strong , sir , ' hinted Pogram , darkly .
Parsing [sent. 12472 len. 10]: ` That makes no difference , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12473 len. 11]: ` I 'll take a dozen if you like . '
Parsing [sent. 12474 len. 9]: ` No , sir , ' retorted Pogram .
Parsing [sent. 12475 len. 5]: ` Not A dozen .
Parsing [sent. 12476 len. 7]: That is more than I require .
Parsing [sent. 12477 len. 33]: If you are content to run the hazard , sir , here is one for your Lord Chancellor , ' producing it , ` and one for Your principal Secretary of State .
Parsing [sent. 12478 len. 17]: I should wish them to see it , sir , as expressing what my opinions air .
Parsing [sent. 12479 len. 11]: That they may not plead ignorance at a future time .
Parsing [sent. 12480 len. 14]: But do n't get into danger , sir , on my account ! '
Parsing [sent. 12481 len. 16]: ` There is not the least danger , I assure you , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12482 len. 13]: So he put the pamphlets in his pocket , and they parted .
Parsing [sent. 12483 len. 38]: Mr Bevan had written in his letter that , at a certain time , which fell out happily just then , he would be at a certain hotel in the city , anxiously expecting to see them .
Parsing [sent. 12484 len. 11]: To this place they repaired without a moment 's delay .
Parsing [sent. 12485 len. 26]: They had the satisfaction of finding him within ; and of being received by their good friend , with his own warmth and heartiness . '
Parsing [sent. 12486 len. 18]: I am truly sorry and ashamed , ' said Martin , ` to have begged of you .
Parsing [sent. 12487 len. 5]: But look at us .
Parsing [sent. 12488 len. 14]: See what we are , and judge to what we are reduced ! '
Parsing [sent. 12489 len. 34]: ` So far from claiming to have done you any service , ' returned the other , ' I reproach myself with having been , unwittingly , the original cause of your misfortunes .
Parsing [sent. 12490 len. 55]: I no more supposed you would go to Eden on such representations as you received ; or , indeed , that you would do anything but be dispossessed , by the readiest means , of your idea that fortunes were so easily made here ; than I thought of going to Eden myself . '
Parsing [sent. 12491 len. 33]: ` The fact is , I closed with the thing in a mad and sanguine manner , ' said Martin , ` and the less said about it the better for me .
Parsing [sent. 12492 len. 13]: Mark , here , had n't a voice in the matter . '
Parsing [sent. 12493 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 12494 len. 15]: but he had n't a voice in any other matter , had he ? '
Parsing [sent. 12495 len. 18]: returned Mr Bevan ; laughing with an air that showed his understanding of Mark and Martin too .
Parsing [sent. 12496 len. 18]: ` Not a very powerful one , I am afraid , ' said Martin with a blush .
Parsing [sent. 12497 len. 9]: ` But live and learn , Mr Bevan !
Parsing [sent. 12498 len. 11]: Nearly die and learn ; we learn the quicker . '
Parsing [sent. 12499 len. 13]: ` Now , ' said their friend , ` about your plans .
Parsing [sent. 12500 len. 9]: You mean to return home at once ? '
Parsing [sent. 12501 len. 24]: ` Oh , I think so , ' returned Martin hastily , for he turned pale at the thought of any other suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 12502 len. 11]: ` That is your opinion too , I hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 12503 len. 3]: ` Unquestionably .
Parsing [sent. 12504 len. 35]: For I do n't know why you ever came here ; though it 's not such an unusual case , I am sorry to say , that we need go any farther into that .
Parsing [sent. 12505 len. 26]: You do n't know that the ship in which you came over with our friend General Fladdock , is in port , of course ? '
Parsing [sent. 12506 len. 4]: ` Indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 12507 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12508 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 12509 len. 8]: And is advertised to sail to-morrow . '
Parsing [sent. 12510 len. 27]: This was tempting news , but tantalising too ; for Martin knew that his getting any employment on board a ship of that class was hopeless .
Parsing [sent. 12511 len. 36]: The money in his pocket would not pay one-fourth of the sum he had already borrowed , and if it had been enough for their passage-money , he could hardly have resolved to spend it .
Parsing [sent. 12512 len. 14]: He explained this to Mr Bevan , and stated what their project was .
Parsing [sent. 12513 len. 17]: ` Why , that 's as wild as Eden every bit , ' returned his friend .
Parsing [sent. 12514 len. 34]: ` You must take your passage like a Christian ; at least , as like a Christian as a fore-cabin passenger can ; and owe me a few more dollars than you intend .
Parsing [sent. 12515 len. 34]: If Mark will go down to the ship and see what passengers there are , and finds that you can go in her without being actually suffocated , my advice is , go !
Parsing [sent. 12516 len. 36]: You and I will look about us in the meantime -LRB- we wo n't call at the Norris 's unless you like -RRB- , and we will all three dine together in the afternoon . '
Parsing [sent. 12517 len. 14]: Martin had nothing to express but gratitude , and so it was arranged .
Parsing [sent. 12518 len. 45]: But he went out of the room after Mark , and advised him to take their passage in the Screw , though they lay upon the bare deck ; which Mr Tapley , who needed no entreaty on the subject readily promised to do .
Parsing [sent. 12519 len. 31]: When he and Martin met again , and were alone , he was in high spirits , and evidently had something to communicate , in which he gloried very much .
Parsing [sent. 12520 len. 13]: ` I 've done Mr Bevan , sir , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 12521 len. 6]: ` Done Mr Bevan ! '
Parsing [sent. 12522 len. 3]: repeated Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12523 len. 19]: ` The cook of the Screw went and got married yesterday , sir , ' said Mr Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 12524 len. 8]: Martin looked at him for farther explanation .
Parsing [sent. 12525 len. 46]: ` And when I got on board , and the word was passed that it was me , ' said Mark , ` the mate he comes and asks me whether I 'd engage to take this said cook 's place upon the passage home .
Parsing [sent. 12526 len. 25]: `` For you 're used to it , '' he says ; `` you were always a-cooking for everybody on your passage out . ''
Parsing [sent. 12527 len. 23]: And so I was , ' said Mark , ` although I never cooked before , I 'll take my oath . '
Parsing [sent. 12528 len. 7]: ` What did you say ? '
Parsing [sent. 12529 len. 3]: demanded Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12530 len. 4]: ` Say ! '
Parsing [sent. 12531 len. 3]: cried Mark .
Parsing [sent. 12532 len. 10]: ` That I 'd take anything I could get .
Parsing [sent. 12533 len. 26]: `` If that 's so , '' says the mate , `` why , bring a glass of rum ; '' which they brought according .
Parsing [sent. 12534 len. 56]: And my wages , sir , ' said Mark in high glee , ` pays your passage ; and I 've put the rolling-pin in your berth to take it -LRB- it 's the easy one up in the corner -RRB- ; and there we are , Rule Britannia , and Britons strike home ! '
Parsing [sent. 12535 len. 13]: ` There never was such a good fellow as you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 12536 len. 8]: cried Martin seizing him by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 12537 len. 16]: ` But what do you mean by `` doing '' Mr Bevan , Mark ? '
Parsing [sent. 12538 len. 9]: ` Why , do n't you see ? '
Parsing [sent. 12539 len. 3]: said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 12540 len. 10]: ` We do n't tell him , you know .
Parsing [sent. 12541 len. 19]: We take his money , but we do n't spend it , and we do n't keep it .
Parsing [sent. 12542 len. 37]: What we do is , write him a little note , explaining this engagement , and roll it up , and leave it at the bar , to be given to him after we are gone .
Parsing [sent. 12543 len. 6]: Do n't you see ? '
Parsing [sent. 12544 len. 13]: Martin 's delight in this idea was not inferior to Mark 's .
Parsing [sent. 12545 len. 8]: It was all done as he proposed .
Parsing [sent. 12546 len. 40]: They passed a cheerful evening ; slept at the hotel ; left the letter as arranged ; and went off to the ship betimes next morning , with such light hearts as the weight of their past miseries engendered .
Parsing [sent. 12547 len. 3]: ` Good-bye !
Parsing [sent. 12548 len. 7]: a hundred thousand times good-bye ! '
Parsing [sent. 12549 len. 6]: said Martin to their friend .
Parsing [sent. 12550 len. 9]: ` How shall I remember all your kindness !
Parsing [sent. 12551 len. 8]: How shall I ever thank you ! '
Parsing [sent. 12552 len. 39]: ` If you ever become a rich man , or a powerful one , ' returned his friend , ` you shall try to make your Government more careful of its subjects when they roam abroad to live .
Parsing [sent. 12553 len. 28]: Tell it what you know of emigration in your own case , and impress upon it how much suffering may be prevented with a little pains ! '
Parsing [sent. 12554 len. 6]: Cheerily , lads , cheerily !
Parsing [sent. 12555 len. 3]: Anchor weighed .
Parsing [sent. 12556 len. 5]: Ship in full sail .
Parsing [sent. 12557 len. 8]: Her sturdy bowsprit pointing true to England .
Parsing [sent. 12558 len. 9]: America a cloud upon the sea behind them !
Parsing [sent. 12559 len. 5]: ` Why , Cook !
Parsing [sent. 12560 len. 9]: what are you thinking of so steadily ? '
Parsing [sent. 12561 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12562 len. 37]: ` Why , I was a-thinking , sir , ' returned Mark , ` that if I was a painter and was called upon to paint the American Eagle , how should I do it ? '
Parsing [sent. 12563 len. 15]: ` Paint it as like an Eagle as you could , I suppose . '
Parsing [sent. 12564 len. 7]: ` No , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 12565 len. 10]: ` That would n't do for me , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12566 len. 87]: I should want to draw it like a Bat , for its short-sightedness ; like a Bantam , for its bragging ; like a Magpie , for its honesty ; like a Peacock , for its vanity ; like a ostrich , for its putting its head in the mud , and thinking nobody sees it -- ' ` And like a Phoenix , for its power of springing from the ashes of its faults and vices , and soaring up anew into the sky ! '
Parsing [sent. 12567 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12568 len. 5]: ` Well , Mark .
Parsing [sent. 12569 len. 6]: Let us hope so . '
Parsing [sent. 12570 len. 68]: CHAPTER THIRTY -- FIVE ARRIVING IN ENGLAND , MARTIN WITNESSES A CEREMONY , FROM WHICH HE DERIVES THE CHEERING INFORMATION THAT HE HAS NOT BEEN FORGOTTEN IN HIS ABSENCE It was mid-day , and high water in the English port for which the Screw was bound , when , borne in gallantly upon the fullness of the tide , she let go her anchor in the river .
Parsing [sent. 12571 len. 52]: Bright as the scene was ; fresh , and full of motion ; airy , free , and sparkling ; it was nothing to the life and exultation in the breasts of the two travellers , at sight of the old churches , roofs , and darkened chimney stacks of Home .
Parsing [sent. 12572 len. 61]: The distant roar that swelled up hoarsely from the busy streets , was music in their ears ; the lines of people gazing from the wharves , were friends held dear ; the canopy of smoke that overhung the town was brighter and more beautiful to them than if the richest silks of Persia had been waving in the air .
Parsing [sent. 12573 len. 107]: And though the water going on its glistening track , turned , ever and again , aside to dance and sparkle round great ships , and heave them up ; and leaped from off the blades of oars , a shower of diving diamonds ; and wantoned with the idle boats , and swiftly passed , in many a sportive chase , through obdurate old iron rings , set deep into the stone-work of the quays ; not even it was half so buoyant , and so restless , as their fluttering hearts , when yearning to set foot , once more , on native ground .
Parsing [sent. 12574 len. 16]: A year had passed since those same spires and roofs had faded from their eyes .
Parsing [sent. 12575 len. 9]: It seemed to them , a dozen years .
Parsing [sent. 12576 len. 23]: Some trifling changes , here and there , they called to mind ; and wondered that they were so few and slight .
Parsing [sent. 12577 len. 20]: In health and fortune , prospect and resource , they came back poorer men than they had gone away .
Parsing [sent. 12578 len. 5]: But it was home .
Parsing [sent. 12579 len. 31]: And though home is a name , a word , it is a strong one ; stronger than magician ever spoke , or spirit answered to , in strongest conjuration .
Parsing [sent. 12580 len. 62]: Being set ashore , with very little money in their pockets , and no definite plan of operation in their heads , they sought out a cheap tavern , where they regaled upon a smoking steak , and certain flowing mugs of beer , as only men just landed from the sea can revel in the generous dainties of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 12581 len. 49]: When they had feasted , as two grateful-tempered giants might have done , they stirred the fire , drew back the glowing curtain from the window , and making each a sofa for himself , by union of the great unwieldy chairs , gazed blissfully into the street .
Parsing [sent. 12582 len. 28]: Even the street was made a fairy street , by being half hidden in an atmosphere of steak , and strong , stout , stand-up English beer .
Parsing [sent. 12583 len. 31]: For on the window-glass hung such a mist , that Mr Tapley was obliged to rise and wipe it with his handkerchief , before the passengers appeared like common mortals .
Parsing [sent. 12584 len. 27]: And even then , a spiral little cloud went curling up from their two glasses of hot grog , which nearly hid them from each other .
Parsing [sent. 12585 len. 44]: It was one of those unaccountable little rooms which are never seen anywhere but in a tavern , and are supposed to have got into taverns by reason of the facilities afforded to the architect for getting drunk while engaged in their construction .
Parsing [sent. 12586 len. 85]: It had more corners in it than the brain of an obstinate man ; was full of mad closets , into which nothing could be put that was not specially invented and made for that purpose ; had mysterious shelvings and bulkheads , and indications of staircases in the ceiling ; and was elaborately provided with a bell that rung in the room itself , about two feet from the handle , and had no connection whatever with any other part of the establishment .
Parsing [sent. 12587 len. 85]: It was a little below the pavement , and abutted close upon it ; so that passengers grated against the window-panes with their buttons , and scraped it with their baskets ; and fearful boys suddenly coming between a thoughtful guest and the light , derided him , or put out their tongues as if he were a physician ; or made white knobs on the ends of their noses by flattening the same against the glass , and vanished awfully , like spectres .
Parsing [sent. 12588 len. 24]: Martin and Mark sat looking at the people as they passed , debating every now and then what their first step should be .
Parsing [sent. 12589 len. 15]: ` We want to see Miss Mary , of course , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 12590 len. 8]: ` Of course , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12591 len. 10]: ` But I do n't know where she is .
Parsing [sent. 12592 len. 48]: Not having had the heart to write in our distress -- you yourself thought silence most advisable -- and consequently , never having heard from her since we left New York the first time , I do n't know where she is , my good fellow . '
Parsing [sent. 12593 len. 27]: ` My opinion is , sir , ' returned Mark , ` that what we 've got to do is to travel straight to the Dragon .
Parsing [sent. 12594 len. 19]: There 's no need for you to go there , where you 're known , unless you like .
Parsing [sent. 12595 len. 9]: You may stop ten mile short of it .
Parsing [sent. 12596 len. 5]: I 'll go on .
Parsing [sent. 12597 len. 9]: Mrs Lupin will tell me all the news .
Parsing [sent. 12598 len. 22]: Mr Pinch will give me every information that we want ; and right glad Mr Pinch will be to do it .
Parsing [sent. 12599 len. 11]: My proposal is : To set off walking this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 12600 len. 7]: To stop when we are tired .
Parsing [sent. 12601 len. 8]: To get a lift when we can .
Parsing [sent. 12602 len. 7]: To walk when we ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 12603 len. 12]: To do it at once , and do it cheap . '
Parsing [sent. 12604 len. 35]: ` Unless we do it cheap , we shall have some difficulty in doing it at all , ' said Martin , pulling out the bank , and telling it over in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 12605 len. 15]: ` The greater reason for losing no time , sir , ' replied Mark .
Parsing [sent. 12606 len. 38]: ` Whereas , when you 've seen the young lady ; and know what state of mind the old gentleman 's in , and all about it ; then you 'll know what to do next . '
Parsing [sent. 12607 len. 8]: ` No doubt , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12608 len. 7]: ` You are quite right . '
Parsing [sent. 12609 len. 39]: They were raising their glasses to their lips , when their hands stopped midway , and their gaze was arrested by a figure which slowly , very slowly , and reflectively , passed the window at that moment .
Parsing [sent. 12610 len. 3]: Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 12611 len. 7]: Placid , calm , but proud .
Parsing [sent. 12612 len. 3]: Honestly proud .
Parsing [sent. 12613 len. 47]: Dressed with peculiar care , smiling with even more than usual blandness , pondering on the beauties of his art with a mild abstraction from all sordid thoughts , and gently travelling across the disc , as if he were a figure in a magic lantern .
Parsing [sent. 12614 len. 66]: As Mr Pecksniff passed , a person coming in the opposite direction stopped to look after him with great interest and respect , almost with veneration ; and the landlord bouncing out of the house , as if he had seen him too , joined this person , and spoke to him , and shook his head gravely , and looked after Mr Pecksniff likewise .
Parsing [sent. 12615 len. 29]: Martin and Mark sat staring at each other , as if they could not believe it ; but there stood the landlord , and the other man still .
Parsing [sent. 12616 len. 23]: In spite of the indignation with which this glimpse of Mr Pecksniff had inspired him , Martin could not help laughing heartily .
Parsing [sent. 12617 len. 4]: Neither could Mark .
Parsing [sent. 12618 len. 8]: ` We must inquire into this ! '
Parsing [sent. 12619 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12620 len. 9]: ` Ask the landlord in , Mark . '
Parsing [sent. 12621 len. 18]: Mr Tapley retired for that purpose , and immediately returned with their large-headed host in safe convoy .
Parsing [sent. 12622 len. 6]: ` Pray , landlord ! '
Parsing [sent. 12623 len. 21]: said Martin , ` who is that gentleman who passed just now , and whom you were looking after ? '
Parsing [sent. 12624 len. 63]: The landlord poked the fire as if , in his desire to make the most of his answer , he had become indifferent even to the price of coals ; and putting his hands in his pockets , said , after inflating himself to give still further effect to his reply : ` That , gentlemen , is the great Mr Pecksniff !
Parsing [sent. 12625 len. 7]: The celebrated architect , gentlemen ! '
Parsing [sent. 12626 len. 30]: He looked from one to the other while he said it , as if he were ready to assist the first man who might be overcome by the intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 12627 len. 13]: ` The great Mr Pecksniff , the celebrated architect , gentlemen . '
Parsing [sent. 12628 len. 26]: said the landlord , ` has come down here , to help to lay the first stone of a new and splendid public building . '
Parsing [sent. 12629 len. 11]: ` Is it to be built from his designs ? '
Parsing [sent. 12630 len. 3]: asked Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12631 len. 45]: ` The great Mr Pecksniff , the celebrated architect , gentlemen , ' returned the landlord , who seemed to have an unspeakable delight in the repetition of these words , ` carried off the First Premium , and will erect the building . '
Parsing [sent. 12632 len. 7]: ` Who lays the stone ? '
Parsing [sent. 12633 len. 3]: asked Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12634 len. 13]: ` Our member has come down express , ' returned the landlord .
Parsing [sent. 12635 len. 11]: ` No scrubs would do for no such a purpose .
Parsing [sent. 12636 len. 24]: Nothing less would satisfy our Directors than our member in the House of Commons , who is returned upon the Gentlemanly Interest . '
Parsing [sent. 12637 len. 7]: ` Which interest is that ? '
Parsing [sent. 12638 len. 3]: asked Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12639 len. 9]: ` What , do n't you know ! '
Parsing [sent. 12640 len. 4]: returned the landlord .
Parsing [sent. 12641 len. 9]: It was quite clear the landlord did n't .
Parsing [sent. 12642 len. 28]: They always told him at election time , that it was the Gentlemanly side , and he immediately put on his top-boots , and voted for it .
Parsing [sent. 12643 len. 9]: ` When does the ceremony take place ? '
Parsing [sent. 12644 len. 3]: asked Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12645 len. 9]: ` This day , ' replied the landlord .
Parsing [sent. 12646 len. 17]: Then pulling out his watch , he added , impressively , ` almost this minute . '
Parsing [sent. 12647 len. 50]: Martin hastily inquired whether there was any possibility of getting in to witness it ; and finding that there would be no objection to the admittance of any decent person , unless indeed the ground were full , hurried off with Mark , as hard as they could go .
Parsing [sent. 12648 len. 35]: They were fortunate enough to squeeze themselves into a famous corner on the ground , where they could see all that passed , without much dread of being beheld by Mr Pecksniff in return .
Parsing [sent. 12649 len. 36]: They were not a minute too soon , for as they were in the act of congratulating each other , a great noise was heard at some distance , and everybody looked towards the gate .
Parsing [sent. 12650 len. 31]: Several ladies prepared their pocket handkerchiefs for waving ; and a stray teacher belonging to the charity school being much cheered by mistake , was immensely groaned at when detected .
Parsing [sent. 12651 len. 15]: ` Perhaps he has Tom Pinch with him , ' Martin whispered Mr Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 12652 len. 20]: ` It would be rather too much of a treat for him , would n't it , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 12653 len. 6]: whispered Mr Tapley in return .
Parsing [sent. 12654 len. 51]: There was no time to discuss the probabilities either way , for the charity school , in clean linen , came filing in two and two , so much to the self-approval of all the people present who did n't subscribe to it , that many of them shed tears .
Parsing [sent. 12655 len. 16]: A band of music followed , led by a conscientious drummer who never left off .
Parsing [sent. 12656 len. 49]: Then came a great many gentlemen with wands in their hands , and bows on their breasts , whose share in the proceedings did not appear to be distinctly laid down , and who trod upon each other , and blocked up the entry for a considerable period .
Parsing [sent. 12657 len. 44]: These were followed by the Mayor and Corporation , all clustering round the member for the Gentlemanly Interest ; who had the great Mr Pecksniff , the celebrated architect on his right hand , and conversed with him familiarly as they came along .
Parsing [sent. 12658 len. 28]: Then the ladies waved their handkerchiefs , and the gentlemen their hats , and the charity children shrieked , and the member for the Gentlemanly Interest bowed .
Parsing [sent. 12659 len. 51]: Silence being restored , the member for the Gentlemanly Interest rubbed his hands , and wagged his head , and looked about him pleasantly ; and there was nothing this member did , at which some lady or other did not burst into an ecstatic waving of her pocket handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 12660 len. 13]: When he looked up at the stone , they said how graceful !
Parsing [sent. 12661 len. 12]: when he peeped into the hole , they said how condescending !
Parsing [sent. 12662 len. 12]: when he chatted with the Mayor , they said how easy !
Parsing [sent. 12663 len. 14]: when he folded his arms they cried with one accord , how statesman-like !
Parsing [sent. 12664 len. 8]: Mr Pecksniff was observed too , closely .
Parsing [sent. 12665 len. 21]: When he talked to the Mayor , they said , Oh , really , what a courtly man he was !
Parsing [sent. 12666 len. 42]: When he laid his hand upon the mason 's shoulder , giving him directions , how pleasant his demeanour to the working classes ; just the sort of man who made their toil a pleasure to them , poor dear souls !
Parsing [sent. 12667 len. 43]: But now a silver trowel was brought ; and when the member for the Gentlemanly Interest , tucking up his coat-sleeve , did a little sleight of hand with the mortar , the air was rent , so loud was the applause .
Parsing [sent. 12668 len. 11]: The workman-like manner in which he did it was amazing .
Parsing [sent. 12669 len. 16]: No one could conceive where such a gentlemanly creature could have picked the knowledge up .
Parsing [sent. 12670 len. 41]: When he had made a kind of dirt-pie under the direction of the mason , they brought a little vase containing coins , the which the member for the Gentlemanly Interest jingled , as if he were going to conjure .
Parsing [sent. 12671 len. 15]: Whereat they said how droll , how cheerful , what a flow of spirits !
Parsing [sent. 12672 len. 27]: This put into its place , an ancient scholar read the inscription , which was in Latin ; not in English ; that would never do .
Parsing [sent. 12673 len. 42]: It gave great satisfaction ; especially every time there was a good long substantive in the third declension , ablative case , with an adjective to match ; at which periods the assembly became very tender , and were much affected .
Parsing [sent. 12674 len. 18]: And now the stone was lowered down into its place , amidst the shouting of the concourse .
Parsing [sent. 12675 len. 39]: When it was firmly fixed , the member for the Gentlemanly Interest struck upon it thrice with the handle of the trowel , as if inquiring , with a touch of humour , whether anybody was at home .
Parsing [sent. 12676 len. 24]: Mr Pecksniff then unrolled his Plans -LRB- prodigious plans they were -RRB- , and people gathered round to look at and admire them .
Parsing [sent. 12677 len. 56]: Martin , who had been fretting himself -- quite unnecessarily , as Mark thought -- during the whole of these proceedings , could no longer restrain his impatience ; but stepping forward among several others , looked straight over the shoulder of the unconscious Mr Pecksniff , at the designs and plans he had unrolled .
Parsing [sent. 12678 len. 9]: He returned to Mark , boiling with rage .
Parsing [sent. 12679 len. 11]: ` Why , what 's the matter , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 12680 len. 3]: cried Mark .
Parsing [sent. 12681 len. 3]: ` Matter !
Parsing [sent. 12682 len. 6]: This is MY building . '
Parsing [sent. 12683 len. 7]: ` Your building , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 12684 len. 3]: said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 12685 len. 4]: ` My grammar-school .
Parsing [sent. 12686 len. 4]: I invented it .
Parsing [sent. 12687 len. 5]: I did it all .
Parsing [sent. 12688 len. 16]: He has only put four windows in , the villain , and spoilt it ! '
Parsing [sent. 12689 len. 33]: Mark could hardly believe it at first , but being assured that it was really so , actually held him to prevent his interference foolishly , until his temporary heat was past .
Parsing [sent. 12690 len. 19]: In the meantime , the member addressed the company on the gratifying deed which he had just performed .
Parsing [sent. 12691 len. 67]: He said that since he had sat in Parliament to represent the Gentlemanly Interest of that town ; and he might add , the Lady Interest , he hoped , besides -LRB- pocket handkerchiefs -RRB- ; it had been his pleasant duty to come among them , and to raise his voice on their behalf in Another Place -LRB- pocket handkerchiefs and laughter -RRB- , often .
Parsing [sent. 12692 len. 30]: But he had never come among them , and had never raised his voice , with half such pure , such deep , such unalloyed delight , as now .
Parsing [sent. 12693 len. 67]: ` The present occasion , ' he said , ` will ever be memorable to me ; not only for the reasons I have assigned , but because it has afforded me an opportunity of becoming personally known to a gentleman -- ' Here he pointed the trowel at Mr Pecksniff , who was greeted with vociferous cheering , and laid his hand upon his heart .
Parsing [sent. 12694 len. 38]: ` To a gentleman who , I am happy to believe , will reap both distinction and profit from this field ; whose fame had previously penetrated to me -- as to whose ears has it not !
Parsing [sent. 12695 len. 32]: -- but whose intellectual countenance I never had the distinguished honour to behold until this day , and whose intellectual conversation I had never before the improving pleasure to enjoy . '
Parsing [sent. 12696 len. 13]: Everybody seemed very glad of this , and applauded more than ever .
Parsing [sent. 12697 len. 83]: ` But I hope my Honourable Friend , ' said the Gentlemanly member -- of course he added `` if he will allow me to call him so , '' and of course Mr Pecksniff bowed -- ` will give me many opportunities of cultivating the knowledge of him ; and that I may have the extraordinary gratification of reflecting in after-time that I laid on this day two first stones , both belonging to structures which shall last my life ! '
Parsing [sent. 12698 len. 4]: Great cheering again .
Parsing [sent. 12699 len. 15]: All this time , Martin was cursing Mr Pecksniff up hill and down dale .
Parsing [sent. 12700 len. 5]: ` My friends ! '
Parsing [sent. 12701 len. 7]: said Mr Pecksniff , in reply .
Parsing [sent. 12702 len. 29]: ` My duty is to build , not speak ; to act , not talk ; to deal with marble , stone , and brick ; not language .
Parsing [sent. 12703 len. 6]: I am very much affected .
Parsing [sent. 12704 len. 5]: God bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 12705 len. 21]: This address , pumped out apparently from Mr Pecksniff 's very heart , brought the enthusiasm to its highest pitch .
Parsing [sent. 12706 len. 41]: The pocket handkerchiefs were waved again ; the charity children were admonished to grow up Pecksniffs , every boy among them ; the Corporation , gentlemen with wands , member for the Gentlemanly Interest , all cheered for Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 12707 len. 6]: Three cheers for Mr Pecksniff !
Parsing [sent. 12708 len. 6]: Three more for Mr Pecksniff !
Parsing [sent. 12709 len. 12]: Three more for Mr Pecksniff , gentlemen , if you please !
Parsing [sent. 12710 len. 20]: One more , gentlemen , for Mr Pecksniff , and let it be a good one to finish with !
Parsing [sent. 12711 len. 24]: In short , Mr Pecksniff was supposed to have done a great work and was very kindly , courteously , and generously rewarded .
Parsing [sent. 12712 len. 31]: When the procession moved away , and Martin and Mark were left almost alone upon the ground , his merits and a desire to acknowledge them formed the common topic .
Parsing [sent. 12713 len. 9]: He was only second to the Gentlemanly member .
Parsing [sent. 12714 len. 11]: ` Compare the fellow 's situation to-day with ours ! '
Parsing [sent. 12715 len. 4]: said Martin bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 12716 len. 8]: ` Lord bless you , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 12717 len. 9]: cried Mark , ` what 's the use ?
Parsing [sent. 12718 len. 22]: Some architects are clever at making foundations , and some architects are clever at building on 'em when they 're made .
Parsing [sent. 12719 len. 19]: But it 'll all come right in the end , sir ; it 'll all come right ! '
Parsing [sent. 12720 len. 10]: ` And in the meantime -- ' began Martin .
Parsing [sent. 12721 len. 23]: ` In the meantime , as you say , sir , we have a deal to do , and far to go .
Parsing [sent. 12722 len. 10]: So sharp 's the word , and Jolly ! '
Parsing [sent. 12723 len. 35]: ` You are the best master in the world , Mark , ' said Martin , ` and I will not be a bad scholar if I can help it , I am resolved !
Parsing [sent. 12724 len. 3]: So come !
Parsing [sent. 12725 len. 8]: Best foot foremost , old fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 12726 len. 12]: CHAPTER THIRTY -- SIX TOM PINCH DEPARTS TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE .
Parsing [sent. 12727 len. 7]: WHAT HE FINDS AT STARTING Oh !
Parsing [sent. 12728 len. 29]: What a different town Salisbury was in Tom Pinch 's eyes to be sure , when the substantial Pecksniff of his heart melted away into an idle dream !
Parsing [sent. 12729 len. 50]: He possessed the same faith in the wonderful shops , the same intensified appreciation of the mystery and wickedness of the place ; made the same exalted estimate of its wealth , population , and resources ; and yet it was not the old city nor anything like it .
Parsing [sent. 12730 len. 144]: He walked into the market while they were getting breakfast ready for him at the Inn ; and though it was the same market as of old , crowded by the same buyers and sellers ; brisk with the same business ; noisy with the same confusion of tongues and cluttering of fowls in coops ; fair with the same display of rolls of butter , newly made , set forth in linen cloths of dazzling whiteness ; green with the same fresh show of dewy vegetables ; dainty with the same array in higglers ' baskets of small shaving-glasses , laces , braces , trouser-straps , and hardware ; savoury with the same unstinted show of delicate pigs ' feet , and pies made precious by the pork that once had walked upon them ; still it was strangely changed to Tom .
Parsing [sent. 12731 len. 38]: For , in the centre of the market-place , he missed a statue he had set up there as in all other places of his personal resort ; and it looked cold and bare without that ornament .
Parsing [sent. 12732 len. 55]: The change lay no deeper than this , for Tom was far from being sage enough to know , that , having been disappointed in one man , it would have been a strictly rational and eminently wise proceeding to have revenged himself upon mankind in general , by mistrusting them one and all .
Parsing [sent. 12733 len. 84]: Indeed this piece of justice , though it is upheld by the authority of divers profound poets and honourable men , bears a nearer resemblance to the justice of that good Vizier in the Thousand-and-one Nights , who issues orders for the destruction of all the Porters in Bagdad because one of that unfortunate fraternity is supposed to have misconducted himself , than to any logical , not to say Christian , system of conduct , known to the world in later times .
Parsing [sent. 12734 len. 50]: Tom had so long been used to steep the Pecksniff of his fancy in his tea , and spread him out upon his toast , and take him as a relish with his beer , that he made but a poor breakfast on the first morning after his expulsion .
Parsing [sent. 12735 len. 28]: Nor did he much improve his appetite for dinner by seriously considering his own affairs , and taking counsel thereon with his friend the organist 's assistant .
Parsing [sent. 12736 len. 29]: The organist 's assistant gave it as his decided opinion that whatever Tom did , he must go to London ; for there was no place like it .
Parsing [sent. 12737 len. 25]: Which may be true in the main , though hardly , perhaps , in itself , a sufficient reason for Tom 's going there .
Parsing [sent. 12738 len. 42]: But Tom had thought of London before , and had coupled with it thoughts of his sister , and of his old friend John Westlock , whose advice he naturally felt disposed to seek in this important crisis of his fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 12739 len. 25]: To London , therefore , he resolved to go ; and he went away to the coach-office at once , to secure his place .
Parsing [sent. 12740 len. 95]: The coach being already full , he was obliged to postpone his departure until the next night ; but even this circumstance had its bright side as well as its dark one , for though it threatened to reduce his poor purse with unexpected country charges , it afforded him an opportunity of writing to Mrs Lupin and appointing his box to be brought to the old finger-post at the old time ; which would enable him to take that treasure with him to the metropolis , and save the expense of its carriage .
Parsing [sent. 12741 len. 23]: ` So , ' said Tom , comforting himself , ` it 's very nearly as broad as it 's long . '
Parsing [sent. 12742 len. 41]: And it can not be denied that , when he had made up his mind to even this extent , he felt an unaccustomed sense of freedom -- a vague and indistinct impression of holiday-making -- which was very luxurious .
Parsing [sent. 12743 len. 44]: He had his moments of depression and anxiety , and they were , with good reason , pretty numerous ; but still , it was wonderfully pleasant to reflect that he was his own master , and could plan and scheme for himself .
Parsing [sent. 12744 len. 64]: It was startling , thrilling , vast , difficult to understand ; it was a stupendous truth , teeming with responsibility and self-distrust ; but in spite of all his cares , it gave a curious relish to the viands at the Inn , and interposed a dreamy haze between him and his prospects , in which they sometimes showed to magical advantage .
Parsing [sent. 12745 len. 48]: In this unsettled state of mind , Tom went once more to bed in the low four-poster , to the same immovable surprise of the effigies of the former landlord and the fat ox ; and in this condition , passed the whole of the succeeding day .
Parsing [sent. 12746 len. 36]: When the coach came round at last with ` London ' blazoned in letters of gold upon the boot , it gave Tom such a turn , that he was half disposed to run away .
Parsing [sent. 12747 len. 59]: But he did n't do it ; for he took his seat upon the box instead , and looking down upon the four greys , felt as if he were another grey himself , or , at all events , a part of the turn-out ; and was quite confused by the novelty and splendour of his situation .
Parsing [sent. 12748 len. 39]: And really it might have confused a less modest man than Tom to find himself sitting next that coachman ; for of all the swells that ever flourished a whip professionally , he might have been elected emperor .
Parsing [sent. 12749 len. 48]: He did n't handle his gloves like another man , but put them on -- even when he was standing on the pavement , quite detached from the coach -- as if the four greys were , somehow or other , at the ends of the fingers .
Parsing [sent. 12750 len. 8]: It was the same with his hat .
Parsing [sent. 12751 len. 31]: He did things with his hat , which nothing but an unlimited knowledge of horses and the wildest freedom of the road , could ever have made him perfect in .
Parsing [sent. 12752 len. 56]: Valuable little parcels were brought to him with particular instructions , and he pitched them into this hat , and stuck it on again ; as if the laws of gravity did not admit of such an event as its being knocked off or blown off , and nothing like an accident could befall it .
Parsing [sent. 12753 len. 5]: The guard , too !
Parsing [sent. 12754 len. 12]: Seventy breezy miles a day were written in his very whiskers .
Parsing [sent. 12755 len. 12]: His manners were a canter ; his conversation a round trot .
Parsing [sent. 12756 len. 16]: He was a fast coach upon a down-hill turnpike road ; he was all pace .
Parsing [sent. 12757 len. 20]: A waggon could n't have moved slowly , with that guard and his key-bugle on the top of it .
Parsing [sent. 12758 len. 22]: These were all foreshadowings of London , Tom thought , as he sat upon the box , and looked about him .
Parsing [sent. 12759 len. 20]: Such a coachman , and such a guard , never could have existed between Salisbury and any other place .
Parsing [sent. 12760 len. 39]: The coach was none of your steady-going , yokel coaches , but a swaggering , rakish , dissipated London coach ; up all night , and lying by all day , and leading a devil of a life .
Parsing [sent. 12761 len. 14]: It cared no more for Salisbury than if it had been a hamlet .
Parsing [sent. 12762 len. 54]: It rattled noisily through the best streets , defied the Cathedral , took the worst corners sharpest , went cutting in everywhere , making everything get out of its way ; and spun along the open country-road , blowing a lively defiance out of its key-bugle , as its last glad parting legacy .
Parsing [sent. 12763 len. 6]: It was a charming evening .
Parsing [sent. 12764 len. 4]: Mild and bright .
Parsing [sent. 12765 len. 34]: And even with the weight upon his mind which arose out of the immensity and uncertainty of London , Tom could not resist the captivating sense of rapid motion through the pleasant air .
Parsing [sent. 12766 len. 99]: The four greys skimmed along , as if they liked it quite as well as Tom did ; the bugle was in as high spirits as the greys ; the coachman chimed in sometimes with his voice ; the wheels hummed cheerfully in unison ; the brass work on the harness was an orchestra of little bells ; and thus , as they went clinking , jingling , rattling smoothly on , the whole concern , from the buckles of the leaders ' coupling-reins to the handle of the hind boot , was one great instrument of music .
Parsing [sent. 12767 len. 22]: Yoho , past hedges , gates , and trees ; past cottages and barns , and people going home from work .
Parsing [sent. 12768 len. 51]: Yoho , past donkey-chaises , drawn aside into the ditch , and empty carts with rampant horses , whipped up at a bound upon the little watercourse , and held by struggling carters close to the five-barred gate , until the coach had passed the narrow turning in the road .
Parsing [sent. 12769 len. 40]: Yoho , by churches dropped down by themselves in quiet nooks , with rustic burial-grounds about them , where the graves are green , and daisies sleep -- for it is evening -- on the bosoms of the dead .
Parsing [sent. 12770 len. 57]: Yoho , past streams , in which the cattle cool their feet , and where the rushes grow ; past paddock-fences , farms , and rick-yards ; past last year 's stacks , cut , slice by slice , away , and showing , in the waning light , like ruined gables , old and brown .
Parsing [sent. 12771 len. 23]: Yoho , down the pebbly dip , and through the merry water-splash and up at a canter to the level road again .
Parsing [sent. 12772 len. 2]: Yoho !
Parsing [sent. 12773 len. 2]: Yoho !
Parsing [sent. 12774 len. 14]: Was the box there , when they came up to the old finger-post ?
Parsing [sent. 12775 len. 3]: The box !
Parsing [sent. 12776 len. 5]: Was Mrs Lupin herself ?
Parsing [sent. 12777 len. 43]: Had she turned out magnificently as a hostess should , in her own chaise-cart , and was she sitting in a mahogany chair , driving her own horse Dragon -LRB- who ought to have been called Dumpling -RRB- , and looking lovely ?
Parsing [sent. 12778 len. 58]: Did the stage-coach pull up beside her , shaving her very wheel , and even while the guard helped her man up with the trunk , did he send the glad echoes of his bugle careering down the chimneys of the distant Pecksniff , as if the coach expressed its exultation in the rescue of Tom Pinch ?
Parsing [sent. 12779 len. 7]: ` This is kind indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 12780 len. 12]: said Tom , bending down to shake hands with her . '
Parsing [sent. 12781 len. 11]: I did n't mean to give you this trouble . '
Parsing [sent. 12782 len. 7]: ` Trouble , Mr Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 12783 len. 7]: cried the hostess of the Dragon .
Parsing [sent. 12784 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 12785 len. 19]: It 's a pleasure to you , I know , ' said Tom , squeezing her hand heartily .
Parsing [sent. 12786 len. 7]: ` Is there any news ? '
Parsing [sent. 12787 len. 6]: The hostess shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 12788 len. 46]: ` Say you saw me , ' said Tom , ` and that I was very bold and cheerful , and not a bit down-hearted ; and that I entreated her to be the same , for all is certain to come right at last .
Parsing [sent. 12789 len. 3]: Good-bye ! '
Parsing [sent. 12790 len. 13]: ` You 'll write when you get settled , Mr Pinch ? '
Parsing [sent. 12791 len. 4]: said Mrs Lupin .
Parsing [sent. 12792 len. 7]: ` When I get settled ! '
Parsing [sent. 12793 len. 11]: cried Tom , with an involuntary opening of his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 12794 len. 13]: ` Oh , yes , I 'll write when I get settled .
Parsing [sent. 12795 len. 33]: Perhaps I had better write before , because I may find that it takes a little time to settle myself ; not having too much money , and having only one friend .
Parsing [sent. 12796 len. 13]: I shall give your love to the friend , by the way .
Parsing [sent. 12797 len. 11]: You were always great with Mr Westlock , you know .
Parsing [sent. 12798 len. 3]: Good-bye ! '
Parsing [sent. 12799 len. 4]: ` Good-bye ! '
Parsing [sent. 12800 len. 17]: said Mrs Lupin , hastily producing a basket with a long bottle sticking out of it .
Parsing [sent. 12801 len. 4]: ` Take this .
Parsing [sent. 12802 len. 3]: Good-bye ! '
Parsing [sent. 12803 len. 14]: ` Do you want me to carry it to London for you ? '
Parsing [sent. 12804 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 12805 len. 8]: She was already turning the chaise-cart round .
Parsing [sent. 12806 len. 10]: ` No , no , ' said Mrs Lupin .
Parsing [sent. 12807 len. 13]: ` It 's only a little something for refreshment on the road .
Parsing [sent. 12808 len. 5]: Sit fast , Jack .
Parsing [sent. 12809 len. 5]: Drive on , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12810 len. 3]: All right !
Parsing [sent. 12811 len. 3]: Good-bye ! '
Parsing [sent. 12812 len. 28]: She was a quarter of a mile off , before Tom collected himself ; and then he was waving his hand lustily ; and so was she .
Parsing [sent. 12813 len. 44]: ` And that 's the last of the old finger-post , ' thought Tom , straining his eyes , ` where I have so often stood to see this very coach go by , and where I have parted with so many companions !
Parsing [sent. 12814 len. 24]: I used to compare this coach to some great monster that appeared at certain times to bear my friends away into the world .
Parsing [sent. 12815 len. 20]: And now it 's bearing me away , to seek my fortune , Heaven knows where and how ! '
Parsing [sent. 12816 len. 42]: It made Tom melancholy to picture himself walking up the lane and back to Pecksniff 's as of old ; and being melancholy , he looked downwards at the basket on his knee , which he had for the moment forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 12817 len. 17]: ` She is the kindest and most considerate creature in the world , ' thought Tom .
Parsing [sent. 12818 len. 28]: ` Now I KNOW that she particularly told that man of hers not to look at me , on purpose to prevent my throwing him a shilling !
Parsing [sent. 12819 len. 41]: I had it ready for him all the time , and he never once looked towards me ; whereas that man naturally , -LRB- for I know him very well , -RRB- would have done nothing but grin and stare .
Parsing [sent. 12820 len. 13]: Upon my word , the kindness of people perfectly melts me . '
Parsing [sent. 12821 len. 8]: Here he caught the coachman 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 12822 len. 4]: The coachman winked .
Parsing [sent. 12823 len. 16]: ` Remarkable fine woman for her time of life , ' said the coachman . '
Parsing [sent. 12824 len. 10]: I quite agree with you , ' returned Tom .
Parsing [sent. 12825 len. 6]: ` So she is . '
Parsing [sent. 12826 len. 19]: ` Finer than many a young ` un , I mean to say , ' observed the coachman .
Parsing [sent. 12827 len. 4]: ` Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 12828 len. 12]: ` Than many a young one , ' Tom assented . '
Parsing [sent. 12829 len. 18]: I do n't care for 'em myself when they 're too young , ' remarked the coachman .
Parsing [sent. 12830 len. 18]: This was a matter of taste , which Tom did not feel himself called upon to discuss .
Parsing [sent. 12831 len. 53]: ` You 'll seldom find 'em possessing correct opinions about refreshment , for instance , when they 're too young , you know , ' said the coachman ; ' a woman must have arrived at maturity , before her mind 's equal to coming provided with a basket like that . '
Parsing [sent. 12832 len. 12]: ` Perhaps you would like to know what it contains ? '
Parsing [sent. 12833 len. 5]: said Tom , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 12834 len. 30]: As the coachman only laughed , and as Tom was curious himself , he unpacked it , and put the articles , one by one , upon the footboard .
Parsing [sent. 12835 len. 49]: A cold roast fowl , a packet of ham in slices , a crusty loaf , a piece of cheese , a paper of biscuits , half a dozen apples , a knife , some butter , a screw of salt , and a bottle of old sherry .
Parsing [sent. 12836 len. 13]: There was a letter besides , which Tom put in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 12837 len. 61]: The coachman was so earnest in his approval of Mrs Lupin 's provident habits , and congratulated Torn so warmly on his good fortune , that Tom felt it necessary , for the lady 's sake , to explain that the basket was a strictly Platonic basket , and had merely been presented to him in the way of friendship .
Parsing [sent. 12838 len. 91]: When he had made the statement with perfect gravity ; for he felt it incumbent on him to disabuse the mind of this lax rover of any incorrect impressions on the subject ; he signified that he would be happy to share the gifts with him , and proposed that they should attack the basket in a spirit of good fellowship at any time in the course of the night which the coachman 's experience and knowledge of the road might suggest , as being best adapted to the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 12839 len. 67]: From this time they chatted so pleasantly together , that although Tom knew infinitely more of unicorns than horses , the coachman informed his friend the guard at the end of the next stage , ` that rum as the box-seat looked , he was as good a one to go , in pint of conversation , as ever he 'd wish to sit by . '
Parsing [sent. 12840 len. 52]: Yoho , among the gathering shades ; making of no account the deep reflections of the trees , but scampering on through light and darkness , all the same , as if the light of London fifty miles away , were quite enough to travel by , and some to spare .
Parsing [sent. 12841 len. 40]: Yoho , beside the village green , where cricket-players linger yet , and every little indentation made in the fresh grass by bat or wicket , ball or player 's foot , sheds out its perfume on the night .
Parsing [sent. 12842 len. 50]: Away with four fresh horses from the Bald-faced Stag , where topers congregate about the door admiring ; and the last team with traces hanging loose , go roaming off towards the pond , until observed and shouted after by a dozen throats , while volunteering boys pursue them .
Parsing [sent. 12843 len. 44]: Now , with a clattering of hoofs and striking out of fiery sparks , across the old stone bridge , and down again into the shadowy road , and through the open gate , and far away , away , into the wold .
Parsing [sent. 12844 len. 2]: Yoho !
Parsing [sent. 12845 len. 12]: Yoho , behind there , stop that bugle for a moment !
Parsing [sent. 12846 len. 20]: Come creeping over to the front , along the coach-roof , guard , and make one at this basket !
Parsing [sent. 12847 len. 32]: Not that we slacken in our pace the while , not we ; we rather put the bits of blood upon their metal , for the greater glory of the snack .
Parsing [sent. 12848 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 12849 len. 38]: It is long since this bottle of old wine was brought into contact with the mellow breath of night , you may depend , and rare good stuff it is to wet a bugler 's whistle with .
Parsing [sent. 12850 len. 4]: Only try it .
Parsing [sent. 12851 len. 15]: Do n't be afraid of turning up your finger , Bill , another pull !
Parsing [sent. 12852 len. 13]: Now , take your breath , and try the bugle , Bill .
Parsing [sent. 12853 len. 4]: There 's music !
Parsing [sent. 12854 len. 6]: There 's a tone ! '
Parsing [sent. 12855 len. 10]: over the hills and far away , ' indeed .
Parsing [sent. 12856 len. 2]: Yoho !
Parsing [sent. 12857 len. 8]: The skittish mare is all alive to-night .
Parsing [sent. 12858 len. 2]: Yoho !
Parsing [sent. 12859 len. 2]: Yoho !
Parsing [sent. 12860 len. 5]: See the bright moon !
Parsing [sent. 12861 len. 19]: High up before we know it ; making the earth reflect the objects on its breast like water .
Parsing [sent. 12862 len. 36]: Hedges , trees , low cottages , church steeples , blighted stumps and flourishing young slips , have all grown vain upon the sudden , and mean to contemplate their own fair images till morning .
Parsing [sent. 12863 len. 15]: The poplars yonder rustle that their quivering leaves may see themselves upon the ground .
Parsing [sent. 12864 len. 29]: Not so the oak ; trembling does not become HIM ; and he watches himself in his stout old burly steadfastness , without the motion of a twig .
Parsing [sent. 12865 len. 36]: The moss-grown gate , ill-poised upon its creaking hinges , crippled and decayed swings to and fro before its glass , like some fantastic dowager ; while our own ghostly likeness travels on , Yoho !
Parsing [sent. 12866 len. 2]: Yoho !
Parsing [sent. 12867 len. 30]: through ditch and brake , upon the ploughed land and the smooth , along the steep hillside and steeper wall , as if it were a phantom -- Hunter .
Parsing [sent. 12868 len. 3]: Clouds too !
Parsing [sent. 12869 len. 7]: And a mist upon the Hollow !
Parsing [sent. 12870 len. 56]: Not a dull fog that hides it , but a light airy gauze-like mist , which in our eyes of modest admiration gives a new charm to the beauties it is spread before ; as real gauze has done ere now , and would again , so please you , though we were the Pope .
Parsing [sent. 12871 len. 2]: Yoho !
Parsing [sent. 12872 len. 9]: Why now we travel like the Moon herself .
Parsing [sent. 12873 len. 41]: Hiding this minute in a grove of trees ; next minute in a patch of vapour ; emerging now upon our broad clear course ; withdrawing now , but always dashing on , our journey is a counter-part of hers .
Parsing [sent. 12874 len. 2]: Yoho !
Parsing [sent. 12875 len. 6]: A match against the Moon !
Parsing [sent. 12876 len. 15]: The beauty of the night is hardly felt , when Day comes rushing up .
Parsing [sent. 12877 len. 2]: Yoho !
Parsing [sent. 12878 len. 15]: Two stages , and the country roads are almost changed to a continuous street .
Parsing [sent. 12879 len. 70]: Yoho , past market-gardens , rows of houses , villas , crescents , terraces , and squares ; past waggons , coaches , carts ; past early workmen , late stragglers , drunken men , and sober carriers of loads ; past brick and mortar in its every shape ; and in among the rattling pavements , where a jaunty-seat upon a coach is not so easy to preserve !
Parsing [sent. 12880 len. 34]: Yoho , down countless turnings , and through countless mazy ways , until an old Innyard is gained , and Tom Pinch , getting down quite stunned and giddy , is in London !
Parsing [sent. 12881 len. 10]: ` Five minutes before the time , too ! '
Parsing [sent. 12882 len. 12]: said the driver , as he received his fee of Tom .
Parsing [sent. 12883 len. 48]: ` Upon my word , ' said Tom , ' I should not have minded very much , if we had been five hours after it ; for at this early hour I do n't know where to go , or what to do with myself . '
Parsing [sent. 12884 len. 9]: ` Do n't they expect you then ? '
Parsing [sent. 12885 len. 4]: inquired the driver .
Parsing [sent. 12886 len. 4]: ` Who ? '
Parsing [sent. 12887 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 12888 len. 9]: ` Why them , ' returned the driver .
Parsing [sent. 12889 len. 39]: His mind was so clearly running on the assumption of Tom 's having come to town to see an extensive circle of anxious relations and friends , that it would have been pretty hard work to undeceive him .
Parsing [sent. 12890 len. 5]: Tom did not try .
Parsing [sent. 12891 len. 29]: He cheerfully evaded the subject , and going into the Inn , fell fast asleep before a fire in one of the public rooms opening from the yard .
Parsing [sent. 12892 len. 49]: When he awoke , the people in the house were all astir , so he washed and dressed himself ; to his great refreshment after the journey ; and , it being by that time eight o'clock , went forth at once to see his old friend John .
Parsing [sent. 12893 len. 53]: John Westlock lived in Furnival 's Inn , High Holborn , which was within a quarter of an hour 's walk of Tom 's starting-point , but seemed a long way off , by reason of his going two or three miles out of the straight road to make a short cut .
Parsing [sent. 12894 len. 31]: When at last he arrived outside John 's door , two stories up , he stood faltering with his hand upon the knocker , and trembled from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 12895 len. 36]: For he was rendered very nervous by the thought of having to relate what had fallen out between himself and Pecksniff ; and he had a misgiving that John would exult fearfully in the disclosure .
Parsing [sent. 12896 len. 25]: ` But it must be made , ' thought Tom , ` sooner or later ; and I had better get it over . '
Parsing [sent. 12897 len. 4]: Rat tat . '
Parsing [sent. 12898 len. 14]: I am afraid that 's not a London knock , ' thought Tom .
Parsing [sent. 12899 len. 7]: ` It did n't sound bold .
Parsing [sent. 12900 len. 12]: Perhaps that 's the reason why nobody answers the door . '
Parsing [sent. 12901 len. 38]: It is quite certain that nobody came , and that Tom stood looking at the knocker ; wondering whereabouts in the neighbourhood a certain gentleman resided , who was roaring out to somebody ` Come in ! '
Parsing [sent. 12902 len. 5]: with all his might .
Parsing [sent. 12903 len. 6]: ` Bless my soul ! '
Parsing [sent. 12904 len. 5]: thought Tom at last .
Parsing [sent. 12905 len. 12]: ` Perhaps he lives here , and is calling to me .
Parsing [sent. 12906 len. 6]: I never thought of that .
Parsing [sent. 12907 len. 12]: Can I open the door from the outside , I wonder .
Parsing [sent. 12908 len. 9]: Yes , to be sure I can . '
Parsing [sent. 12909 len. 36]: To be sure he could , by turning the handle ; and to be sure when he did turn it the same voice came rushing out , crying ` Why do n't you come in ?
Parsing [sent. 12910 len. 7]: Come in , do you hear ?
Parsing [sent. 12911 len. 8]: What are you standing there for ? '
Parsing [sent. 12912 len. 4]: -- quite violently .
Parsing [sent. 12913 len. 76]: Tom stepped from the little passage into the room from which these sounds proceeded , and had barely caught a glimpse of a gentleman in a dressing-gown and slippers -LRB- with his boots beside him ready to put on -RRB- , sitting at his breakfast with a newspaper in his hand , when the said gentleman , at the imminent hazard of oversetting his tea-table , made a plunge at Tom , and hugged him .
Parsing [sent. 12914 len. 9]: ` Why , Tom , my boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 12915 len. 4]: cried the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 12916 len. 4]: ` Tom ! '
Parsing [sent. 12917 len. 13]: ` How glad I am to see you , Mr Westlock ! '
Parsing [sent. 12918 len. 15]: said Tom Pinch , shaking both his hands , and trembling more than ever .
Parsing [sent. 12919 len. 7]: ` How kind you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 12920 len. 5]: ` Mr Westlock ! '
Parsing [sent. 12921 len. 13]: repeated John , ` what do you mean by that , Pinch ?
Parsing [sent. 12922 len. 12]: You have not forgotten my Christian name , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 12923 len. 7]: ` No , John , no .
Parsing [sent. 12924 len. 10]: I have not forgotten , ' said Thomas Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 12925 len. 12]: ` Good gracious me , how kind you are ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 12926 len. 12]: I never saw such a fellow in all my life ! '
Parsing [sent. 12927 len. 3]: cried John .
Parsing [sent. 12928 len. 13]: ` What do you mean by saying THAT over and over again ?
Parsing [sent. 12929 len. 11]: What did you expect me to be , I wonder !
Parsing [sent. 12930 len. 13]: Here , sit down , Tom , and be a reasonable creature .
Parsing [sent. 12931 len. 7]: How are you , my boy ?
Parsing [sent. 12932 len. 8]: I am delighted to see you ! '
Parsing [sent. 12933 len. 13]: ` And I am delighted to see YOU , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 12934 len. 12]: ` It 's mutual , of course , ' returned John .
Parsing [sent. 12935 len. 8]: ` It always was , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 12936 len. 19]: If I had known you had been coming , Tom , I would have had something for breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 12937 len. 36]: I would rather have such a surprise than the best breakfast in the world , myself ; but yours is another case , and I have no doubt you are as hungry as a hunter .
Parsing [sent. 12938 len. 20]: You must make out as well as you can , Tom , and we 'll recompense ourselves at dinner-time .
Parsing [sent. 12939 len. 15]: You take sugar , I know ; I recollect the sugar at Pecksniff 's .
Parsing [sent. 12940 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 12941 len. 4]: How IS Pecksniff ?
Parsing [sent. 12942 len. 7]: When did you come to town ?
Parsing [sent. 12943 len. 9]: DO begin at something or other , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 12944 len. 14]: There are only scraps here , but they are not at all bad .
Parsing [sent. 12945 len. 5]: Boar 's Head potted .
Parsing [sent. 12946 len. 5]: Try it , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 12947 len. 7]: Make a beginning whatever you do .
Parsing [sent. 12948 len. 7]: What an old Blade you are !
Parsing [sent. 12949 len. 8]: I am delighted to see you . '
Parsing [sent. 12950 len. 74]: While he delivered himself of these words in a state of great commotion , John was constantly running backwards and forwards to and from the closet , bringing out all sorts of things in pots , scooping extraordinary quantities of tea out of the caddy , dropping French rolls into his boots , pouring hot water over the butter , and making a variety of similar mistakes without disconcerting himself in the least .
Parsing [sent. 12951 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 12952 len. 24]: said John , sitting down for the fiftieth time , and instantly starting up again to make some other addition to the breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 12953 len. 16]: ` Now we are as well off as we are likely to be till dinner .
Parsing [sent. 12954 len. 10]: And now let us have the news , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 12955 len. 8]: Imprimis , how 's Pecksniff ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 12956 len. 15]: I do n't know how he is , ' was Tom 's grave answer .
Parsing [sent. 12957 len. 16]: John Westlock put the teapot down , and looked at him , in astonishment . '
Parsing [sent. 12958 len. 29]: I do n't know how he is , ' said Thomas Pinch ; ` and , saving that I wish him no ill , I do n't care .
Parsing [sent. 12959 len. 7]: I have left him , John .
Parsing [sent. 12960 len. 8]: I have left him for ever . '
Parsing [sent. 12961 len. 4]: ` Voluntarily ? '
Parsing [sent. 12962 len. 10]: ` Why , no , for he dismissed me .
Parsing [sent. 12963 len. 25]: But I had first found out that I was mistaken in him ; and I could not have remained with him under any circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 12964 len. 15]: I grieve to say that you were right in your estimate of his character .
Parsing [sent. 12965 len. 30]: It may be a ridiculous weakness , John , but it has been very painful and bitter to me to find this out , I do assure you . '
Parsing [sent. 12966 len. 25]: Tom had no need to direct that appealing look towards his friend , in mild and gentle deprecation of his answering with a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 12967 len. 15]: John Westlock would as soon have thought of striking him down upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 12968 len. 19]: ` It was all a dream of mine , ' said Tom , ` and it is over .
Parsing [sent. 12969 len. 13]: I 'll tell you how it happened , at some other time .
Parsing [sent. 12970 len. 7]: Bear with my folly , John .
Parsing [sent. 12971 len. 17]: I do not , just now , like to think or speak about it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 12972 len. 62]: I swear to you , Tom , ' returned his friend , with great earnestness of manner , after remaining silent for a few moments , ` that when I see , as I do now , how deeply you feel this , I do n't know whether to be glad or sorry that you have made the discovery at last .
Parsing [sent. 12973 len. 22]: I reproach myself with the thought that I ever jested on the subject ; I ought to have known better . '
Parsing [sent. 12974 len. 52]: ` My dear friend , ' said Tom , extending his hand , ` it is very generous and gallant in you to receive me and my disclosure in this spirit ; it makes me blush to think that I should have felt a moment 's uneasiness as I came along .
Parsing [sent. 12975 len. 31]: You ca n't think what a weight is lifted off my mind , ' said Tom , taking up his knife and fork again , and looking very cheerful . '
Parsing [sent. 12976 len. 10]: I shall punish the Boar 's Head dreadfully . '
Parsing [sent. 12977 len. 45]: The host , thus reminded of his duties , instantly betook himself to piling up all kinds of irreconcilable and contradictory viands in Tom 's plate , and a very capital breakfast Tom made , and very much the better for it Tom felt .
Parsing [sent. 12978 len. 20]: ` That 's all right , ' said John , after contemplating his visitor 's proceedings with infinite satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 12979 len. 7]: ` Now , about our plans .
Parsing [sent. 12980 len. 11]: You are going to stay with me , of course .
Parsing [sent. 12981 len. 6]: Where 's your box ? '
Parsing [sent. 12982 len. 12]: ` It 's at the Inn , ' said Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 12983 len. 20]: I did n't intend -- ' ` Never mind what you did n't intend , ' John Westlock interposed .
Parsing [sent. 12984 len. 11]: ` What you DID intend is more to the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 12985 len. 19]: You intended , in coming here , to ask my advice , did you not , Tom ? '
Parsing [sent. 12986 len. 4]: ` Certainly . '
Parsing [sent. 12987 len. 13]: ` And to take it when I gave it to you ? '
Parsing [sent. 12988 len. 30]: ` Yes , ' rejoined Tom , smiling , ` if it were good advice , which , being yours , I have no doubt it will be . '
Parsing [sent. 12989 len. 4]: ` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 12990 len. 28]: Then do n't be an obstinate old humbug in the outset , Tom , or I shall shut up shop and dispense none of that invaluable commodity .
Parsing [sent. 12991 len. 8]: You are on a visit to me .
Parsing [sent. 12992 len. 12]: I wish I had an organ for you , Tom ! '
Parsing [sent. 12993 len. 22]: ` So do the gentlemen downstairs , and the gentlemen overhead I have no doubt , ' was Tom 's reply .
Parsing [sent. 12994 len. 5]: ` Let me see .
Parsing [sent. 12995 len. 32]: In the first place , you will wish to see your sister this morning , ' pursued his friend , ` and of course you will like to go there alone .
Parsing [sent. 12996 len. 29]: I 'll walk part of the way with you ; and see about a little business of my own , and meet you here again in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 12997 len. 8]: Put that in your pocket , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 12998 len. 9]: It 's only the key of the door .
Parsing [sent. 12999 len. 11]: If you come home first you 'll want it . '
Parsing [sent. 13000 len. 34]: ` Really , ' said Tom , ` quartering one 's self upon a friend in this way -- ' ` Why , there are two keys , ' interposed John Westlock . '
Parsing [sent. 13001 len. 15]: I ca n't open the door with them both at once , can I ?
Parsing [sent. 13002 len. 9]: What a ridiculous fellow you are , Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 13003 len. 12]: Nothing particular you 'd like for dinner , is there ? '
Parsing [sent. 13004 len. 9]: ` Oh dear no , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13005 len. 14]: ` Very well , then you may as well leave it to me .
Parsing [sent. 13006 len. 10]: Have a glass of cherry brandy , Tom ? '
Parsing [sent. 13007 len. 5]: ` Not a drop !
Parsing [sent. 13008 len. 7]: What remarkable chambers these are ! '
Parsing [sent. 13009 len. 10]: said Pinch ` there 's everything in 'em ! '
Parsing [sent. 13010 len. 15]: ` Bless your soul , Tom , nothing but a few little bachelor contrivances !
Parsing [sent. 13011 len. 21]: the sort of impromptu arrangements that might have suggested themselves to Philip Quarll or Robinson Crusoe , that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 13012 len. 5]: What do you say ?
Parsing [sent. 13013 len. 5]: Shall we walk ? '
Parsing [sent. 13014 len. 9]: ` By all means , ' cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13015 len. 8]: ` As soon as you like . '
Parsing [sent. 13016 len. 32]: Accordingly John Westlock took the French rolls out of his boots , and put his boots on , and dressed himself ; giving Tom the paper to read in the meanwhile .
Parsing [sent. 13017 len. 23]: When he returned , equipped for walking , he found Tom in a brown study , with the paper in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 13018 len. 6]: ` Dreaming , Tom ? '
Parsing [sent. 13019 len. 11]: ` No , ' said Mr Pinch , ` No .
Parsing [sent. 13020 len. 24]: I have been looking over the advertising sheet , thinking there might be something in it which would be likely to suit me .
Parsing [sent. 13021 len. 18]: But , as I often think , the strange thing seems to be that nobody is suited .
Parsing [sent. 13022 len. 31]: Here are all kinds of employers wanting all sorts of servants , and all sorts of servants wanting all kinds of employers , and they never seem to come together .
Parsing [sent. 13023 len. 42]: Here is a gentleman in a public office in a position of temporary difficulty , who wants to borrow five hundred pounds ; and in the very next advertisement here is another gentleman who has got exactly that sum to lend .
Parsing [sent. 13024 len. 15]: But he 'll never lend it to him , John , you 'll find !
Parsing [sent. 13025 len. 55]: Here is a lady possessing a moderate independence , who wants to board and lodge with a quiet , cheerful family ; and here is a family describing themselves in those very words , `` a quiet , cheerful family , '' who want exactly such a lady to come and live with them .
Parsing [sent. 13026 len. 8]: But she 'll never go , John !
Parsing [sent. 13027 len. 53]: Neither do any of these single gentlemen who want an airy bedroom , with the occasional use of a parlour , ever appear to come to terms with these other people who live in a rural situation remarkable for its bracing atmosphere , within five minutes ' walk of the Royal Exchange .
Parsing [sent. 13028 len. 50]: Even those letters of the alphabet who are always running away from their friends and being entreated at the tops of columns to come back , never DO come back , if we may judge from the number of times they are asked to do it and do n't .
Parsing [sent. 13029 len. 76]: It really seems , ' said Tom , relinquishing the paper with a thoughtful sigh , ` as if people had the same gratification in printing their complaints as in making them known by word of mouth ; as if they found it a comfort and consolation to proclaim `` I want such and such a thing , and I ca n't get it , and I do n't expect I ever shall ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 13030 len. 13]: John Westlock laughed at the idea , and they went out together .
Parsing [sent. 13031 len. 33]: So many years had passed since Tom was last in London , and he had known so little of it then , that his interest in all he saw was very great .
Parsing [sent. 13032 len. 48]: He was particularly anxious , among other notorious localities , to have those streets pointed out to him which were appropriated to the slaughter of countrymen ; and was quite disappointed to find , after half-an-hour 's walking , that he had n't had his pocket picked .
Parsing [sent. 13033 len. 30]: But on John Westlock 's inventing a pickpocket for his gratification , and pointing out a highly respectable stranger as one of that fraternity , he was much delighted .
Parsing [sent. 13034 len. 33]: His friend accompanied him to within a short distance of Camberwell and having put him beyond the possibility of mistaking the wealthy brass-and-copper founder 's , left him to make his visit .
Parsing [sent. 13035 len. 13]: Arriving before the great bell-handle , Tom gave it a gentle pull .
Parsing [sent. 13036 len. 4]: The porter appeared .
Parsing [sent. 13037 len. 9]: ` Pray does Miss Pinch live here ? '
Parsing [sent. 13038 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13039 len. 12]: ` Miss Pinch is governess here , ' replied the porter .
Parsing [sent. 13040 len. 37]: At the same time he looked at Tom from head to foot , as if he would have said , ` You are a nice man , YOU are ; where did YOU come from ? '
Parsing [sent. 13041 len. 12]: ` It 's the same young lady , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13042 len. 6]: ` It 's quite right .
Parsing [sent. 13043 len. 7]: Is she at home ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 13044 len. 14]: I do n't know , I 'm sure , ' rejoined the porter .
Parsing [sent. 13045 len. 13]: ` Do you think you could have the goodness to ascertain ? '
Parsing [sent. 13046 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13047 len. 31]: He had quite a delicacy in offering the suggestion , for the possibility of such a step did not appear to present itself to the porter 's mind at all .
Parsing [sent. 13048 len. 51]: The fact was that the porter in answering the gate-bell had , according to usage , rung the house-bell -LRB- for it is as well to do these things in the Baronial style while you are about it -RRB- , and that there the functions of his office had ceased .
Parsing [sent. 13049 len. 50]: Being hired to open and shut the gate , and not to explain himself to strangers , he left this little incident to be developed by the footman with the tags , who , at this juncture , called out from the door steps : ` Hollo , there !
Parsing [sent. 13050 len. 6]: wot are you up to ?
Parsing [sent. 13051 len. 7]: This way , young man ! '
Parsing [sent. 13052 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 13053 len. 8]: said Tom , hurrying towards him . '
Parsing [sent. 13054 len. 10]: I did n't observe that there was anybody else .
Parsing [sent. 13055 len. 8]: Pray is Miss Pinch at home ? '
Parsing [sent. 13056 len. 10]: ` She 's IN , ' replied the footman .
Parsing [sent. 13057 len. 33]: As much as to say to Tom : ` But if you think she has anything to do with the proprietorship of this place you had better abandon that idea . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13058 len. 14]: I wish to see her , if you please , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13059 len. 49]: The footman , being a lively young man , happened to have his attention caught at that moment by the flight of a pigeon , in which he took so warm an interest that his gaze was rivetted on the bird until it was quite out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 13060 len. 15]: He then invited Tom to come in , and showed him into a parlour .
Parsing [sent. 13061 len. 5]: ` Hany neem ? '
Parsing [sent. 13062 len. 11]: said the young man , pausing languidly at the door .
Parsing [sent. 13063 len. 64]: It was a good thought ; because without providing the stranger , in case he should happen to be of a warm temper , with a sufficient excuse for knocking him down , it implied this young man 's estimate of his quality , and relieved his breast of the oppressive burden of rating him in secret as a nameless and obscure individual .
Parsing [sent. 13064 len. 13]: ` Say her brother , if you please , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13065 len. 4]: ` Mother ? '
Parsing [sent. 13066 len. 4]: drawled the footman .
Parsing [sent. 13067 len. 12]: ` Brother , ' repeated Tom , slightly raising his voice .
Parsing [sent. 13068 len. 51]: ` And if you will say , in the first instance , a gentleman , and then say her brother , I shall be obliged to you , as she does not expect me or know I am in London , and I do not wish to startle her . '
Parsing [sent. 13069 len. 32]: The young man 's interest in Tom 's observations had ceased long before this time , but he kindly waited until now ; when , shutting the door , he withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 13070 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 13071 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13072 len. 9]: ` This is very disrespectful and uncivil behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 13073 len. 17]: I hope these are new servants here , and that Ruth is very differently treated . '
Parsing [sent. 13074 len. 14]: His cogitations were interrupted by the sound of voices in the adjoining room .
Parsing [sent. 13075 len. 29]: They seemed to be engaged in high dispute , or in indignant reprimand of some offender ; and gathering strength occasionally , broke out into a perfect whirlwind .
Parsing [sent. 13076 len. 35]: It was in one of these gusts , as it appeared to Tom , that the footman announced him ; for an abrupt and unnatural calm took place , and then a dead silence .
Parsing [sent. 13077 len. 40]: He was standing before the window , wondering what domestic quarrel might have caused these sounds , and hoping Ruth had nothing to do with it , when the door opened , and his sister ran into his arms .
Parsing [sent. 13078 len. 8]: ` Why , bless my soul ! '
Parsing [sent. 13079 len. 25]: said Tom , looking at her with great pride , when they had tenderly embraced each other , ` how altered you are Ruth !
Parsing [sent. 13080 len. 21]: I should scarcely have known you , my love , if I had seen you anywhere else , I declare !
Parsing [sent. 13081 len. 34]: You are so improved , ' said Tom , with inexpressible delight ; ` you are so womanly ; you are so -- positively , you know , you are so handsome ! '
Parsing [sent. 13082 len. 30]: ` If YOU think so Tom -- ' ` Oh , but everybody must think so , you know , ' said Tom , gently smoothing down her hair .
Parsing [sent. 13083 len. 10]: ` It 's matter of fact ; not opinion .
Parsing [sent. 13084 len. 7]: But what 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 13085 len. 15]: said Tom , looking at her more intently , ` how flushed you are !
Parsing [sent. 13086 len. 7]: and you have been crying . '
Parsing [sent. 13087 len. 10]: ` No , I have not , Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 13088 len. 9]: ` Nonsense , ' said her brother stoutly .
Parsing [sent. 13089 len. 6]: ` That 's a story .
Parsing [sent. 13090 len. 5]: Do n't tell me !
Parsing [sent. 13091 len. 4]: I know better .
Parsing [sent. 13092 len. 6]: What is it , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 13093 len. 8]: I 'm not with Mr Pecksniff now .
Parsing [sent. 13094 len. 53]: I am going to try and settle myself in London ; and if you are not happy here -LRB- as I very much fear you are not , for I begin to think you have been deceiving me with the kindest and most affectionate intention -RRB- you shall not remain here . '
Parsing [sent. 13095 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 13096 len. 9]: Tom 's blood was rising ; mind that !
Parsing [sent. 13097 len. 18]: Perhaps the Boar 's Head had something to do with it , but certainly the footman had .
Parsing [sent. 13098 len. 17]: So had the sight of his pretty sister -- a great deal to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 13099 len. 22]: Tom could bear a good deal himself , but he was proud of her , and pride is a sensitive thing .
Parsing [sent. 13100 len. 43]: He began to think , ` there are more Pecksniffs than one , perhaps , ' and by all the pins and needles that run up and down in angry veins , Tom was in a most unusual tingle all at once !
Parsing [sent. 13101 len. 22]: ` We will talk about it , Tom , ' said Ruth , giving him another kiss to pacify him . '
Parsing [sent. 13102 len. 10]: I am afraid I can not stay here . '
Parsing [sent. 13103 len. 5]: ` Can not ! '
Parsing [sent. 13104 len. 3]: replied Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13105 len. 11]: ` Why then , you shall not , my love .
Parsing [sent. 13106 len. 2]: Heyday !
Parsing [sent. 13107 len. 8]: You are not an object of charity !
Parsing [sent. 13108 len. 5]: Upon my word ! '
Parsing [sent. 13109 len. 36]: Tom was stopped in these exclamations by the footman , who brought a message from his master , importing that he wished to speak with him before he went , and with Miss Pinch also .
Parsing [sent. 13110 len. 9]: ` Show the way , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13111 len. 10]: ` I 'll wait upon him at once . '
Parsing [sent. 13112 len. 55]: Accordingly they entered the adjoining room from which the noise of altercation had proceeded ; and there they found a middle-aged gentleman , with a pompous voice and manner , and a middle-aged lady , with what may be termed an excisable face , or one in which starch and vinegar were decidedly employed .
Parsing [sent. 13113 len. 34]: There was likewise present that eldest pupil of Miss Pinch , whom Mrs Todgers , on a previous occasion , had called a syrup , and who was now weeping and sobbing spitefully .
Parsing [sent. 13114 len. 15]: ` My brother , sir , ' said Ruth Pinch , timidly presenting Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13115 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 13116 len. 8]: cried the gentleman , surveying Tom attentively .
Parsing [sent. 13117 len. 12]: ` You really are Miss Pinch 's brother , I presume ?
Parsing [sent. 13118 len. 6]: You will excuse my asking .
Parsing [sent. 13119 len. 8]: I do n't observe any resemblance . '
Parsing [sent. 13120 len. 15]: ` Miss Pinch has a brother , I know , ' observed the lady .
Parsing [sent. 13121 len. 25]: ` Miss Pinch is always talking about her brother , when she ought to be engaged upon my education , ' sobbed the pupil .
Parsing [sent. 13122 len. 3]: ` Sophia !
Parsing [sent. 13123 len. 5]: Hold your tongue ! '
Parsing [sent. 13124 len. 4]: observed the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 13125 len. 12]: ` Sit down , if you please , ' addressing Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13126 len. 15]: Tom sat down , looking from one face to another , in mute surprise .
Parsing [sent. 13127 len. 22]: ` Remain here , if you please , Miss Pinch , ' pursued the gentleman , looking slightly over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 13128 len. 15]: Tom interrupted him here , by rising to place a chair for his sister .
Parsing [sent. 13129 len. 9]: Having done which he sat down again . '
Parsing [sent. 13130 len. 22]: I am glad you chance to have called to see your sister to-day , sir , ' resumed the brass-and-copper founder .
Parsing [sent. 13131 len. 40]: ` For although I do not approve , as a principle , of any young person engaged in my family in the capacity of a governess , receiving visitors , it happens in this case to be well timed .
Parsing [sent. 13132 len. 18]: I am sorry to inform you that we are not at all satisfied with your sister . '
Parsing [sent. 13133 len. 14]: ` We are very much DISsatisfied with her , ' observed the lady .
Parsing [sent. 13134 len. 22]: ` I 'd never say another lesson to Miss Pinch if I was to be beat to death for it ! '
Parsing [sent. 13135 len. 4]: sobbed the pupil .
Parsing [sent. 13136 len. 4]: ` Sophia ! '
Parsing [sent. 13137 len. 4]: cried her father .
Parsing [sent. 13138 len. 6]: ` Hold your tongue ! '
Parsing [sent. 13139 len. 15]: ` Will you allow me to inquire what your ground of dissatisfaction is ? '
Parsing [sent. 13140 len. 3]: asked Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13141 len. 12]: ` Yes , ' said the gentleman , ' I will .
Parsing [sent. 13142 len. 13]: I do n't recognize it as a right ; but I will .
Parsing [sent. 13143 len. 12]: Your sister has not the slightest innate power of commanding respect .
Parsing [sent. 13144 len. 11]: It has been a constant source of difference between us .
Parsing [sent. 13145 len. 42]: Although she has been in this family for some time , and although the young lady who is now present has almost , as it were , grown up under her tuition , that young lady has no respect for her .
Parsing [sent. 13146 len. 21]: Miss Pinch has been perfectly unable to command my daughter 's respect , or to win my daughter 's confidence .
Parsing [sent. 13147 len. 33]: Now , ' said the gentleman , allowing the palm of his hand to fall gravely down upon the table : ' I maintain that there is something radically wrong in that !
Parsing [sent. 13148 len. 27]: You , as her brother , may be disposed to deny it -- ' ' I beg your pardon , sir , ' said Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 13149 len. 10]: I am not at all disposed to deny it .
Parsing [sent. 13150 len. 17]: I am sure that there is something radically wrong ; radically monstrous , in that . '
Parsing [sent. 13151 len. 5]: ` Good Heavens ! '
Parsing [sent. 13152 len. 21]: cried the gentleman , looking round the room with dignity , ` what do I find to be the case !
Parsing [sent. 13153 len. 20]: what results obtrude themselves upon me as flowing from this weakness of character on the part of Miss Pinch !
Parsing [sent. 13154 len. 80]: What are my feelings as a father , when , after my desire -LRB- repeatedly expressed to Miss Pinch , as I think she will not venture to deny -RRB- that my daughter should be choice in her expressions , genteel in her deportment , as becomes her station in life , and politely distant to her inferiors in society , I find her , only this very morning , addressing Miss Pinch herself as a beggar ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 13155 len. 12]: A beggarly thing , ' observed the lady , in correction .
Parsing [sent. 13156 len. 17]: ` Which is worse , ' said the gentleman , triumphantly ; ` which is worse .
Parsing [sent. 13157 len. 4]: A beggarly thing .
Parsing [sent. 13158 len. 9]: A low , coarse , despicable expression ! '
Parsing [sent. 13159 len. 9]: ` Most despicable , ' cried Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 13160 len. 16]: I am glad to find that there is a just appreciation of it here . '
Parsing [sent. 13161 len. 20]: ` So just , sir , ' said the gentleman , lowering his voice to be the more impressive .
Parsing [sent. 13162 len. 64]: ` So just , that , but for my knowing Miss Pinch to be an unprotected young person , an orphan , and without friends , I would , as I assured Miss Pinch , upon my veracity and personal character , a few minutes ago , I would have severed the connection between us at that moment and from that time . '
Parsing [sent. 13163 len. 8]: ` Bless my soul , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 13164 len. 33]: cried Tom , rising from his seat ; for he was now unable to contain himself any longer ; ` do n't allow such considerations as those to influence you , pray .
Parsing [sent. 13165 len. 7]: They do n't exist , sir .
Parsing [sent. 13166 len. 5]: She is not unprotected .
Parsing [sent. 13167 len. 8]: She is ready to depart this instant .
Parsing [sent. 13168 len. 11]: Ruth , my dear , get your bonnet on ! '
Parsing [sent. 13169 len. 8]: ` Oh , a pretty family ! '
Parsing [sent. 13170 len. 4]: cried the lady .
Parsing [sent. 13171 len. 8]: ` Oh , he 's her brother !
Parsing [sent. 13172 len. 8]: There 's no doubt about that ! '
Parsing [sent. 13173 len. 31]: ` As little doubt , madam , ' said Tom , ` as that the young lady yonder is the child of your teaching , and not my sister 's .
Parsing [sent. 13174 len. 11]: Ruth , my dear , get your bonnet on ! '
Parsing [sent. 13175 len. 63]: ` When you say , young man , ' interposed the brass-and-copper founder , haughtily , ` with that impertinence which is natural to you , and which I therefore do not condescend to notice further , that the young lady , my eldest daughter , has been educated by any one but Miss Pinch , you -- I need n't proceed .
Parsing [sent. 13176 len. 5]: You comprehend me fully .
Parsing [sent. 13177 len. 11]: I have no doubt you are used to it . '
Parsing [sent. 13178 len. 4]: ` Sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 13179 len. 13]: cried Tom , after regarding him in silence for some little time .
Parsing [sent. 13180 len. 15]: ` If you do not understand what I mean , I will tell you .
Parsing [sent. 13181 len. 24]: If you do understand what I mean , I beg you not to repeat that mode of expressing yourself in answer to it .
Parsing [sent. 13182 len. 18]: My meaning is , that no man can expect his children to respect what he degrades . '
Parsing [sent. 13183 len. 8]: ` Ha , ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 13184 len. 4]: laughed the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 13185 len. 3]: ` Cant !
Parsing [sent. 13186 len. 2]: cant !
Parsing [sent. 13187 len. 5]: The common cant ! '
Parsing [sent. 13188 len. 8]: ` The common story , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 13189 len. 11]: said Tom ; ` the story of a common mind .
Parsing [sent. 13190 len. 15]: Your governess can not win the confidence and respect of your children , forsooth !
Parsing [sent. 13191 len. 14]: Let her begin by winning yours , and see what happens then . '
Parsing [sent. 13192 len. 16]: ` Miss Pinch is getting her bonnet on , I trust , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 13193 len. 5]: said the gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 13194 len. 14]: I trust she is , ' said Tom , forestalling the reply . '
Parsing [sent. 13195 len. 7]: I have no doubt she is .
Parsing [sent. 13196 len. 11]: In the meantime I address myself to you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 13197 len. 27]: You made your statement to me , sir ; you required to see me for that purpose ; and I have a right to answer it .
Parsing [sent. 13198 len. 36]: I am not loud or turbulent , ' said Tom , which was quite true , ` though I can scarcely say as much for you , in your manner of addressing yourself to me .
Parsing [sent. 13199 len. 17]: And I wish , on my sister 's behalf , to state the simple truth . '
Parsing [sent. 13200 len. 20]: ` You may state anything you like , young man , ' returned the gentleman , affecting to yawn .
Parsing [sent. 13201 len. 10]: ` My dear , Miss Pinch 's money . '
Parsing [sent. 13202 len. 51]: ` When you tell me , ' resumed Tom , who was not the less indignant for keeping himself quiet , ` that my sister has no innate power of commanding the respect of your children , I must tell you it is not so ; and that she has .
Parsing [sent. 13203 len. 28]: She is as well bred , as well taught , as well qualified by nature to command respect , as any hirer of a governess you know .
Parsing [sent. 13204 len. 47]: But when you place her at a disadvantage in reference to every servant in your house , how can you suppose , if you have the gift of common sense , that she is not in a tenfold worse position in reference to your daughters ? '
Parsing [sent. 13205 len. 4]: ` Pretty well !
Parsing [sent. 13206 len. 16]: Upon my word , ' exclaimed the gentleman , ` this is pretty well ! '
Parsing [sent. 13207 len. 12]: ` It is very ill , sir , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13208 len. 13]: ` It is very bad and mean , and wrong and cruel .
Parsing [sent. 13209 len. 2]: Respect !
Parsing [sent. 13210 len. 29]: I believe young people are quick enough to observe and imitate ; and why or how should they respect whom no one else respects , and everybody slights ?
Parsing [sent. 13211 len. 12]: And very partial they must grow -- oh , very partial !
Parsing [sent. 13212 len. 22]: -- to their studies , when they see to what a pass proficiency in those same tasks has brought their governess !
Parsing [sent. 13213 len. 2]: Respect !
Parsing [sent. 13214 len. 35]: Put anything the most deserving of respect before your daughters in the light in which you place her , and you will bring it down as low , no matter what it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 13215 len. 16]: ` You speak with extreme impertinence , young man , ' observed the gentleman . '
Parsing [sent. 13216 len. 29]: I speak without passion , but with extreme indignation and contempt for such a course of treatment , and for all who practice it , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13217 len. 68]: ` Why , how can you , as an honest gentleman , profess displeasure or surprise at your daughter telling my sister she is something beggarly and humble , when you are for ever telling her the same thing yourself in fifty plain , outspeaking ways , though not in words ; and when your very porter and footman make the same delicate announcement to all comers ?
Parsing [sent. 13218 len. 31]: As to your suspicion and distrust of her ; even of her word ; if she is not above their reach , you have no right to employ her . '
Parsing [sent. 13219 len. 5]: ` No right ! '
Parsing [sent. 13220 len. 5]: cried the brass-and-copper founder .
Parsing [sent. 13221 len. 8]: ` Distinctly not , ' Tom answered .
Parsing [sent. 13222 len. 26]: ` If you imagine that the payment of an annual sum of money gives it to you , you immensely exaggerate its power and value .
Parsing [sent. 13223 len. 14]: Your money is the least part of your bargain in such a case .
Parsing [sent. 13224 len. 19]: You may be punctual in that to half a second on the clock , and yet be Bankrupt .
Parsing [sent. 13225 len. 39]: I have nothing more to say , ' said Tom , much flushed and flustered , now that it was over , ` except to crave permission to stand in your garden until my sister is ready . '
Parsing [sent. 13226 len. 10]: Not waiting to obtain it , Tom walked out .
Parsing [sent. 13227 len. 13]: Before he had well begun to cool , his sister joined him .
Parsing [sent. 13228 len. 21]: She was crying ; and Tom could not bear that any one about the house should see her doing that .
Parsing [sent. 13229 len. 14]: ` They will think you are sorry to go , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13230 len. 9]: ` You are not sorry to go ? '
Parsing [sent. 13231 len. 7]: ` No , Tom , no .
Parsing [sent. 13232 len. 13]: I have been anxious to go for a very long time . '
Parsing [sent. 13233 len. 6]: ` Very well , then !
Parsing [sent. 13234 len. 5]: Do n't cry ! '
Parsing [sent. 13235 len. 4]: said Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 13236 len. 15]: I am so sorry for YOU , dear , ' sobbed Tom 's sister .
Parsing [sent. 13237 len. 16]: ` But you ought to be glad on my account , ' said Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 13238 len. 12]: I shall be twice as happy with you for a companion .
Parsing [sent. 13239 len. 5]: Hold up your head .
Parsing [sent. 13240 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 13241 len. 8]: Now we go out as we ought .
Parsing [sent. 13242 len. 14]: Not blustering , you know , but firm and confident in ourselves . '
Parsing [sent. 13243 len. 18]: The idea of Tom and his sister blustering , under any circumstances , was a splendid absurdity .
Parsing [sent. 13244 len. 38]: But Tom was very far from feeling it to be so , in his excitement ; and passed out at the gate with such severe determination written in his face that the porter hardly knew him again .
Parsing [sent. 13245 len. 52]: It was not until they had walked some short distance , and Tom found himself getting cooler and more collected , that he was quite restored to himself by an inquiry from his sister , who said in her pleasant little voice : ` Where are we going , Tom ? '
Parsing [sent. 13246 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 13247 len. 12]: said Tom , stopping , ' I do n't know . '
Parsing [sent. 13248 len. 14]: ` Do n't you -- do n't you live anywhere , dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 13249 len. 10]: asked Tom 's sister looking wistfully in his face .
Parsing [sent. 13250 len. 7]: ` No , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13251 len. 5]: ` Not at present .
Parsing [sent. 13252 len. 3]: Not exactly .
Parsing [sent. 13253 len. 6]: I only arrived this morning .
Parsing [sent. 13254 len. 7]: We must have some lodgings . '
Parsing [sent. 13255 len. 61]: He did n't tell her that he had been going to stay with his friend John , and could on no account think of billeting two inmates upon him , of whom one was a young lady ; for he knew that would make her uncomfortable , and would cause her to regard herself as being an inconvenience to him .
Parsing [sent. 13256 len. 42]: Neither did he like to leave her anywhere while he called on John , and told him of this change in his arrangements ; for he was delicate of seeming to encroach upon the generous and hospitable nature of his friend .
Parsing [sent. 13257 len. 40]: Therefore he said again , ` We must have some lodgings , of course ; ' and said it as stoutly as if he had been a perfect Directory and Guide -- Book to all the lodgings in London .
Parsing [sent. 13258 len. 11]: ` Where shall we go and look for 'em ? '
Parsing [sent. 13259 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13260 len. 7]: ` What do you think ? '
Parsing [sent. 13261 len. 15]: Tom 's sister was not much wiser on such a topic than he was .
Parsing [sent. 13262 len. 35]: So she squeezed her little purse into his coat-pocket , and folding the little hand with which she did so on the other little hand with which she clasped his arm , said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 13263 len. 21]: ` It ought to be a cheap neighbourhood , ' said Tom , ` and not too far from London .
Parsing [sent. 13264 len. 4]: Let me see .
Parsing [sent. 13265 len. 10]: Should you think Islington a good place ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 13266 len. 12]: I should think it was an excellent place , Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 13267 len. 18]: ` It used to be called Merry Islington , once upon a time , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13268 len. 16]: ` Perhaps it 's merry now ; if so , it 's all the better .
Parsing [sent. 13269 len. 3]: Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 13270 len. 14]: ` If it 's not too dear , ' said Tom 's sister .
Parsing [sent. 13271 len. 15]: ` Of course , if it 's not too dear , ' assented Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13272 len. 7]: ` Well , where IS Islington ?
Parsing [sent. 13273 len. 13]: We ca n't do better than go there , I should think .
Parsing [sent. 13274 len. 5]: Let 's go . '
Parsing [sent. 13275 len. 24]: Tom 's sister would have gone anywhere with him ; so they walked off , arm in arm , as comfortably as possible .
Parsing [sent. 13276 len. 26]: Finding , presently , that Islington was not in that neighbourhood , Tom made inquiries respecting a public conveyance thither ; which they soon obtained .
Parsing [sent. 13277 len. 75]: As they rode along they were very full of conversation indeed , Tom relating what had happened to him , and Tom 's sister relating what had happened to her , and both finding a great deal more to say than time to say it in ; for they had only just begun to talk , in comparison with what they had to tell each other , when they reached their journey 's end .
Parsing [sent. 13278 len. 30]: ` Now , ' said Tom , ` we must first look out for some very unpretending streets , and then look out for bills in the windows . '
Parsing [sent. 13279 len. 35]: So they walked off again , quite as happily as if they had just stepped out of a snug little house of their own , to look for lodgings on account of somebody else .
Parsing [sent. 13280 len. 44]: Tom 's simplicity was unabated , Heaven knows ; but now that he had somebody to rely upon him , he was stimulated to rely a little more upon himself , and was , in his own opinion , quite a desperate fellow .
Parsing [sent. 13281 len. 37]: After roaming up and down for hours , looking at some scores of lodgings , they began to find it rather fatiguing , especially as they saw none which were at all adapted to their purpose .
Parsing [sent. 13282 len. 35]: At length , however , in a singular little old-fashioned house , up a blind street , they discovered two small bedrooms and a triangular parlour , which promised to suit them well enough .
Parsing [sent. 13283 len. 42]: Their desiring to take possession immediately was a suspicious circumstance , but even this was surmounted by the payment of their first week 's rent , and a reference to John Westlock , Esquire , Furnival 's Inn , High Holborn .
Parsing [sent. 13284 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 13285 len. 73]: It was a goodly sight , when this important point was settled , to behold Tom and his sister trotting round to the baker 's , and the butcher 's , and the grocer 's , with a kind of dreadful delight in the unaccustomed cares of housekeeping ; taking secret counsel together as they gave their small orders , and distracted by the least suggestion on the part of the shopkeeper !
Parsing [sent. 13286 len. 53]: When they got back to the triangular parlour , and Tom 's sister , bustling to and fro , busy about a thousand pleasant nothings , stopped every now and then to give old Tom a kiss or smile upon him , Tom rubbed his hands as if all Islington were his .
Parsing [sent. 13287 len. 20]: It was late in the afternoon now , though , and high time for Tom to keep his appointment .
Parsing [sent. 13288 len. 41]: So , after agreeing with his sister that in consideration of not having dined , they would venture on the extravagance of chops for supper at nine , he walked out again to narrate these marvellous occurrences to John . '
Parsing [sent. 13289 len. 14]: I am quite a family man all at once , ' thought Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13290 len. 18]: ` If I can only get something to do , how comfortable Ruth and I may be !
Parsing [sent. 13291 len. 5]: Ah , that if !
Parsing [sent. 13292 len. 9]: But it 's of no use to despond .
Parsing [sent. 13293 len. 24]: I can but do that , when I have tried everything and failed ; and even then it wo n't serve me much .
Parsing [sent. 13294 len. 26]: Upon my word , ' thought Tom , quickening his pace , ' I do n't know what John will think has become of me .
Parsing [sent. 13295 len. 37]: He 'll begin to be afraid I have strayed into one of those streets where the countrymen are murdered ; and that I have been made meat pies of , or some such horrible thing . '
Parsing [sent. 13296 len. 22]: CHAPTER THIRTY -- SEVEN TOM PINCH , GOING ASTRAY , FINDS THAT HE IS NOT THE ONLY PERSON IN THAT PREDICAMENT .
Parsing [sent. 13297 len. 84]: HE RETALIATES UPON A FALLEN FOE Tom 's evil genius did not lead him into the dens of any of those preparers of cannibalic pastry , who are represented in many standard country legends as doing a lively retail business in the Metropolis ; nor did it mark him out as the prey of ring-droppers , pea and thimble-riggers , duffers , touters , or any of those bloodless sharpers , who are , perhaps , a little better known to the Police .
Parsing [sent. 13298 len. 75]: He fell into conversation with no gentleman who took him into a public-house , where there happened to be another gentleman who swore he had more money than any gentleman , and very soon proved he had more money than one gentleman by taking his away from him ; neither did he fall into any other of the numerous man-traps which are set up without notice , in the public grounds of this city .
Parsing [sent. 13299 len. 6]: But he lost his way .
Parsing [sent. 13300 len. 20]: He very soon did that ; and in trying to find it again he lost it more and more .
Parsing [sent. 13301 len. 84]: Now , Tom , in his guileless distrust of London , thought himself very knowing in coming to the determination that he would not ask to be directed to Furnival 's Inn , if he could help it ; unless , indeed , he should happen to find himself near the Mint , or the Bank of England ; in which case he would step in , and ask a civil question or two , confiding in the perfect respectability of the concern .
Parsing [sent. 13302 len. 102]: So on he went , looking up all the streets he came near , and going up half of them ; and thus , by dint of not being true to Goswell Street , and filing off into Aldermanbury , and bewildering himself in Barbican , and being constant to the wrong point of the compass in London Wall , and then getting himself crosswise into Thames Street , by an instinct that would have been marvellous if he had had the least desire or reason to go there , he found himself , at last , hard by the Monument .
Parsing [sent. 13303 len. 20]: The Man in the Monument was quite as mysterious a being to Tom as the Man in the Moon .
Parsing [sent. 13304 len. 34]: It immediately occurred to him that the lonely creature who held himself aloof from all mankind in that pillar like some old hermit was the very man of whom to ask his way .
Parsing [sent. 13305 len. 62]: Cold , he might be ; little sympathy he had , perhaps , with human passion -- the column seemed too tall for that ; but if Truth did n't live in the base of the Monument , notwithstanding Pope 's couplet about the outside of it , where in London -LRB- thought Tom -RRB- was she likely to be found !
Parsing [sent. 13306 len. 66]: Coming close below the pillar , it was a great encouragement to Tom to find that the Man in the Monument had simple tastes ; that stony and artificial as his residence was , he still preserved some rustic recollections ; that he liked plants , hung up bird-cages , was not wholly cut off from fresh groundsel , and kept young trees in tubs .
Parsing [sent. 13307 len. 26]: The Man in the Monument , himself , was sitting outside the door -- his own door : the Monument-door : what a grand idea !
Parsing [sent. 13308 len. 28]: -- and was actually yawning , as if there were no Monument to stop his mouth , and give him a perpetual interest in his own existence .
Parsing [sent. 13309 len. 26]: Tom was advancing towards this remarkable creature , to inquire the way to Furnival 's Inn , when two people came to see the Monument .
Parsing [sent. 13310 len. 19]: They were a gentleman and a lady ; and the gentleman said , ` How much a-piece ? '
Parsing [sent. 13311 len. 12]: The Man in the Monument replied , ' A Tanner . '
Parsing [sent. 13312 len. 11]: It seemed a low expression , compared with the Monument .
Parsing [sent. 13313 len. 21]: The gentleman put a shilling into his hand , and the Man in the Monument opened a dark little door .
Parsing [sent. 13314 len. 24]: When the gentleman and lady had passed out of view , he shut it again , and came slowly back to his chair .
Parsing [sent. 13315 len. 6]: He sat down and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 13316 len. 13]: ` They do n't know what a many steps there is ! '
Parsing [sent. 13317 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 13318 len. 11]: ` It 's worth twice the money to stop here .
Parsing [sent. 13319 len. 6]: Oh , my eye ! '
Parsing [sent. 13320 len. 13]: The Man in the Monument was a Cynic ; a worldly man !
Parsing [sent. 13321 len. 9]: Tom could n't ask his way of HIM .
Parsing [sent. 13322 len. 12]: He was prepared to put no confidence in anything he said .
Parsing [sent. 13323 len. 5]: ` My gracious ! '
Parsing [sent. 13324 len. 8]: cried a well-known voice behind Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 13325 len. 10]: ` Why , to be sure it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 13326 len. 14]: At the same time he was poked in the back by a parasol .
Parsing [sent. 13327 len. 18]: Turning round to inquire into this salute , he beheld the eldest daughter of his late patron .
Parsing [sent. 13328 len. 5]: ` Miss Pecksniff ! '
Parsing [sent. 13329 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13330 len. 10]: ` Why , my goodness , Mr Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 13331 len. 3]: cried Cherry .
Parsing [sent. 13332 len. 9]: ` What are you doing here ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 13333 len. 12]: I have rather wandered from my way , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13334 len. 16]: ` I -- ' ' I hope you have run away , ' said Charity .
Parsing [sent. 13335 len. 22]: ` It would be quite spirited and proper if you had , when my Papa so far forgets himself . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13336 len. 9]: I have left him , ' returned Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13337 len. 10]: ` But it was perfectly understood on both sides .
Parsing [sent. 13338 len. 7]: It was not done clandestinely . '
Parsing [sent. 13339 len. 6]: ` Is he married ? '
Parsing [sent. 13340 len. 11]: asked Cherry , with a spasmodic shake of her chin .
Parsing [sent. 13341 len. 42]: ` No , not yet , ' said Tom , colouring ; ` to tell you the truth , I do n't think he is likely to be , if -- if Miss Graham is the object of his passion . '
Parsing [sent. 13342 len. 7]: ` Tcha , Mr Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 13343 len. 14]: cried Charity , with sharp impatience , ` you 're very easily deceived .
Parsing [sent. 13344 len. 14]: You do n't know the arts of which such a creature is capable .
Parsing [sent. 13345 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 13346 len. 7]: it 's a wicked world . '
Parsing [sent. 13347 len. 7]: ` You are not married ? '
Parsing [sent. 13348 len. 8]: Tom hinted , to divert the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 13349 len. 6]: ` N -- no ! '
Parsing [sent. 13350 len. 18]: said Cherry , tracing out one particular paving-stone in Monument Yard with the end of her parasol .
Parsing [sent. 13351 len. 12]: ` I -- but really it 's quite impossible to explain .
Parsing [sent. 13352 len. 7]: Wo n't you walk in ? '
Parsing [sent. 13353 len. 8]: ` You live here , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 13354 len. 29]: said Tom ` Yes , ' returned Miss Pecksniff , pointing with her parasol to Todgers 's ; ' I reside with this lady , AT PRESENT . '
Parsing [sent. 13355 len. 23]: The great stress on the two last words suggested to Tom that he was expected to say something in reference to them .
Parsing [sent. 13356 len. 4]: So he said .
Parsing [sent. 13357 len. 5]: ` Only at present !
Parsing [sent. 13358 len. 8]: Are you going home again soon ? '
Parsing [sent. 13359 len. 10]: ` No , Mr Pinch , ' returned Charity .
Parsing [sent. 13360 len. 6]: ` No , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 13361 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 13362 len. 34]: A mother-in-law who is younger than -- I mean to say , who is as nearly as possible about the same age as one 's self , would not quite suit my spirit .
Parsing [sent. 13363 len. 4]: Not quite ! '
Parsing [sent. 13364 len. 9]: said Cherry , with a spiteful shiver . '
Parsing [sent. 13365 len. 14]: I thought from your saying `` at present '' ' -- Tom observed .
Parsing [sent. 13366 len. 7]: ` Really , upon my word !
Parsing [sent. 13367 len. 41]: I had no idea you would press me so very closely on the subject , Mr Pinch , ' said Charity , blushing , ` or I should not have been so foolish as to allude to -- oh really !
Parsing [sent. 13368 len. 8]: -- wo n't you walk in ? '
Parsing [sent. 13369 len. 37]: Tom mentioned , to excuse himself , that he had an appointment in Furnival 's Inn , and that coming from Islington he had taken a few wrong turnings , and arrived at the Monument instead .
Parsing [sent. 13370 len. 28]: Miss Pecksniff simpered very much when he asked her if she knew the way to Furnival 's Inn , and at length found courage to reply . '
Parsing [sent. 13371 len. 107]: A gentleman who is a friend of mine , or at least who is not exactly a friend so much as a sort of acquaintance -- Oh upon my word , I hardly know what I say , Mr Pinch ; you must n't suppose there is any engagement between us ; or at least if there is , that it is at all a settled thing as yet -- is going to Furnival 's Inn immediately , I believe upon a little business , and I am sure he would be very glad to accompany you , so as to prevent your going wrong again .
Parsing [sent. 13372 len. 6]: You had better walk in .
Parsing [sent. 13373 len. 28]: You will very likely find my sister Merry here , ' she said with a curious toss of her head , and anything but an agreeable smile .
Parsing [sent. 13374 len. 33]: ` Then , I think , I 'll endeavour to find my way alone , ' said Tom , ` for I fear she would not be very glad to see me .
Parsing [sent. 13375 len. 34]: That unfortunate occurrence , in relation to which you and I had some amicable words together , in private , is not likely to have impressed her with any friendly feeling towards me .
Parsing [sent. 13376 len. 9]: Though it really was not my fault . '
Parsing [sent. 13377 len. 30]: ` She has never heard of that , you may depend , ' said Cherry , gathering up the corners of her mouth , and nodding at Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 13378 len. 22]: I am far from sure that she would bear you any mighty ill will for it , if she had . '
Parsing [sent. 13379 len. 8]: ` You do n't say so ? '
Parsing [sent. 13380 len. 12]: cried Tom , who was really concerned by this insinuation . '
Parsing [sent. 13381 len. 8]: I say nothing , ' said Charity .
Parsing [sent. 13382 len. 41]: ` If I had not already known what shocking things treachery and deceit are in themselves , Mr Pinch , I might perhaps have learnt it from the success they meet with -- from the success they meet with . '
Parsing [sent. 13383 len. 6]: Here she smiled as before .
Parsing [sent. 13384 len. 8]: ` But I do n't say anything .
Parsing [sent. 13385 len. 9]: On the contrary , I should scorn it .
Parsing [sent. 13386 len. 7]: You had better walk in ! '
Parsing [sent. 13387 len. 17]: There was something hidden here , which piqued Tom 's interest and troubled his tender heart .
Parsing [sent. 13388 len. 68]: When , in a moment 's irresolution , he looked at Charity , he could not but observe a struggle in her face between a sense of triumph and a sense of shame ; nor could he but remark how , meeting even his eyes , which she cared so little for , she turned away her own , for all the splenetic defiance in her manner .
Parsing [sent. 13389 len. 51]: An uneasy thought entered Tom 's head ; a shadowy misgiving that the altered relations between himself and Pecksniff were somehow to involve an altered knowledge on his part of other people , and were to give him an insight into much of which he had had no previous suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 13390 len. 12]: And yet he put no definite construction upon Charity 's proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 13391 len. 84]: He certainly had no idea that as he had been the audience and spectator of her mortification , she grasped with eager delight at any opportunity of reproaching her sister with his presence in HER far deeper misery ; for he knew nothing of it , and only pictured that sister as the same giddy , careless , trivial creature she always had been , with the same slight estimation of himself which she had never been at the least pains to conceal .
Parsing [sent. 13392 len. 33]: In short , he had merely a confused impression that Miss Pecksniff was not quite sisterly or kind ; and being curious to set it right , accompanied her as she desired .
Parsing [sent. 13393 len. 26]: The house-door being opened , she went in before Tom , requesting him to follow her ; and led the way to the parlour door .
Parsing [sent. 13394 len. 6]: ` Oh , Merry ! '
Parsing [sent. 13395 len. 17]: she said , looking in , ' I am so glad you have not gone home .
Parsing [sent. 13396 len. 17]: Who do you think I have met in the street , and brought to see you !
Parsing [sent. 13397 len. 3]: Mr Pinch !
Parsing [sent. 13398 len. 2]: There .
Parsing [sent. 13399 len. 10]: Now you ARE surprised , I am sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 13400 len. 13]: Not more surprised than Tom was , when he looked upon her .
Parsing [sent. 13401 len. 4]: Not so much .
Parsing [sent. 13402 len. 5]: Not half so much .
Parsing [sent. 13403 len. 22]: ` Mr Pinch has left Papa , my dear , ' said Cherry , ` and his prospects are quite flourishing .
Parsing [sent. 13404 len. 21]: I have promised that Augustus , who is going that way , shall escort him to the place he wants .
Parsing [sent. 13405 len. 10]: Augustus , my child , where are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 13406 len. 29]: With these words Miss Pecksniff screamed her way out of the parlour , calling on Augustus Moddle to appear ; and left Tom Pinch alone with her sister .
Parsing [sent. 13407 len. 77]: If she had always been his kindest friend ; if she had treated him through all his servitude with such consideration as was never yet received by struggling man ; if she had lightened every moment of those many years , and had ever spared and never wounded him ; his honest heart could not have swelled before her with a deeper pity , or a purer freedom from all base remembrance than it did then .
Parsing [sent. 13408 len. 5]: ` My gracious me !
Parsing [sent. 13409 len. 21]: You are really the last person in the world I should have thought of seeing , I am sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 13410 len. 12]: Tom was sorry to hear her speaking in her old manner .
Parsing [sent. 13411 len. 6]: He had not expected that .
Parsing [sent. 13412 len. 37]: Yet he did not feel it a contradiction that he should be sorry to see her so unlike her old self , and sorry at the same time to hear her speaking in her old manner .
Parsing [sent. 13413 len. 8]: The two things seemed quite natural . '
Parsing [sent. 13414 len. 12]: I wonder you find any gratification in coming to see me .
Parsing [sent. 13415 len. 11]: I ca n't think what put it in your head .
Parsing [sent. 13416 len. 8]: I never had much in seeing you .
Parsing [sent. 13417 len. 19]: There was no love lost between us , Mr Pinch , at any time , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 13418 len. 21]: Her bonnet lay beside her on the sofa , and she was very busy with the ribbons as she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 13419 len. 13]: Much too busy to be conscious of the work her fingers did .
Parsing [sent. 13420 len. 9]: ` We never quarrelled , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13421 len. 32]: -- Tom was right in that , for one person can no more quarrel without an adversary , than one person can play at chess , or fight a duel . '
Parsing [sent. 13422 len. 14]: I hoped you would be glad to shake hands with an old friend .
Parsing [sent. 13423 len. 12]: Do n't let us rake up bygones , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13424 len. 11]: ` If I ever offended you , forgive me . '
Parsing [sent. 13425 len. 27]: She looked at him for a moment ; dropped her bonnet from her hands ; spread them before her altered face , and burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 13426 len. 7]: ` Oh , Mr Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 13427 len. 19]: she said , ` although I never used you well , I did believe your nature was forgiving .
Parsing [sent. 13428 len. 10]: I did not think you could be cruel . '
Parsing [sent. 13429 len. 20]: She spoke as little like her old self now , for certain , as Tom could possibly have wished .
Parsing [sent. 13430 len. 18]: But she seemed to be appealing to him reproachfully , and he did not understand her . '
Parsing [sent. 13431 len. 11]: I seldom showed it -- never -- I know that .
Parsing [sent. 13432 len. 37]: But I had that belief in you , that if I had been asked to name the person in the world least likely to retort upon me , I would have named you , confidently . '
Parsing [sent. 13433 len. 7]: ` Would have named me ! '
Parsing [sent. 13434 len. 3]: Tom repeated .
Parsing [sent. 13435 len. 18]: ` Yes , ' she said with energy , ` and I have often thought so . '
Parsing [sent. 13436 len. 15]: After a moment 's reflection , Tom sat himself upon a chair beside her .
Parsing [sent. 13437 len. 38]: ` Do you believe , ' said Tom , ` oh , can you think , that what I said just now , I said with any but the true and plain intention which my words professed ?
Parsing [sent. 13438 len. 11]: I mean it , in the spirit and the letter .
Parsing [sent. 13439 len. 18]: If I ever offended you , forgive me ; I may have done so , many times .
Parsing [sent. 13440 len. 7]: You never injured or offended me .
Parsing [sent. 13441 len. 24]: How , then , could I possibly retort , if even I were stern and bad enough to wish to do it ! '
Parsing [sent. 13442 len. 34]: After a little while she thanked him , through her tears and sobs , and told him she had never been at once so sorry and so comforted , since she left home .
Parsing [sent. 13443 len. 33]: Still she wept bitterly ; and it was the greater pain to Tom to see her weeping , from her standing in especial need , just then , of sympathy and tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 13444 len. 6]: ` Come , come ! '
Parsing [sent. 13445 len. 17]: said Tom , ` you used to be as cheerful as the day was long . '
Parsing [sent. 13446 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 13447 len. 3]: used ! '
Parsing [sent. 13448 len. 13]: she cried , in such a tone as rent Tom 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 13449 len. 10]: ` And will be again , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13450 len. 6]: ` No , never more .
Parsing [sent. 13451 len. 7]: No , never , never more .
Parsing [sent. 13452 len. 66]: If you should talk with old Mr Chuzzlewit , at any time , ' she added , looking hurriedly into his face -- ' I sometimes thought he liked you , but suppressed it -- will you promise me to tell him that you saw me here , and that I said I bore in mind the time we talked together in the churchyard ? '
Parsing [sent. 13453 len. 6]: Tom promised that he would .
Parsing [sent. 13454 len. 25]: ` Many times since then , when I have wished I had been carried there before that day , I have recalled his words .
Parsing [sent. 13455 len. 28]: I wish that he should know how true they were , although the least acknowledgment to that effect has never passed my lips and never will . '
Parsing [sent. 13456 len. 7]: Tom promised this , conditionally too .
Parsing [sent. 13457 len. 29]: He did not tell her how improbable it was that he and the old man would ever meet again , because he thought it might disturb her more .
Parsing [sent. 13458 len. 59]: ` If he should ever know this , through your means , dear Mr Pinch , ' said Mercy , ` tell him that I sent the message , not for myself , but that he might be more forbearing and more patient , and more trustful to some other person , in some other time of need .
Parsing [sent. 13459 len. 38]: Tell him that if he could know how my heart trembled in the balance that day , and what a very little would have turned the scale , his own would bleed with pity for me . '
Parsing [sent. 13460 len. 14]: ` Yes , yes , ' said Tom , ' I will . '
Parsing [sent. 13461 len. 44]: ` When I appeared to him the most unworthy of his help , I was -- I know I was , for I have often , often , thought about it since -- the most inclined to yield to what he showed me .
Parsing [sent. 13462 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 13463 len. 60]: if he had relented but a little more ; if he had thrown himself in my way for but one other quarter of an hour ; if he had extended his compassion for a vain , unthinking , miserable girl , in but the least degree ; he might , and I believe he would , have saved her !
Parsing [sent. 13464 len. 72]: Tell him that I do n't blame him , but am grateful for the effort that he made ; but ask him for the love of God , and youth , and in merciful consideration for the struggle which an ill-advised and unwakened nature makes to hide the strength it thinks its weakness -- ask him never , never , to forget this , when he deals with one again ! '
Parsing [sent. 13465 len. 19]: Although Tom did not hold the clue to her full meaning , he could guess it pretty nearly .
Parsing [sent. 13466 len. 22]: Touched to the quick , he took her hand and said , or meant to say , some words of consolation .
Parsing [sent. 13467 len. 13]: She felt and understood them , whether they were spoken or no .
Parsing [sent. 13468 len. 24]: He was not quite certain , afterwards , but that she had tried to kneel down at his feet , and bless him .
Parsing [sent. 13469 len. 16]: He found that he was not alone in the room when she had left it .
Parsing [sent. 13470 len. 9]: Mrs Todgers was there , shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 13471 len. 43]: Tom had never seen Mrs Todgers , it is needless to say , but he had a perception of her being the lady of the house ; and he saw some genuine compassion in her eyes , that won his good opinion .
Parsing [sent. 13472 len. 5]: ` Ah , sir !
Parsing [sent. 13473 len. 14]: You are an old friend , I see , ' said Mrs Todgers .
Parsing [sent. 13474 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13475 len. 30]: ` And yet , ' quoth Mrs Todgers , shutting the door softly , ` she has n't told you what her troubles are , I 'm certain . '
Parsing [sent. 13476 len. 13]: Tom was struck by these words , for they were quite true .
Parsing [sent. 13477 len. 13]: ` Indeed , ' he said , ` she has not . '
Parsing [sent. 13478 len. 17]: ` And never would , ' said Mrs Todgers , ` if you saw her daily .
Parsing [sent. 13479 len. 19]: She never makes the least complaint to me , or utters a single word of explanation or reproach .
Parsing [sent. 13480 len. 19]: But I know , ' said Mrs Todgers , drawing in her breath , ' I know ! '
Parsing [sent. 13481 len. 44]: Tom nodded sorrowfully , ` So do I. ' ' I fully believe , ' said Mrs Todgers , taking her pocket-handkerchief from the flat reticule , ` that nobody can tell one half of what that poor young creature has to undergo .
Parsing [sent. 13482 len. 60]: But though she comes here , constantly , to ease her poor full heart without his knowing it ; and saying , `` Mrs Todgers , I am very low to-day ; I think that I shall soon be dead , '' sits crying in my room until the fit is past ; I know no more from her .
Parsing [sent. 13483 len. 27]: And , I believe , ' said Mrs Todgers , putting back her handkerchief again , ` that she considers me a good friend too . '
Parsing [sent. 13484 len. 9]: Mrs Todgers might have said her best friend .
Parsing [sent. 13485 len. 58]: Commercial gentlemen and gravy had tried Mrs Todgers 's temper ; the main chance -- it was such a very small one in her case , that she might have been excused for looking sharp after it , lest it should entirely vanish from her sight -- had taken a firm hold on Mrs Todgers 's attention .
Parsing [sent. 13486 len. 62]: But in some odd nook in Mrs Todgers 's breast , up a great many steps , and in a corner easy to be overlooked , there was a secret door , with ` Woman ' written on the spring , which , at a touch from Mercy 's hand , had flown wide open , and admitted her for shelter .
Parsing [sent. 13487 len. 44]: When boarding-house accounts are balanced with all other ledgers , and the books of the Recording Angel are made up for ever , perhaps there may be seen an entry to thy credit , lean Mrs Todgers , which shall make thee beautiful !
Parsing [sent. 13488 len. 60]: She was growing beautiful so rapidly in Tom 's eyes ; for he saw that she was poor , and that this good had sprung up in her from among the sordid strivings of her life ; that she might have been a very Venus in a minute more , if Miss Pecksniff had not entered with her friend .
Parsing [sent. 13489 len. 6]: ` Mr Thomas Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 13490 len. 12]: said Charity , performing the ceremony of introduction with evident pride .
Parsing [sent. 13491 len. 4]: ` Mr Moddle .
Parsing [sent. 13492 len. 6]: Where 's my sister ? '
Parsing [sent. 13493 len. 11]: ` Gone , Miss Pecksniff , ' Mrs Todgers answered .
Parsing [sent. 13494 len. 9]: ` She had appointed to be home . '
Parsing [sent. 13495 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 13496 len. 7]: said Charity , looking at Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13497 len. 7]: ` Oh , dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 13498 len. 21]: ` She 's greatly altered since she 's been Anoth -- since she 's been married , Mrs Todgers ! '
Parsing [sent. 13499 len. 3]: observed Moddle .
Parsing [sent. 13500 len. 6]: ` My dear Augustus ! '
Parsing [sent. 13501 len. 10]: said Miss Pecksniff , in a low voice . '
Parsing [sent. 13502 len. 15]: I verily believe you have said that fifty thousand times , in my hearing .
Parsing [sent. 13503 len. 7]: What a Prose you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 13504 len. 26]: This was succeeded by some trifling love passages , which appeared to originate with , if not to be wholly carried on by Miss Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 13505 len. 30]: At any rate , Mr Moddle was much slower in his responses than is customary with young lovers , and exhibited a lowness of spirits which was quite oppressive .
Parsing [sent. 13506 len. 27]: He did not improve at all when Tom and he were in the streets , but sighed so dismally that it was dreadful to hear him .
Parsing [sent. 13507 len. 17]: As a means of cheering him up , Tom told him that he wished him joy .
Parsing [sent. 13508 len. 4]: ` Joy ! '
Parsing [sent. 13509 len. 3]: cried Moddle .
Parsing [sent. 13510 len. 6]: ` Ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 13511 len. 8]: ` What an extraordinary young man ! '
Parsing [sent. 13512 len. 3]: thought Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13513 len. 11]: ` The Scorner has not set his seal upon you .
Parsing [sent. 13514 len. 8]: YOU care what becomes of you ? '
Parsing [sent. 13515 len. 3]: said Moddle .
Parsing [sent. 13516 len. 16]: Tom admitted that it was a subject in which he certainly felt some interest . '
Parsing [sent. 13517 len. 9]: I do n't , ' said Mr Moddle .
Parsing [sent. 13518 len. 10]: ` The Elements may have me when they please .
Parsing [sent. 13519 len. 5]: I 'm ready . '
Parsing [sent. 13520 len. 18]: Tom inferred from these , and other expressions of the same nature , that he was jealous .
Parsing [sent. 13521 len. 38]: Therefore he allowed him to take his own course ; which was such a gloomy one , that he felt a load removed from his mind when they parted company at the gate of Furnival 's Inn .
Parsing [sent. 13522 len. 30]: It was now a couple of hours past John Westlock 's dinner-time ; and he was walking up and down the room , quite anxious for Tom 's safety .
Parsing [sent. 13523 len. 17]: The table was spread ; the wine was carefully decanted ; and the dinner smelt delicious .
Parsing [sent. 13524 len. 15]: ` Why , Tom , old boy , where on earth have you been ?
Parsing [sent. 13525 len. 5]: Your box is here .
Parsing [sent. 13526 len. 12]: Get your boots off instantly , and sit down ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 13527 len. 32]: I am sorry to say I ca n't stay , John , ' replied Tom Pinch , who was breathless with the haste he had made in running up the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 13528 len. 6]: ` Ca n't stay ! '
Parsing [sent. 13529 len. 24]: ` If you 'll go on with your dinner , ' said Tom , ` I 'll tell you my reason the while .
Parsing [sent. 13530 len. 17]: I must n't eat myself , or I shall have no appetite for the chops . '
Parsing [sent. 13531 len. 12]: ` There are no chops here , my food fellow . '
Parsing [sent. 13532 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 13533 len. 10]: But there are at Islington , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13534 len. 24]: John Westlock was perfectly confounded by this reply , and vowed he would not touch a morsel until Tom had explained himself fully .
Parsing [sent. 13535 len. 19]: So Tom sat down , and told him all ; to which he listened with the greatest interest .
Parsing [sent. 13536 len. 28]: He knew Tom too well , and respected his delicacy too much , to ask him why he had taken these measures without communicating with him first .
Parsing [sent. 13537 len. 50]: He quite concurred in the expediency of Tom 's immediately returning to his sister , as he knew so little of the place in which he had left her , and good-humouredly proposed to ride back with him in a cab , in which he might convey his box .
Parsing [sent. 13538 len. 26]: Tom 's proposition that he should sup with them that night , he flatly rejected , but made an appointment with him for the morrow .
Parsing [sent. 13539 len. 32]: ` And now Tom , ' he said , as they rode along , ' I have a question to ask you to which I expect a manly and straightforward answer .
Parsing [sent. 13540 len. 6]: Do you want any money ?
Parsing [sent. 13541 len. 9]: I am pretty sure you do . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13542 len. 10]: I do n't indeed , ' said Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 13543 len. 8]: I believe you are deceiving me . '
Parsing [sent. 13544 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 13545 len. 16]: With many thanks to you , I am quite in earnest , ' Tom replied .
Parsing [sent. 13546 len. 12]: ` My sister has some money , and so have I .
Parsing [sent. 13547 len. 55]: If I had nothing else , John , I have a five-pound note , which that good creature , Mrs Lupin , of the Dragon , handed up to me outside the coach , in a letter begging me to borrow it ; and then drove off as hard as she could go . '
Parsing [sent. 13548 len. 16]: ` And a blessing on every dimple in her handsome face , say I ! '
Parsing [sent. 13549 len. 20]: cried John , ` though why you should give her the preference over me , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 13550 len. 3]: Never mind .
Parsing [sent. 13551 len. 8]: I bide my time , Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 13552 len. 17]: ` And I hope you 'll continue to bide it , ' returned Tom , gayly .
Parsing [sent. 13553 len. 24]: ` For I owe you more , already , in a hundred other ways , than I can ever hope to pay . '
Parsing [sent. 13554 len. 11]: They parted at the door of Tom 's new residence .
Parsing [sent. 13555 len. 45]: John Westlock , sitting in the cab , and , catching a glimpse of a blooming little busy creature darting out to kiss Tom and to help him with his box , would not have had the least objection to change places with him .
Parsing [sent. 13556 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 13557 len. 21]: she WAS a cheerful little thing ; and had a quaint , bright quietness about her that was infinitely pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 13558 len. 11]: Surely she was the best sauce for chops ever invented .
Parsing [sent. 13559 len. 29]: The potatoes seemed to take a pleasure in sending up their grateful steam before her ; the froth upon the pint of porter pouted to attract her notice .
Parsing [sent. 13560 len. 7]: But it was all in vain .
Parsing [sent. 13561 len. 6]: She saw nothing but Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13562 len. 11]: Tom was the first and last thing in the world .
Parsing [sent. 13563 len. 36]: As she sat opposite to Tom at supper , fingering one of Tom 's pet tunes upon the table-cloth , and smiling in his face , he had never been so happy in his life .
Parsing [sent. 13564 len. 50]: CHAPTER THIRTY -- EIGHT SECRET SERVICE In walking from the city with his sentimental friend , Tom Pinch had looked into the face , and brushed against the threadbare sleeve , of Mr Nadgett , man of mystery to the Anglo -- Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance Company .
Parsing [sent. 13565 len. 31]: Mr Nadgett naturally passed away from Tom 's remembrance as he passed out of his view ; for he did n't know him , and had never heard his name .
Parsing [sent. 13566 len. 51]: As there are a vast number of people in the huge metropolis of England who rise up every morning not knowing where their heads will rest at night , so there are a multitude who shooting arrows over houses as their daily business , never know on whom they fall .
Parsing [sent. 13567 len. 47]: Mr Nadgett might have passed Tom Pinch ten thousand times ; might even have been quite familiar with his face , his name , pursuits , and character ; yet never once have dreamed that Tom had any interest in any act or mystery of his .
Parsing [sent. 13568 len. 11]: Tom might have done the like by him of course .
Parsing [sent. 13569 len. 60]: But the same private man out of all the men alive , was in the mind of each at the same moment ; was prominently connected though in a different manner , with the day 's adventures of both ; and formed , when they passed each other in the street , the one absorbing topic of their thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 13570 len. 12]: Why Tom had Jonas Chuzzlewit in his mind requires no explanation .
Parsing [sent. 13571 len. 16]: Why Mr Nadgett should have had Jonas Chuzzlewit in his , is quite another thing .
Parsing [sent. 13572 len. 24]: But , somehow or other , that amiable and worthy orphan had become a part of the mystery of Mr Nadgett 's existence .
Parsing [sent. 13573 len. 17]: Mr Nadgett took an interest in his lightest proceedings ; and it never flagged or wavered .
Parsing [sent. 13574 len. 118]: He watched him in and out of the Assurance Office , where he was now formally installed as a Director ; he dogged his footsteps in the streets ; he stood listening when he talked ; he sat in coffee-rooms entering his name in the great pocket-book , over and over again ; he wrote letters to himself about him constantly ; and , when he found them in his pocket , put them in the fire , with such distrust and caution that he would bend down to watch the crumpled tinder while it floated upwards , as if his mind misgave him , that the mystery it had contained might come out at the chimney-pot .
Parsing [sent. 13575 len. 9]: And yet all this was quite a secret .
Parsing [sent. 13576 len. 12]: Mr Nadgett kept it to himself , and kept it close .
Parsing [sent. 13577 len. 35]: Jonas had no more idea that Mr Nadgett 's eyes were fixed on him , than he had that he was living under the daily inspection and report of a whole order of Jesuits .
Parsing [sent. 13578 len. 40]: Indeed Mr Nadgett 's eyes were seldom fixed on any other objects than the ground , the clock , or the fire ; but every button on his coat might have been an eye , he saw so much .
Parsing [sent. 13579 len. 33]: The secret manner of the man disarmed suspicion in this wise ; suggesting , not that he was watching any one , but that he thought some other man was watching him .
Parsing [sent. 13580 len. 35]: He went about so stealthily , and kept himself so wrapped up in himself , that the whole object of his life appeared to be , to avoid notice and preserve his own mystery .
Parsing [sent. 13581 len. 91]: Jonas sometimes saw him in the street , hovering in the outer office , waiting at the door for the man who never came , or slinking off with his immovable face and drooping head , and the one beaver glove dangling before him ; but he would as soon have thought of the cross upon the top of St. Paul 's Cathedral taking note of what he did , or slowly winding a great net about his feet , as of Nadgett 's being engaged in such an occupation .
Parsing [sent. 13582 len. 104]: Mr Nadgett made a mysterious change about this time in his mysterious life : for whereas he had , until now , been first seen every morning coming down Cornhill , so exactly like the Nadgett of the day before as to occasion a popular belief that he never went to bed or took his clothes off , he was now first seen in Holborn , coming out of Kingsgate Street ; and it was soon discovered that he actually went every morning to a barber 's shop in that street to get shaved ; and that the barber 's name was Sweedlepipe .
Parsing [sent. 13583 len. 60]: He seemed to make appointments with the man who never came , to meet him at this barber 's ; for he would frequently take long spells of waiting in the shop , and would ask for pen and ink , and pull out his pocket-book , and be very busy over it for an hour at a time .
Parsing [sent. 13584 len. 35]: Mrs Gamp and Mr Sweedlepipe had many deep discoursings on the subject of this mysterious customer ; but they usually agreed that he had speculated too much and was keeping out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 13585 len. 83]: He must have appointed the man who never kept his word , to meet him at another new place too ; for one day he was found , for the first time , by the waiter at the Mourning Coach -- Horse , the House-of-call for Undertakers , down in the City there , making figures with a pipe-stem in the sawdust of a clean spittoon ; and declining to call for anything , on the ground of expecting a gentleman presently .
Parsing [sent. 13586 len. 41]: As the gentleman was not honourable enough to keep his engagement , he came again next day , with his pocket-book in such a state of distention that he was regarded in the bar as a man of large property .
Parsing [sent. 13587 len. 32]: After that , he repeated his visits every day , and had so much writing to do , that he made nothing of emptying a capacious leaden inkstand in two sittings .
Parsing [sent. 13588 len. 21]: Although he never talked much , still , by being there among the regular customers , he made their acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 13589 len. 59]: and in course of time became quite intimate with Mr Tacker , Mr Mould 's foreman ; and even with Mr Mould himself , who openly said he was a long-headed man , a dry one , a salt fish , a deep file , a rasper ; and made him the subject of many other flattering encomiums .
Parsing [sent. 13590 len. 52]: At the same time , too , he told the people at the Assurance Office , in his own mysterious way , that there was something wrong -LRB- secretly wrong , of course -RRB- in his liver , and that he feared he must put himself under the doctor 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 13591 len. 46]: He was delivered over to Jobling upon this representation ; and though Jobling could not find out where his liver was wrong , wrong Mr Nadgett said it was ; observing that it was his own liver , and he hoped he ought to know .
Parsing [sent. 13592 len. 35]: Accordingly , he became Mr Jobling 's patient ; and detailing his symptoms in his slow and secret way , was in and out of that gentleman 's room a dozen times a day .
Parsing [sent. 13593 len. 61]: As he pursued all these occupations at once ; and all steadily ; and all secretly ; and never slackened in his watchfulness of everything that Mr Jonas said and did , and left unsaid and undone ; it is not improbable that they were , secretly , essential parts of some great scheme which Mr Nadgett had on foot .
Parsing [sent. 13594 len. 55]: It was on the morning of this very day on which so much had happened to Tom Pinch , that Nadgett suddenly appeared before Mr Montague 's house in Pall Mall -- he always made his appearance as if he had that moment come up a trap -- when the clocks were striking nine .
Parsing [sent. 13595 len. 37]: He rang the bell in a covert under-handed way , as though it were a treasonable act ; and passed in at the door , the moment it was opened wide enough to receive his body .
Parsing [sent. 13596 len. 12]: That done , he shut it immediately with his own hands .
Parsing [sent. 13597 len. 25]: Mr Bailey , taking up his name without delay , returned with a request that he would follow him into his master 's chamber .
Parsing [sent. 13598 len. 42]: The chairman of the Anglo -- Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance Board was dressing , and received him as a business person who was often backwards and forwards , and was received at all times for his business ' sake .
Parsing [sent. 13599 len. 7]: ` Well , Mr Nadgett ? '
Parsing [sent. 13600 len. 11]: Mr Nadgett put his hat upon the ground and coughed .
Parsing [sent. 13601 len. 36]: The boy having withdrawn and shut the door , he went to it softly , examined the handle , and returned to within a pace or two of the chair in which Mr Montague sat .
Parsing [sent. 13602 len. 9]: ` Any news , Mr Nadgett ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 13603 len. 13]: I think we have some news at last , sir . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13604 len. 7]: I am happy to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 13605 len. 14]: I began to fear you were off the scent , Mr Nadgett . '
Parsing [sent. 13606 len. 5]: ` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 13607 len. 5]: It grows cold occasionally .
Parsing [sent. 13608 len. 4]: It will sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 13609 len. 7]: We ca n't help that . '
Parsing [sent. 13610 len. 9]: ` You are truth itself , Mr Nadgett .
Parsing [sent. 13611 len. 8]: Do you report a great success ? '
Parsing [sent. 13612 len. 23]: ` That depends upon your judgment and construction of it , ' was his answer , as he put on his spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 13613 len. 9]: ` What do you think of it yourself ?
Parsing [sent. 13614 len. 6]: Have you pleased yourself ? '
Parsing [sent. 13615 len. 32]: Mr Nadgett rubbed his hands slowly , stroked his chin , looked round the room , and said , ` Yes , yes , I think it 's a good case .
Parsing [sent. 13616 len. 11]: I am disposed to think it 's a good case .
Parsing [sent. 13617 len. 9]: Will you go into it at once ? '
Parsing [sent. 13618 len. 6]: ` By all means . '
Parsing [sent. 13619 len. 51]: Mr Nadgett picked out a certain chair from among the rest , and having planted it in a particular spot , as carefully as if he had been going to vault over it , placed another chair in front of it ; leaving room for his own legs between them .
Parsing [sent. 13620 len. 22]: He then sat down in chair number two , and laid his pocket-book , very carefully , on chair number one .
Parsing [sent. 13621 len. 18]: He then untied the pocket-book , and hung the string over the back of chair number one .
Parsing [sent. 13622 len. 21]: He then drew both the chairs a little nearer Mr Montague , and opening the pocket-book spread out its contents .
Parsing [sent. 13623 len. 39]: Finally he selected a certain memorandum from the rest , and held it out to his employer , who , during the whole of these preliminary ceremonies , had been making violent efforts to conceal his impatience . '
Parsing [sent. 13624 len. 26]: I wish you would n't be so fond of making notes , my excellent friend , ' said Tigg Montague with a ghastly smile . '
Parsing [sent. 13625 len. 17]: I wish you would consent to give me their purport by word of mouth . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13626 len. 14]: I do n't like word of mouth , ' said Mr Nadgett gravely .
Parsing [sent. 13627 len. 9]: ` We never know who 's listening . '
Parsing [sent. 13628 len. 45]: Mr Montague was going to retort , when Nadgett handed him the paper , and said , with quiet exultation in his tone , ` We 'll begin at the beginning , and take that one first , if you please , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 13629 len. 31]: The chairman cast his eyes upon it , coldly , and with a smile which did not render any great homage to the slow and methodical habits of his spy .
Parsing [sent. 13630 len. 37]: But he had not read half-a-dozen lines when the expression of his face began to change , and before he had finished the perusal of the paper , it was full of grave and serious attention .
Parsing [sent. 13631 len. 19]: ` Number Two , ' said Mr Nadgett , handing him another , and receiving back the first .
Parsing [sent. 13632 len. 11]: ` Read Number Two , sir , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 13633 len. 10]: There is more interest as you go on . '
Parsing [sent. 13634 len. 55]: Tigg Montague leaned backward in his chair , and cast upon his emissary such a look of vacant wonder -LRB- not unmingled with alarm -RRB- , that Mr Nadgett considered it necessary to repeat the request he had already twice preferred ; with the view to recalling his attention to the point in hand .
Parsing [sent. 13635 len. 29]: Profiting by the hint , Mr Montague went on with Number Two , and afterwards with Numbers Three , and Four , and Five , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 13636 len. 42]: These documents were all in Mr Nadgett 's writing , and were apparently a series of memoranda , jotted down from time to time upon the backs of old letters , or any scrap of paper that came first to hand .
Parsing [sent. 13637 len. 35]: Loose straggling scrawls they were , and of very uninviting exterior ; but they had weighty purpose in them , if the chairman 's face were any index to the character of their contents .
Parsing [sent. 13638 len. 25]: The progress of Mr Nadgett 's secret satisfaction arising out of the effect they made , kept pace with the emotions of the reader .
Parsing [sent. 13639 len. 28]: At first , Mr Nadgett sat with his spectacles low down upon his nose , looking over them at his employer , and nervously rubbing his hands .
Parsing [sent. 13640 len. 50]: After a little while , he changed his posture in his chair for one of greater ease , and leisurely perused the next document he held ready as if an occasional glance at his employer 's face were now enough and all occasion for anxiety or doubt were gone .
Parsing [sent. 13641 len. 24]: And finally he rose and looked out of the window , where he stood with a triumphant air until Tigg Montague had finished .
Parsing [sent. 13642 len. 11]: ` And this is the last , Mr Nadgett ! '
Parsing [sent. 13643 len. 9]: said that gentleman , drawing a long breath .
Parsing [sent. 13644 len. 10]: ` That , sir , is the last . '
Parsing [sent. 13645 len. 12]: ` You are a wonderful man , Mr Nadgett ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 13646 len. 19]: I think it is a pretty good case , ' he returned as he gathered up his papers .
Parsing [sent. 13647 len. 9]: ` It cost some trouble , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 13648 len. 12]: ` The trouble shall be well rewarded , Mr Nadgett . '
Parsing [sent. 13649 len. 3]: Nadgett bowed .
Parsing [sent. 13650 len. 20]: ` There is a deeper impression of Somebody 's Hoof here , than I had expected , Mr Nadgett .
Parsing [sent. 13651 len. 16]: I may congratulate myself upon your being such a good hand at a secret . '
Parsing [sent. 13652 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 13653 len. 30]: nothing has an interest to me that 's not a secret , ' replied Nadgett , as he tied the string about his pocket-book , and put it up .
Parsing [sent. 13654 len. 24]: ` It always takes away any pleasure I may have had in this inquiry even to make it known to you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13655 len. 10]: A most invaluable constitution , ' Tigg retorted . '
Parsing [sent. 13656 len. 14]: A great gift for a gentleman employed as you are , Mr Nadgett .
Parsing [sent. 13657 len. 16]: Much better than discretion ; though you possess that quality also in an eminent degree .
Parsing [sent. 13658 len. 8]: I think I heard a double knock .
Parsing [sent. 13659 len. 21]: Will you put your head out of window , and tell me whether there is anybody at the door ? '
Parsing [sent. 13660 len. 40]: Mr Nadgett softly raised the sash , and peered out from the very corner , as a man might who was looking down into a street from whence a brisk discharge of musketry might be expected at any moment .
Parsing [sent. 13661 len. 25]: Drawing in his head with equal caution , he observed , not altering his voice or manner : ` Mr Jonas Chuzzlewit ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 13662 len. 8]: I thought so , ' Tigg retorted .
Parsing [sent. 13663 len. 7]: ` Shall I go ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 13664 len. 6]: I think you had better .
Parsing [sent. 13665 len. 3]: Stay though !
Parsing [sent. 13666 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 13667 len. 11]: remain here , Mr Nadgett , if you please . '
Parsing [sent. 13668 len. 14]: It was remarkable how pale and flurried he had become in an instant .
Parsing [sent. 13669 len. 8]: There was nothing to account for it .
Parsing [sent. 13670 len. 13]: His eye had fallen on his razors ; but what of them !
Parsing [sent. 13671 len. 5]: Mr Chuzzlewit was announced .
Parsing [sent. 13672 len. 6]: ` Show him up directly .
Parsing [sent. 13673 len. 2]: Nadgett !
Parsing [sent. 13674 len. 8]: do n't you leave us alone together .
Parsing [sent. 13675 len. 7]: Mind you do n't , now !
Parsing [sent. 13676 len. 5]: By the Lord ! '
Parsing [sent. 13677 len. 18]: he added in a whisper to himself : ` We do n't know what may happen . '
Parsing [sent. 13678 len. 31]: Saying this , he hurriedly took up a couple of hair-brushes , and began to exercise them on his own head , as if his toilet had not been interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 13679 len. 41]: Mr Nadgett withdrew to the stove , in which there was a small fire for the convenience of heating curling-irons ; and taking advantage of so favourable an opportunity for drying his pocket-handkerchief , produced it without loss of time .
Parsing [sent. 13680 len. 27]: There he stood , during the whole interview , holding it before the bars , and sometimes , but not often , glancing over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 13681 len. 6]: ` My dear Chuzzlewit ! '
Parsing [sent. 13682 len. 7]: cried Montague , as Jonas entered .
Parsing [sent. 13683 len. 7]: ` You rise with the lark .
Parsing [sent. 13684 len. 15]: Though you go to bed with the nightingale , you rise with the lark .
Parsing [sent. 13685 len. 10]: You have superhuman energy , my dear Chuzzlewit ! '
Parsing [sent. 13686 len. 4]: ` Ecod ! '
Parsing [sent. 13687 len. 37]: said Jonas , with an air of langour and ill-humour , as he took a chair , ' I should be very glad not to get up with the lark , if I could help it .
Parsing [sent. 13688 len. 29]: But I am a light sleeper ; and it 's better to be up than lying awake , counting the dismal old church-clocks , in bed . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13689 len. 5]: A light sleeper ! '
Parsing [sent. 13690 len. 4]: cried his friend .
Parsing [sent. 13691 len. 9]: ` Now , what is a light sleeper ?
Parsing [sent. 13692 len. 23]: I often hear the expression , but upon my life I have not the least conception what a light sleeper is . '
Parsing [sent. 13693 len. 4]: ` Hallo ! '
Parsing [sent. 13694 len. 8]: said Jonas , ` Who 's that ?
Parsing [sent. 13695 len. 24]: Oh , old what 's - his-name : looking -LRB- as usual -RRB- as if he wanted to skulk up the chimney . '
Parsing [sent. 13696 len. 5]: ` Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 13697 len. 8]: I have no doubt he does . '
Parsing [sent. 13698 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 13699 len. 13]: He 's not wanted here , I suppose , ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 13700 len. 10]: ` He may go , may n't he ? '
Parsing [sent. 13701 len. 12]: ` Oh , let him stay , let him stay ! '
Parsing [sent. 13702 len. 3]: said Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 13703 len. 9]: ` He 's a mere piece of furniture .
Parsing [sent. 13704 len. 14]: He has been making his report , and is waiting for further orders .
Parsing [sent. 13705 len. 37]: He has been told , ' said Tigg , raising his voice , ` not to lose sight of certain friends of ours , or to think that he has done with them by any means .
Parsing [sent. 13706 len. 6]: He understands his business . '
Parsing [sent. 13707 len. 29]: ` He need , ' replied Jonas ; ` for of all the precious old dummies in appearance that I ever saw , he 's about the worst .
Parsing [sent. 13708 len. 10]: He 's afraid of me , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 13709 len. 18]: ` It 's my belief , ' said Tigg , ` that you are Poison to him .
Parsing [sent. 13710 len. 2]: Nadgett !
Parsing [sent. 13711 len. 6]: give me that towel ! '
Parsing [sent. 13712 len. 15]: He had as little occasion for a towel as Jonas had for a start .
Parsing [sent. 13713 len. 24]: But Nadgett brought it quickly ; and , having lingered for a moment , fell back upon his old post by the fire .
Parsing [sent. 13714 len. 25]: ` You see , my dear fellow , ' resumed Tigg , ` you are too -- what 's the matter with your lips ?
Parsing [sent. 13715 len. 7]: How white they are ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 13716 len. 12]: I took some vinegar just now , ' said Jonas . '
Parsing [sent. 13717 len. 7]: I had oysters for my breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 13718 len. 6]: Where are they white ? '
Parsing [sent. 13719 len. 15]: he added , muttering an oath , and rubbing them upon his handkerchief . '
Parsing [sent. 13720 len. 9]: I do n't believe they ARE white . '
Parsing [sent. 13721 len. 15]: ` Now I look again , they are not , ' replied his friend .
Parsing [sent. 13722 len. 8]: ` They are coming right again . '
Parsing [sent. 13723 len. 21]: ` Say what you were going to say , ' cried Jonas angrily , ` and let my face be !
Parsing [sent. 13724 len. 32]: As long as I can show my teeth when I want to -LRB- and I can do that pretty well -RRB- , the colour of my lips is not material . '
Parsing [sent. 13725 len. 9]: ` Quite true , ' said Tigg . '
Parsing [sent. 13726 len. 17]: I was only going to say that you are too quick and active for our friend .
Parsing [sent. 13727 len. 19]: He is too shy to cope with such a man as you , but does his duty well .
Parsing [sent. 13728 len. 5]: Oh , very well !
Parsing [sent. 13729 len. 8]: But what is a light sleeper ? '
Parsing [sent. 13730 len. 7]: ` Hang a light sleeper ! '
Parsing [sent. 13731 len. 4]: exclaimed Jonas pettishly .
Parsing [sent. 13732 len. 9]: ` No , no , ' interrupted Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 13733 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 13734 len. 8]: We 'll not do that . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13735 len. 36]: A light sleeper ai n't a heavy one , ' said Jonas in his sulky way ; ` do n't sleep much , and do n't sleep well , and do n't sleep sound . '
Parsing [sent. 13736 len. 39]: ` And dreams , ' said Tigg , ` and cries out in an ugly manner ; and when the candle burns down in the night , is in an agony ; and all that sort of thing .
Parsing [sent. 13737 len. 4]: I see ! '
Parsing [sent. 13738 len. 8]: They were silent for a little time .
Parsing [sent. 13739 len. 23]: Then Jonas spoke : ` Now we 've done with child 's talk , I want to have a word with you .
Parsing [sent. 13740 len. 15]: I want to have a word with you before we meet up yonder to-day .
Parsing [sent. 13741 len. 11]: I am not satisfied with the state of affairs . '
Parsing [sent. 13742 len. 5]: ` Not satisfied ! '
Parsing [sent. 13743 len. 3]: cried Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 13744 len. 8]: ` The money comes in well . '
Parsing [sent. 13745 len. 22]: ` The money comes in well enough , ' retorted Jonas , ` but it do n't come out well enough .
Parsing [sent. 13746 len. 9]: It ca n't be got at easily enough .
Parsing [sent. 13747 len. 13]: I have n't sufficient power ; it is all in your hands .
Parsing [sent. 13748 len. 2]: Ecod !
Parsing [sent. 13749 len. 56]: what with one of your by-laws , and another of your by-laws , and your votes in this capacity , and your votes in that capacity , and your official rights , and your individual rights , and other people 's rights who are only you again , there are no rights left for me .
Parsing [sent. 13750 len. 8]: Everybody else 's rights are my wrongs .
Parsing [sent. 13751 len. 15]: What 's the use of my having a voice if it 's always drowned ?
Parsing [sent. 13752 len. 15]: I might as well be dumb , and it would be much less aggravating .
Parsing [sent. 13753 len. 12]: I 'm not a-going to stand that , you know . '
Parsing [sent. 13754 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 13755 len. 7]: said Tigg in an insinuating tone .
Parsing [sent. 13756 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 13757 len. 9]: returned Jonas , ` I 'm not indeed .
Parsing [sent. 13758 len. 35]: I 'll play old Gooseberry with the office , and make you glad to buy me out at a good high figure , if you try any of your tricks with me . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13759 len. 10]: I give you my honour -- ' Montague began .
Parsing [sent. 13760 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 13761 len. 42]: confound your honour , ' interrupted Jonas , who became more coarse and quarrelsome as the other remonstrated , which may have been a part of Mr Montague 's intention ; ' I want a little more control over the money .
Parsing [sent. 13762 len. 21]: You may have all the honour , if you like ; I 'll never bring you to book for that .
Parsing [sent. 13763 len. 14]: But I 'm not a-going to stand it , as it is now .
Parsing [sent. 13764 len. 25]: If you should take it into your honourable head to go abroad with the bank , I do n't see much to prevent you .
Parsing [sent. 13765 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 13766 len. 5]: That wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 13767 len. 29]: I 've had some very good dinners here , but they 'd come too dear on such terms ; and therefore , that wo n't do . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13768 len. 53]: I am unfortunate to find you in this humour , ' said Tigg , with a remarkable kind of smile ; ` for I was going to propose to you -- for your own advantage ; solely for your own advantage -- that you should venture a little more with us . '
Parsing [sent. 13769 len. 9]: ` Was you , by G -- ? '
Parsing [sent. 13770 len. 8]: said Jonas , with a short laugh .
Parsing [sent. 13771 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 13772 len. 39]: And to suggest , ' pursued Montague , ` that surely you have friends ; indeed , I know you have ; who would answer our purpose admirably , and whom we should be delighted to receive . '
Parsing [sent. 13773 len. 6]: ` How kind of you !
Parsing [sent. 13774 len. 12]: You 'd be delighted to receive 'em , would you ? '
Parsing [sent. 13775 len. 6]: said Jonas , bantering . '
Parsing [sent. 13776 len. 10]: I give you my sacred honour , quite transported .
Parsing [sent. 13777 len. 7]: As your friends , observe ! '
Parsing [sent. 13778 len. 15]: ` Exactly , ' said Jonas ; ` as my friends , of course .
Parsing [sent. 13779 len. 16]: You 'll be very much delighted when you get 'em , I have no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 13780 len. 14]: And it 'll be all to my advantage , wo n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 13781 len. 26]: ` It will be very much to your advantage , ' answered Montague poising a brush in each hand , and looking steadily upon him .
Parsing [sent. 13782 len. 15]: ` It will be very much to your advantage , I assure you . '
Parsing [sent. 13783 len. 18]: ` And you can tell me how , ' said Jonas , ` ca n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 13784 len. 8]: ` SHALL I tell you how ? '
Parsing [sent. 13785 len. 5]: returned the other . '
Parsing [sent. 13786 len. 10]: I think you had better , ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 13787 len. 29]: ` Strange things have been done in the Assurance way before now , by strange sorts of men , and I mean to take care of myself . '
Parsing [sent. 13788 len. 4]: ` Chuzzlewit ! '
Parsing [sent. 13789 len. 20]: replied Montague , leaning forward , with his arms upon his knees , and looking full into his face .
Parsing [sent. 13790 len. 33]: ` Strange things have been done , and are done every day ; not only in our way , but in a variety of other ways ; and no one suspects them .
Parsing [sent. 13791 len. 34]: But ours , as you say , my good friend , is a strange way ; and we strangely happen , sometimes , to come into the knowledge of very strange events . '
Parsing [sent. 13792 len. 31]: He beckoned to Jonas to bring his chair nearer ; and looking slightly round , as if to remind him of the presence of Nadgett , whispered in his ear .
Parsing [sent. 13793 len. 28]: From red to white ; from white to red again ; from red to yellow ; then to a cold , dull , awful , sweat-bedabbled blue .
Parsing [sent. 13794 len. 62]: In that short whisper , all these changes fell upon the face of Jonas Chuzzlewit ; and when at last he laid his hand upon the whisperer 's mouth , appalled , lest any syllable of what he said should reach the ears of the third person present , it was as bloodless and as heavy as the hand of Death .
Parsing [sent. 13795 len. 18]: He drew his chair away , and sat a spectacle of terror , misery , and rage .
Parsing [sent. 13796 len. 16]: He was afraid to speak , or look , or move , or sit still .
Parsing [sent. 13797 len. 31]: Abject , crouching , and miserable , he was a greater degradation to the form he bore , than if he had been a loathsome wound from head to heel .
Parsing [sent. 13798 len. 28]: His companion leisurely resumed his dressing , and completed it , glancing sometimes with a smile at the transformation he had effected , but never speaking once .
Parsing [sent. 13799 len. 29]: ` You 'll not object , ' he said , when he was quite equipped , ` to venture further with us , Chuzzlewit , my friend ? '
Parsing [sent. 13800 len. 11]: His pale lips faintly stammered out a ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 13801 len. 4]: ` Well said !
Parsing [sent. 13802 len. 5]: That 's like yourself .
Parsing [sent. 13803 len. 44]: Do you know I was thinking yesterday that your father-in-law , relying on your advice as a man of great sagacity in money matters , as no doubt you are , would join us , if the thing were well presented to him .
Parsing [sent. 13804 len. 5]: He has money ? '
Parsing [sent. 13805 len. 8]: ` Yes , he has money . '
Parsing [sent. 13806 len. 9]: ` Shall I leave Mr Pecksniff to you ?
Parsing [sent. 13807 len. 8]: Will you undertake for Mr Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 13808 len. 5]: ` I 'll try .
Parsing [sent. 13809 len. 8]: I 'll do my best . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13810 len. 15]: A thousand thanks , ' replied the other , clapping him upon the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 13811 len. 6]: ` Shall we walk downstairs ?
Parsing [sent. 13812 len. 3]: Mr Nadgett !
Parsing [sent. 13813 len. 8]: Follow us , if you please . '
Parsing [sent. 13814 len. 7]: They went down in that order .
Parsing [sent. 13815 len. 93]: Whatever Jonas felt in reference to Montague ; whatever sense he had of being caged , and barred , and trapped , and having fallen down into a pit of deepest ruin ; whatever thoughts came crowding on his mind even at that early time , of one terrible chance of escape , of one red glimmer in a sky of blackness ; he no more thought that the slinking figure half-a-dozen stairs behind him was his pursuing Fate , than that the other figure at his side was his Good Angel .
Parsing [sent. 13816 len. 30]: CHAPTER THIRTY -- NINE CONTAINING SOME FURTHER PARTICULARS OF THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY OF THE PINCHES ; WITH STRANGE NEWS FROM THE CITY , NARROWLY CONCERNING TOM Pleasant little Ruth !
Parsing [sent. 13817 len. 10]: Cheerful , tidy , bustling , quiet little Ruth !
Parsing [sent. 13818 len. 31]: No doll 's house ever yielded greater delight to its young mistress , than little Ruth derived from her glorious dominion over the triangular parlour and the two small bedrooms .
Parsing [sent. 13819 len. 6]: To be Tom 's housekeeper .
Parsing [sent. 13820 len. 3]: What dignity !
Parsing [sent. 13821 len. 33]: Housekeeping , upon the commonest terms , associated itself with elevated responsibilities of all sorts and kinds ; but housekeeping for Tom implied the utmost complication of grave trusts and mighty charges .
Parsing [sent. 13822 len. 69]: Well might she take the keys out of the little chiffonier which held the tea and sugar ; and out of the two little damp cupboards down by the fireplace , where the very black beetles got mouldy , and had the shine taken out of their backs by envious mildew ; and jingle them upon a ring before Tom 's eyes when he came down to breakfast !
Parsing [sent. 13823 len. 22]: Well might she , laughing musically , put them up in that blessed little pocket of hers with a merry pride !
Parsing [sent. 13824 len. 45]: For it was such a grand novelty to be mistress of anything , that if she had been the most relentless and despotic of all little housekeepers , she might have pleaded just that much for her excuse , and have been honourably acquitted .
Parsing [sent. 13825 len. 28]: So far from being despotic , however , there was a coyness about her very way of pouring out the tea , which Tom quite revelled in .
Parsing [sent. 13826 len. 44]: And when she asked him what he would like to have for dinner , and faltered out ` chops ' as a reasonably good suggestion after their last night 's successful supper , Tom grew quite facetious , and rallied her desperately . '
Parsing [sent. 13827 len. 38]: I do n't know , Tom , ' said his sister , blushing , ' I am not quite confident , but I think I could make a beef-steak pudding , if I tried , Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 13828 len. 22]: ` In the whole catalogue of cookery , there is nothing I should like so much as a beef-steak pudding ! '
Parsing [sent. 13829 len. 15]: cried Tom , slapping his leg to give the greater force to this reply .
Parsing [sent. 13830 len. 9]: ` Yes , dear , that 's excellent !
Parsing [sent. 13831 len. 60]: But if it should happen not to come quite right the first time , ' his sister faltered ; ` if it should happen not to be a pudding exactly , but should turn out a stew , or a soup , or something of that sort , you 'll not be vexed , Tom , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 13832 len. 41]: The serious way in which she looked at Tom ; the way in which Tom looked at her ; and the way in which she gradually broke into a merry laugh at her own expense , would have enchanted you .
Parsing [sent. 13833 len. 11]: ` Why , ' said Tom ` this is capital .
Parsing [sent. 13834 len. 15]: It gives us a new , and quite an uncommon interest in the dinner .
Parsing [sent. 13835 len. 21]: We put into a lottery for a beefsteak pudding , and it is impossible to say what we may get .
Parsing [sent. 13836 len. 22]: We may make some wonderful discovery , perhaps , and produce such a dish as never was known before . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13837 len. 63]: I shall not be at all surprised if we do , Tom , ' returned his sister , still laughing merrily , ` or if it should prove to be such a dish as we shall not feel very anxious to produce again ; but the meat must come out of the saucepan at last , somehow or other , you know .
Parsing [sent. 13838 len. 16]: We ca n't cook it into nothing at all ; that 's a great comfort .
Parsing [sent. 13839 len. 12]: So if you like to venture , I will . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13840 len. 36]: I have not the least doubt , ' rejoined Tom , ` that it will come out an excellent pudding , or at all events , I am sure that I shall think it so .
Parsing [sent. 13841 len. 33]: There is naturally something so handy and brisk about you , Ruth , that if you said you could make a bowl of faultless turtle soup , I should believe you . '
Parsing [sent. 13842 len. 5]: And Tom was right .
Parsing [sent. 13843 len. 8]: She was precisely that sort of person .
Parsing [sent. 13844 len. 20]: Nobody ought to have been able to resist her coaxing manner ; and nobody had any business to try .
Parsing [sent. 13845 len. 13]: Yet she never seemed to know it was her manner at all .
Parsing [sent. 13846 len. 7]: That was the best of it .
Parsing [sent. 13847 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 13848 len. 81]: she washed up the breakfast cups , chatting away the whole time , and telling Tom all sorts of anecdotes about the brass-and-copper founder ; put everything in its place ; made the room as neat as herself ; -- you must not suppose its shape was half as neat as hers though , or anything like it -- and brushed Tom 's old hat round and round and round again , until it was as sleek as Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 13849 len. 80]: Then she discovered , all in a moment , that Tom 's shirt-collar was frayed at the edge ; and flying upstairs for a needle and thread , came flying down again with her thimble on , and set it right with wonderful expertness ; never once sticking the needle into his face , although she was humming his pet tune from first to last , and beating time with the fingers of her left hand upon his neckcloth .
Parsing [sent. 13850 len. 75]: She had no sooner done this , than off she was again ; and there she stood once more , as brisk and busy as a bee , tying that compact little chin of hers into an equally compact little bonnet ; intent on bustling out to the butcher 's , without a minute 's loss of time ; and inviting Tom to come and see the steak cut , with his own eyes .
Parsing [sent. 13851 len. 49]: As to Tom , he was ready to go anywhere ; so off they trotted , arm-in-arm , as nimbly as you please ; saying to each other what a quiet street it was to lodge in , and how very cheap , and what an airy situation .
Parsing [sent. 13852 len. 29]: To see the butcher slap the steak , before he laid it on the block , and give his knife a sharpening , was to forget breakfast instantly .
Parsing [sent. 13853 len. 22]: It was agreeable , too -- it really was -- to see him cut it off , so smooth and juicy .
Parsing [sent. 13854 len. 45]: There was nothing savage in the act , although the knife was large and keen ; it was a piece of art , high art ; there was delicacy of touch , clearness of tone , skillful handling of the subject , fine shading .
Parsing [sent. 13855 len. 11]: It was the triumph of mind over matter ; quite .
Parsing [sent. 13856 len. 23]: Perhaps the greenest cabbage-leaf ever grown in a garden was wrapped about this steak , before it was delivered over to Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13857 len. 18]: But the butcher had a sentiment for his business , and knew how to refine upon it .
Parsing [sent. 13858 len. 43]: When he saw Tom putting the cabbage-leaf into his pocket awkwardly , he begged to be allowed to do it for him ; ` for meat , ' he said with some emotion , ` must be humoured , not drove . '
Parsing [sent. 13859 len. 98]: Back they went to the lodgings again , after they had bought some eggs , and flour , and such small matters ; and Tom sat gravely down to write at one end of the parlour table , while Ruth prepared to make the pudding at the other end ; for there was nobody in the house but an old woman -LRB- the landlord being a mysterious sort of man , who went out early in the morning , and was scarcely ever seen -RRB- ; and saving in mere household drudgery , they waited on themselves .
Parsing [sent. 13860 len. 9]: ` What are you writing , Tom ? '
Parsing [sent. 13861 len. 11]: inquired his sister , laying her hand upon his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 13862 len. 77]: ` Why , you see , my dear , ' said Tom , leaning back in his chair , and looking up in her face , ' I am very anxious , of course , to obtain some suitable employment ; and before Mr Westlock comes this afternoon , I think I may as well prepare a little description of myself and my qualifications ; such as he could show to any friend of his . '
Parsing [sent. 13863 len. 25]: ` You had better do the same for me , Tom , also , ' said his sister , casting down her eyes . '
Parsing [sent. 13864 len. 28]: I should dearly like to keep house for you and take care of you always , Tom ; but we are not rich enough for that . '
Parsing [sent. 13865 len. 20]: ` We are not rich , ' returned Tom , ` certainly ; and we may be much poorer .
Parsing [sent. 13866 len. 11]: But we will not part if we can help it .
Parsing [sent. 13867 len. 45]: No , no ; we will make up our minds Ruth , that unless we are so very unfortunate as to render me quite sure that you would be better off away from me than with me , we will battle it out together .
Parsing [sent. 13868 len. 15]: I am certain we shall be happier if we can battle it out together .
Parsing [sent. 13869 len. 8]: Do n't you think we shall ? '
Parsing [sent. 13870 len. 6]: ` Think , Tom ! '
Parsing [sent. 13871 len. 8]: ` Oh , tut , tut ! '
Parsing [sent. 13872 len. 5]: interposed Tom , tenderly .
Parsing [sent. 13873 len. 7]: ` You must n't cry . '
Parsing [sent. 13874 len. 11]: ` No , no ; I wo n't , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13875 len. 9]: But you ca n't afford it , dear .
Parsing [sent. 13876 len. 7]: You ca n't , indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 13877 len. 11]: ` We do n't know that , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13878 len. 15]: ` How are we to know that , yet awhile , and without trying ?
Parsing [sent. 13879 len. 6]: Lord bless my soul ! '
Parsing [sent. 13880 len. 22]: -- Tom 's energy became quite grand -- ` there is no knowing what may happen , if we try hard .
Parsing [sent. 13881 len. 21]: And I am sure we can live contentedly upon a very little -- if we can only get it . '
Parsing [sent. 13882 len. 13]: ` Yes ; that I am sure we can , Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 13883 len. 16]: ` Why , then , ' said Tom , ` we must try for it .
Parsing [sent. 13884 len. 17]: My friend , John Westlock , is a capital fellow , and very shrewd and intelligent .
Parsing [sent. 13885 len. 6]: I 'll take his advice .
Parsing [sent. 13886 len. 13]: We 'll talk it over with him -- both of us together .
Parsing [sent. 13887 len. 18]: You 'll like John very much , when you come to know him , I am certain .
Parsing [sent. 13888 len. 8]: Do n't cry , do n't cry .
Parsing [sent. 13889 len. 9]: YOU make a beef-steak pudding , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 13890 len. 9]: said Tom , giving her a gentle push .
Parsing [sent. 13891 len. 13]: ` Why , you have n't boldness enough for a dumpling ! '
Parsing [sent. 13892 len. 10]: ` You WILL call it a pudding , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13893 len. 2]: Mind !
Parsing [sent. 13894 len. 7]: I told you not ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 13895 len. 20]: I may as well call it that , till it proves to be something else , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13896 len. 15]: ` Oh , you are going to work in earnest , are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 13897 len. 4]: Aye , aye !
Parsing [sent. 13898 len. 4]: That she was .
Parsing [sent. 13899 len. 19]: And in such pleasant earnest , moreover , that Tom 's attention wandered from his writing every moment .
Parsing [sent. 13900 len. 70]: First , she tripped downstairs into the kitchen for the flour , then for the pie-board , then for the eggs , then for the butter , then for a jug of water , then for the rolling-pin , then for a pudding-basin , then for the pepper , then for the salt ; making a separate journey for everything , and laughing every time she started off afresh .
Parsing [sent. 13901 len. 30]: When all the materials were collected she was horrified to find she had no apron on , and so ran UPstairs by way of variety , to fetch it .
Parsing [sent. 13902 len. 62]: She did n't put it on upstairs , but came dancing down with it in her hand ; and being one of those little women to whom an apron is a most becoming little vanity , it took an immense time to arrange ; having to be carefully smoothed down beneath -- Oh , heaven , what a wicked little stomacher !
Parsing [sent. 13903 len. 59]: -- and to be gathered up into little plaits by the strings before it could be tied , and to be tapped , rebuked , and wheedled , at the pockets , before it would set right , which at last it did , and when it did -- but never mind ; this is a sober chronicle .
Parsing [sent. 13904 len. 40]: And then , there were her cuffs to be tucked up , for fear of flour ; and she had a little ring to pull off her finger , which would n't come off -LRB- foolish little ring ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 13905 len. 41]: ; and during the whole of these preparations she looked demurely every now and then at Tom , from under her dark eyelashes , as if they were all a part of the pudding , and indispensable to its composition .
Parsing [sent. 13906 len. 71]: For the life and soul of him , Tom could get no further in his writing than , ' A respectable young man , aged thirty-five , ' and this , notwithstanding the show she made of being supernaturally quiet , and going about on tiptoe , lest she should disturb him ; which only served as an additional means of distracting his attention , and keeping it upon her .
Parsing [sent. 13907 len. 13]: ` Tom , ' she said at last , in high glee .
Parsing [sent. 13908 len. 4]: ` Tom ! '
Parsing [sent. 13909 len. 5]: ` What now ? '
Parsing [sent. 13910 len. 12]: said Tom , repeating to himself , ` aged thirty-five ! '
Parsing [sent. 13911 len. 11]: ` Will you look here a moment , please ? '
Parsing [sent. 13912 len. 12]: As if he had n't been looking all the time ! '
Parsing [sent. 13913 len. 8]: I am going to begin , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13914 len. 14]: Do n't you wonder why I butter the inside of the basin ? '
Parsing [sent. 13915 len. 6]: said his busy little sister .
Parsing [sent. 13916 len. 17]: ` Not more than you do , I dare say , ' replied Tom , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 13917 len. 13]: ` For I believe you do n't know anything about it . '
Parsing [sent. 13918 len. 9]: ` What an infidel you are , Tom !
Parsing [sent. 13919 len. 15]: How else do you think it would turn out easily when it was done !
Parsing [sent. 13920 len. 10]: For a civil-engineer and land-surveyor not to know that !
Parsing [sent. 13921 len. 6]: My goodness , Tom ! '
Parsing [sent. 13922 len. 12]: It was wholly out of the question to try to write .
Parsing [sent. 13923 len. 30]: Tom lined out ` respectable young man , aged thirty-five ; ' and sat looking on , pen in hand , with one of the most loving smiles imaginable .
Parsing [sent. 13924 len. 9]: Such a busy little woman as she was !
Parsing [sent. 13925 len. 18]: So full of self-importance and trying so hard not to smile , or seem uncertain about anything !
Parsing [sent. 13926 len. 165]: It was a perfect treat to Tom to see her with her brows knit , and her rosy lips pursed up , kneading away at the crust , rolling it out , cutting it up into strips , lining the basin with it , shaving it off fine round the rim , chopping up the steak into small pieces , raining down pepper and salt upon them , packing them into the basin , pouring in cold water for gravy , and never venturing to steal a look in his direction , lest her gravity should be disturbed ; until , at last , the basin being quite full and only wanting the top crust , she clapped her hands all covered with paste and flour , at Tom , and burst out heartily into such a charming little laugh of triumph , that the pudding need have had no other seasoning to commend it to the taste of any reasonable man on earth .
Parsing [sent. 13927 len. 7]: ` Where 's the pudding ? '
Parsing [sent. 13928 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13929 len. 10]: For he was cutting his jokes , Tom was .
Parsing [sent. 13930 len. 4]: ` Where ! '
Parsing [sent. 13931 len. 10]: she answered , holding it up with both hands .
Parsing [sent. 13932 len. 6]: ` Look at it ! '
Parsing [sent. 13933 len. 6]: ` THAT a pudding ! '
Parsing [sent. 13934 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13935 len. 20]: ` It WILL be , you stupid fellow , when it 's covered in , ' returned his sister .
Parsing [sent. 13936 len. 42]: Tom still pretending to look incredulous , she gave him a tap on the head with the rolling-pin , and still laughing merrily , had returned to the composition of the top crust , when she started and turned very red .
Parsing [sent. 13937 len. 18]: Tom started , too , for following her eyes , he saw John Westlock in the room .
Parsing [sent. 13938 len. 8]: ` Why , my goodness , John !
Parsing [sent. 13939 len. 8]: How did YOU come in ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 13940 len. 55]: I beg pardon , ' said John -- ' your sister 's pardon especially -- but I met an old lady at the street door , who requested me to enter here ; and as you did n't hear me knock , and the door was open , I made bold to do so .
Parsing [sent. 13941 len. 47]: I hardly know , ' said John , with a smile , ` why any of us should be disconcerted at my having accidentally intruded upon such an agreeable domestic occupation , so very agreeably and skillfully pursued ; but I must confess that I am .
Parsing [sent. 13942 len. 11]: Tom , will you kindly come to my relief ? '
Parsing [sent. 13943 len. 9]: ` Mr John Westlock , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13944 len. 6]: ` My sister . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13945 len. 37]: I hope that , as the sister of so old a friend , ' said John , laughing ` you will have the goodness to detach your first impressions of me from my unfortunate entrance . '
Parsing [sent. 13946 len. 22]: ` My sister is not indisposed perhaps to say the same to you on her own behalf , ' retorted Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13947 len. 50]: John said , of course , that this was quite unnecessary , for he had been transfixed in silent admiration ; and he held out his hand to Miss Pinch ; who could n't take it , however , by reason of the flour and paste upon her own .
Parsing [sent. 13948 len. 46]: This , which might seem calculated to increase the general confusion and render matters worse , had in reality the best effect in the world , for neither of them could help laughing ; and so they both found themselves on easy terms immediately . '
Parsing [sent. 13949 len. 11]: I am delighted to see you , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13950 len. 6]: ` Sit down . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13951 len. 38]: I can only think of sitting down on one condition , ' returned his friend ; ` and that is , that your sister goes on with the pudding , as if you were still alone . '
Parsing [sent. 13952 len. 12]: ` That I am sure she will , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13953 len. 21]: ` On one other condition , and that is , that you stay and help us to eat it . '
Parsing [sent. 13954 len. 45]: Poor little Ruth was seized with a palpitation of the heart when Tom committed this appalling indiscretion , for she felt that if the dish turned out a failure , she never would be able to hold up her head before John Westlock again .
Parsing [sent. 13955 len. 53]: Quite unconscious of her state of mind , John accepted the invitation with all imaginable heartiness ; and after a little more pleasantry concerning this same pudding , and the tremendous expectations he made believe to entertain of it , she blushingly resumed her occupation , and he took a chair . '
Parsing [sent. 13956 len. 35]: I am here much earlier than I intended , Tom ; but I will tell you , what brings me , and I think I can answer for your being glad to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 13957 len. 10]: Is that anything you wish to show me ? '
Parsing [sent. 13958 len. 6]: ` Oh dear no ! '
Parsing [sent. 13959 len. 25]: cried Tom , who had forgotten the blotted scrap of paper in his hand , until this inquiry brought it to his recollection . '
Parsing [sent. 13960 len. 18]: `` A respectable young man , aged thirty-five '' -- The beginning of a description of myself .
Parsing [sent. 13961 len. 6]: That 's all . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13962 len. 14]: I do n't think you will have occasion to finish it , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13963 len. 15]: But how is it you never told me you had friends in London ? '
Parsing [sent. 13964 len. 22]: Tom looked at his sister with all his might ; and certainly his sister looked with all her might at him .
Parsing [sent. 13965 len. 6]: ` Friends in London ! '
Parsing [sent. 13966 len. 3]: echoed Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13967 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 13968 len. 9]: said Westlock , ` to be sure . '
Parsing [sent. 13969 len. 14]: ` Have YOU any friends in London , Ruth , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 13970 len. 3]: asked Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13971 len. 7]: ` No , Tom . ' '
Parsing [sent. 13972 len. 22]: I am very happy to hear that I have , ' said Tom , ` but it 's news to me .
Parsing [sent. 13973 len. 5]: I never knew it .
Parsing [sent. 13974 len. 13]: They must be capital people to keep a secret , John . '
Parsing [sent. 13975 len. 12]: ` You shall judge for yourself , ' returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 13976 len. 14]: ` Seriously , Tom , here is the plain state of the case .
Parsing [sent. 13977 len. 18]: As I was sitting at breakfast this morning , there comes a knock at my door . '
Parsing [sent. 13978 len. 16]: ` On which you cried out , very loud , `` Come in ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 13979 len. 3]: suggested Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13980 len. 5]: ` So I did .
Parsing [sent. 13981 len. 39]: And the person who knocked , not being a respectable young man , aged thirty-five , from the country , came in when he was invited , instead of standing gaping and staring about him on the landing .
Parsing [sent. 13982 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 13983 len. 21]: When he came in , I found he was a stranger ; a grave , business-like , sedate-looking , stranger .
Parsing [sent. 13984 len. 5]: `` Mr Westlock ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13985 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 13986 len. 20]: `` That is my name , '' said I. `` The favour of a few words with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13987 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 13988 len. 48]: `` Pray be seated , sir , '' said I. ' Here John stopped for an instant , to glance towards the table , where Tom 's sister , listening attentively , was still busy with the basin , which by this time made a noble appearance .
Parsing [sent. 13989 len. 19]: Then he resumed : ` The pudding having taken a chair , Tom -- ' ` What ! '
Parsing [sent. 13990 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13991 len. 7]: ` Having taken a chair . '
Parsing [sent. 13992 len. 7]: ` You said a pudding . '
Parsing [sent. 13993 len. 16]: ` No , no , ' replied John , colouring rather ; ' a chair .
Parsing [sent. 13994 len. 22]: The idea of a stranger coming into my rooms at half-past eight o'clock in the morning , and taking a pudding !
Parsing [sent. 13995 len. 33]: Having taken a chair , Tom , a chair -- amazed me by opening the conversation thus : `` I believe you are acquainted , sir , with Mr Thomas Pinch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13996 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 13997 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 13998 len. 9]: ` His very words , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 13999 len. 6]: I told him I was .
Parsing [sent. 14000 len. 10]: Did I know where you were at present residing ?
Parsing [sent. 14001 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 14002 len. 3]: In London ?
Parsing [sent. 14003 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 14004 len. 20]: He had casually heard , in a roundabout way , that you had left your situation with Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 14005 len. 5]: Was that the fact ?
Parsing [sent. 14006 len. 5]: Yes , it was .
Parsing [sent. 14007 len. 5]: Did you want another ?
Parsing [sent. 14008 len. 6]: Yes , you did . '
Parsing [sent. 14009 len. 11]: ` Certainly , ' said Tom , nodding his head .
Parsing [sent. 14010 len. 8]: ` Just what I impressed upon him .
Parsing [sent. 14011 len. 32]: You may rest assured that I set that point beyond the possibility of any mistake , and gave him distinctly to understand that he might make up his mind about it .
Parsing [sent. 14012 len. 4]: Very well . '
Parsing [sent. 14013 len. 17]: `` Then , '' said he , `` I think I can accommodate him . '' '
Parsing [sent. 14014 len. 6]: Tom 's sister stopped short .
Parsing [sent. 14015 len. 6]: ` Lord bless me ! '
Parsing [sent. 14016 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 14017 len. 15]: ` Ruth , my dear , `` think I can accommodate him . '' '
Parsing [sent. 14018 len. 45]: ` Of course I begged him , ' pursued John Westlock , glancing at Tom 's sister , who was not less eager in her interest than Tom himself , ` to proceed , and said that I would undertake to see you immediately .
Parsing [sent. 14019 len. 97]: He replied that he had very little to say , being a man of few words , but such as it was , it was to the purpose -- and so , indeed , it turned out -- for he immediately went on to tell me that a friend of his was in want of a kind of secretary and librarian ; and that although the salary was small , being only a hundred pounds a year , with neither board nor lodging , still the duties were not heavy , and there the post was .
Parsing [sent. 14020 len. 9]: Vacant , and ready for your acceptance . '
Parsing [sent. 14021 len. 6]: ` Good gracious me ! '
Parsing [sent. 14022 len. 10]: cried Tom ; ' a hundred pounds a year !
Parsing [sent. 14023 len. 4]: My dear John !
Parsing [sent. 14024 len. 5]: Ruth , my love !
Parsing [sent. 14025 len. 7]: A hundred pounds a year ! '
Parsing [sent. 14026 len. 49]: ` But the strangest part of the story , ' resumed John Westlock , laying his hand on Tom 's wrist , to bespeak his attention , and repress his ecstasies for the moment ; ` the strangest part of the story , Miss Pinch , is this .
Parsing [sent. 14027 len. 17]: I do n't know this man from Adam ; neither does this man know Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 14028 len. 20]: ` He ca n't , ' said Tom , in great perplexity , ` if he 's a Londoner .
Parsing [sent. 14029 len. 10]: I do n't know any one in London . '
Parsing [sent. 14030 len. 96]: ` And on my observing , ' John resumed , still keeping his hand upon Tom 's wrist , ` that I had no doubt he would excuse the freedom I took in inquiring who directed him to me ; how he came to know of the change which had taken place in my friend 's position ; and how he came to be acquainted with my friend 's peculiar fitness for such an office as he had described ; he drily said that he was not at liberty to enter into any explanations . '
Parsing [sent. 14031 len. 11]: ` Not at liberty to enter into any explanations ! '
Parsing [sent. 14032 len. 9]: repeated Tom , drawing a long breath . '
Parsing [sent. 14033 len. 53]: `` I must be perfectly aware , '' he said , ' John added , ' `` that to any person who had ever been in Mr Pecksniff 's neighbourhood , Mr Thomas Pinch and his acquirements were as well known as the Church steeple , or the Blue Dragon . '' '
Parsing [sent. 14034 len. 6]: ` The Blue Dragon ! '
Parsing [sent. 14035 len. 12]: repeated Tom , staring alternately at his friend and his sister .
Parsing [sent. 14036 len. 7]: ` Aye , think of that !
Parsing [sent. 14037 len. 23]: He spoke as familiarly of the Blue Dragon , I give you my word , as if he had been Mark Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 14038 len. 58]: I opened my eyes , I can tell you , when he did so ; but I could not fancy I had ever seen the man before , although he said with a smile , `` You know the Blue Dragon , Mr Westlock ; you kept it up there , once or twice , yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 14039 len. 5]: Kept it up there !
Parsing [sent. 14040 len. 4]: So I did .
Parsing [sent. 14041 len. 6]: You remember , Tom ? '
Parsing [sent. 14042 len. 37]: Tom nodded with great significance , and , falling into a state of deeper perplexity than before , observed that this was the most unaccountable and extraordinary circumstance he had ever heard of in his life .
Parsing [sent. 14043 len. 4]: ` Unaccountable ? '
Parsing [sent. 14044 len. 5]: his friend repeated . '
Parsing [sent. 14045 len. 7]: I became afraid of the man .
Parsing [sent. 14046 len. 17]: Though it was broad day , and bright sunshine , I was positively afraid of him .
Parsing [sent. 14047 len. 34]: I declare I half suspected him to be a supernatural visitor , and not a mortal , until he took out a common-place description of pocket-book , and handed me this card . '
Parsing [sent. 14048 len. 12]: ` Mr Fips , ' said Tom , reading it aloud .
Parsing [sent. 14049 len. 4]: ` Austin Friars .
Parsing [sent. 14050 len. 8]: Austin Friars sounds ghostly , John . '
Parsing [sent. 14051 len. 14]: ` Fips do n't , I think , ' was John 's reply .
Parsing [sent. 14052 len. 18]: ` But there he lives , Tom , and there he expects us to call this morning .
Parsing [sent. 14053 len. 19]: And now you know as much of this strange incident as I do , upon my honour . '
Parsing [sent. 14054 len. 53]: Tom 's face , between his exultation in the hundred pounds a year , and his wonder at this narration , was only to be equalled by the face of his sister , on which there sat the very best expression of blooming surprise that any painter could have wished to see .
Parsing [sent. 14055 len. 25]: What the beef-steak pudding would have come to , if it had not been by this time finished , astrology itself could hardly determine .
Parsing [sent. 14056 len. 34]: ` Tom , ' said Ruth , after a little hesitation , ` perhaps Mr Westlock , in his friendship for you , knows more of this than he chooses to tell . '
Parsing [sent. 14057 len. 6]: ` No , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 14058 len. 5]: cried John , eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 14059 len. 10]: ` It is not so , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 14060 len. 5]: I wish it were .
Parsing [sent. 14061 len. 16]: I can not take credit to myself , Miss Pinch , for any such thing .
Parsing [sent. 14062 len. 25]: All that I know , or , so far as I can judge , am likely to know , I have told you . '
Parsing [sent. 14063 len. 13]: ` Could n't you know more , if you thought proper ? '
Parsing [sent. 14064 len. 8]: said Ruth , scraping the pie-board industriously .
Parsing [sent. 14065 len. 7]: ` No , ' retorted John .
Parsing [sent. 14066 len. 5]: ` Indeed , no .
Parsing [sent. 14067 len. 20]: It is very ungenerous in you to be so suspicious of me when I repose implicit faith in you .
Parsing [sent. 14068 len. 12]: I have unbounded confidence in the pudding , Miss Pinch . '
Parsing [sent. 14069 len. 23]: She laughed at this , but they soon got back into a serious vein , and discussed the subject with profound gravity .
Parsing [sent. 14070 len. 44]: Whatever else was obscure in the business , it appeared to be quite plain that Tom was offered a salary of one hundred pounds a year ; and this being the main point , the surrounding obscurity rather set it off than otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 14071 len. 32]: Tom , being in a great flutter , wished to start for Austin Friars instantly , but they waited nearly an hour , by John 's advice , before they departed .
Parsing [sent. 14072 len. 139]: Tom made himself as spruce as he could before leaving home , and when John Westlock , through the half-opened parlour door , had glimpses of that brave little sister brushing the collar of his coat in the passage , taking up loose stitches in his gloves and hovering lightly about and about him , touching him up here and there in the height of her quaint , little , old-fashioned tidiness , he called to mind the fancy-portraits of her on the wall of the Pecksniffian workroom , and decided with uncommon indignation that they were gross libels , and not half pretty enough ; though , as hath been mentioned in its place , the artists always made those sketches beautiful , and he had drawn at least a score of them with his own hands .
Parsing [sent. 14073 len. 27]: ` Tom , ' he said , as they were walking along , ' I begin to think you must be somebody 's son . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14074 len. 13]: I suppose I am , ' Tom answered in his quiet way .
Parsing [sent. 14075 len. 10]: ` But I mean somebody 's of consequence . '
Parsing [sent. 14076 len. 24]: ` Bless your heart , ' replied Tom , ` my poor father was of no consequence , nor my mother either . '
Parsing [sent. 14077 len. 9]: ` You remember them perfectly , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 14078 len. 4]: ` Remember them ?
Parsing [sent. 14079 len. 4]: oh dear yes .
Parsing [sent. 14080 len. 7]: My poor mother was the last .
Parsing [sent. 14081 len. 31]: She died when Ruth was a mere baby , and then we both became a charge upon the savings of that good old grandmother I used to tell you of .
Parsing [sent. 14082 len. 3]: You remember !
Parsing [sent. 14083 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 14084 len. 11]: There 's nothing romantic in our history , John . '
Parsing [sent. 14085 len. 11]: ` Very well , ' said John in quiet despair .
Parsing [sent. 14086 len. 15]: ` Then there is no way of accounting for my visitor of this morning .
Parsing [sent. 14087 len. 9]: So we 'll not try , Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 14088 len. 70]: They did try , notwithstanding , and never left off trying until they got to Austin Friars , where , in a very dark passage on the first floor , oddly situated at the back of a house , across some leads , they found a little blear-eyed glass door up in one corner , with MR. FIPS painted on it in characters which were meant to be transparent .
Parsing [sent. 14089 len. 76]: There was also a wicked old sideboard hiding in the gloom hard by , meditating designs upon the ribs of visitors ; and an old mat , worn into lattice work , which , being useless as a mat -LRB- even if anybody could have seen it , which was impossible -RRB- , had for many years directed its industry into another channel , and regularly tripped up every one of Mr Fips 's clients .
Parsing [sent. 14090 len. 50]: Mr Fips , hearing a violent concussion between a human hat and his office door , was apprised , by the usual means of communication , that somebody had come to call upon him , and giving that somebody admission , observed that it was ` rather dark . '
Parsing [sent. 14091 len. 13]: ` Dark indeed , ' John whispered in Tom Pinch 's ear .
Parsing [sent. 14092 len. 19]: ` Not a bad place to dispose of a countryman in , I should think , Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 14093 len. 53]: Tom had been already turning over in his mind the possibility of their having been tempted into that region to furnish forth a pie ; but the sight of Mr Fips , who was small and spare , and looked peaceable , and wore black shorts and powder , dispelled his doubts .
Parsing [sent. 14094 len. 9]: ` Walk in , ' said Mr Fips .
Parsing [sent. 14095 len. 4]: They walked in .
Parsing [sent. 14096 len. 51]: And a mighty yellow-jaundiced little office Mr Fips had of it ; with a great , black , sprawling splash upon the floor in one corner , as if some old clerk had cut his throat there , years ago , and had let out ink instead of blood . '
Parsing [sent. 14097 len. 15]: I have brought my friend Mr Pinch , sir , ' said John Westlock .
Parsing [sent. 14098 len. 11]: ` Be pleased to sit , ' said Mr Fips .
Parsing [sent. 14099 len. 41]: They occupied the two chairs , and Mr Fips took the office stool from the stuffing whereof he drew forth a piece of horse-hair of immense length , which he put into his mouth with a great appearance of appetite .
Parsing [sent. 14100 len. 28]: He looked at Tom Pinch curiously , but with an entire freedom from any such expression as could be reasonably construed into an unusual display of interest .
Parsing [sent. 14101 len. 52]: After a short silence , during which Mr Fips was so perfectly unembarrassed as to render it manifest that he could have broken it sooner without hesitation , if he had felt inclined to do so , he asked if Mr Westlock had made his offer fully known to Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 14102 len. 6]: John answered in the affirmative .
Parsing [sent. 14103 len. 15]: ` And you think it worth your while , sir , do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 14104 len. 7]: Mr Fips inquired of Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 14105 len. 17]: I think it a piece of great good fortune , sir , ' said Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 14106 len. 11]: I am exceedingly obliged to you for the offer . '
Parsing [sent. 14107 len. 11]: ` Not to me , ' said Mr Fips . '
Parsing [sent. 14108 len. 6]: I act upon instructions . '
Parsing [sent. 14109 len. 13]: ` To your friend , sir , then , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 14110 len. 20]: ` To the gentleman with whom I am to engage , and whose confidence I shall endeavour to deserve .
Parsing [sent. 14111 len. 20]: When he knows me better , sir , I hope he will not lose his good opinion of me .
Parsing [sent. 14112 len. 16]: He will find me punctual and vigilant , and anxious to do what is right .
Parsing [sent. 14113 len. 22]: That I think I can answer for , and so , ' looking towards him , ` can Mr Westlock . '
Parsing [sent. 14114 len. 8]: ` Most assuredly , ' said John .
Parsing [sent. 14115 len. 13]: Mr Fips appeared to have some little difficulty in resuming the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 14116 len. 21]: To relieve himself , he took up the wafer-stamp , and began stamping capital F 's all over his legs .
Parsing [sent. 14117 len. 26]: ` The fact is , ' said Mr Fips , ` that my friend is not , at this present moment , in town . '
Parsing [sent. 14118 len. 30]: Tom 's countenance fell ; for he thought this equivalent to telling him that his appearance did not answer ; and that Fips must look out for somebody else .
Parsing [sent. 14119 len. 14]: ` When do you think he will be in town , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 14120 len. 4]: he asked . '
Parsing [sent. 14121 len. 11]: I ca n't say ; it 's impossible to tell .
Parsing [sent. 14122 len. 6]: I really have no idea .
Parsing [sent. 14123 len. 44]: But , ' said Fips , taking off a very deep impression of the wafer-stamp upon the calf of his left leg , and looking steadily at Tom , ' I do n't know that it 's a matter of much consequence . '
Parsing [sent. 14124 len. 14]: Poor Tom inclined his head deferentially , but appeared to doubt that . '
Parsing [sent. 14125 len. 22]: I say , ' repeated Mr Fips , ` that I do n't know it 's a matter of much consequence .
Parsing [sent. 14126 len. 12]: The business lies entirely between yourself and me , Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 14127 len. 24]: With reference to your duties , I can set you going ; and with reference to your salary , I can pay it .
Parsing [sent. 14128 len. 46]: Weekly , ' said Mr Fips , putting down the wafer-stamp , and looking at John Westlock and Tom Pinch by turns , ` weekly ; in this office ; at any time between the hours of four and five o'clock in the afternoon . '
Parsing [sent. 14129 len. 19]: As Mr Fips said this , he made up his face as if he were going to whistle .
Parsing [sent. 14130 len. 5]: But he did n't .
Parsing [sent. 14131 len. 28]: ` You are very good , ' said Tom , whose countenance was now suffused with pleasure ; ` and nothing can be more satisfactory or straightforward .
Parsing [sent. 14132 len. 26]: My attendance will be required -- ' ` From half-past nine to four o'clock or so , I should say , ' interrupted Mr Fips .
Parsing [sent. 14133 len. 6]: ` About that . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14134 len. 29]: I did not mean the hours of attendance , ' retorted Tom , ` which are light and easy , I am sure ; but the place . '
Parsing [sent. 14135 len. 6]: ` Oh , the place !
Parsing [sent. 14136 len. 8]: The place is in the Temple . '
Parsing [sent. 14137 len. 4]: Tom was delighted .
Parsing [sent. 14138 len. 18]: ` Perhaps , ' said Mr Fips , ` you would like to see the place ? '
Parsing [sent. 14139 len. 6]: ` Oh , dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 14140 len. 4]: cried Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 14141 len. 26]: I shall only be too glad to consider myself engaged , if you will allow me ; without any further reference to the place . '
Parsing [sent. 14142 len. 44]: ` You may consider yourself engaged , by all means , ' said Mr Fips ; ` you could n't meet me at the Temple Gate in Fleet Street , in an hour from this time , I suppose , could you ? '
Parsing [sent. 14143 len. 4]: Certainly Tom could .
Parsing [sent. 14144 len. 10]: ` Good , ' said Mr Fips , rising .
Parsing [sent. 14145 len. 18]: ` Then I will show you the place ; and you can begin your attendance to-morrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 14146 len. 11]: In an hour , therefore , I shall see you .
Parsing [sent. 14147 len. 6]: You too , Mr Westlock ?
Parsing [sent. 14148 len. 3]: Very good .
Parsing [sent. 14149 len. 6]: Take care how you go .
Parsing [sent. 14150 len. 6]: It 's rather dark . '
Parsing [sent. 14151 len. 26]: With this remark , which seemed superfluous , he shut them out upon the staircase , and they groped their way into the street again .
Parsing [sent. 14152 len. 41]: The interview had done so little to remove the mystery in which Tom 's new engagement was involved , and had done so much to thicken it , that neither could help smiling at the puzzled looks of the other .
Parsing [sent. 14153 len. 48]: They agreed , however , that the introduction of Tom to his new office and office companions could hardly fail to throw a light upon the subject ; and therefore postponed its further consideration until after the fulfillment of the appointment they had made with Mr Fips .
Parsing [sent. 14154 len. 30]: After looking at John Westlock 's chambers , and devoting a few spare minutes to the Boar 's Head , they issued forth again to the place of meeting .
Parsing [sent. 14155 len. 27]: The time agreed upon had not quite come ; but Mr Fips was already at the Temple Gate , and expressed his satisfaction at their punctuality .
Parsing [sent. 14156 len. 49]: He led the way through sundry lanes and courts , into one more quiet and more gloomy than the rest , and , singling out a certain house , ascended a common staircase ; taking from his pocket , as he went , a bunch of rusty keys .
Parsing [sent. 14157 len. 53]: Stopping before a door upon an upper story , which had nothing but a yellow smear of paint where custom would have placed the tenant 's name , he began to beat the dust out of one of these keys , very deliberately , upon the great broad handrail of the balustrade .
Parsing [sent. 14158 len. 31]: ` You had better have a little plug made , ' he said , looking round at Tom , after blowing a shrill whistle into the barrel of the key .
Parsing [sent. 14159 len. 14]: ` It 's the only way of preventing them from getting stopped up .
Parsing [sent. 14160 len. 21]: You 'll find the lock go the better , too , I dare say , for a little oil . '
Parsing [sent. 14161 len. 25]: Tom thanked him ; but was too much occupied with his own speculations , and John Westlock 's looks , to be very talkative .
Parsing [sent. 14162 len. 24]: In the meantime Mr Fips opened the door , which yielded to his hand very unwillingly , and with a horribly discordant sound .
Parsing [sent. 14163 len. 18]: He took the key out , when he had done so , and gave it to Tom .
Parsing [sent. 14164 len. 6]: ` Aye , aye ! '
Parsing [sent. 14165 len. 4]: said Mr Fips .
Parsing [sent. 14166 len. 9]: ` The dust lies rather thick here . '
Parsing [sent. 14167 len. 5]: Truly , it did .
Parsing [sent. 14168 len. 14]: Mr Fips might have gone so far as to say , very thick .
Parsing [sent. 14169 len. 46]: It had accumulated everywhere ; lay deep on everything , and in one part , where a ray of sun shone through a crevice in the shutter and struck upon the opposite wall , it went twirling round and round , like a gigantic squirrel-cage .
Parsing [sent. 14170 len. 15]: Dust was the only thing in the place that had any motion about it .
Parsing [sent. 14171 len. 45]: When their conductor admitted the light freely , and lifting up the heavy window-sash , let in the summer air , he showed the mouldering furniture , discoloured wainscoting and ceiling , rusty stove , and ashy hearth , in all their inert neglect .
Parsing [sent. 14172 len. 63]: Close to the door there stood a candlestick , with an extinguisher upon it ; as if the last man who had been there had paused , after securing a retreat , to take a parting look at the dreariness he left behind , and then had shut out light and life together , and closed the place up like a tomb .
Parsing [sent. 14173 len. 25]: There were two rooms on that floor ; and in the first or outer one a narrow staircase , leading to two more above .
Parsing [sent. 14174 len. 8]: These last were fitted up as bed-chambers .
Parsing [sent. 14175 len. 56]: Neither in them , nor in the rooms below , was any scarcity of convenient furniture observable , although the fittings were of a bygone fashion ; but solitude and want of use seemed to have rendered it unfit for any purposes of comfort , and to have given it a grisly , haunted air .
Parsing [sent. 14176 len. 29]: Movables of every kind lay strewn about , without the least attempt at order , and were intermixed with boxes , hampers , and all sorts of lumber .
Parsing [sent. 14177 len. 56]: On all the floors were piles of books , to the amount , perhaps , of some thousands of volumes : these , still in bales ; those , wrapped in paper , as they had been purchased ; others scattered singly or in heaps ; not one upon the shelves which lined the walls .
Parsing [sent. 14178 len. 9]: To these Mr Fips called Tom 's attention .
Parsing [sent. 14179 len. 27]: ` Before anything else can be done , we must have them put in order , catalogued , and ranged upon the book-shelves , Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 14180 len. 13]: That will do to begin with , I think , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 14181 len. 33]: Tom rubbed his hands in the pleasant anticipation of a task so congenial to his taste , and said : ` An occupation full of interest for me , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 14182 len. 32]: It will occupy me , perhaps , until Mr. -- ' ` Until Mr. -- ' repeated Fips ; as much as to ask Tom what he was stopping for . '
Parsing [sent. 14183 len. 16]: I forgot that you had not mentioned the gentleman 's name , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 14184 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 14185 len. 14]: cried Mr Fips , pulling on his glove , ` did n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 14186 len. 11]: No , by-the-bye , I do n't think I did .
Parsing [sent. 14187 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 14188 len. 9]: I dare say he 'll be here soon .
Parsing [sent. 14189 len. 13]: You will get on very well together , I have no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 14190 len. 8]: I wish you success I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 14191 len. 9]: You wo n't forget to shut the door ?
Parsing [sent. 14192 len. 10]: It 'll lock of itself if you slam it .
Parsing [sent. 14193 len. 6]: Half-past nine , you know .
Parsing [sent. 14194 len. 47]: Let us say from half-past nine to four , or half-past four , or thereabouts ; one day , perhaps , a little earlier , another day , perhaps , a little later , according as you feel disposed , and as you arrange your work .
Parsing [sent. 14195 len. 11]: Mr Fips , Austin Friars of course you 'll remember ?
Parsing [sent. 14196 len. 15]: And you wo n't forget to slam the door , if you please ! '
Parsing [sent. 14197 len. 42]: He said all this in such a comfortable , easy manner , that Tom could only rub his hands , and nod his head , and smile in acquiescence which he was still doing , when Mr Fips walked coolly out .
Parsing [sent. 14198 len. 8]: ` Why , he 's gone ! '
Parsing [sent. 14199 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 14200 len. 45]: ` And what 's more , Tom , ' said John Westlock , seating himself upon a pile of books , and looking up at his astonished friend , ` he is evidently not coming back again ; so here you are , installed .
Parsing [sent. 14201 len. 8]: Under rather singular circumstances , Tom ! '
Parsing [sent. 14202 len. 42]: It was such an odd affair throughout , and Tom standing there among the books with his hat in one hand and the key in the other , looked so prodigiously confounded , that his friend could not help laughing heartily .
Parsing [sent. 14203 len. 64]: Tom himself was tickled ; no less by the hilarity of his friend than by the recollection of the sudden manner in which he had been brought to a stop , in the very height of his urbane conference with Mr Fips ; so by degrees Tom burst out laughing too ; and each making the other laugh more , they fairly roared .
Parsing [sent. 14204 len. 60]: When they had had their laugh out , which did not happen very soon , for give John an inch that way and he was sure to take several ells , being a jovial , good-tempered fellow , they looked about them more closely , groping among the lumber for any stray means of enlightenment that might turn up .
Parsing [sent. 14205 len. 11]: But no scrap or shred of information could they find .
Parsing [sent. 14206 len. 61]: The books were marked with a variety of owner 's names , having , no doubt , been bought at sales , and collected here and there at different times ; but whether any one of these names belonged to Tom 's employer , and , if so , which of them , they had no means whatever of determining .
Parsing [sent. 14207 len. 54]: It occurred to John as a very bright thought to make inquiry at the steward 's office , to whom the chambers belonged , or by whom they were held ; but he came back no wiser than he went , the answer being , ` Mr Fips , of Austin Friars . '
Parsing [sent. 14208 len. 17]: ` After all , Tom , I begin to think it lies no deeper than this .
Parsing [sent. 14209 len. 45]: Fips is an eccentric man ; has some knowledge of Pecksniff ; despises him , of course ; has heard or seen enough of you to know that you are the man he wants ; and engages you in his own whimsical manner . '
Parsing [sent. 14210 len. 10]: ` But why in his own whimsical manner ? '
Parsing [sent. 14211 len. 3]: asked Tom .
Parsing [sent. 14212 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 14213 len. 10]: why does any man entertain his own whimsical taste ?
Parsing [sent. 14214 len. 21]: Why does Mr Fips wear shorts and powder , and Mr Fips 's next-door neighbour boots and a wig ? '
Parsing [sent. 14215 len. 43]: Tom , being in that state of mind in which any explanation is a great relief , adopted this last one -LRB- which indeed was quite as feasible as any other -RRB- readily , and said he had no doubt of it .
Parsing [sent. 14216 len. 42]: Nor was his faith at all shaken by his having said exactly the same thing to each suggestion of his friend 's in turn , and being perfectly ready to say it again if he had any new solution to propose .
Parsing [sent. 14217 len. 22]: As he had not , Tom drew down the window-sash , and folded the shutter ; and they left the rooms .
Parsing [sent. 14218 len. 29]: He closed the door heavily , as Mr Fips had desired him ; tried it , found it all safe , and put the key in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 14219 len. 29]: They made a pretty wide circuit in going back to Islington , as they had time to spare , and Tom was never tired of looking about him .
Parsing [sent. 14220 len. 54]: It was well he had John Westlock for his companion , for most people would have been weary of his perpetual stoppages at shop-windows , and his frequent dashes into the crowded carriage-way at the peril of his life , to get the better view of church steeples , and other public buildings .
Parsing [sent. 14221 len. 52]: But John was charmed to see him so much interested , and every time Tom came back with a beaming face from among the wheels of carts and hackney-coaches , wholly unconscious of the personal congratulations addressed to him by the drivers , John seemed to like him better than before .
Parsing [sent. 14222 len. 44]: There was no flour on Ruth 's hands when she received them in the triangular parlour , but there were pleasant smiles upon her face , and a crowd of welcomes shining out of every smile , and gleaming in her bright eyes .
Parsing [sent. 14223 len. 9]: By the bye , how bright they were !
Parsing [sent. 14224 len. 44]: Looking into them for but a moment , when you took her hand , you saw , in each , such a capital miniature of yourself , representing you as such a restless , flashing , eager , brilliant little fellow -- Ah !
Parsing [sent. 14225 len. 12]: if you could only have kept them for your own miniature !
Parsing [sent. 14226 len. 38]: But , wicked , roving , restless , too impartial eyes , it was enough for any one to stand before them , and , straightway , there he danced and sparkled quite as merrily as you !
Parsing [sent. 14227 len. 83]: The table was already spread for dinner ; and though it was spread with nothing very choice in the way of glass or linen , and with green-handled knives , and very mountebanks of two-pronged forks , which seemed to be trying how far asunder they could possibly stretch their legs without converting themselves into double the number of iron toothpicks , it wanted neither damask , silver , gold , nor china ; no , nor any other garniture at all .
Parsing [sent. 14228 len. 17]: There it was ; and , being there , nothing else would have done as well .
Parsing [sent. 14229 len. 57]: The success of that initiative dish ; that first experiment of hers in cookery ; was so entire , so unalloyed and perfect , that John Westlock and Tom agreed she must have been studying the art in secret for a long time past ; and urged her to make a full confession of the fact .
Parsing [sent. 14230 len. 60]: They were exceedingly merry over this jest , and many smart things were said concerning it ; but John was not as fair in his behaviour as might have been expected , for , after luring Tom Pinch on for a long time , he suddenly went over to the enemy , and swore to everything his sister said .
Parsing [sent. 14231 len. 39]: However , as Tom observed the same night before going to bed , it was only in joke , and John had always been famous for being polite to ladies , even when he was quite a boy .
Parsing [sent. 14232 len. 6]: Ruth said , ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 14233 len. 3]: indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 14234 len. 7]: She did n't say anything else .
Parsing [sent. 14235 len. 13]: It is astonishing how much three people may find to talk about .
Parsing [sent. 14236 len. 7]: They scarcely left off talking once .
Parsing [sent. 14237 len. 39]: And it was not all lively chat which occupied them ; for when Tom related how he had seen Mr Pecksniff 's daughters , and what a change had fallen on the younger , they were very serious .
Parsing [sent. 14238 len. 65]: John Westlock became quite absorbed in her fortunes ; asking many questions of Tom Pinch about her marriage , inquiring whether her husband was the gentleman whom Tom had brought to dine with him at Salisbury ; in what degree of relationship they stood towards each other , being different persons ; and taking , in short , the greatest interest in the subject .
Parsing [sent. 14239 len. 62]: Tom then went into it , at full length ; he told how Martin had gone abroad , and had not been heard of for a long time ; how Dragon Mark had borne him company ; how Mr Pecksniff had got the poor old doting grandfather into his power ; and how he basely sought the hand of Mary Graham .
Parsing [sent. 14240 len. 45]: But not a word said Tom of what lay hidden in his heart ; his heart , so deep , and true , and full of honour , and yet with so much room for every gentle and unselfish thought ; not a word .
Parsing [sent. 14241 len. 4]: Tom , Tom !
Parsing [sent. 14242 len. 95]: The man in all this world most confident in his sagacity and shrewdness ; the man in all this world most proud of his distrust of other men , and having most to show in gold and silver as the gains belonging to his creed ; the meekest favourer of that wise doctrine , Every man for himself , and God for us all -LRB- there being high wisdom in the thought that the Eternal Majesty of Heaven ever was , or can be , on the side of selfish lust and love ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 14243 len. 38]: ; shall never find , oh , never find , be sure of that , the time come home to him , when all his wisdom is an idiot 's folly , weighed against a simple heart !
Parsing [sent. 14244 len. 81]: Well , well , Tom , it was simple too , though simple in a different way , to be so eager touching that same theatre , of which John said , when tea was done , he had the absolute command , so far as taking parties in without the payment of a sixpence was concerned ; and simpler yet , perhaps , never to suspect that when he went in first , alone , he paid the money !
Parsing [sent. 14245 len. 65]: Simple in thee , dear Tom , to laugh and cry so heartily at such a sorry show , so poorly shown ; simple to be so happy and loquacious trudging home with Ruth ; simple to be so surprised to find that merry present of a cookery-book awaiting her in the parlour next morning , with the beef-steak-pudding-leaf turned down and blotted out .
Parsing [sent. 14246 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 14247 len. 5]: Let the record stand !
Parsing [sent. 14248 len. 15]: Thy quality of soul was simple , simple , quite contemptible , Tom Pinch !
Parsing [sent. 14249 len. 48]: CHAPTER FORTY THE PINCHES MAKE A NEW ACQUAINTANCE , AND HAVE FRESH OCCASION FOR SURPRISE AND WONDER There was a ghostly air about these uninhabited chambers in the Temple , and attending every circumstance of Tom 's employment there , which had a strange charm in it .
Parsing [sent. 14250 len. 66]: Every morning when he shut his door at Islington , he turned his face towards an atmosphere of unaccountable fascination , as surely as he turned it to the London smoke ; and from that moment it thickened round and round him all day long , until the time arrived for going home again , and leaving it , like a motionless cloud , behind .
Parsing [sent. 14251 len. 29]: It seemed to Tom , every morning , that he approached this ghostly mist , and became enveloped in it , by the easiest succession of degrees imaginable .
Parsing [sent. 14252 len. 22]: Passing from the roar and rattle of the streets into the quiet court-yards of the Temple , was the first preparation .
Parsing [sent. 14253 len. 105]: Every echo of his footsteps sounded to him like a sound from the old walls and pavements , wanting language to relate the histories of the dim , dismal rooms ; to tell him what lost documents were decaying in forgotten corners of the shut-up cellars , from whose lattices such mouldy sighs came breathing forth as he went past ; to whisper of dark bins of rare old wine , bricked up in vaults among the old foundations of the Halls ; or mutter in a lower tone yet darker legends of the cross-legged knights , whose marble effigies were in the church .
Parsing [sent. 14254 len. 44]: With the first planting of his foot upon the staircase of his dusty office , all these mysteries increased ; until , ascending step by step , as Tom ascended , they attained their full growth in the solitary labours of the day .
Parsing [sent. 14255 len. 11]: Every day brought one recurring , never-failing source of speculation .
Parsing [sent. 14256 len. 15]: This employer ; would he come to-day , and what would he be like ?
Parsing [sent. 14257 len. 59]: For Tom could not stop short at Mr Fips ; he quite believed that Mr Fips had spoken truly , when he said he acted for another ; and what manner of man that other was , became a full-blown flower of wonder in the garden of Tom 's fancy , which never faded or got trodden down .
Parsing [sent. 14258 len. 35]: At one time , he conceived that Mr Pecksniff , repenting of his falsehood , might , by exertion of his influence with some third person have devised these means of giving him employment .
Parsing [sent. 14259 len. 65]: He found this idea so insupportable after what had taken place between that good man and himself , that he confided it to John Westlock on the very same day ; informing John that he would rather ply for hire as a porter , than fall so low in his own esteem as to accept the smallest obligation from the hands of Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 14260 len. 79]: But John assured him that he -LRB- Tom Pinch -RRB- was far from doing justice to the character of Mr Pecksniff yet , if he supposed that gentleman capable of performing a generous action ; and that he might make his mind quite easy on that head until he saw the sun turn green and the moon black , and at the same time distinctly perceived with the naked eye , twelve first-rate comets careering round those planets .
Parsing [sent. 14261 len. 30]: In which unusual state of things , he said -LRB- and not before -RRB- , it might become not absolutely lunatic to suspect Mr Pecksniff of anything so monstrous .
Parsing [sent. 14262 len. 27]: In short he laughed the idea down completely ; and Tom , abandoning it , was thrown upon his beam-ends again , for some other solution .
Parsing [sent. 14263 len. 38]: In the meantime Tom attended to his duties daily , and made considerable progress with the books ; which were already reduced to some sort of order , and made a great appearance in his fairly-written catalogue .
Parsing [sent. 14264 len. 85]: During his business hours , he indulged himself occasionally with snatches of reading ; which were often , indeed , a necessary part of his pursuit ; and as he usually made bold to carry one of these goblin volumes home at night -LRB- always bringing it back again next morning , in case his strange employer should appear and ask what had become of it -RRB- , he led a happy , quiet , studious kind of life , after his own heart .
Parsing [sent. 14265 len. 45]: But though the books were never so interesting , and never so full of novelty to Tom , they could not so enchain him , in those mysterious chambers , as to render him unconscious , for a moment , of the lightest sound .
Parsing [sent. 14266 len. 50]: Any footstep on the flags without set him listening attentively and when it turned into that house , and came up , up , up the stairs , he always thought with a beating heart , ` Now I am coming face to face with him at last ! '
Parsing [sent. 14267 len. 14]: But no footstep ever passed the floor immediately below : except his own .
Parsing [sent. 14268 len. 67]: This mystery and loneliness engendered fancies in Tom 's mind , the folly of which his common sense could readily discover , but which his common sense was quite unable to keep away , notwithstanding ; that quality being with most of us , in such a case , like the old French Police -- quick at detection , but very weak as a preventive power .
Parsing [sent. 14269 len. 83]: Misgivings , undefined , absurd , inexplicable , that there was some one hiding in the inner room -- walking softly overhead , peeping in through the door-chink , doing something stealthy , anywhere where he was not -- came over him a hundred times a day , making it pleasant to throw up the sash , and hold communication even with the sparrows who had built in the roof and water-spout , and were twittering about the windows all day long .
Parsing [sent. 14270 len. 34]: He sat with the outer door wide open , at all times , that he might hear the footsteps as they entered , and turned off into the chambers on the lower floor .
Parsing [sent. 14271 len. 51]: He formed odd prepossessions too , regarding strangers in the streets ; and would say within himself of such or such a man , who struck him as having anything uncommon in his dress or aspect , ' I should n't wonder , now , if that were he ! '
Parsing [sent. 14272 len. 5]: But it never was .
Parsing [sent. 14273 len. 55]: And though he actually turned back and followed more than one of these suspected individuals , in a singular belief that they were going to the place he was then upon his way from , he never got any other satisfaction by it , than the satisfaction of knowing it was not the case .
Parsing [sent. 14274 len. 40]: Mr Fips , of Austin Friars , rather deepened than illumined the obscurity of his position ; for on the first occasion of Tom 's waiting on him to receive his weekly pay , he said : ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 14275 len. 18]: by the bye , Mr Pinch , you need n't mention it , if you please ! '
Parsing [sent. 14276 len. 32]: Tom thought he was going to tell him a secret ; so he said that he would n't on any account , and that Mr Fips might entirely depend upon him .
Parsing [sent. 14277 len. 31]: But as Mr Fips said ` Very good , ' in reply , and nothing more , Tom prompted him : ` Not on any account , ' repeated Tom .
Parsing [sent. 14278 len. 9]: Mr Fips repeated : ` Very good . '
Parsing [sent. 14279 len. 11]: ` You were going to say ' -- Tom hinted .
Parsing [sent. 14280 len. 6]: ` Oh dear no ! '
Parsing [sent. 14281 len. 3]: cried Fips .
Parsing [sent. 14282 len. 6]: ` Not at all . '
Parsing [sent. 14283 len. 29]: However , seeing Tom confused , he added , ' I mean that you need n't mention any particulars about your place of employment , to people generally .
Parsing [sent. 14284 len. 9]: You 'll find it better not . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14285 len. 27]: I have not had the pleasure of seeing my employer yet , sir , ' observed Tom , putting his week 's salary in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 14286 len. 6]: ` Have n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 14287 len. 3]: said Fips .
Parsing [sent. 14288 len. 13]: ` No , I do n't suppose you have though . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14289 len. 28]: I should like to thank him , and to know that what I have done so far , is done to his satisfaction , ' faltered Tom .
Parsing [sent. 14290 len. 13]: ` Quite right , ' said Mr Fips , with a yawn .
Parsing [sent. 14291 len. 4]: ` Highly creditable .
Parsing [sent. 14292 len. 4]: Very proper . '
Parsing [sent. 14293 len. 11]: Tom hastily resolved to try him on another tack . '
Parsing [sent. 14294 len. 14]: I shall soon have finished with the books , ' he said . '
Parsing [sent. 14295 len. 17]: I hope that will not terminate my engagement , sir , or render me useless ? '
Parsing [sent. 14296 len. 6]: ` Oh dear no ! '
Parsing [sent. 14297 len. 3]: retorted Fips .
Parsing [sent. 14298 len. 9]: ` Plenty to do ; plen-ty to do !
Parsing [sent. 14299 len. 6]: Be careful how you go .
Parsing [sent. 14300 len. 6]: It 's rather dark . '
Parsing [sent. 14301 len. 16]: This was the very utmost extent of information Tom could ever get out of HIM .
Parsing [sent. 14302 len. 28]: So it was dark enough in all conscience ; and if Mr Fips expressed himself with a double meaning , he had good reason for doing so .
Parsing [sent. 14303 len. 37]: But now a circumstance occurred , which helped to divert Tom 's thoughts from even this mystery , and to divide them between it and a new channel , which was a very Nile in itself .
Parsing [sent. 14304 len. 8]: The way it came about was this .
Parsing [sent. 14305 len. 124]: Having always been an early riser and having now no organ to engage him in sweet converse every morning , it was his habit to take a long walk before going to the Temple ; and naturally inclining , as a stranger , towards those parts of the town which were conspicuous for the life and animation pervading them , he became a great frequenter of the market-places , bridges , quays , and especially the steam-boat wharves ; for it was very lively and fresh to see the people hurrying away upon their many schemes of business or pleasure , and it made Tom glad to think that there was that much change and freedom in the monotonous routine of city lives .
Parsing [sent. 14306 len. 10]: In most of these morning excursions Ruth accompanied him .
Parsing [sent. 14307 len. 46]: As their landlord was always up and away at his business -LRB- whatever that might be , no one seemed to know -RRB- at a very early hour , the habits of the people of the house in which they lodged corresponded with their own .
Parsing [sent. 14308 len. 20]: Thus they had often finished their breakfast , and were out in the summer air , by seven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 14309 len. 31]: After a two hours ' stroll they parted at some convenient point ; Tom going to the Temple , and his sister returning home , as methodically as you please .
Parsing [sent. 14310 len. 115]: Many and many a pleasant stroll they had in Covent Garden Market ; snuffing up the perfume of the fruits and flowers , wondering at the magnificence of the pineapples and melons ; catching glimpses down side avenues , of rows and rows of old women , seated on inverted baskets , shelling peas ; looking unutterable things at the fat bundles of asparagus with which the dainty shops were fortified as with a breastwork ; and , at the herbalist 's doors , gratefully inhaling scents as of veal-stuffing yet uncooked , dreamily mixed up with capsicums , brown-paper , seeds , even with hints of lusty snails and fine young curly leeches .
Parsing [sent. 14311 len. 98]: Many and many a pleasant stroll they had among the poultry markets , where ducks and fowls , with necks unnaturally long , lay stretched out in pairs , ready for cooking ; where there were speckled eggs in mossy baskets , white country sausages beyond impeachment by surviving cat or dog , or horse or donkey ; new cheeses to any wild extent , live birds in coops and cages , looking much too big to be natural , in consequence of those receptacles being much too little ; rabbits , alive and dead , innumerable .
Parsing [sent. 14312 len. 32]: Many a pleasant stroll they had among the cool , refreshing , silvery fish-stalls , with a kind of moonlight effect about their stock-in-trade , excepting always for the ruddy lobsters .
Parsing [sent. 14313 len. 29]: Many a pleasant stroll among the waggon-loads of fragrant hay , beneath which dogs and tired waggoners lay fast asleep , oblivious of the pieman and the public-house .
Parsing [sent. 14314 len. 17]: But never half so good a stroll as down among the steamboats on a bright morning .
Parsing [sent. 14315 len. 52]: There they lay , alongside of each other ; hard and fast for ever , to all appearance , but designing to get out somehow , and quite confident of doing it ; and in that faith shoals of passengers , and heaps of luggage , were proceeding hurriedly on board .
Parsing [sent. 14316 len. 10]: Little steam-boats dashed up and down the stream incessantly .
Parsing [sent. 14317 len. 92]: Tiers upon tiers of vessels , scores of masts , labyrinths of tackle , idle sails , splashing oars , gliding row-boats , lumbering barges , sunken piles , with ugly lodgings for the water-rat within their mud-discoloured nooks ; church steeples , warehouses , house-roofs , arches , bridges , men and women , children , casks , cranes , boxes horses , coaches , idlers , and hard-labourers ; there they were , all jumbled up together , any summer morning , far beyond Tom 's power of separation .
Parsing [sent. 14318 len. 31]: In the midst of all this turmoil there was an incessant roar from every packet 's funnel , which quite expressed and carried out the uppermost emotion of the scene .
Parsing [sent. 14319 len. 77]: They all appeared to be perspiring and bothering themselves , exactly as their passengers did ; they never left off fretting and chafing , in their own hoarse manner , once ; but were always panting out , without any stops , ` Come along do make haste I 'm very nervous come along oh good gracious we shall never get there how late you are do make haste I 'm off directly come along ! '
Parsing [sent. 14320 len. 86]: Even when they had left off , and had got safely out into the current , on the smallest provocation they began again ; for the bravest packet of them all , being stopped by some entanglement in the river , would immediately begin to fume and pant afresh , ` oh here 's a stoppage what 's the matter do go on there I 'm in a hurry it 's done on purpose did you ever oh my goodness DO go on here ! '
Parsing [sent. 14321 len. 32]: and so , in a state of mind bordering on distraction , would be last seen drifting slowly through the mist into the summer light beyond , that made it red .
Parsing [sent. 14322 len. 46]: Tom 's ship , however ; or , at least , the packet-boat in which Tom and his sister took the greatest interest on one particular occasion ; was not off yet , by any means ; but was at the height of its disorder .
Parsing [sent. 14323 len. 72]: The press of passengers was very great ; another steam-boat lay on each side of her ; the gangways were choked up ; distracted women , obviously bound for Gravesend , but turning a deaf ear to all representations that this particular vessel was about to sail for Antwerp , persisted in secreting baskets of refreshments behind bulk-heads , and water-casks , and under seats ; and very great confusion prevailed .
Parsing [sent. 14324 len. 63]: It was so amusing , that Tom , with Ruth upon his arm , stood looking down from the wharf , as nearly regardless as it was in the nature of flesh and blood to be , of an elderly lady behind him , who had brought a large umbrella with her , and did n't know what to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 14325 len. 35]: This tremendous instrument had a hooked handle ; and its vicinity was first made known to him by a painful pressure on the windpipe , consequent upon its having caught him round the throat .
Parsing [sent. 14326 len. 84]: Soon after disengaging himself with perfect good humour , he had a sensation of the ferule in his back ; immediately afterwards , of the hook entangling his ankles ; then of the umbrella generally , wandering about his hat , and flapping at it like a great bird ; and , lastly , of a poke or thrust below the ribs , which give him such exceeding anguish , that he could not refrain from turning round to offer a mild remonstrance .
Parsing [sent. 14327 len. 56]: Upon his turning round , he found the owner of the umbrella struggling on tip-toe , with a countenance expressive of violent animosity , to look down upon the steam-boats ; from which he inferred that she had attacked him , standing in the front row , by design , and as her natural enemy .
Parsing [sent. 14328 len. 11]: ` What a very ill-natured person you must be ! '
Parsing [sent. 14329 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 14330 len. 13]: The lady cried out fiercely , ` Where 's the pelisse ! '
Parsing [sent. 14331 len. 46]: -- meaning the constabulary -- and went on to say , shaking the handle of the umbrella at Tom , that but for them fellers never being in the way when they was wanted , she 'd have given him in charge , she would .
Parsing [sent. 14332 len. 41]: ` If they greased their whiskers less , and minded the duties which they 're paid so heavy for , a little more , ' she observed , ` no one need n't be drove mad by scrouding so ! '
Parsing [sent. 14333 len. 23]: She had been grievously knocked about , no doubt , for her bonnet was bent into the shape of a cocked hat .
Parsing [sent. 14334 len. 20]: Being a fat little woman , too , she was in a state of great exhaustion and intense heat .
Parsing [sent. 14335 len. 22]: Instead of pursuing the altercation , therefore , Tom civilly inquired what boat she wanted to go on board of ? '
Parsing [sent. 14336 len. 33]: I suppose , ' returned the lady , ` as nobody but yourself can want to look at a steam package , without wanting to go a-boarding of it , can they !
Parsing [sent. 14337 len. 3]: Booby ! '
Parsing [sent. 14338 len. 12]: ` Which one do you want to look at then ? '
Parsing [sent. 14339 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 14340 len. 11]: ` We 'll make room for you if we can .
Parsing [sent. 14341 len. 7]: Do n't be so ill-tempered . '
Parsing [sent. 14342 len. 52]: ` No blessed creetur as ever I was with in trying times , ' returned the lady , somewhat softened , ` and they 're a many in their numbers , ever brought it as a charge again myself that I was anythin ' but mild and equal in my spirits .
Parsing [sent. 14343 len. 39]: Never mind a contradicting of me , if you seem to feel it does you good , ma'am , I often says , for well you know that Sairey may be trusted not to give it back again .
Parsing [sent. 14344 len. 23]: But I will not denige that I am worrited and wexed this day , and with good reagion , Lord forbid ! '
Parsing [sent. 14345 len. 69]: By this time , Mrs Gamp -LRB- for it was no other than that experienced practitioner -RRB- had , with Tom 's assistance , squeezed and worked herself into a small corner between Ruth and the rail ; where , after breathing very hard for some little time , and performing a short series of dangerous evolutions with her umbrella , she managed to establish herself pretty comfortably .
Parsing [sent. 14346 len. 16]: ` And which of all them smoking monsters is the Ankworks boat , I wonder .
Parsing [sent. 14347 len. 4]: Goodness me ! '
Parsing [sent. 14348 len. 4]: cried Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 14349 len. 8]: ` What boat did you want ? '
Parsing [sent. 14350 len. 3]: asked Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 14351 len. 11]: ` The Ankworks package , ' Mrs Gamp replied . '
Parsing [sent. 14352 len. 9]: I will not deceive you , my sweet .
Parsing [sent. 14353 len. 5]: Why should I ? '
Parsing [sent. 14354 len. 14]: ` That is the Antwerp packet in the middle , ' said Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 14355 len. 32]: ` And I wish it was in Jonadge 's belly , I do , ' cried Mrs Gamp ; appearing to confound the prophet with the whale in this miraculous aspiration .
Parsing [sent. 14356 len. 56]: Ruth said nothing in reply ; but , as Mrs Gamp , laying her chin against the cool iron of the rail , continued to look intently at the Antwerp boat , and every now and then to give a little groan , she inquired whether any child of hers was going aboard that morning ?
Parsing [sent. 14357 len. 9]: Or perhaps her husband , she said kindly .
Parsing [sent. 14358 len. 33]: ` Which shows , ' said Mrs Gamp , casting up her eyes , ` what a little way you 've travelled into this wale of life , my dear young creetur !
Parsing [sent. 14359 len. 56]: As a good friend of mine has frequent made remark to me , which her name , my love , is Harris , Mrs Harris through the square and up the steps a-turnin ' round by the tobacker shop , `` Oh Sairey , Sairey , little do we know wot lays afore us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14360 len. 24]: `` Mrs Harris , ma'am , '' I says , `` not much , it 's true , but more than you suppoge .
Parsing [sent. 14361 len. 37]: Our calcilations , ma'am , '' I says , `` respectin ' wot the number of a family will be , comes most times within one , and oftener than you would suppoge , exact . ''
Parsing [sent. 14362 len. 23]: `` Sairey , '' says Mrs Harris , in a awful way , `` Tell me wot is my indiwidgle number . ''
Parsing [sent. 14363 len. 20]: `` No , Mrs Harris , '' I says to her , `` ex-cuge me , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 14364 len. 36]: My own , '' I says , `` has fallen out of three-pair backs , and had damp doorsteps settled on their lungs , and one was turned up smilin ' in a bedstead unbeknown .
Parsing [sent. 14365 len. 26]: Therefore , ma'am , '' I says , `` seek not to proticipate , but take 'em as they come and as they go . ''
Parsing [sent. 14366 len. 18]: Mine , ' says Mrs Gamp , ` mine is all gone , my dear young chick .
Parsing [sent. 14367 len. 51]: And as to husbands , there 's a wooden leg gone likeways home to its account , which in its constancy of walkin ' into wine vaults , and never comin ' out again 'till fetched by force , was quite as weak as flesh , if not weaker . '
Parsing [sent. 14368 len. 33]: When she had delivered this oration , Mrs Gamp leaned her chin upon the cool iron again ; and looking intently at the Antwerp packet , shook her head and groaned . '
Parsing [sent. 14369 len. 25]: I would n't , ' said Mrs Gamp , ' I would n't be a man and have such a think upon my mind !
Parsing [sent. 14370 len. 15]: -- but nobody as owned the name of man , could do it ! '
Parsing [sent. 14371 len. 27]: Tom and his sister glanced at each other ; and Ruth , after a moment 's hesitation , asked Mrs Gamp what troubled her so much .
Parsing [sent. 14372 len. 23]: ` My dear , ' returned that lady , dropping her voice , ` you are single , ai n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 14373 len. 10]: Ruth laughed blushed , and said ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 14374 len. 14]: ` Worse luck , ' proceeded Mrs Gamp , ` for all parties !
Parsing [sent. 14375 len. 46]: But others is married , and in the marriage state ; and there is a dear young creetur a-comin ' down this mornin ' to that very package , which is no more fit to trust herself to sea , than nothin ' is ! '
Parsing [sent. 14376 len. 28]: She paused here to look over the deck of the packet in question , and on the steps leading down to it , and on the gangways .
Parsing [sent. 14377 len. 43]: Seeming to have thus assured herself that the object of her commiseration had not yet arrived , she raised her eyes gradually up to the top of the escape-pipe , and indignantly apostrophised the vessel : ` Oh , drat you ! '
Parsing [sent. 14378 len. 35]: said Mrs Gamp , shaking her umbrella at it , ` you 're a nice spluttering nisy monster for a delicate young creetur to go and be a passinger by ; ai n't you !
Parsing [sent. 14379 len. 12]: YOU never do no harm in that way , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 14380 len. 16]: With your hammering , and roaring , and hissing , and lamp-iling , you brute !
Parsing [sent. 14381 len. 57]: Them Confugion steamers , ' said Mrs Gamp , shaking her umbrella again , ` has done more to throw us out of our reg ` lar work and bring ewents on at times when nobody counted on 'em -LRB- especially them screeching railroad ones -RRB- , than all the other frights that ever was took .
Parsing [sent. 14382 len. 73]: I have heerd of one young man , a guard upon a railway , only three years opened -- well does Mrs Harris know him , which indeed he is her own relation by her sister 's marriage with a master sawyer -- as is godfather at this present time to six-and-twenty blessed little strangers , equally unexpected , and all on ` um named after the Ingeines as was the cause .
Parsing [sent. 14383 len. 3]: Ugh ! '
Parsing [sent. 14384 len. 38]: said Mrs Gamp , resuming her apostrophe , ` one might easy know you was a man 's inwention , from your disregardlessness of the weakness of our naturs , so one might , you brute ! '
Parsing [sent. 14385 len. 30]: It would not have been unnatural to suppose , from the first part of Mrs Gamp 's lamentations , that she was connected with the stage-coaching or post-horsing trade .
Parsing [sent. 14386 len. 35]: She had no means of judging of the effect of her concluding remarks upon her young companion ; for she interrupted herself at this point , and exclaimed : ` There she identically goes !
Parsing [sent. 14387 len. 16]: Poor sweet young creetur , there she goes , like a lamb to the sacrifige !
Parsing [sent. 14388 len. 34]: If there 's any illness when that wessel gets to sea , ' said Mrs Gamp , prophetically , ` it 's murder , and I 'm the witness for the persecution . '
Parsing [sent. 14389 len. 31]: She was so very earnest on the subject , that Tom 's sister -LRB- being as kind as Tom himself -RRB- could not help saying something to her in reply .
Parsing [sent. 14390 len. 22]: ` Pray , which is the lady , ' she inquired , ` in whom you are so much interested ? '
Parsing [sent. 14391 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 14392 len. 4]: groaned Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 14393 len. 5]: ` There she goes !
Parsing [sent. 14394 len. 10]: A-crossin ' the little wooden bridge at this minute .
Parsing [sent. 14395 len. 11]: She 's a-slippin ' on a bit of orangepeel ! '
Parsing [sent. 14396 len. 5]: tightly clutching her umbrella .
Parsing [sent. 14397 len. 9]: ` What a turn it give me . '
Parsing [sent. 14398 len. 31]: ` Do you mean the lady who is with that man wrapped up from head to foot in a large cloak , so that his face is almost hidden ? '
Parsing [sent. 14399 len. 8]: ` Well he may hide it ! '
Parsing [sent. 14400 len. 4]: Mrs Gamp replied .
Parsing [sent. 14401 len. 11]: ` He 's good call to be ashamed of himself .
Parsing [sent. 14402 len. 12]: Did you see him a-jerking of her wrist , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 14403 len. 12]: ` He seems to be hasty with her , indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 14404 len. 14]: ` Now he 's a-taking of her down into the close cabin ! '
Parsing [sent. 14405 len. 6]: said Mrs Gamp , impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 14406 len. 7]: ` What 's the man about !
Parsing [sent. 14407 len. 9]: The deuce is in him , I think .
Parsing [sent. 14408 len. 12]: Why ca n't he leave her in the open air ? '
Parsing [sent. 14409 len. 46]: He did not , whatever his reason was , but led her quickly down and disappeared himself , without loosening his cloak , or pausing on the crowded deck one moment longer than was necessary to clear their way to that part of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 14410 len. 19]: Tom had not heard this little dialogue ; for his attention had been engaged in an unexpected manner .
Parsing [sent. 14411 len. 45]: A hand upon his sleeve had caused him to look round , just when Mrs Gamp concluded her apostrophe to the steam-engine ; and on his right arm , Ruth being on his left , he found their landlord , to his great surprise .
Parsing [sent. 14412 len. 62]: He was not so much surprised at the man 's being there , as at his having got close to him so quietly and swiftly ; for another person had been at his elbow one instant before ; and he had not in the meantime been conscious of any change or pressure in the knot of people among whom he stood .
Parsing [sent. 14413 len. 38]: He and Ruth had frequently remarked how noiselessly this landlord of theirs came into and went out of his own house ; but Tom was not the less amazed to see him at his elbow now . '
Parsing [sent. 14414 len. 16]: I beg your pardon , Mr Pinch , ' he said in his ear . '
Parsing [sent. 14415 len. 18]: I am rather infirm , and out of breath , and my eyes are not very good .
Parsing [sent. 14416 len. 11]: I am not as young as I was , sir .
Parsing [sent. 14417 len. 34]: You do n't see a gentleman in a large cloak down yonder , with a lady on his arm ; a lady in a veil and a black shawl ; do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 14418 len. 49]: If HE did not , it was curious that in speaking he should have singled out from all the crowd the very people whom he described ; and should have glanced hastily from them to Tom , as if he were burning to direct his wandering eyes . '
Parsing [sent. 14419 len. 8]: A gentleman in a large cloak ! '
Parsing [sent. 14420 len. 12]: said Tom , ` and a lady in a black shawl !
Parsing [sent. 14421 len. 5]: Let me see ! '
Parsing [sent. 14422 len. 6]: ` Yes , yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 14423 len. 9]: replied the other , with keen impatience . '
Parsing [sent. 14424 len. 35]: A gentleman muffled up from head to foot -- strangely muffled up for such a morning as this -- like an invalid , with his hand to his face at this minute , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 14425 len. 6]: No , no , no !
Parsing [sent. 14426 len. 25]: not there , ' he added , following Tom 's gaze ; ` the other way ; in that direction ; down yonder . '
Parsing [sent. 14427 len. 32]: Again he indicated , but this time in his hurry , with his outstretched finger , the very spot on which the progress of these persons was checked at that moment .
Parsing [sent. 14428 len. 51]: ` There are so many people , and so much motion , and so many objects , ' said Tom , ` that I find it difficult to -- no , I really do n't see a gentleman in a large cloak , and a lady in a black shawl .
Parsing [sent. 14429 len. 12]: There 's a lady in a red shawl over there ! '
Parsing [sent. 14430 len. 8]: ` No , no , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 14431 len. 12]: cried his landlord , pointing eagerly again , ` not there .
Parsing [sent. 14432 len. 8]: The other way ; the other way .
Parsing [sent. 14433 len. 6]: Look at the cabin steps .
Parsing [sent. 14434 len. 4]: To the left .
Parsing [sent. 14435 len. 8]: They must be near the cabin steps .
Parsing [sent. 14436 len. 7]: Do you see the cabin steps ?
Parsing [sent. 14437 len. 7]: There 's the bell ringing already !
Parsing [sent. 14438 len. 7]: DO you see the steps ? '
Parsing [sent. 14439 len. 4]: ` Stay ! '
Parsing [sent. 14440 len. 8]: said Tom , ` you 're right .
Parsing [sent. 14441 len. 2]: Look !
Parsing [sent. 14442 len. 5]: there they go now .
Parsing [sent. 14443 len. 7]: Is that the gentleman you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 14444 len. 18]: Descending at this minute , with the folds of a great cloak trailing down after him ? '
Parsing [sent. 14445 len. 6]: ` The very man ! '
Parsing [sent. 14446 len. 21]: returned the other , not looking at what Tom pointed out , however , but at Tom 's own face .
Parsing [sent. 14447 len. 14]: ` Will you do me a kindness , sir , a great kindness ?
Parsing [sent. 14448 len. 9]: Will you put that letter in his hand ?
Parsing [sent. 14449 len. 5]: Only give him that !
Parsing [sent. 14450 len. 4]: He expects it .
Parsing [sent. 14451 len. 47]: I am charged to do it by my employers , but I am late in finding him , and , not being as young as I have been , should never be able to make my way on board and off the deck again in time .
Parsing [sent. 14452 len. 14]: Will you pardon my boldness , and do me that great kindness ? '
Parsing [sent. 14453 len. 37]: His hands shook , and his face bespoke the utmost interest and agitation , as he pressed the letter upon Tom , and pointed to its destination , like the Tempter in some grim old carving .
Parsing [sent. 14454 len. 18]: To hesitate in the performance of a good-natured or compassionate office was not in Tom 's way .
Parsing [sent. 14455 len. 31]: He took the letter ; whispered Ruth to wait till he returned , which would be immediately ; and ran down the steps with all the expedition he could make .
Parsing [sent. 14456 len. 63]: There were so many people going down , so many others coming up , such heavy goods in course of transit to and fro , such a ringing of bell , blowing-off of steam , and shouting of men 's voices , that he had much ado to force his way , or keep in mind to which boat he was going .
Parsing [sent. 14457 len. 48]: But he reached the right one with good speed , and going down the cabin-stairs immediately , described the object of his search standing at the upper end of the saloon , with his back towards him , reading some notice which was hung against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 14458 len. 19]: As Tom advanced to give him the letter , he started , hearing footsteps , and turned round .
Parsing [sent. 14459 len. 27]: What was Tom 's astonishment to find in him the man with whom he had had the conflict in the field -- poor Mercy 's husband .
Parsing [sent. 14460 len. 2]: Jonas !
Parsing [sent. 14461 len. 31]: Tom understood him to say , what the devil did he want ; but it was not easy to make out what he said ; he spoke so indistinctly . '
Parsing [sent. 14462 len. 27]: I want nothing with you for myself , ' said Tom ; ' I was asked , a moment since , to give you this letter .
Parsing [sent. 14463 len. 18]: You were pointed out to me , but I did n't know you in your strange dress .
Parsing [sent. 14464 len. 4]: Take it ! '
Parsing [sent. 14465 len. 15]: He did so , opened it , and read the writing on the inside .
Parsing [sent. 14466 len. 26]: The contents were evidently very brief ; not more perhaps than one line ; but they struck upon him like a stone from a sling .
Parsing [sent. 14467 len. 7]: He reeled back as he read .
Parsing [sent. 14468 len. 17]: His emotion was so different from any Tom had ever seen before that he stopped involuntarily .
Parsing [sent. 14469 len. 34]: Momentary as his state of indecision was , the bell ceased while he stood there , and a hoarse voice calling down the steps , inquired if there was any to go ashore ?
Parsing [sent. 14470 len. 14]: ` Yes , ' cried Jonas , ` I -- I am coming .
Parsing [sent. 14471 len. 4]: Give me time .
Parsing [sent. 14472 len. 5]: Where 's that woman !
Parsing [sent. 14473 len. 8]: Come back ; come back here . '
Parsing [sent. 14474 len. 19]: He threw open another door as he spoke , and dragged , rather than led , her forth .
Parsing [sent. 14475 len. 39]: She was pale and frightened , and amazed to see her old acquaintance ; but had no time to speak , for they were making a great stir above ; and Jonas drew her rapidly towards the deck .
Parsing [sent. 14476 len. 6]: ` Where are we going ?
Parsing [sent. 14477 len. 6]: What is the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 14478 len. 11]: ` We are going back , ' said Jonas . '
Parsing [sent. 14479 len. 6]: I have changed my mind .
Parsing [sent. 14480 len. 5]: I ca n't go .
Parsing [sent. 14481 len. 19]: Do n't question me , or I shall be the death of you , or some one else .
Parsing [sent. 14482 len. 3]: Stop there !
Parsing [sent. 14483 len. 2]: Stop !
Parsing [sent. 14484 len. 6]: We 're for the shore .
Parsing [sent. 14485 len. 4]: Do you hear ?
Parsing [sent. 14486 len. 7]: We 're for the shore ! '
Parsing [sent. 14487 len. 25]: He turned , even in the madness of his hurry , and scowling darkly back at Tom , shook his clenched hand at him .
Parsing [sent. 14488 len. 17]: There are not many human faces capable of the expression with which he accompanied that gesture .
Parsing [sent. 14489 len. 10]: He dragged her up , and Tom followed them .
Parsing [sent. 14490 len. 43]: Across the deck , over the side , along the crazy plank , and up the steps , he dragged her fiercely ; not bestowing any look on her , but gazing upwards all the while among the faces on the wharf .
Parsing [sent. 14491 len. 20]: Suddenly he turned again , and said to Tom with a tremendous oath : ` Where is he ? '
Parsing [sent. 14492 len. 34]: Before Tom , in his indignation and amazement , could return an answer to a question he so little understood , a gentleman approached Tom behind , and saluted Jonas Chuzzlewit by name .
Parsing [sent. 14493 len. 33]: He has a gentleman of foreign appearance , with a black moustache and whiskers ; and addressed him with a polite composure , strangely different from his own distracted and desperate manner .
Parsing [sent. 14494 len. 8]: ` Chuzzlewit , my good fellow ! '
Parsing [sent. 14495 len. 22]: said the gentleman , raising his hat in compliment to Mrs Chuzzlewit , ' I ask your pardon twenty thousand times .
Parsing [sent. 14496 len. 66]: I am most unwilling to interfere between you and a domestic trip of this nature -LRB- always so very charming and refreshing , I know , although I have not the happiness to be a domestic man myself , which is the great infelicity of my existence -RRB- ; but the beehive , my dear friend , the beehive -- will you introduce me ? '
Parsing [sent. 14497 len. 17]: ` This is Mr Montague , ' said Jonas , whom the words appeared to choke .
Parsing [sent. 14498 len. 42]: ` The most unhappy and most penitent of men , Mrs Chuzzlewit , ' pursued that gentleman , ` for having been the means of spoiling this excursion ; but as I tell my friend , the beehive , the beehive .
Parsing [sent. 14499 len. 16]: You projected a short little continental trip , my dear friend , of course ? '
Parsing [sent. 14500 len. 6]: Jonas maintained a dogged silence .
Parsing [sent. 14501 len. 15]: ` May I die , ' cried Montague , ` but I am shocked !
Parsing [sent. 14502 len. 7]: Upon my soul I am shocked .
Parsing [sent. 14503 len. 32]: But that confounded beehive of ours in the city must be paramount to every other consideration , when there is honey to be made ; and that is my best excuse .
Parsing [sent. 14504 len. 38]: Here is a very singular old female dropping curtseys on my right , ' said Montague , breaking off in his discourse , and looking at Mrs Gamp , ` who is not a friend of mine .
Parsing [sent. 14505 len. 6]: Does anybody know her ? '
Parsing [sent. 14506 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 14507 len. 11]: Well they knows me , bless their precious hearts ! '
Parsing [sent. 14508 len. 22]: said Mrs Gamp , ` not forgettin ' your own merry one , sir , and long may it be so !
Parsing [sent. 14509 len. 56]: Wishin ' as every one ' -LRB- she delivered this in the form of a toast or sentiment -RRB- ` was as merry , and as handsome-lookin ' , as a little bird has whispered me a certain gent is , which I will not name for fear I give offence where none is doo !
Parsing [sent. 14510 len. 33]: My precious lady , ' here she stopped short in her merriment , for she had until now affected to be vastly entertained , ` you 're too pale by half ! '
Parsing [sent. 14511 len. 10]: ` YOU are here too , are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 14512 len. 3]: muttered Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 14513 len. 11]: ` Ecod , there are enough of you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14514 len. 34]: I hope , sir , ' returned Mrs Gamp , dropping an indignant curtsey , ` as no bones is broke by me and Mrs Harris a-walkin ' down upon a public wharf .
Parsing [sent. 14515 len. 39]: Which was the very words she says to me -LRB- although they was the last I ever had to speak -RRB- was these : `` Sairey , '' she says , `` is it a public wharf ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14516 len. 14]: Mrs Harris , '' I makes answer , `` can you doubt it ?
Parsing [sent. 14517 len. 39]: You have know 'd me now , ma'am , eight and thirty year ; and did you ever know me go , or wish to go , where I was not made welcome , say the words . ''
Parsing [sent. 14518 len. 15]: `` No , Sairey , '' Mrs Harris says , `` contrairy quite . ''
Parsing [sent. 14519 len. 7]: And well she knows it too .
Parsing [sent. 14520 len. 23]: I am but a poor woman , but I 've been sought after , sir , though you may not think it .
Parsing [sent. 14521 len. 28]: I 've been knocked up at all hours of the night , and warned out by a many landlords , in consequence of being mistook for Fire .
Parsing [sent. 14522 len. 31]: I goes out workin ' for my bread , 't is true , but I maintains my independency , with your kind leave , and which I will till death .
Parsing [sent. 14523 len. 69]: I has my feelins as a woman , sir , and I have been a mother likeways ; but touch a pipkin as belongs to me , or make the least remarks on what I eats or drinks , and though you was the favouritest young for ` ard hussy of a servant-gal as ever come into a house , either you leaves the place , or me .
Parsing [sent. 14524 len. 16]: My earnins is not great , sir , but I will not be impoged upon .
Parsing [sent. 14525 len. 42]: Bless the babe , and save the mother , is my mortar , sir ; but I makes so free as add to that , Do n't try no impogician with the Nuss , for she will not abear it ! '
Parsing [sent. 14526 len. 30]: Mrs Gamp concluded by drawing her shawl tightly over herself with both hands , and , as usual , referring to Mrs Harris for full corroboration of these particulars .
Parsing [sent. 14527 len. 39]: She had that peculiar trembling of the head which , in ladies of her excitable nature , may be taken as a sure indication of their breaking out again very shortly ; when Jonas made a timely interposition .
Parsing [sent. 14528 len. 23]: ` As you ARE here , ' he said , ` you had better see to her , and take her home .
Parsing [sent. 14529 len. 6]: I am otherwise engaged . '
Parsing [sent. 14530 len. 24]: He said nothing more ; but looked at Montague as if to give him notice that he was ready to attend him . '
Parsing [sent. 14531 len. 12]: I am sorry to take you away , ' said Montague .
Parsing [sent. 14532 len. 23]: Jonas gave him a sinister look , which long lived in Tom 's memory , and which he often recalled afterwards . '
Parsing [sent. 14533 len. 11]: I am , upon my life , ' said Montague .
Parsing [sent. 14534 len. 9]: ` Why did you make it necessary ? '
Parsing [sent. 14535 len. 26]: With the same dark glance as before , Jonas replied , after a moment 's silence : ` The necessity is none of my making .
Parsing [sent. 14536 len. 8]: You have brought it about yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 14537 len. 5]: He said nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 14538 len. 34]: He said even this as if he were bound , and in the other 's power , but had a sullen and suppressed devil within him , which he could not quite resist .
Parsing [sent. 14539 len. 43]: His very gait , as they walked away together , was like that of a fettered man ; but , striving to work out at his clenched hands , knitted brows , and fast-set lips , was the same imprisoned devil still .
Parsing [sent. 14540 len. 15]: They got into a handsome cabriolet which was waiting for them and drove away .
Parsing [sent. 14541 len. 43]: The whole of this extraordinary scene had passed so rapidly and the tumult which prevailed around as so unconscious of any impression from it , that , although Tom had been one of the chief actors , it was like a dream .
Parsing [sent. 14542 len. 12]: No one had noticed him after they had left the packet .
Parsing [sent. 14543 len. 21]: He had stood behind Jonas , and so near him , that he could not help hearing all that passed .
Parsing [sent. 14544 len. 30]: He had stood there , with his sister on his arm , expecting and hoping to have an opportunity of explaining his strange share in this yet stranger business .
Parsing [sent. 14545 len. 36]: But Jonas had not raised his eyes from the ground ; no one else had even looked towards him ; and before he could resolve on any course of action , they were all gone .
Parsing [sent. 14546 len. 7]: He gazed round for his landlord .
Parsing [sent. 14547 len. 19]: But he had done that more than once already , and no such man was to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 14548 len. 33]: He was still pursuing this search with his eyes , when he saw a hand beckoning to him from a hackney-coach ; and hurrying towards it , found it was Merry 's .
Parsing [sent. 14549 len. 25]: She addressed him hurriedly , but bent out of the window , that she might not be overheard by her companion , Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 14550 len. 6]: ` What is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 14551 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 14552 len. 8]: ` Good heaven , what is it ?
Parsing [sent. 14553 len. 24]: Why did he tell me last night to prepare for a long journey , and why have you brought us back like criminals ?
Parsing [sent. 14554 len. 5]: Dear Mr Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 14555 len. 12]: she clasped her hands distractedly , ` be merciful to us .
Parsing [sent. 14556 len. 16]: Whatever this dreadful secret is , be merciful , and God will bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 14557 len. 25]: ` If any power of mercy lay with me , ' cried Tom , ` trust me , you should n't ask in vain .
Parsing [sent. 14558 len. 12]: But I am far more ignorant and weak than you . '
Parsing [sent. 14559 len. 49]: She withdrew into the coach again , and he saw the hand waving towards him for a moment ; but whether in reproachfulness or incredulity or misery , or grief , or sad adieu , or what else , he could not , being so hurried , understand .
Parsing [sent. 14560 len. 18]: SHE was gone now ; and Ruth and he were left to walk away , and wonder .
Parsing [sent. 14561 len. 19]: Had Mr Nadgett appointed the man who never came , to meet him upon London Bridge that morning ?
Parsing [sent. 14562 len. 17]: He was certainly looking over the parapet , and down upon the steamboat-wharf at that moment .
Parsing [sent. 14563 len. 13]: It could not have been for pleasure ; he never took pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 14564 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 14565 len. 8]: He must have had some business there .
Parsing [sent. 14566 len. 55]: CHAPTER FORTY -- ONE MR JONAS AND HIS FRIEND , ARRIVING AT A PLEASANT UNDERSTANDING , SET FORTH UPON AN ENTERPRISE The office of the Anglo -- Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance Company being near at hand , and Mr Montague driving Jonas straight there , they had very little way to go .
Parsing [sent. 14567 len. 58]: But the journey might have been one of several hours ' duration , without provoking a remark from either ; for it was clear that Jonas did not mean to break the silence which prevailed between them , and that it was not , as yet , his dear friend 's cue to tempt them into conversation .
Parsing [sent. 14568 len. 42]: He had thrown aside his cloak , as having now no motive for concealment , and with that garment huddled on his knees , sat as far removed from his companion as the limited space in such a carriage would allow .
Parsing [sent. 14569 len. 47]: There was a striking difference in his manner , compared with what it had been , within a few minutes , when Tom encountered him so unexpectedly on board the packet , or when the ugly change had fallen on him in Mr Montague 's dressing-room .
Parsing [sent. 14570 len. 42]: He had the aspect of a man found out and held at bay ; of being baffled , hunted , and beset ; but there was now a dawning and increasing purpose in his face , which changed it very much .
Parsing [sent. 14571 len. 59]: It was gloomy , distrustful , lowering ; pale with anger and defeat ; it still was humbled , abject , cowardly and mean ; but , let the conflict go on as it would , there was one strong purpose wrestling with every emotion of his mind , and casting the whole series down as they arose .
Parsing [sent. 14572 len. 22]: Not prepossessing in appearance at the best of times , it may be readily supposed that he was not so now .
Parsing [sent. 14573 len. 37]: He had left deep marks of his front teeth in his nether lip ; and those tokens of the agitation he had lately undergone improved his looks as little as the heavy corrugations in his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 14574 len. 46]: But he was self-possessed now ; unnaturally self-possessed , indeed , as men quite otherwise than brave are known to be in desperate extremities ; and when the carriage stopped , he waited for no invitation , but leapt hardily out , and went upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 14575 len. 23]: The chairman followed him ; and closing the board-room door as soon as they had entered , threw himself upon a sofa .
Parsing [sent. 14576 len. 25]: Jonas stood before the window , looking down into the street ; and leaned against the sash , resting his head upon his arms .
Parsing [sent. 14577 len. 9]: ` This is not handsome , Chuzzlewit ! '
Parsing [sent. 14578 len. 5]: said Montague at length .
Parsing [sent. 14579 len. 8]: ` Not handsome upon my soul ! '
Parsing [sent. 14580 len. 9]: ` What would you have me do ? '
Parsing [sent. 14581 len. 14]: he answered , looking round abruptly ; ` What do you expect ? '
Parsing [sent. 14582 len. 7]: ` Confidence , my good fellow .
Parsing [sent. 14583 len. 4]: Some confidence ! '
Parsing [sent. 14584 len. 7]: said Montague in an injured tone .
Parsing [sent. 14585 len. 3]: ` Ecod !
Parsing [sent. 14586 len. 11]: You show great confidence in me , ' retorted Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 14587 len. 6]: ` Do n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 14588 len. 6]: ` Do I not ? '
Parsing [sent. 14589 len. 19]: said his companion , raising his head , and looking at him , but he had turned again .
Parsing [sent. 14590 len. 5]: ` Do I not ?
Parsing [sent. 14591 len. 31]: Have I not confided to you the easy schemes I have formed for our advantage ; OUR advantage , mind ; not mine alone ; and what is my return ?
Parsing [sent. 14592 len. 4]: Attempted flight ! '
Parsing [sent. 14593 len. 7]: ` How do you know that ?
Parsing [sent. 14594 len. 8]: Who said I meant to fly ? '
Parsing [sent. 14595 len. 4]: ` Who said ?
Parsing [sent. 14596 len. 4]: Come , come .
Parsing [sent. 14597 len. 18]: A foreign boat , my friend , an early hour , a figure wrapped up for disguise !
Parsing [sent. 14598 len. 3]: Who said ?
Parsing [sent. 14599 len. 14]: If you did n't mean to jilt me , why were you there ?
Parsing [sent. 14600 len. 17]: If you did n't mean to jilt me , why did you come back ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 14601 len. 14]: I came back , ' said Jonas , ` to avoid disturbance . '
Parsing [sent. 14602 len. 10]: ` You were wise , ' rejoined his friend .
Parsing [sent. 14603 len. 20]: Jonas stood quite silent ; still looking down into the street , and resting his head upon his arms .
Parsing [sent. 14604 len. 21]: ` Now , Chuzzlewit , ' said Montague , ` notwithstanding what has passed I will be plain with you .
Parsing [sent. 14605 len. 7]: Are you attending to me there ?
Parsing [sent. 14606 len. 8]: I only see your back . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14607 len. 4]: I hear you .
Parsing [sent. 14608 len. 5]: Go on ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 14609 len. 16]: I say that notwithstanding what has passed , I will be plain with you . '
Parsing [sent. 14610 len. 6]: ` You said that before .
Parsing [sent. 14611 len. 12]: And I have told you once I heard you say it .
Parsing [sent. 14612 len. 4]: Go on . '
Parsing [sent. 14613 len. 28]: ` You are a little chafed , but I can make allowance for that , and am , fortunately , myself in the very best of tempers .
Parsing [sent. 14614 len. 9]: Now , let us see how circumstances stand .
Parsing [sent. 14615 len. 31]: A day or two ago , I mentioned to you , my dear fellow , that I thought I had discovered -- ' ` Will you hold your tongue ? '
Parsing [sent. 14616 len. 13]: said Jonas , looking fiercely round , and glancing at the door .
Parsing [sent. 14617 len. 6]: ` Well , well ! '
Parsing [sent. 14618 len. 3]: said Montague .
Parsing [sent. 14619 len. 3]: ` Judicious !
Parsing [sent. 14620 len. 3]: Quite correct !
Parsing [sent. 14621 len. 25]: My discoveries being published , would be like many other men 's discoveries in this honest world ; of no further use to me .
Parsing [sent. 14622 len. 21]: You see , Chuzzlewit , how ingenuous and frank I am in showing you the weakness of my own position !
Parsing [sent. 14623 len. 3]: To return .
Parsing [sent. 14624 len. 43]: I make , or think I make , a certain discovery which I take an early opportunity of mentioning in your ear , in that spirit of confidence which I really hoped did prevail between us , and was reciprocated by you .
Parsing [sent. 14625 len. 12]: Perhaps there is something in it ; perhaps there is nothing .
Parsing [sent. 14626 len. 10]: I have my knowledge and opinion on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 14627 len. 4]: You have yours .
Parsing [sent. 14628 len. 7]: We will not discuss the question .
Parsing [sent. 14629 len. 27]: But , my good fellow , you have been weak ; what I wish to point out to you is , that you have been weak .
Parsing [sent. 14630 len. 41]: I may desire to turn this little incident to my account -LRB- indeed , I do -- I 'll not deny it -RRB- , but my account does not lie in probing it , or using it against you . '
Parsing [sent. 14631 len. 11]: ` What do you call using it against me ? '
Parsing [sent. 14632 len. 11]: asked Jonas , who had not yet changed his attitude .
Parsing [sent. 14633 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 14634 len. 7]: said Montague , with a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 14635 len. 9]: ` We 'll not enter into that . '
Parsing [sent. 14636 len. 10]: ` Using it to make a beggar of me .
Parsing [sent. 14637 len. 8]: Is that the use you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 14638 len. 4]: ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 14639 len. 9]: ` Ecod , ' muttered Jonas , bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 14640 len. 12]: ` That 's the use in which your account DOES lie .
Parsing [sent. 14641 len. 8]: You speak the truth there . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14642 len. 30]: I wish you to venture -LRB- it 's a very safe venture -RRB- a little more with us , certainly , and to keep quiet , ' said Montague .
Parsing [sent. 14643 len. 11]: ` You promised me you would ; and you must .
Parsing [sent. 14644 len. 10]: I say it plainly , Chuzzlewit , you MUST .
Parsing [sent. 14645 len. 4]: Reason the matter .
Parsing [sent. 14646 len. 41]: If you do n't , my secret is worthless to me : and being so , it may as well become the public property as mine ; better , for I shall gain some credit , bringing it to light .
Parsing [sent. 14647 len. 21]: I want you , besides , to act as a decoy in a case I have already told you of .
Parsing [sent. 14648 len. 9]: You do n't mind that , I know .
Parsing [sent. 14649 len. 38]: You care nothing for the man -LRB- you care nothing for any man ; you are too sharp ; so am I , I hope -RRB- ; and could bear any loss of his with pious fortitude .
Parsing [sent. 14650 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 14651 len. 10]: You have tried to escape from the first consequence .
Parsing [sent. 14652 len. 10]: You can not escape it , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 14653 len. 7]: I have shown you that to-day .
Parsing [sent. 14654 len. 12]: Now , I am not a moral man , you know .
Parsing [sent. 14655 len. 49]: I am not the least in the world affected by anything you may have done ; by any little indiscretion you may have committed ; but I wish to profit by it if I can ; and to a man of your intelligence I make that free confession .
Parsing [sent. 14656 len. 10]: I am not at all singular in that infirmity .
Parsing [sent. 14657 len. 20]: Everybody profits by the indiscretion of his neighbour ; and the people in the best repute , the most .
Parsing [sent. 14658 len. 8]: Why do you give me this trouble ?
Parsing [sent. 14659 len. 13]: It must come to a friendly agreement , or an unfriendly crash .
Parsing [sent. 14660 len. 3]: It must .
Parsing [sent. 14661 len. 10]: If the former , you are very little hurt .
Parsing [sent. 14662 len. 6]: If the latter -- well !
Parsing [sent. 14663 len. 11]: you know best what is likely to happen then . '
Parsing [sent. 14664 len. 12]: Jonas left the window , and walked up close to him .
Parsing [sent. 14665 len. 46]: He did not look him in the face ; it was not his habit to do that ; but he kept his eyes towards him -- on his breast , or thereabouts -- and was at great pains to speak slowly and distinctly in reply .
Parsing [sent. 14666 len. 13]: Just as a man in a state of conscious drunkenness might be .
Parsing [sent. 14667 len. 13]: ` Lying is of no use now , ' he said . '
Parsing [sent. 14668 len. 20]: I DID think of getting away this morning , and making better terms with you from a distance . '
Parsing [sent. 14669 len. 5]: ` To be sure !
Parsing [sent. 14670 len. 5]: to be sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 14671 len. 3]: replied Montague .
Parsing [sent. 14672 len. 5]: ` Nothing more natural .
Parsing [sent. 14673 len. 9]: I foresaw that , and provided against it .
Parsing [sent. 14674 len. 10]: But I am afraid I am interrupting you . '
Parsing [sent. 14675 len. 35]: ` How the devil , ' pursued Jonas , with a still greater effort , ` you made choice of your messenger , and where you found him , I 'll not ask you .
Parsing [sent. 14676 len. 9]: I owed him one good turn before to-day .
Parsing [sent. 14677 len. 49]: If you are so careless of men in general , as you said you were just now , you are quite indifferent to what becomes of such a crop-tailed cur as that , and will leave me to settle my account with him in my own manner . '
Parsing [sent. 14678 len. 26]: If he had raised his eyes to his companion 's face , he would have seen that Montague was evidently unable to comprehend his meaning .
Parsing [sent. 14679 len. 35]: But continuing to stand before him , with his furtive gaze directed as before , and pausing here only to moisten his dry lips with his tongue , the fact was lost upon him .
Parsing [sent. 14680 len. 30]: It might have struck a close observer that this fixed and steady glance of Jonas 's was a part of the alteration which had taken place in his demeanour .
Parsing [sent. 14681 len. 53]: He kept it riveted on one spot , with which his thoughts had manifestly nothing to do ; like as a juggler walking on a cord or wire to any dangerous end , holds some object in his sight to steady him , and never wanders from it , lest he trip .
Parsing [sent. 14682 len. 15]: Montague was quick in his rejoinder , though he made it at a venture .
Parsing [sent. 14683 len. 15]: There was no difference of opinion between him and his friend on THAT point .
Parsing [sent. 14684 len. 4]: Not the least .
Parsing [sent. 14685 len. 33]: ` Your great discovery , ' Jonas proceeded , with a savage sneer that got the better of him for the moment , ` may be true , and may be false .
Parsing [sent. 14686 len. 16]: Whichever it is , I dare say I 'm no worse than other men . '
Parsing [sent. 14687 len. 9]: ` Not a bit , ' said Tigg .
Parsing [sent. 14688 len. 5]: ` Not a bit .
Parsing [sent. 14689 len. 11]: We 're all alike -- or nearly so . ' '
Parsing [sent. 14690 len. 19]: I want to know this , ' Jonas went on to say ; ` is it your own ?
Parsing [sent. 14691 len. 11]: You 'll not wonder at my asking the question . '
Parsing [sent. 14692 len. 5]: ` My own ! '
Parsing [sent. 14693 len. 3]: repeated Montague .
Parsing [sent. 14694 len. 4]: ` Aye ! '
Parsing [sent. 14695 len. 6]: returned the other , gruffly .
Parsing [sent. 14696 len. 8]: ` Is it known to anybody else ?
Parsing [sent. 14697 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 14698 len. 7]: Do n't waver about that . '
Parsing [sent. 14699 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 14700 len. 8]: said Montague , without the smallest hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 14701 len. 20]: ` What would it be worth , do you think , unless I had the keeping of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 14702 len. 12]: Now , for the first time , Jonas looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 14703 len. 20]: After a pause , he put out his hand , and said , with a laugh : ` Come !
Parsing [sent. 14704 len. 11]: make things easy to me , and I 'm yours .
Parsing [sent. 14705 len. 25]: I do n't know that I may not be better off here , after all , than if I had gone away this morning .
Parsing [sent. 14706 len. 12]: But here I am , and here I 'll stay now .
Parsing [sent. 14707 len. 5]: Take your oath ! '
Parsing [sent. 14708 len. 24]: He cleared his throat , for he was speaking hoarsely and said in a lighter tone : ` Shall I go to Pecksniff ?
Parsing [sent. 14709 len. 2]: When ?
Parsing [sent. 14710 len. 4]: Say when ! '
Parsing [sent. 14711 len. 4]: ` Immediately ! '
Parsing [sent. 14712 len. 3]: cried Montague .
Parsing [sent. 14713 len. 10]: ` He can not be enticed too soon . '
Parsing [sent. 14714 len. 4]: ` Ecod ! '
Parsing [sent. 14715 len. 8]: cried Jonas , with a wild laugh .
Parsing [sent. 14716 len. 11]: ` There 's some fun in catching that old hypocrite .
Parsing [sent. 14717 len. 4]: I hate him .
Parsing [sent. 14718 len. 6]: Shall I go to-night ? '
Parsing [sent. 14719 len. 3]: ` Aye !
Parsing [sent. 14720 len. 13]: This , ' said Montague , ecstatically , ` is like business !
Parsing [sent. 14721 len. 6]: We understand each other now !
Parsing [sent. 14722 len. 11]: To-night , my good fellow , by all means . '
Parsing [sent. 14723 len. 9]: ` Come with me , ' cried Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 14724 len. 42]: ` We must make a dash ; go down in state , and carry documents , for he 's a deep file to deal with , and must be drawn on with an artful hand , or he 'll not follow .
Parsing [sent. 14725 len. 4]: I know him .
Parsing [sent. 14726 len. 17]: As I ca n't take your lodgings or your dinners down , I must take you .
Parsing [sent. 14727 len. 6]: Will you come to-night ? '
Parsing [sent. 14728 len. 21]: His friend appeared to hesitate ; and neither to have anticipated this proposal , nor to relish it very much .
Parsing [sent. 14729 len. 14]: ` We can concert our plans upon the road , ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 14730 len. 27]: ` We must not go direct to him , but cross over from some other place , and turn out of our way to see him .
Parsing [sent. 14731 len. 17]: I may not want to introduce you , but I must have you on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 14732 len. 10]: I know the man , I tell you . '
Parsing [sent. 14733 len. 10]: ` But what if the man knows me ? '
Parsing [sent. 14734 len. 7]: said Montague , shrugging his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 14735 len. 5]: ` He know ! '
Parsing [sent. 14736 len. 3]: cried Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 14737 len. 13]: ` Do n't you run that risk with fifty men a day !
Parsing [sent. 14738 len. 6]: Would your father know you ?
Parsing [sent. 14739 len. 5]: Did I know you ?
Parsing [sent. 14740 len. 2]: Ecod !
Parsing [sent. 14741 len. 10]: You were another figure when I saw you first .
Parsing [sent. 14742 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 14743 len. 8]: I see the rents and patches now !
Parsing [sent. 14744 len. 9]: No false hair then , no black dye !
Parsing [sent. 14745 len. 13]: You were another sort of joker in those days , you were !
Parsing [sent. 14746 len. 6]: You even spoke different then .
Parsing [sent. 14747 len. 16]: You 've acted the gentleman so seriously since , that you 've taken in yourself .
Parsing [sent. 14748 len. 11]: If he should know you , what does it matter ?
Parsing [sent. 14749 len. 10]: Such a change is a proof of your success .
Parsing [sent. 14750 len. 15]: You know that , or you would not have made yourself known to me .
Parsing [sent. 14751 len. 5]: Will you come ? '
Parsing [sent. 14752 len. 20]: ` My good fellow , ' said Montague , still hesitating , ' I can trust you alone . '
Parsing [sent. 14753 len. 4]: ` Trust me !
Parsing [sent. 14754 len. 11]: Ecod , you may trust me now , far enough .
Parsing [sent. 14755 len. 13]: I 'll try to go away no more -- no more ! '
Parsing [sent. 14756 len. 20]: He stopped , and added in a more sober tone , ' I ca n't get on without you .
Parsing [sent. 14757 len. 6]: Will you come ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 14758 len. 15]: I will , ' said Montague , ` if that 's your opinion . '
Parsing [sent. 14759 len. 7]: And they shook hands upon it .
Parsing [sent. 14760 len. 61]: The boisterous manner which Jonas had exhibited during the latter part of this conversation , and which had gone on rapidly increasing with almost every word he had spoken , from the time when he looked his honourable friend in the face until now , did not now subside , but , remaining at its height , abided by him .
Parsing [sent. 14761 len. 32]: Most unusual with him at any period ; most inconsistent with his temper and constitution ; especially unnatural it would appear in one so darkly circumstanced ; it abided by him .
Parsing [sent. 14762 len. 20]: It was not like the effect of wine , or any ardent drink , for he was perfectly coherent .
Parsing [sent. 14763 len. 52]: It even made him proof against the usual influence of such means of excitement ; for , although he drank deeply several times that day , with no reserve or caution , he remained exactly the same man , and his spirits neither rose nor fell in the least observable degree .
Parsing [sent. 14764 len. 35]: Deciding , after some discussion , to travel at night , in order that the day 's business might not be broken in upon , they took counsel together in reference to the means .
Parsing [sent. 14765 len. 49]: Mr Montague being of opinion that four horses were advisable , at all events for the first stage , as throwing a great deal of dust into people 's eyes , in more senses than one , a travelling chariot and four lay under orders for nine o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 14766 len. 38]: Jonas did not go home ; observing , that his being obliged to leave town on business in so great a hurry , would be a good excuse for having turned back so unexpectedly in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 14767 len. 53]: So he wrote a note for his portmanteau , and sent it by a messenger , who duly brought his luggage back , with a short note from that other piece of luggage , his wife , expressive of her wish to be allowed to come and see him for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 14768 len. 38]: To this request he sent for answer , ` she had better ; ' and one such threatening affirmative being sufficient , in defiance of the English grammar , to express a negative , she kept away .
Parsing [sent. 14769 len. 33]: Mr Montague being much engaged in the course of the day , Jonas bestowed his spirits chiefly on the doctor , with whom he lunched in the medical officer 's own room .
Parsing [sent. 14770 len. 35]: On his way thither , encountering Mr Nadgett in the outer room , he bantered that stealthy gentleman on always appearing anxious to avoid him , and inquired if he were afraid of him .
Parsing [sent. 14771 len. 31]: Mr Nadgett slyly answered , ` No , but he believed it must be his way as he had been charged with much the same kind of thing before . '
Parsing [sent. 14772 len. 20]: Mr Montague was listening to , or , to speak with greater elegance , he overheard , this dialogue .
Parsing [sent. 14773 len. 24]: As soon as Jonas was gone he beckoned Nadgett to him with the feather of his pen , and whispered in his ear .
Parsing [sent. 14774 len. 10]: ` Who gave him my letter this morning ? '
Parsing [sent. 14775 len. 17]: ` My lodger , sir , ' said Nadgett , behind the palm of his hand .
Parsing [sent. 14776 len. 8]: ` How came that about ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 14777 len. 9]: I found him on the wharf , sir .
Parsing [sent. 14778 len. 17]: Being so much hurried , and you not arrived , it was necessary to do something .
Parsing [sent. 14779 len. 21]: It fortunately occurred to me , that if I gave it him myself I could be of no further use .
Parsing [sent. 14780 len. 9]: I should have been blown upon immediately . '
Parsing [sent. 14781 len. 19]: ` Mr Nadgett , you are a jewel , ' said Montague , patting him on the back .
Parsing [sent. 14782 len. 9]: ` What 's your lodger 's name ? '
Parsing [sent. 14783 len. 5]: ` Pinch , sir .
Parsing [sent. 14784 len. 4]: Thomas Pinch . '
Parsing [sent. 14785 len. 21]: Montague reflected for a little while , and then asked : ` From the country , do you know ? '
Parsing [sent. 14786 len. 11]: ` From Wiltshire , sir , he told me . '
Parsing [sent. 14787 len. 6]: They parted without another word .
Parsing [sent. 14788 len. 41]: To see Mr Nadgett 's bow when Montague and he next met , and to see Mr Montague acknowledge it , anybody might have undertaken to swear that they had never spoken to each other confidentially in all their lives .
Parsing [sent. 14789 len. 47]: In the meanwhile , Mr Jonas and the doctor made themselves very comfortable upstairs , over a bottle of the old Madeira and some sandwiches ; for the doctor having been already invited to dine below at six o'clock , preferred a light repast for lunch .
Parsing [sent. 14790 len. 21]: It was advisable , he said , in two points of view : First , as being healthy in itself .
Parsing [sent. 14791 len. 9]: Secondly as being the better preparation for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 14792 len. 48]: ` And you are bound for all our sakes to take particular care of your digestion , Mr Chuzzlewit , my dear sir , ' said the doctor smacking his lips after a glass of wine ; ` for depend upon it , it is worth preserving .
Parsing [sent. 14793 len. 12]: It must be in admirable condition , sir ; perfect chronometer-work .
Parsing [sent. 14794 len. 9]: Otherwise your spirits could not be so remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 14795 len. 23]: Your bosom 's lord sits lightly on its throne , Mr Chuzzlewit , as what 's - his-name says in the play .
Parsing [sent. 14796 len. 22]: I wish he said it in a play which did anything like common justice to our profession , by the bye .
Parsing [sent. 14797 len. 26]: There is an apothecary in that drama , sir , which is a low thing ; vulgar , sir ; out of nature altogether . '
Parsing [sent. 14798 len. 40]: Mr Jobling pulled out his shirt-frill of fine linen , as though he would have said , ` This is what I call nature in a medical man , sir ; ' and looked at Jonas for an observation .
Parsing [sent. 14799 len. 28]: Jonas not being in a condition to pursue the subject , took up a case of lancets that was lying on the table , and opened it .
Parsing [sent. 14800 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 14801 len. 23]: said the doctor , leaning back in his chair , ' I always take 'em out of my pocket before I eat .
Parsing [sent. 14802 len. 6]: My pockets are rather tight .
Parsing [sent. 14803 len. 7]: Ha , ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 14804 len. 27]: Jonas had opened one of the shining little instruments ; and was scrutinizing it with a look as sharp and eager as its own bright edge .
Parsing [sent. 14805 len. 6]: ` Good steel , doctor .
Parsing [sent. 14806 len. 3]: Good steel !
Parsing [sent. 14807 len. 3]: Eh ! '
Parsing [sent. 14808 len. 15]: ` Ye-es , ' replied the doctor , with the faltering modesty of ownership .
Parsing [sent. 14809 len. 15]: ` One might open a vein pretty dexterously with that , Mr Chuzzlewit . '
Parsing [sent. 14810 len. 15]: ` It has opened a good many in its time , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 14811 len. 10]: said Jonas looking at it with a growing interest .
Parsing [sent. 14812 len. 13]: ` Not a few , my dear sir , not a few .
Parsing [sent. 14813 len. 42]: It has been engaged in a -- in a pretty good practice , I believe I may say , ' replied the doctor , coughing as if the matter-of-fact were so very dry and literal that he could n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 14814 len. 21]: ` In a pretty good practice , ' repeated the doctor , putting another glass of wine to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 14815 len. 18]: ` Now , could you cut a man 's throat with such a thing as this ? '
Parsing [sent. 14816 len. 3]: demanded Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 14817 len. 20]: ` Oh certainly , certainly , if you took him in the right place , ' returned the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 14818 len. 8]: ` It all depends upon that . '
Parsing [sent. 14819 len. 11]: ` Where you have your hand now , hey ? '
Parsing [sent. 14820 len. 10]: cried Jonas , bending forward to look at it .
Parsing [sent. 14821 len. 15]: ` Yes , ' said the doctor ; ` that 's the jugular . '
Parsing [sent. 14822 len. 27]: Jonas , in his vivacity , made a sudden sawing in the air , so close behind the doctor 's jugular that he turned quite red .
Parsing [sent. 14823 len. 18]: Then Jonas -LRB- in the same strange spirit of vivacity -RRB- burst into a loud discordant laugh .
Parsing [sent. 14824 len. 26]: ` No , no , ' said the doctor , shaking his head ; ` edge tools , edge tools ; never play with 'em .
Parsing [sent. 14825 len. 22]: A very remarkable instance of the skillful use of edge-tools , by the way , occurs to me at this moment .
Parsing [sent. 14826 len. 7]: It was a case of murder .
Parsing [sent. 14827 len. 25]: I am afraid it was a case of murder , committed by a member of our profession ; it was so artistically done . '
Parsing [sent. 14828 len. 4]: ` Aye ! '
Parsing [sent. 14829 len. 3]: said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 14830 len. 6]: ` How was that ? '
Parsing [sent. 14831 len. 17]: ` Why , sir , ' returned Jobling , ` the thing lies in a nutshell .
Parsing [sent. 14832 len. 48]: A certain gentleman was found , one morning , in an obscure street , lying in an angle of a doorway -- I should rather say , leaning , in an upright position , in the angle of a doorway , and supported consequently by the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 14833 len. 11]: Upon his waistcoat there was one solitary drop of blood .
Parsing [sent. 14834 len. 14]: He was dead and cold ; and had been murdered , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 14835 len. 8]: ` Only one drop of blood ! '
Parsing [sent. 14836 len. 3]: said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 14837 len. 19]: ` Sir , that man , ' replied the doctor , ` had been stabbed to the heart .
Parsing [sent. 14838 len. 23]: Had been stabbed to the heart with such dexterity , sir , that he had died instantly , and had bled internally .
Parsing [sent. 14839 len. 84]: It was supposed that a medical friend of his -LRB- to whom suspicion attached -RRB- had engaged him in conversation on some pretence ; had taken him , very likely , by the button in a conversational manner ; had examined his ground at leisure with his other hand ; had marked the exact spot ; drawn out the instrument , whatever it was , when he was quite prepared ; and -- ' ` And done the trick , ' suggested Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 14840 len. 9]: ` Exactly so , ' replied the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 14841 len. 14]: ` It was quite an operation in its way , and very neat .
Parsing [sent. 14842 len. 21]: The medical friend never turned up ; and , as I tell you , he had the credit of it .
Parsing [sent. 14843 len. 11]: Whether he did it or not I ca n't say .
Parsing [sent. 14844 len. 90]: But , having had the honour to be called in with two or three of my professional brethren on the occasion , and having assisted to make a careful examination of the wound , I have no hesitation in saying that it would have reflected credit on any medical man ; and that in an unprofessional person it could not but be considered , either as an extraordinary work of art , or the result of a still more extraordinary , happy , and favourable conjunction of circumstances . '
Parsing [sent. 14845 len. 67]: His hearer was so much interested in this case , that the doctor went on to elucidate it with the assistance of his own finger and thumb and waistcoat ; and at Jonas 's request , he took the further trouble of going into a corner of the room , and alternately representing the murdered man and the murderer ; which he did with great effect .
Parsing [sent. 14846 len. 26]: The bottle being emptied and the story done , Jonas was in precisely the same boisterous and unusual state as when they had sat down .
Parsing [sent. 14847 len. 21]: If , as Jobling theorized , his good digestion were the cause , he must have been a very ostrich .
Parsing [sent. 14848 len. 26]: At dinner it was just the same ; and after dinner too ; though wine was drunk in abundance , and various rich meats eaten .
Parsing [sent. 14849 len. 9]: At nine o'clock it was still the same .
Parsing [sent. 14850 len. 38]: There being a lamp in the carriage , he swore they would take a pack of cards , and a bottle of wine ; and with these things under his cloak , went down to the door .
Parsing [sent. 14851 len. 15]: ` Out of the way , Tom Thumb , and get to bed ! '
Parsing [sent. 14852 len. 27]: This was the salutation he bestowed on Mr Bailey , who , booted and wrapped up , stood at the carriage door to help him in .
Parsing [sent. 14853 len. 6]: ` To bed , sir !
Parsing [sent. 14854 len. 10]: I 'm a-going , too , ' said Bailey .
Parsing [sent. 14855 len. 28]: He alighted quickly , and walked back into the hall , where Montague was lighting a cigar ; conducting Mr Bailey with him , by the collar .
Parsing [sent. 14856 len. 17]: ` You are not a-going to take this monkey of a boy , are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 14857 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' said Montague .
Parsing [sent. 14858 len. 13]: He gave the boy a shake , and threw him roughly aside .
Parsing [sent. 14859 len. 61]: There was more of his familiar self in the action , than in anything he had done that day ; but he broke out laughing immediately afterwards , and making a thrust at the doctor with his hand , in imitation of his representation of the medical friend , went out to the carriage again , and took his seat .
Parsing [sent. 14860 len. 5]: His companion followed immediately .
Parsing [sent. 14861 len. 7]: Mr Bailey climbed into the rumble .
Parsing [sent. 14862 len. 9]: ` It will be a stormy night ! '
Parsing [sent. 14863 len. 8]: exclaimed the doctor , as they started .
Parsing [sent. 14864 len. 27]: CHAPTER FORTY -- TWO CONTINUATION OF THE ENTERPRISE OF MR JONAS AND HIS FRIEND The doctor 's prognostication in reference to the weather was speedily verified .
Parsing [sent. 14865 len. 74]: Although the weather was not a patient of his , and no third party had required him to give an opinion on the case , the quick fulfilment of his prophecy may be taken as an instance of his professional tact ; for , unless the threatening aspect of the night had been perfectly plain and unmistakable , Mr Jobling would never have compromised his reputation by delivering any sentiments on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 14866 len. 20]: He used this principle in Medicine with too much success to be unmindful of it in his commonest transactions .
Parsing [sent. 14867 len. 54]: It was one of those hot , silent nights , when people sit at windows listening for the thunder which they know will shortly break ; when they recall dismal tales of hurricanes and earthquakes ; and of lonely travellers on open plains , and lonely ships at sea , struck by lightning .
Parsing [sent. 14868 len. 39]: Lightning flashed and quivered on the black horizon even now ; and hollow murmurings were in the wind , as though it had been blowing where the thunder rolled , and still was charged with its exhausted echoes .
Parsing [sent. 14869 len. 42]: But the storm , though gathering swiftly , had not yet come up ; and the prevailing stillness was the more solemn , from the dull intelligence that seemed to hover in the air , of noise and conflict afar off .
Parsing [sent. 14870 len. 40]: It was very dark ; but in the murky sky there were masses of cloud which shone with a lurid light , like monstrous heaps of copper that had been heated in a furnace , and were growing cold .
Parsing [sent. 14871 len. 18]: These had been advancing steadily and slowly , but they were now motionless , or nearly so .
Parsing [sent. 14872 len. 46]: As the carriage clattered round the corners of the streets , it passed at every one a knot of persons who had come there -- many from their houses close at hand , without hats -- to look up at that quarter of the sky .
Parsing [sent. 14873 len. 20]: And now a very few large drops of rain began to fall , and thunder rumbled in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 14874 len. 37]: Jonas sat in a corner of the carriage with his bottle resting on his knee , and gripped as tightly in his hand as if he would have ground its neck to powder if he could .
Parsing [sent. 14875 len. 48]: Instinctively attracted by the night , he had laid aside the pack of cards upon the cushion ; and with the same involuntary impulse , so intelligible to both of them as not to occasion a remark on either side , his companion had extinguished the lamp .
Parsing [sent. 14876 len. 19]: The front glasses were down ; and they sat looking silently out upon the gloomy scene before them .
Parsing [sent. 14877 len. 31]: They were clear of London , or as clear of it as travellers can be whose way lies on the Western Road , within a stage of that enormous city .
Parsing [sent. 14878 len. 32]: Occasionally they encountered a foot-passenger , hurrying to the nearest place of shelter ; or some unwieldy cart proceeding onward at a heavy trot , with the same end in view .
Parsing [sent. 14879 len. 35]: Little clusters of such vehicles were gathered round the stable-yard or baiting-place of every wayside tavern ; while their drivers watched the weather from the doors and open windows , or made merry within .
Parsing [sent. 14880 len. 39]: Everywhere the people were disposed to bear each other company rather than sit alone ; so that groups of watchful faces seemed to be looking out upon the night AND THEM , from almost every house they passed .
Parsing [sent. 14881 len. 20]: It may appear strange that this should have disturbed Jonas , or rendered him uneasy ; but it did .
Parsing [sent. 14882 len. 31]: After muttering to himself , and often changing his position , he drew up the blind on his side of the carriage , and turned his shoulder sulkily towards it .
Parsing [sent. 14883 len. 33]: But he neither looked at his companion , nor broke the silence which prevailed between them , and which had fallen so suddenly upon himself , by addressing a word to him .
Parsing [sent. 14884 len. 17]: The thunder rolled , the lightning flashed ; the rain poured down like Heaven 's wrath .
Parsing [sent. 14885 len. 24]: Surrounded at one moment by intolerable light , and at the next by pitchy darkness , they still pressed forward on their journey .
Parsing [sent. 14886 len. 26]: Even when they arrived at the end of the stage , and might have tarried , they did not ; but ordered horses out immediately .
Parsing [sent. 14887 len. 25]: Nor had this any reference to some five minutes ' lull , which at that time seemed to promise a cessation of the storm .
Parsing [sent. 14888 len. 15]: They held their course as if they were impelled and driven by its fury .
Parsing [sent. 14889 len. 31]: Although they had not exchanged a dozen words , and might have tarried very well , they seemed to feel , by joint consent , that onward they must go .
Parsing [sent. 14890 len. 37]: Louder and louder the deep thunder rolled , as through the myriad halls of some vast temple in the sky ; fiercer and brighter became the lightning , more and more heavily the rain poured down .
Parsing [sent. 14891 len. 53]: The horses -LRB- they were travelling now with a single pair -RRB- plunged and started from the rills of quivering fire that seemed to wind along the ground before them ; but there these two men sat , and forward they went as if they were led on by an invisible attraction .
Parsing [sent. 14892 len. 35]: The eye , partaking of the quickness of the flashing light , saw in its every gleam a multitude of objects which it could not see at steady noon in fifty times that period .
Parsing [sent. 14893 len. 131]: Bells in steeples , with the rope and wheel that moved them ; ragged nests of birds in cornices and nooks ; faces full of consternation in the tilted waggons that came tearing past ; their frightened teams ringing out a warning which the thunder drowned ; harrows and ploughs left out in fields ; miles upon miles of hedge-divided country , with the distant fringe of trees as obvious as the scarecrow in the bean-field close at hand ; in a trembling , vivid , flickering instant , everything was clear and plain ; then came a flush of red into the yellow light ; a change to blue ; a brightness so intense that there was nothing else but light ; and then the deepest and profoundest darkness .
Parsing [sent. 14894 len. 36]: The lightning being very crooked and very dazzling may have presented or assisted a curious optical illusion , which suddenly rose before the startled eyes of Montague in the carriage , and as rapidly disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 14895 len. 32]: He thought he saw Jonas with his hand lifted , and the bottle clenched in it like a hammer , making as if he would aim a blow at his head .
Parsing [sent. 14896 len. 47]: At the same time he observed -LRB- or so believed -RRB- an expression in his face -- a combination of the unnatural excitement he had shown all day , with a wild hatred and fear -- which might have rendered a wolf a less terrible companion .
Parsing [sent. 14897 len. 23]: He uttered an involuntary exclamation , and called to the driver , who brought his horses to a stop with all speed .
Parsing [sent. 14898 len. 37]: It could hardly have been as he supposed , for although he had not taken his eyes off his companion , and had not seen him move , he sat reclining in his corner as before .
Parsing [sent. 14899 len. 7]: ` What 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 14900 len. 3]: said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 14901 len. 15]: ` Is that your general way of waking out of your sleep ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 14902 len. 19]: I could swear , ' returned the other , ` that I have not closed my eyes ! '
Parsing [sent. 14903 len. 30]: ` When you have sworn it , ' said Jonas , composedly , ` we had better go on again , if you have only stopped for that . '
Parsing [sent. 14904 len. 24]: He uncorked the bottle with the help of his teeth ; and putting it to his lips , took a long draught . '
Parsing [sent. 14905 len. 10]: I wish we had never started on this journey .
Parsing [sent. 14906 len. 32]: This is not , ' said Montague , recoiling instinctively , and speaking in a voice that betrayed his agitation ; ` this is not a night to travel in . '
Parsing [sent. 14907 len. 3]: ` Ecod !
Parsing [sent. 14908 len. 22]: you 're right there , ' returned Jonas , ` and we should n't be out in it but for you .
Parsing [sent. 14909 len. 26]: If you had n't kept me waiting all day , we might have been at Salisbury by this time ; snug abed and fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 14910 len. 7]: What are we stopping for ? '
Parsing [sent. 14911 len. 39]: His companion put his head out of window for a moment , and drawing it in again , observed -LRB- as if that were his cause of anxiety -RRB- , that the boy was drenched to the skin .
Parsing [sent. 14912 len. 9]: ` Serve him right , ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 14913 len. 7]: ` I 'm glad of it .
Parsing [sent. 14914 len. 8]: What the devil are we stopping for ?
Parsing [sent. 14915 len. 12]: Are you going to spread him out to dry ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 14916 len. 18]: I have half a mind to take him inside , ' observed the other with some hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 14917 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 14918 len. 3]: thankee ! '
Parsing [sent. 14919 len. 3]: said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 14920 len. 17]: ` We do n't want any damp boys here ; especially a young imp like him .
Parsing [sent. 14921 len. 7]: Let him be where he is .
Parsing [sent. 14922 len. 19]: He ai n't afraid of a little thunder and lightning , I dare say ; whoever else is .
Parsing [sent. 14923 len. 5]: Go on , driver .
Parsing [sent. 14924 len. 21]: We had better have HIM inside perhaps , ' he muttered with a laugh ; ` and the horses ! '
Parsing [sent. 14925 len. 22]: ` Do n't go too fast , ' cried Montague to the postillion ; ` and take care how you go .
Parsing [sent. 14926 len. 13]: You were nearly in the ditch when I called to you . '
Parsing [sent. 14927 len. 17]: This was not true ; and Jonas bluntly said so , as they moved forward again .
Parsing [sent. 14928 len. 34]: Montague took little or no heed of what he said , but repeated that it was not a night for travelling , and showed himself , both then and afterwards , unusually anxious .
Parsing [sent. 14929 len. 28]: From this time Jonas recovered his former spirits , if such a term may be employed to express the state in which he had left the city .
Parsing [sent. 14930 len. 43]: He had his bottle often at his mouth ; roared out snatches of songs , without the least regard to time or tune or voice , or anything but loud discordance ; and urged his silent friend to be merry with him .
Parsing [sent. 14931 len. 36]: ` You 're the best company in the world , my good fellow , ' said Montague with an effort , ` and in general irresistible ; but to-night -- do you hear it ? '
Parsing [sent. 14932 len. 3]: ` Ecod !
Parsing [sent. 14933 len. 37]: I hear and see it too , ' cried Jonas , shading his eyes , for the moment , from the lightning which was flashing , not in any one direction , but all around them .
Parsing [sent. 14934 len. 5]: ` What of that ?
Parsing [sent. 14935 len. 13]: It do n't change you , nor me , nor our affairs .
Parsing [sent. 14936 len. 50]: Chorus , chorus , It may lighten and storm , Till it hunt the red worm From the grass where the gibbet is driven ; But it ca n't hurt the dead , And it wo n't save the head That is doom 'd to be rifled and riven .
Parsing [sent. 14937 len. 28]: That must be a precious old song , ' he added with an oath , as he stopped short in a kind of wonder at himself . '
Parsing [sent. 14938 len. 32]: I have n't heard it since I was a boy , and how it comes into my head now , unless the lightning put it there , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 14939 len. 8]: `` Ca n't hurt the dead '' !
Parsing [sent. 14940 len. 4]: No , no .
Parsing [sent. 14941 len. 9]: `` And wo n't save the head '' !
Parsing [sent. 14942 len. 4]: No , no .
Parsing [sent. 14943 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 14944 len. 7]: Ha , ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 14945 len. 52]: His mirth was of such a savage and extraordinary character , and was , in an inexplicable way , at once so suited to the night , and yet such a coarse intrusion on its terrors , that his fellow-traveller , always a coward , shrunk from him in positive fear .
Parsing [sent. 14946 len. 16]: Instead of Jonas being his tool and instrument , their places seemed to be reversed .
Parsing [sent. 14947 len. 42]: But there was reason for this too , Montague thought ; since the sense of his debasement might naturally inspire such a man with the wish to assert a noisy independence , and in that licence to forget his real condition .
Parsing [sent. 14948 len. 29]: Being quick enough , in reference to such subjects of contemplation , he was not long in taking this argument into account and giving it its full weight .
Parsing [sent. 14949 len. 17]: But still , he felt a vague sense of alarm , and was depressed and uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 14950 len. 45]: He was certain he had not been asleep ; but his eyes might have deceived him ; for , looking at Jonas now in any interval of darkness , he could represent his figure to himself in any attitude his state of mind suggested .
Parsing [sent. 14951 len. 80]: On the other hand , he knew full well that Jonas had no reason to love him ; and even taking the piece of pantomime which had so impressed his mind to be a real gesture , and not the working of his fancy , the most that could be said of it was , that it was quite in keeping with the rest of his diabolical fun , and had the same impotent expression of truth in it .
Parsing [sent. 14952 len. 23]: ` If he could kill me with a wish , ' thought the swindler , ' I should not live long . '
Parsing [sent. 14953 len. 56]: He resolved that when he should have had his use of Jonas , he would restrain him with an iron curb ; in the meantime , that he could not do better than leave him to take his own way , and preserve his own peculiar description of good-humour , after his own uncommon manner .
Parsing [sent. 14954 len. 46]: It was no great sacrifice to bear with him ; ` for when all is got that can be got , ' thought Montague , ' I shall decamp across the water , and have the laugh on my side -- and the gains . '
Parsing [sent. 14955 len. 47]: Such were his reflections from hour to hour ; his state of mind being one in which the same thoughts constantly present themselves over and over again in wearisome repetition ; while Jonas , who appeared to have dismissed reflection altogether , entertained himself as before .
Parsing [sent. 14956 len. 42]: They agreed that they would go to Salisbury , and would cross to Mr Pecksniff 's in the morning ; and at the prospect of deluding that worthy gentleman , the spirits of his amiable son-in-law became more boisterous than ever .
Parsing [sent. 14957 len. 21]: As the night wore on , the thunder died away , but still rolled gloomily and mournfully in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 14958 len. 15]: The lightning too , though now comparatively harmless , was yet bright and frequent .
Parsing [sent. 14959 len. 12]: The rain was quite as violent as it had ever been .
Parsing [sent. 14960 len. 28]: It was their ill-fortune , at about the time of dawn and in the last stage of their journey , to have a restive pair of horses .
Parsing [sent. 14961 len. 118]: These animals had been greatly terrified in their stable by the tempest ; and coming out into the dreary interval between night and morning , when the glare of the lightning was yet unsubdued by day , and the various objects in their view were presented in indistinct and exaggerated shapes which they would not have worn by night , they gradually became less and less capable of control ; until , taking a sudden fright at something by the roadside , they dashed off wildly down a steep hill , flung the driver from his saddle , drew the carriage to the brink of a ditch , stumbled headlong down , and threw it crashing over .
Parsing [sent. 14962 len. 16]: The travellers had opened the carriage door , and had either jumped or fallen out .
Parsing [sent. 14963 len. 10]: Jonas was the first to stagger to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 14964 len. 34]: He felt sick and weak , and very giddy , and reeling to a five-barred gate , stood holding by it ; looking drowsily about as the whole landscape swam before his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 14965 len. 30]: But , by degrees , he grew more conscious , and presently observed that Montague was lying senseless in the road , within a few feet of the horses .
Parsing [sent. 14966 len. 78]: In an instant , as if his own faint body were suddenly animated by a demon , he ran to the horses ' heads ; and pulling at their bridles with all his force , set them struggling and plunging with such mad violence as brought their hoofs at every effort nearer to the skull of the prostrate man ; and must have led in half a minute to his brains being dashed out on the highway .
Parsing [sent. 14967 len. 23]: As he did this , he fought and contended with them like a man possessed , making them wilder by his cries .
Parsing [sent. 14968 len. 4]: ` Whoop ! '
Parsing [sent. 14969 len. 3]: cried Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 14970 len. 3]: ` Whoop !
Parsing [sent. 14971 len. 2]: again !
Parsing [sent. 14972 len. 2]: another !
Parsing [sent. 14973 len. 8]: A little more , a little more !
Parsing [sent. 14974 len. 5]: Up , ye devils !
Parsing [sent. 14975 len. 3]: Hillo ! '
Parsing [sent. 14976 len. 24]: As he heard the driver , who had risen and was hurrying up , crying to him to desist , his violence increased .
Parsing [sent. 14977 len. 3]: ` Hiilo !
Parsing [sent. 14978 len. 3]: Hillo ! '
Parsing [sent. 14979 len. 3]: cried Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 14980 len. 7]: ` For God 's sake ! '
Parsing [sent. 14981 len. 4]: cried the driver .
Parsing [sent. 14982 len. 14]: ` The gentleman -- in the road -- he 'll be killed ! '
Parsing [sent. 14983 len. 12]: The same shouts and the same struggles were his only answer .
Parsing [sent. 14984 len. 33]: But the man darting in at the peril of his own life , saved Montague 's , by dragging him through the mire and water out of the reach of present harm .
Parsing [sent. 14985 len. 39]: That done , he ran to Jonas ; and with the aid of his knife they very shortly disengaged the horses from the broken chariot , and got them , cut and bleeding , on their legs again .
Parsing [sent. 14986 len. 20]: The postillion and Jonas had now leisure to look at each other , which they had not had yet .
Parsing [sent. 14987 len. 10]: ` Presence of mind , presence of mind ! '
Parsing [sent. 14988 len. 9]: cried Jonas , throwing up his hands wildly .
Parsing [sent. 14989 len. 10]: ` What would you have done without me ? '
Parsing [sent. 14990 len. 20]: ` The other gentleman would have done badly without ME , ' returned the man , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 14991 len. 8]: ` You should have moved him first .
Parsing [sent. 14992 len. 8]: I gave him up for dead . '
Parsing [sent. 14993 len. 20]: ` Presence of mind , you croaker , presence of mind ' cried Jonas with a harsh loud laugh .
Parsing [sent. 14994 len. 10]: ` Was he struck , do you think ? '
Parsing [sent. 14995 len. 8]: They both turned to look at him .
Parsing [sent. 14996 len. 20]: Jonas muttered something to himself , when he saw him sitting up beneath the hedge , looking vacantly around .
Parsing [sent. 14997 len. 7]: ` What 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 14998 len. 3]: asked Montague .
Parsing [sent. 14999 len. 6]: ` Is anybody hurt ? '
Parsing [sent. 15000 len. 4]: ` Ecod ! '
Parsing [sent. 15001 len. 10]: said Jonas , ` it do n't seem so .
Parsing [sent. 15002 len. 10]: There are no bones broken , after all . '
Parsing [sent. 15003 len. 10]: They raised him , and he tried to walk .
Parsing [sent. 15004 len. 12]: He was a good deal shaken , and trembled very much .
Parsing [sent. 15005 len. 19]: But with the exception of a few cuts and bruises this was all the damage he had sustained .
Parsing [sent. 15006 len. 8]: ` Cuts and bruises , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 15007 len. 3]: said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 15008 len. 7]: ` We 've all got them .
Parsing [sent. 15009 len. 9]: Only cuts and bruises , eh ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 15010 len. 30]: I would n't have given sixpence for the gentleman 's head in half-a-dozen seconds more , for all he 's only cut and bruised , ' observed the post-boy .
Parsing [sent. 15011 len. 47]: ` If ever you 're in an accident of this sort again , sir ; which I hope you wo n't be ; never you pull at the bridle of a horse that 's down , when there 's a man 's head in the way .
Parsing [sent. 15012 len. 46]: That ca n't be done twice without there being a dead man in the case ; it would have ended in that , this time , as sure as ever you were born , if I had n't come up just when I did . '
Parsing [sent. 15013 len. 31]: Jonas replied by advising him with a curse to hold his tongue , and to go somewhere , whither he was not very likely to go of his own accord .
Parsing [sent. 15014 len. 26]: But Montague , who had listened eagerly to every word , himself diverted the subject , by exclaiming : ` Where 's the boy ? '
Parsing [sent. 15015 len. 3]: ` Ecod !
Parsing [sent. 15016 len. 9]: I forgot that monkey , ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 15017 len. 8]: ` What 's become of him ? '
Parsing [sent. 15018 len. 8]: A very brief search settled that question .
Parsing [sent. 15019 len. 29]: The unfortunate Mr Bailey had been thrown sheer over the hedge or the five-barred gate ; and was lying in the neighbouring field , to all appearance dead .
Parsing [sent. 15020 len. 31]: ` When I said to-night , that I wished I had never started on this journey , ' cried his master , ' I knew it was an ill-fated one .
Parsing [sent. 15021 len. 6]: Look at this boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 15022 len. 6]: ` Is that all ? '
Parsing [sent. 15023 len. 3]: growled Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 15024 len. 24]: ` If you call THAT a sign of it -- ' ` Why , what should I call a sign of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 15025 len. 5]: asked Montague , hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 15026 len. 8]: ` What do you mean ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 15027 len. 34]: I mean , ' said Jonas , stooping down over the body , ` that I never heard you were his father , or had any particular reason to care much about him .
Parsing [sent. 15028 len. 2]: Halloa .
Parsing [sent. 15029 len. 5]: Hold up there ! '
Parsing [sent. 15030 len. 30]: But the boy was past holding up , or being held up , or giving any other sign of life than a faint and fitful beating of the heart .
Parsing [sent. 15031 len. 51]: After some discussion the driver mounted the horse which had been least injured , and took the lad in his arms as well as he could ; while Montague and Jonas , leading the other horse , and carrying a trunk between them , walked by his side towards Salisbury .
Parsing [sent. 15032 len. 31]: ` You 'd get there in a few minutes , and be able to send assistance to meet us , if you went forward , post-boy , ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 15033 len. 5]: ` Trot on ! '
Parsing [sent. 15034 len. 16]: ` No , no , ' cried Montague ; ` we 'll keep together . '
Parsing [sent. 15035 len. 9]: ` Why , what a chicken you are !
Parsing [sent. 15036 len. 12]: You are not afraid of being robbed ; are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 15037 len. 4]: said Jonas . '
Parsing [sent. 15038 len. 24]: I am not afraid of anything , ' replied the other , whose looks and manner were in flat contradiction to his words .
Parsing [sent. 15039 len. 8]: ` But we 'll keep together . '
Parsing [sent. 15040 len. 18]: ` You were mighty anxious about the boy , a minute ago , ' said Jonas . '
Parsing [sent. 15041 len. 13]: I suppose you know that he may die in the meantime ? '
Parsing [sent. 15042 len. 5]: ` Aye , aye .
Parsing [sent. 15043 len. 3]: I know .
Parsing [sent. 15044 len. 7]: But we 'll keep together . '
Parsing [sent. 15045 len. 33]: As it was clear that he was not to be moved from this determination , Jonas made no other rejoinder than such as his face expressed ; and they proceeded in company .
Parsing [sent. 15046 len. 40]: They had three or four good miles to travel ; and the way was not made easier by the state of the road , the burden by which they were embarrassed , or their own stiff and sore condition .
Parsing [sent. 15047 len. 56]: After a sufficiently long and painful walk , they arrived at the Inn ; and having knocked the people up -LRB- it being yet very early in the morning -RRB- , sent out messengers to see to the carriage and its contents , and roused a surgeon from his bed to tend the chief sufferer .
Parsing [sent. 15048 len. 13]: All the service he could render , he rendered promptly and skillfully .
Parsing [sent. 15049 len. 30]: But he gave it as his opinion that the boy was labouring under a severe concussion of the brain , and that Mr Bailey 's mortal course was run .
Parsing [sent. 15050 len. 36]: If Montague 's strong interest in the announcement could have been considered as unselfish in any degree , it might have been a redeeming trait in a character that had no such lineaments to spare .
Parsing [sent. 15051 len. 33]: But it was not difficult to see that , for some unexpressed reason best appreciated by himself , he attached a strange value to the company and presence of this mere child .
Parsing [sent. 15052 len. 57]: When , after receiving some assistance from the surgeon himself , he retired to the bedroom prepared for him , and it was broad day , his mind was still dwelling on this theme , ' I would rather have lost , ' he said , ' a thousand pounds than lost the boy just now .
Parsing [sent. 15053 len. 7]: But I 'll return home alone .
Parsing [sent. 15054 len. 6]: I am resolved upon that .
Parsing [sent. 15055 len. 15]: Chuzzlewit shall go forward first , and I will follow in my own time .
Parsing [sent. 15056 len. 17]: I 'll have no more of this , ' he added , wiping his damp forehead .
Parsing [sent. 15057 len. 12]: ` Twenty-four hours of this would turn my hair grey ! '
Parsing [sent. 15058 len. 54]: After examining his chamber , and looking under the bed , and in the cupboards , and even behind the curtains , with unusual caution -LRB- although it was , as has been said , broad day -RRB- , he double-locked the door by which he had entered , and retired to rest .
Parsing [sent. 15059 len. 28]: There was another door in the room , but it was locked on the outer side ; and with what place it communicated , he knew not .
Parsing [sent. 15060 len. 13]: His fears or evil conscience reproduced this door in all his dreams .
Parsing [sent. 15061 len. 55]: He dreamed that a dreadful secret was connected with it ; a secret which he knew , and yet did not know , for although he was heavily responsible for it , and a party to it , he was harassed even in his vision by a distracting uncertainty in reference to its import .
Parsing [sent. 15062 len. 51]: Incoherently entwined with this dream was another , which represented it as the hiding-place of an enemy , a shadow , a phantom ; and made it the business of his life to keep the terrible creature closed up , and prevent it from forcing its way in upon him .
Parsing [sent. 15063 len. 127]: With this view Nadgett , and he , and a strange man with a bloody smear upon his head -LRB- who told him that he had been his playfellow , and told him , too , the real name of an old schoolmate , forgotten until then -RRB- , worked with iron plates and nails to make the door secure ; but though they worked never so hard , it was all in vain , for the nails broke , or changed to soft twigs , or what was worse , to worms , between their fingers ; the wood of the door splintered and crumbled , so that even nails would not remain in it ; and the iron plates curled up like hot paper .
Parsing [sent. 15064 len. 35]: All this time the creature on the other side -- whether it was in the shape of man , or beast , he neither knew nor sought to know -- was gaining on them .
Parsing [sent. 15065 len. 33]: But his greatest terror was when the man with the bloody smear upon his head demanded of him if he knew this creatures name , and said that he would whisper it .
Parsing [sent. 15066 len. 22]: At this the dreamer fell upon his knees , his whole blood thrilling with inexplicable fear , and held his ears .
Parsing [sent. 15067 len. 40]: But looking at the speaker 's lips , he saw that they formed the utterance of the letter ` J' ; and crying out aloud that the secret was discovered , and they were all lost , he awoke .
Parsing [sent. 15068 len. 11]: Awoke to find Jonas standing at his bedside watching him .
Parsing [sent. 15069 len. 7]: And that very door wide open .
Parsing [sent. 15070 len. 18]: As their eyes met , Jonas retreated a few paces , and Montague sprang out of bed .
Parsing [sent. 15071 len. 4]: ` Heyday ! '
Parsing [sent. 15072 len. 3]: said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 15073 len. 9]: ` You 're all alive this morning . '
Parsing [sent. 15074 len. 4]: ` Alive ! '
Parsing [sent. 15075 len. 11]: the other stammered , as he pulled the bell-rope violently .
Parsing [sent. 15076 len. 8]: ` What are you doing here ? '
Parsing [sent. 15077 len. 28]: ` It 's your room to be sure , ' said Jonas ; ` but I 'm almost inclined to ask you what YOU are doing here ?
Parsing [sent. 15078 len. 11]: My room is on the other side of that door .
Parsing [sent. 15079 len. 11]: No one told me last night not to open it .
Parsing [sent. 15080 len. 16]: I thought it led into a passage , and was coming out to order breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 15081 len. 12]: There 's -- there 's no bell in my room . '
Parsing [sent. 15082 len. 45]: Montague had in the meantime admitted the man with his hot water and boots , who hearing this , said , yes , there was ; and passed into the adjoining room to point it out , at the head of the bed . '
Parsing [sent. 15083 len. 19]: I could n't find it , then , ' said Jonas ; ` it 's all the same .
Parsing [sent. 15084 len. 6]: Shall I order breakfast ? '
Parsing [sent. 15085 len. 6]: Montague answered in the affirmative .
Parsing [sent. 15086 len. 32]: When Jonas had retired , whistling , through his own room , he opened the door of communication , to take out the key and fasten it on the inner side .
Parsing [sent. 15087 len. 7]: But it was taken out already .
Parsing [sent. 15088 len. 27]: He dragged a table against the door , and sat down to collect himself , as if his dreams still had some influence upon his mind .
Parsing [sent. 15089 len. 11]: ` An evil journey , ' he repeated several times .
Parsing [sent. 15090 len. 5]: ` An evil journey .
Parsing [sent. 15091 len. 7]: But I 'll travel home alone .
Parsing [sent. 15092 len. 9]: I 'll have no more of this . '
Parsing [sent. 15093 len. 30]: His presentiment , or superstition , that it was an evil journey , did not at all deter him from doing the evil for which the journey was undertaken .
Parsing [sent. 15094 len. 69]: With this in view , he dressed himself more carefully than usual to make a favourable impression on Mr Pecksniff ; and , reassured by his own appearance , the beauty of the morning , and the flashing of the wet boughs outside his window in the merry sunshine , was soon sufficiently inspirited to swear a few round oaths , and hum the fag-end of a song .
Parsing [sent. 15095 len. 21]: But he still muttered to himself at intervals , for all that : ` I 'll travel home alone ! '
Parsing [sent. 15096 len. 14]: CHAPTER FORTY -- THREE HAS AN INFLUENCE ON THE FORTUNES OF SEVERAL PEOPLE .
Parsing [sent. 15097 len. 42]: MR PECKSNIFF IS EXHIBITED IN THE PLENITUDE OF POWER ; AND WIELDS THE SAME WITH FORTITUDE AND MAGNANIMITY On the night of the storm , Mrs Lupin , hostess of the Blue Dragon , sat by herself in her little bar .
Parsing [sent. 15098 len. 23]: Her solitary condition , or the bad weather , or both united , made Mrs Lupin thoughtful , not to say sorrowful .
Parsing [sent. 15099 len. 42]: As she sat with her chin upon her hand , looking out through a low back lattice , rendered dim in the brightest day-time by clustering vine-leaves , she shook her head very often , and said , ` Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 15100 len. 8]: Oh , dear , dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 15101 len. 15]: It was a melancholy time , even in the snugness of the Dragon bar .
Parsing [sent. 15102 len. 59]: The rich expanse of corn-field , pasture-land , green slope , and gentle undulation , with its sparkling brooks , its many hedgerows , and its clumps of beautiful trees , was black and dreary , from the diamond panes of the lattice away to the far horizon , where the thunder seemed to roll along the hills .
Parsing [sent. 15103 len. 56]: The heavy rain beat down the tender branches of vine and jessamine , and trampled on them in its fury ; and when the lightning gleamed it showed the tearful leaves shivering and cowering together at the window , and tapping at it urgently , as if beseeching to be sheltered from the dismal night .
Parsing [sent. 15104 len. 20]: As a mark of her respect for the lightning , Mrs Lupin had removed her candle to the chimney-piece .
Parsing [sent. 15105 len. 36]: Her basket of needle-work stood unheeded at her elbow ; her supper , spread on a round table not far off , was untasted ; and the knives had been removed for fear of attraction .
Parsing [sent. 15106 len. 24]: She had sat for a long time with her chin upon her hand , saying to herself at intervals , ` Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 15107 len. 8]: Ah , dear , dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 15108 len. 73]: She was on the eve of saying so , once more , when the latch of the house-door -LRB- closed to keep the rain out -RRB- , rattled on its well-worn catch , and a traveller came in , who , shutting it after him , and walking straight up to the half-door of the bar , said , rather gruffly : ' A pint of the best old beer here . '
Parsing [sent. 15109 len. 29]: He had some reason to be gruff , for if he had passed the day in a waterfall , he could scarcely have been wetter than he was .
Parsing [sent. 15110 len. 43]: He was wrapped up to the eyes in a rough blue sailor 's coat , and had an oil-skin hat on , from the capacious brim of which the rain fell trickling down upon his breast , and back , and shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 15111 len. 70]: Judging from a certain liveliness of chin -- he had so pulled down his hat , and pulled up his collar , to defend himself from the weather , that she could only see his chin , and even across that he drew the wet sleeve of his shaggy coat , as she looked at him -- Mrs Lupin set him down for a good-natured fellow , too . '
Parsing [sent. 15112 len. 5]: A bad night ! '
Parsing [sent. 15113 len. 5]: observed the hostess cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 15114 len. 16]: The traveller shook himself like a Newfoundland dog , and said it was , rather .
Parsing [sent. 15115 len. 21]: ` There 's a fire in the kitchen , ' said Mrs Lupin , ` and very good company there .
Parsing [sent. 15116 len. 10]: Had n't you better go and dry yourself ? '
Parsing [sent. 15117 len. 25]: ` No , thankee , ' said the man , glancing towards the kitchen as he spoke ; he seemed to know the way .
Parsing [sent. 15118 len. 18]: ` It 's enough to give you your death of cold , ' observed the hostess . '
Parsing [sent. 15119 len. 25]: I do n't take my death easy , ' returned the traveller ; ` or I should most likely have took it afore to-night .
Parsing [sent. 15120 len. 6]: Your health , ma'am ! '
Parsing [sent. 15121 len. 28]: Mrs Lupin thanked him ; but in the act of lifting the tankard to his mouth , he changed his mind , and put it down again .
Parsing [sent. 15122 len. 41]: Throwing his body back , and looking about him stiffly , as a man does who is wrapped up , and has his hat low down over his eyes , he said : ` What do you call this house ?
Parsing [sent. 15123 len. 8]: Not the Dragon , do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 15124 len. 13]: Mrs Lupin complacently made answer , ` Yes , the Dragon . '
Parsing [sent. 15125 len. 34]: ` Why , then , you 've got a sort of a relation of mine here , ma'am , ' said the traveller ; ' a young man of the name of Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 15126 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 15127 len. 6]: Mark , my boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 15128 len. 17]: apostrophizing the premises , ` have I come upon you at last , old buck ! '
Parsing [sent. 15129 len. 10]: This was touching Mrs Lupin on a tender point .
Parsing [sent. 15130 len. 43]: She turned to trim the candle on the chimney-piece , and said , with her back towards the traveller : ` Nobody should be made more welcome at the Dragon , master , than any one who brought me news of Mark .
Parsing [sent. 15131 len. 18]: But it 's many and many a long day and month since he left here and England .
Parsing [sent. 15132 len. 18]: And whether he 's alive or dead , poor fellow , Heaven above us only knows ! '
Parsing [sent. 15133 len. 27]: She shook her head , and her voice trembled ; her hand must have done so too , for the light required a deal of trimming .
Parsing [sent. 15134 len. 9]: ` Where did he go , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 15135 len. 9]: asked the traveller , in a gentler voice .
Parsing [sent. 15136 len. 17]: ` He went , ' said Mrs Lupin , with increased distress , ` to America .
Parsing [sent. 15137 len. 39]: He was always tender-hearted and kind , and perhaps at this moment may be lying in prison under sentence of death , for taking pity on some miserable black , and helping the poor runaway creetur to escape .
Parsing [sent. 15138 len. 8]: How could he ever go to America !
Parsing [sent. 15139 len. 28]: Why did n't he go to some of those countries where the savages eat each other fairly , and give an equal chance to every one ! '
Parsing [sent. 15140 len. 41]: Quite subdued by this time , Mrs Lupin sobbed , and was retiring to a chair to give her grief free vent , when the traveller caught her in his arms , and she uttered a glad cry of recognition .
Parsing [sent. 15141 len. 7]: ` Yes , I will ! '
Parsing [sent. 15142 len. 12]: cried Mark , ` another -- one more -- twenty more !
Parsing [sent. 15143 len. 11]: You did n't know me in that hat and coat ?
Parsing [sent. 15144 len. 9]: I thought you would have known me anywheres !
Parsing [sent. 15145 len. 4]: Ten more ! '
Parsing [sent. 15146 len. 26]: ` So I should have known you , if I could have seen you ; but I could n't , and you spoke so gruff .
Parsing [sent. 15147 len. 19]: I did n't think you could speak gruff to me , Mark , at first coming back . '
Parsing [sent. 15148 len. 5]: ` Fifteen more ! '
Parsing [sent. 15149 len. 4]: said Mr Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 15150 len. 9]: ` How handsome and how young you look !
Parsing [sent. 15151 len. 3]: Six more !
Parsing [sent. 15152 len. 16]: The last half-dozen war n't a fair one , and must be done over again .
Parsing [sent. 15153 len. 13]: Lord bless you , what a treat it is to see you !
Parsing [sent. 15154 len. 3]: One more !
Parsing [sent. 15155 len. 8]: Well , I never was so jolly .
Parsing [sent. 15156 len. 17]: Just a few more , on account of there not being any credit in it ! '
Parsing [sent. 15157 len. 34]: When Mr Tapley stopped in these calculations in simple addition , he did it , not because he was at all tired of the exercise , but because he was out of breath .
Parsing [sent. 15158 len. 8]: The pause reminded him of other duties .
Parsing [sent. 15159 len. 12]: ` Mr Martin Chuzzlewit 's outside , ' he said . '
Parsing [sent. 15160 len. 19]: I left him under the cartshed , while I came on to see if there was anybody here .
Parsing [sent. 15161 len. 26]: We want to keep quiet to-night , till we know the news from you , and what it 's best for us to do . '
Parsing [sent. 15162 len. 20]: ` There 's not a soul in the house , except the kitchen company , ' returned the hostess .
Parsing [sent. 15163 len. 28]: ` If they were to know you had come back , Mark , they 'd have a bonfire in the street , late as it is . '
Parsing [sent. 15164 len. 51]: ` But they must n't know it to-night , my precious soul , ' said Mark ; ` so have the house shut , and the kitchen fire made up ; and when it 's all ready , put a light in the winder , and we 'll come in .
Parsing [sent. 15165 len. 3]: One more !
Parsing [sent. 15166 len. 8]: I long to hear about old friends .
Parsing [sent. 15167 len. 42]: You 'll tell me all about 'em , wo n't you ; Mr Pinch , and the butcher 's dog down the street , and the terrier over the way , and the wheelwright 's , and every one of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 15168 len. 22]: When I first caught sight of the church to-night , I thought the steeple would have choked me , I did .
Parsing [sent. 15169 len. 3]: One more !
Parsing [sent. 15170 len. 4]: Wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 15171 len. 11]: Not a very little one to finish off with ? '
Parsing [sent. 15172 len. 15]: ` You have had plenty , I am sure , ' said the hostess .
Parsing [sent. 15173 len. 9]: ` Go along with your foreign manners ! '
Parsing [sent. 15174 len. 10]: ` That ai n't foreign , bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 15175 len. 3]: cried Mark .
Parsing [sent. 15176 len. 8]: ` Native as oysters , that is !
Parsing [sent. 15177 len. 8]: One more , because it 's native !
Parsing [sent. 15178 len. 12]: As a mark of respect for the land we live in !
Parsing [sent. 15179 len. 19]: This do n't count as between you and me , you understand , ' said Mr Tapley . '
Parsing [sent. 15180 len. 11]: I ai n't a-kissing you now , you 'll observe .
Parsing [sent. 15181 len. 15]: I have been among the patriots ; I 'm a-kissin ' my country . '
Parsing [sent. 15182 len. 31]: It would have been very unreasonable to complain of the exhibition of his patriotism with which he followed up this explanation , that it was at all lukewarm or indifferent .
Parsing [sent. 15183 len. 34]: When he had given full expression to his nationality , he hurried off to Martin ; while Mrs Lupin , in a state of great agitation and excitement , prepared for their reception .
Parsing [sent. 15184 len. 31]: The company soon came tumbling out ; insisting to each other that the Dragon clock was half an hour too fast , and that the thunder must have affected it .
Parsing [sent. 15185 len. 40]: Impatient , wet , and weary though they were , Martin and Mark were overjoyed to see these old faces , and watched them with delighted interest as they departed from the house , and passed close by them .
Parsing [sent. 15186 len. 10]: ` There 's the old tailor , Mark ! '
Parsing [sent. 15187 len. 3]: whispered Martin .
Parsing [sent. 15188 len. 7]: ` There he goes , sir !
Parsing [sent. 15189 len. 16]: A little bandier than he was , I think , sir , ai n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 15190 len. 40]: His figure 's so far altered , as it seems to me , that you might wheel a rather larger barrow between his legs as he walks , than you could have done conveniently when we know 'd him .
Parsing [sent. 15191 len. 9]: There 's Sam a-coming out , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 15192 len. 8]: ` Ah , to be sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 15193 len. 9]: cried Martin ; ` Sam , the hostler .
Parsing [sent. 15194 len. 13]: I wonder whether that horse of Pecksniff 's is alive still ? '
Parsing [sent. 15195 len. 13]: ` Not a doubt on it , sir , ' returned Mark .
Parsing [sent. 15196 len. 49]: ` That 's a description of animal , sir , as will go on in a bony way peculiar to himself for a long time , and get into the newspapers at last under the title of `` Sing ` lar Tenacity of Life in a Quadruped . ''
Parsing [sent. 15197 len. 15]: As if he had ever been alive in all his life , worth mentioning !
Parsing [sent. 15198 len. 15]: There 's the clerk , sir -- wery drunk , as usual . ' '
Parsing [sent. 15199 len. 5]: I see him ! '
Parsing [sent. 15200 len. 5]: said Martin , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 15201 len. 15]: ` But , my life , how wet you are , Mark ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 15202 len. 3]: I am !
Parsing [sent. 15203 len. 9]: What do you consider yourself , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 15204 len. 21]: ` Oh , not half as bad , ' said his fellow-traveller , with an air of great vexation . '
Parsing [sent. 15205 len. 22]: I told you not to keep on the windy side , Mark , but to let us change and change about .
Parsing [sent. 15206 len. 13]: The rain has been beating on you ever since it began . '
Parsing [sent. 15207 len. 76]: ` You do n't know how it pleases me , sir , ' said Mark , after a short silence , ` if I may make so bold as say so , to hear you a-going on in that there uncommon considerate way of yours ; which I do n't mean to attend to , never , but which , ever since that time when I was floored in Eden , you have showed . '
Parsing [sent. 15208 len. 6]: ` Ah , Mark ! '
Parsing [sent. 15209 len. 13]: sighed Martin , ` the less we say of that the better .
Parsing [sent. 15210 len. 8]: Do I see the light yonder ? '
Parsing [sent. 15211 len. 7]: ` That 's the light ! '
Parsing [sent. 15212 len. 3]: cried Mark .
Parsing [sent. 15213 len. 10]: ` Lord bless her , what briskness she possesses !
Parsing [sent. 15214 len. 6]: Now for it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 15215 len. 15]: Neat wines , good beds , and first-rate entertainment for man or beast . '
Parsing [sent. 15216 len. 102]: The kitchen fire burnt clear and red , the table was spread out , the kettle boiled ; the slippers were there , the boot-jack too , sheets of ham were there , cooking on the gridiron ; half-a-dozen eggs were there , poaching in the frying-pan ; a plethoric cherry-brandy bottle was there , winking at a foaming jug of beer upon the table ; rare provisions were there , dangling from the rafters as if you had only to open your mouth , and something exquisitely ripe and good would be glad of the excuse for tumbling into it .
Parsing [sent. 15217 len. 29]: Mrs Lupin , who for their sakes had dislodged the very cook , high priestess of the temple , with her own genial hands was dressing their repast .
Parsing [sent. 15218 len. 14]: It was impossible to help it -- a ghost must have hugged her .
Parsing [sent. 15219 len. 21]: The Atlantic Ocean and the Red Sea being , in that respect , all one , Martin hugged her instantly .
Parsing [sent. 15220 len. 31]: Mr Tapley -LRB- as if the idea were quite novel , and had never occurred to him before -RRB- , followed , with much gravity , on the same side .
Parsing [sent. 15221 len. 84]: ` Little did I ever think , ' said Mrs Lupin , adjusting her cap and laughing heartily ; yes , and blushing too ; ` often as I have said that Mr Pecksniff 's young gentlemen were the life and soul of the Dragon , and that without them it would be too dull to live in -- little did I ever think I am sure , that any one of them would ever make so free as you , Mr Martin !
Parsing [sent. 15222 len. 50]: And still less that I should n't be angry with him , but should be glad with all my heart to be the first to welcome him home from America , with Mark Tapley for his -- ' ` For his friend , Mrs Lupin , ' interposed Martin .
Parsing [sent. 15223 len. 34]: ` For his friend , ' said the hostess , evidently gratified by this distinction , but at the same time admonishing Mr Tapley with a fork to remain at a respectful distance .
Parsing [sent. 15224 len. 8]: ` Little did I ever think that !
Parsing [sent. 15225 len. 30]: But still less , that I should ever have the changes to relate that I shall have to tell you of , when you have done your supper ! '
Parsing [sent. 15226 len. 5]: ` Good Heaven ! '
Parsing [sent. 15227 len. 11]: cried Martin , changing colour , ` what changes ? '
Parsing [sent. 15228 len. 20]: ` SHE , ' said the hostess , ` is quite well , and now at Mr Pecksniff 's .
Parsing [sent. 15229 len. 9]: Do n't be at all alarmed about her .
Parsing [sent. 15230 len. 7]: She is everything you could wish .
Parsing [sent. 15231 len. 16]: It 's of no use mincing matters , or making secrets , is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 15232 len. 5]: added Mrs Lupin . '
Parsing [sent. 15233 len. 10]: I know all about it , you see ! '
Parsing [sent. 15234 len. 23]: ` My good creature , ' returned Martin , ` you are exactly the person who ought to know all about it .
Parsing [sent. 15235 len. 11]: I am delighted to think you DO know about that !
Parsing [sent. 15236 len. 8]: But what changes do you hint at ?
Parsing [sent. 15237 len. 6]: Has any death occurred ? '
Parsing [sent. 15238 len. 6]: ` No , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 15239 len. 4]: said the hostess .
Parsing [sent. 15240 len. 7]: ` Not as bad as that .
Parsing [sent. 15241 len. 21]: But I declare now that I will not be drawn into saying another word till you have had your supper .
Parsing [sent. 15242 len. 17]: If you ask me fifty questions in the meantime , I wo n't answer one . '
Parsing [sent. 15243 len. 60]: She was so positive , that there was nothing for it but to get the supper over as quickly as possible ; and as they had been walking a great many miles , and had fasted since the middle of the day , they did no great violence to their own inclinations in falling on it tooth and nail .
Parsing [sent. 15244 len. 35]: It took rather longer to get through than might have been expected ; for , half-a-dozen times , when they thought they had finished , Mrs Lupin exposed the fallacy of that impression triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 15245 len. 16]: But at last , in the course of time and nature , they gave in .
Parsing [sent. 15246 len. 69]: Then , sitting with their slippered feet stretched out upon the kitchen hearth -LRB- which was wonderfully comforting , for the night had grown by this time raw and chilly -RRB- , and looking with involuntary admiration at their dimpled , buxom , blooming hostess , as the firelight sparkled in her eyes and glimmered in her raven hair , they composed themselves to listen to her news .
Parsing [sent. 15247 len. 34]: Many were the exclamations of surprise which interrupted her , when she told them of the separation between Mr Pecksniff and his daughters , and between the same good gentleman and Mr Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 15248 len. 48]: But these were nothing to the indignant demonstrations of Martin , when she related , as the common talk of the neighbourhood , what entire possession he had obtained over the mind and person of old Mr Chuzzlewit , and what high honour he designed for Mary .
Parsing [sent. 15249 len. 48]: On receipt of this intelligence , Martin 's slippers flew off in a twinkling , and he began pulling on his wet boots with that indefinite intention of going somewhere instantly , and doing something to somebody , which is the first safety-valve of a hot temper .
Parsing [sent. 15250 len. 4]: ` He ! '
Parsing [sent. 15251 len. 10]: said Martin , ` smooth-tongued villain that he is !
Parsing [sent. 15252 len. 2]: He !
Parsing [sent. 15253 len. 9]: Give me that other boot , Mark ? '
Parsing [sent. 15254 len. 12]: ` Where was you a-thinking of going to , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 15255 len. 28]: inquired Mr Tapley drying the sole at the fire , and looking coolly at it as he spoke , as if it were a slice of toast .
Parsing [sent. 15256 len. 4]: ` Where ! '
Parsing [sent. 15257 len. 3]: repeated Martin .
Parsing [sent. 15258 len. 16]: ` You do n't suppose I am going to remain here , do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 15259 len. 8]: The imperturbable Mark confessed that he did .
Parsing [sent. 15260 len. 4]: You do ! '
Parsing [sent. 15261 len. 5]: retorted Martin angrily . '
Parsing [sent. 15262 len. 7]: I am much obliged to you .
Parsing [sent. 15263 len. 9]: What do you take me for ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 15264 len. 32]: I take you for what you are , sir , ' said Mark ; ` and , consequently , am quite sure that whatever you do will be right and sensible .
Parsing [sent. 15265 len. 6]: The boot , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 15266 len. 31]: Martin darted an impatient look at him , without taking it , and walked rapidly up and down the kitchen several times , with one boot and a stocking on .
Parsing [sent. 15267 len. 30]: But , mindful of his Eden resolution , he had already gained many victories over himself when Mark was in the case , and he resolved to conquer now .
Parsing [sent. 15268 len. 38]: So he came back to the book-jack , laid his hand on Mark 's shoulder to steady himself , pulled the boot off , picked up his slippers , put them on , and sat down again .
Parsing [sent. 15269 len. 24]: He could not help thrusting his hands to the very bottom of his pockets , and muttering at intervals , ` Pecksniff too !
Parsing [sent. 15270 len. 3]: That fellow !
Parsing [sent. 15271 len. 4]: Upon my soul !
Parsing [sent. 15272 len. 2]: In-deed !
Parsing [sent. 15273 len. 4]: What next ? '
Parsing [sent. 15274 len. 47]: and so forth ; nor could he help occasionally shaking his fist at the chimney , with a very threatening countenance ; but this did not last long ; and he heard Mrs Lupin out , if not with composure , at all events in silence .
Parsing [sent. 15275 len. 47]: ` As to Mr Pecksniff himself , ' observed the hostess in conclusion , spreading out the skirts of her gown with both hands , and nodding her head a great many times as she did so , ' I do n't know what to say .
Parsing [sent. 15276 len. 15]: Somebody must have poisoned his mind , or influenced him in some extraordinary way .
Parsing [sent. 15277 len. 20]: I can not believe that such a noble-spoken gentleman would go and do wrong of his own accord ! '
Parsing [sent. 15278 len. 4]: A noble-spoken gentleman !
Parsing [sent. 15279 len. 33]: How many people are there in the world , who , for no better reason , uphold their Pecksniffs to the last and abandon virtuous men , when Pecksniffs breathe upon them !
Parsing [sent. 15280 len. 37]: ` As to Mr Pinch , ' pursued the landlady , ` if ever there was a dear , good , pleasant , worthy soul alive , Pinch , and no other , is his name .
Parsing [sent. 15281 len. 23]: But how do we know that old Mr Chuzzlewit himself was not the cause of difference arising between him and Mr Pecksniff ?
Parsing [sent. 15282 len. 49]: No one but themselves can tell ; for Mr Pinch has a proud spirit , though he has such a quiet way ; and when he left us , and was so sorry to go , he scorned to make his story good , even to me . '
Parsing [sent. 15283 len. 6]: ` Poor old Tom ! '
Parsing [sent. 15284 len. 11]: said Martin , in a tone that sounded like remorse .
Parsing [sent. 15285 len. 28]: ` It 's a comfort to know , ' resumed the landlady , ` that he has his sister living with him , and is doing well .
Parsing [sent. 15286 len. 56]: Only yesterday he sent me back , by post , a little ' -- here the colour came into her cheeks -- ' a little trifle I was bold enough to lend him when he went away ; saying , with many thanks , that he had good employment , and did n't want it .
Parsing [sent. 15287 len. 12]: It was the same note ; he had n't broken it .
Parsing [sent. 15288 len. 26]: I never thought I could have been so little pleased to see a bank-note come back to me as I was to see that . '
Parsing [sent. 15289 len. 8]: ` Kindly said , and heartily ! '
Parsing [sent. 15290 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 15291 len. 8]: ` Is it not , Mark ? '
Parsing [sent. 15292 len. 30]: ` She ca n't say anything as does not possess them qualities , ' returned Mr Tapley ; ` which as much belongs to the Dragon as its licence .
Parsing [sent. 15293 len. 23]: And now that we have got quite cool and fresh , to the subject again , sir ; what will you do ?
Parsing [sent. 15294 len. 33]: If you 're not proud , and can make up your mind to go through with what you spoke of , coming along , that 's the course for you to take .
Parsing [sent. 15295 len. 47]: If you started wrong with your grandfather -LRB- which , you 'll excuse my taking the liberty of saying , appears to have been the case -RRB- , up with you , sir , and tell him so , and make an appeal to his affections .
Parsing [sent. 15296 len. 5]: Do n't stand out .
Parsing [sent. 15297 len. 20]: He 's a great deal older than you , and if he was hasty , you was hasty too .
Parsing [sent. 15298 len. 9]: Give way , sir , give way . '
Parsing [sent. 15299 len. 56]: The eloquence of Mr Tapley was not without its effect on Martin but he still hesitated , and expressed his reason thus : ` That 's all very true , and perfectly correct , Mark ; and if it were a mere question of humbling myself before HIM , I would not consider it twice .
Parsing [sent. 15300 len. 53]: But do n't you see , that being wholly under this hypocrite 's government , and having -LRB- if what we hear be true -RRB- no mind or will of his own , I throw myself , in fact , not at his feet , but at the feet of Mr Pecksniff ?
Parsing [sent. 15301 len. 42]: And when I am rejected and spurned away , ' said Martin , turning crimson at the thought , ` it is not by him ; my own blood stirred against me ; but by Pecksniff -- Pecksniff , Mark ! '
Parsing [sent. 15302 len. 31]: ` Well , but we know beforehand , ' returned the politic Mr Tapley , ` that Pecksniff is a wagabond , a scoundrel , and a willain . ' '
Parsing [sent. 15303 len. 6]: A most pernicious villain ! '
Parsing [sent. 15304 len. 4]: said Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 15305 len. 5]: A most pernicious willain .
Parsing [sent. 15306 len. 21]: We know that beforehand , sir ; and , consequently , it 's no shame to be defeated by Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 15307 len. 4]: Blow Pecksniff ! '
Parsing [sent. 15308 len. 11]: cried Mr Tapley , in the fervour of his eloquence .
Parsing [sent. 15309 len. 5]: ` Who 's he !
Parsing [sent. 15310 len. 49]: It 's not in the natur of Pecksniff to shame US , unless he agreed with us , or done us a service ; and , in case he offered any audacity of that description , we could express our sentiments in the English language , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 15311 len. 3]: Pecksniff ! '
Parsing [sent. 15312 len. 8]: repeated Mr Tapley , with ineffable disdain .
Parsing [sent. 15313 len. 22]: ` What 's Pecksniff , who 's Pecksniff , where 's Pecksniff , that he 's to be so much considered ?
Parsing [sent. 15314 len. 66]: We 're not a-calculating for ourselves ; ' he laid uncommon emphasis on the last syllable of that word , and looked full in Martin 's face ; ` we 're making a effort for a young lady likewise as has undergone her share ; and whatever little hope we have , this here Pecksniff is not to stand in its way , I expect .
Parsing [sent. 15315 len. 15]: I never heard of any act of Parliament , as was made by Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 15316 len. 2]: Pecksniff !
Parsing [sent. 15317 len. 27]: Why , I would n't see the man myself ; I would n't hear him ; I would n't choose to know he was in company .
Parsing [sent. 15318 len. 30]: I 'd scrape my shoes on the scraper of the door , and call that Pecksniff , if you liked ; but I would n't condescend no further . '
Parsing [sent. 15319 len. 26]: The amazement of Mrs Lupin , and indeed of Mr Tapley himself for that matter , at this impassioned flow of language , was immense .
Parsing [sent. 15320 len. 23]: But Martin , after looking thoughtfully at the fire for a short time , said : ` You are right , Mark .
Parsing [sent. 15321 len. 9]: Right or wrong , it shall be done .
Parsing [sent. 15322 len. 6]: I 'll do it . '
Parsing [sent. 15323 len. 11]: ` One word more , sir , ' returned Mark .
Parsing [sent. 15324 len. 17]: ` Only think of him so far as not to give him a handle against you .
Parsing [sent. 15325 len. 15]: Do n't you do anything secret that he can report before you get there .
Parsing [sent. 15326 len. 50]: Do n't you even see Miss Mary in the morning , but let this here dear friend of ours ' -- Mr Tapley bestowed a smile upon the hostess -- ` prepare her for what 's a-going to happen , and carry any little message as may be agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 15327 len. 4]: She knows how .
Parsing [sent. 15328 len. 5]: Do n't you ? '
Parsing [sent. 15329 len. 8]: Mrs Lupin laughed and tossed her head .
Parsing [sent. 15330 len. 14]: ` Then you go in , bold and free as a gentleman should .
Parsing [sent. 15331 len. 12]: `` I have n't done nothing under-handed , '' says you .
Parsing [sent. 15332 len. 28]: `` I have n't been skulking about the premises , here I am , for-give me , I ask your pardon , God Bless You ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 15333 len. 19]: Martin smiled , but felt that it was good advice notwithstanding , and resolved to act upon it .
Parsing [sent. 15334 len. 48]: When they had ascertained from Mrs Lupin that Pecksniff had already returned from the great ceremonial at which they had beheld him in his glory ; and when they had fully arranged the order of their proceedings ; they went to bed , intent upon the morrow .
Parsing [sent. 15335 len. 43]: In pursuance of their project as agreed upon at this discussion , Mr Tapley issued forth next morning , after breakfast , charged with a letter from Martin to his grandfather , requesting leave to wait upon him for a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 15336 len. 27]: And postponing as he went along the congratulations of his numerous friends until a more convenient season , he soon arrived at Mr Pecksniff 's house .
Parsing [sent. 15337 len. 45]: At that gentleman 's door ; with a face so immovable that it would have been next to an impossibility for the most acute physiognomist to determine what he was thinking about , or whether he was thinking at all ; he straightway knocked .
Parsing [sent. 15338 len. 48]: A person of Mr Tapley 's observation could not long remain insensible to the fact that Mr Pecksniff was making the end of his nose very blunt against the glass of the parlour window , in an angular attempt to discover who had knocked at the door .
Parsing [sent. 15339 len. 35]: Nor was Mr Tapley slow to baffle this movement on the part of the enemy , by perching himself on the top step , and presenting the crown of his hat in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 15340 len. 29]: But possibly Mr Pecksniff had already seen him , for Mark soon heard his shoes creaking , as he advanced to open the door with his own hands .
Parsing [sent. 15341 len. 17]: Mr Pecksniff was as cheerful as ever , and sang a little song in the passage .
Parsing [sent. 15342 len. 8]: ` How d'ye do , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 15343 len. 3]: said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 15344 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 15345 len. 4]: cried Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 15346 len. 6]: ` Tapley , I believe ?
Parsing [sent. 15347 len. 4]: The Prodigal returned !
Parsing [sent. 15348 len. 11]: We do n't want any beer , my friend . '
Parsing [sent. 15349 len. 10]: ` Thankee , sir , ' said Mark . '
Parsing [sent. 15350 len. 9]: I could n't accommodate you if you did .
Parsing [sent. 15351 len. 5]: A letter , sir .
Parsing [sent. 15352 len. 6]: Wait for an answer . '
Parsing [sent. 15353 len. 5]: ` For me ? '
Parsing [sent. 15354 len. 4]: cried Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 15355 len. 8]: ` And an answer , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 15356 len. 19]: ` Not for you , I think , sir , ' said Mark , pointing out the direction .
Parsing [sent. 15357 len. 12]: ` Chuzzlewit , I believe the name is , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 15358 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 15359 len. 4]: returned Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 15360 len. 4]: ` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 15361 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 15362 len. 11]: Who 's it from , my good young man ? '
Parsing [sent. 15363 len. 22]: ` The gentleman it comes from wrote his name inside , sir , ' returned Mr Tapley with extreme politeness . '
Parsing [sent. 15364 len. 17]: I see him a-signing of it at the end , while I was a-waitin ' . '
Parsing [sent. 15365 len. 13]: ` And he said he wanted an answer , did he ? '
Parsing [sent. 15366 len. 9]: asked Mr Pecksniff in his most persuasive manner .
Parsing [sent. 15367 len. 6]: Mark replied in the affirmative .
Parsing [sent. 15368 len. 7]: ` He shall have an answer .
Parsing [sent. 15369 len. 29]: Certainly , ' said Mr Pecksniff , tearing the letter into small pieces , as mildly as if that were the most flattering attention a correspondent could receive .
Parsing [sent. 15370 len. 17]: ` Have the goodness to give him that , with my compliments , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 15371 len. 4]: Good morning ! '
Parsing [sent. 15372 len. 14]: Whereupon he handed Mark the scraps ; retired , and shut the door .
Parsing [sent. 15373 len. 18]: Mark thought it prudent to subdue his personal emotions , and return to Martin at the Dragon .
Parsing [sent. 15374 len. 22]: They were not unprepared for such a reception , and suffered an hour or so to elapse before making another attempt .
Parsing [sent. 15375 len. 17]: When this interval had gone by , they returned to Mr Pecksniff 's house in company .
Parsing [sent. 15376 len. 34]: Martin knocked this time , while Mr Tapley prepared himself to keep the door open with his foot and shoulder , when anybody came , and by that means secure an enforced parley .
Parsing [sent. 15377 len. 13]: But this precaution was needless , for the servant-girl appeared almost immediately .
Parsing [sent. 15378 len. 68]: Brushing quickly past her as he had resolved in such a case to do , Martin -LRB- closely followed by his faithful ally -RRB- opened the door of that parlour in which he knew a visitor was most likely to be found ; passed at once into the room ; and stood , without a word of notice or announcement , in the presence of his grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 15379 len. 11]: Mr Pecksniff also was in the room ; and Mary .
Parsing [sent. 15380 len. 27]: In the swift instant of their mutual recognition , Martin saw the old man droop his grey head , and hide his face in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 15381 len. 7]: It smote him to the heart .
Parsing [sent. 15382 len. 53]: In his most selfish and most careless day , this lingering remnant of the old man 's ancient love , this buttress of a ruined tower he had built up in the time gone by , with so much pride and hope , would have caused a pang in Martin 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 15383 len. 57]: But now , changed for the better in his worst respect ; looking through an altered medium on his former friend , the guardian of his childhood , so broken and bowed down ; resentment , sullenness , self-confidence , and pride , were all swept away , before the starting tears upon the withered cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 15384 len. 8]: He could not bear to see them .
Parsing [sent. 15385 len. 13]: He could not bear to think they fell at sight of him .
Parsing [sent. 15386 len. 16]: He could not bear to view reflected in them , the reproachful and irrevocable Past .
Parsing [sent. 15387 len. 21]: He hurriedly advanced to seize the old man 's hand in his , when Mr Pecksniff interposed himself between them .
Parsing [sent. 15388 len. 7]: ` No , young man ! '
Parsing [sent. 15389 len. 29]: said Mr Pecksniff , striking himself upon the breast , and stretching out his other arm towards his guest as if it were a wing to shelter him .
Parsing [sent. 15390 len. 5]: ` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 15391 len. 4]: None of that .
Parsing [sent. 15392 len. 7]: Strike here , sir , here !
Parsing [sent. 15393 len. 20]: Launch your arrows at me , sir , if you 'll have the goodness ; not at Him ! '
Parsing [sent. 15394 len. 4]: ` Grandfather ! '
Parsing [sent. 15395 len. 3]: cried Martin .
Parsing [sent. 15396 len. 4]: ` Hear me !
Parsing [sent. 15397 len. 9]: I implore you , let me speak ! '
Parsing [sent. 15398 len. 6]: ` Would you , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 15399 len. 4]: Would you ? '
Parsing [sent. 15400 len. 16]: said Mr Pecksniff , dodging about , so as to keep himself always between them .
Parsing [sent. 15401 len. 104]: ` Is it not enough , sir , that you come into my house like a thief in the night , or I should rather say , for we can never be too particular on the subject of Truth , like a thief in the day-time ; bringing your dissolute companions with you , to plant themselves with their backs against the insides of parlour doors , and prevent the entrance or issuing forth of any of my household ' -- Mark had taken up this position , and held it quite unmoved -- ` but would you also strike at venerable Virtue ?
Parsing [sent. 15402 len. 3]: Would you ?
Parsing [sent. 15403 len. 7]: Know that it is not defenceless .
Parsing [sent. 15404 len. 9]: I will be its shield , young man .
Parsing [sent. 15405 len. 3]: Assail me .
Parsing [sent. 15406 len. 5]: Come on , sir .
Parsing [sent. 15407 len. 4]: Fire away ! '
Parsing [sent. 15408 len. 14]: ` Pecksniff , ' said the old man , in a feeble voice .
Parsing [sent. 15409 len. 4]: ` Calm yourself .
Parsing [sent. 15410 len. 5]: Be quiet . ' '
Parsing [sent. 15411 len. 19]: I ca n't be calm , ' cried Mr Pecksniff , ` and I wo n't be quiet .
Parsing [sent. 15412 len. 6]: My benefactor and my friend !
Parsing [sent. 15413 len. 13]: Shall even my house be no refuge for your hoary pillow ! '
Parsing [sent. 15414 len. 5]: ` Stand aside ! '
Parsing [sent. 15415 len. 26]: said the old man , stretching out his hand ; ` and let me see what it is I used to love so dearly . '
Parsing [sent. 15416 len. 18]: ` It is right that you should see it , my friend , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 15417 len. 14]: ` It is well that you should see it , my noble sir .
Parsing [sent. 15418 len. 13]: It is desirable that you should contemplate it in its true proportions .
Parsing [sent. 15419 len. 3]: Behold it !
Parsing [sent. 15420 len. 6]: There it is , sir .
Parsing [sent. 15421 len. 5]: There it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 15422 len. 27]: Martin could hardly be a mortal man , and not express in his face something of the anger and disdain with which Mr Pecksniff inspired him .
Parsing [sent. 15423 len. 16]: But beyond this he evinced no knowledge whatever of that gentleman 's presence or existence .
Parsing [sent. 15424 len. 43]: True , he had once , and that at first , glanced at him involuntarily , and with supreme contempt ; but for any other heed he took of him , there might have been nothing in his place save empty air .
Parsing [sent. 15425 len. 76]: As Mr Pecksniff withdrew from between them , agreeably to the wish just now expressed -LRB- which he did during the delivery of the observations last recorded -RRB- , old Martin , who had taken Mary Graham 's hand in his , and whispered kindly to her , as telling her she had no cause to be alarmed , gently pushed her from him , behind his chair ; and looked steadily at his grandson .
Parsing [sent. 15426 len. 12]: ` And that , ' he said , ` is he .
Parsing [sent. 15427 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 15428 len. 4]: that is he !
Parsing [sent. 15429 len. 7]: Say what you wish to say .
Parsing [sent. 15430 len. 39]: But come no nearer , ' ` His sense of justice is so fine , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` that he will hear even him , although he knows beforehand that nothing can come of it .
Parsing [sent. 15431 len. 4]: Ingenuous mind ! '
Parsing [sent. 15432 len. 36]: Mr Pecksniff did not address himself immediately to any person in saying this , but assuming the position of the Chorus in a Greek Tragedy , delivered his opinion as a commentary on the proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 15433 len. 4]: ` Grandfather ! '
Parsing [sent. 15434 len. 7]: said Martin , with great earnestness .
Parsing [sent. 15435 len. 39]: ` From a painful journey , from a hard life , from a sick-bed , from privation and distress , from gloom and disappointment , from almost hopelessness and despair , I have come back to you . '
Parsing [sent. 15436 len. 37]: ` Rovers of this sort , ' observed Mr Pecksniff , as Chorus , ` very commonly come back when they find they do n't meet with the success they expected in their marauding ravages . '
Parsing [sent. 15437 len. 58]: ` But for this faithful man , ' said Martin , turning towards Mark , ` whom I first knew in this place , and who went away with me voluntarily , as a servant , but has been , throughout , my zealous and devoted friend ; but for him , I must have died abroad .
Parsing [sent. 15438 len. 48]: Far from home , far from any help or consolation ; far from the probability even of my wretched fate being ever known to any one who cared to hear it -- oh , that you would let me say , of being known to you ! '
Parsing [sent. 15439 len. 8]: The old man looked at Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 15440 len. 6]: Mr Pecksniff looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 15441 len. 10]: ` Did you speak , my worthy sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 15442 len. 8]: said Mr Pecksniff , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 15443 len. 9]: The old man answered in the negative . '
Parsing [sent. 15444 len. 15]: I know what you thought , ' said Mr Pecksniff , with another smile .
Parsing [sent. 15445 len. 8]: ` Let him go on my friend .
Parsing [sent. 15446 len. 14]: The development of self-interest in the human mind is always a curious study .
Parsing [sent. 15447 len. 8]: Let him go on , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 15448 len. 5]: ` Go on ! '
Parsing [sent. 15449 len. 20]: observed the old man ; in a mechanical obedience , it appeared , to Mr Pecksniff 's suggestion . '
Parsing [sent. 15450 len. 39]: I have been so wretched and so poor , ' said Martin , ` that I am indebted to the charitable help of a stranger , in a land of strangers , for the means of returning here .
Parsing [sent. 15451 len. 12]: All this tells against me in your mind , I know .
Parsing [sent. 15452 len. 32]: I have given you cause to think I have been driven here wholly by want , and have not been led on , in any degree , by affection or regret .
Parsing [sent. 15453 len. 19]: When I parted from you , Grandfather , I deserved that suspicion , but I do not now .
Parsing [sent. 15454 len. 6]: I do not now . '
Parsing [sent. 15455 len. 12]: The Chorus put its hand in its waistcoat , and smiled .
Parsing [sent. 15456 len. 15]: ` Let him go on , my worthy sir , ' it said . '
Parsing [sent. 15457 len. 16]: I know what you are thinking of , but do n't express it prematurely . '
Parsing [sent. 15458 len. 34]: Old Martin raised his eyes to Mr Pecksniff 's face , and appearing to derive renewed instruction from his looks and words , said , once again : ` Go on ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 15459 len. 11]: I have little more to say , ' returned Martin .
Parsing [sent. 15460 len. 33]: ` And as I say it now , with little or no hope , Grandfather ; whatever dawn of hope I had on entering the room ; believe it to be true .
Parsing [sent. 15461 len. 10]: At least , believe it to be true . '
Parsing [sent. 15462 len. 5]: ` Beautiful Truth ! '
Parsing [sent. 15463 len. 7]: exclaimed the Chorus , looking upward .
Parsing [sent. 15464 len. 10]: ` How is your name profaned by vicious persons !
Parsing [sent. 15465 len. 20]: You do n't live in a well , my holy principle , but on the lips of false mankind .
Parsing [sent. 15466 len. 26]: It is hard to bear with mankind , dear sir ' -- addressing the elder Mr Chuzzlewit ; ` but let us do so meekly .
Parsing [sent. 15467 len. 8]: It is our duty so to do .
Parsing [sent. 15468 len. 11]: Let us be among the Few who do their duty .
Parsing [sent. 15469 len. 51]: If , ' pursued the Chorus , soaring up into a lofty flight , ` as the poet informs us , England expects Every man to do his duty , England is the most sanguine country on the face of the earth , and will find itself continually disappointed . '
Parsing [sent. 15470 len. 62]: ` Upon that subject , ' said Martin , looking calmly at the old man as he spoke , but glancing once at Mary , whose face was now buried in her hands , upon the back of his easy-chair ; ` upon that subject which first occasioned a division between us , my mind and heart are incapable of change .
Parsing [sent. 15471 len. 22]: Whatever influence they have undergone , since that unhappy time , has not been one to weaken but to strengthen me .
Parsing [sent. 15472 len. 18]: I can not profess sorrow for that , nor irresolution in that , nor shame in that .
Parsing [sent. 15473 len. 9]: Nor would you wish me , I know .
Parsing [sent. 15474 len. 65]: But that I might have trusted to your love , if I had thrown myself manfully upon it ; that I might have won you over with ease , if I had been more yielding and more considerate ; that I should have best remembered myself in forgetting myself , and recollecting you ; reflection , solitude , and misery , have taught me .
Parsing [sent. 15475 len. 47]: I came resolved to say this , and to ask your forgiveness ; not so much in hope for the future , as in regret for the past ; for all that I would ask of you is , that you would aid me to live .
Parsing [sent. 15476 len. 15]: Help me to get honest work to do , and I would do it .
Parsing [sent. 15477 len. 27]: My condition places me at the disadvantage of seeming to have only my selfish ends to serve , but try if that be so or not .
Parsing [sent. 15478 len. 24]: Try if I be self-willed , obdurate , and haughty , as I was ; or have been disciplined in a rough school .
Parsing [sent. 15479 len. 29]: Let the voice of nature and association plead between us , Grandfather ; and do not , for one fault , however thankless , quite reject me ! '
Parsing [sent. 15480 len. 24]: As he ceased , the grey head of the old man drooped again ; and he concealed his face behind his outspread fingers .
Parsing [sent. 15481 len. 23]: ` My dear sir , ' cried Mr Pecksniff , bending over him , ` you must not give way to this .
Parsing [sent. 15482 len. 32]: It is very natural , and very amiable , but you must not allow the shameless conduct of one whom you long ago cast off , to move you so far .
Parsing [sent. 15483 len. 3]: Rouse yourself .
Parsing [sent. 15484 len. 16]: Think , ' said Pecksniff , ` think of Me , my friend . ' '
Parsing [sent. 15485 len. 14]: I will , ' returned old Martin , looking up into his face .
Parsing [sent. 15486 len. 7]: ` You recall me to myself .
Parsing [sent. 15487 len. 4]: I will . '
Parsing [sent. 15488 len. 59]: ` Why , what , ' said Mr Pecksniff , sitting down beside him in a chair which he drew up for the purpose , and tapping him playfully on the arm , ` what is the matter with my strong-minded compatriot , if I may venture to take the liberty of calling him by that endearing expression ?
Parsing [sent. 15489 len. 17]: Shall I have to scold my coadjutor , or to reason with an intellect like this ?
Parsing [sent. 15490 len. 5]: I think not . '
Parsing [sent. 15491 len. 5]: ` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 15492 len. 12]: There is no occasion , ' said the old man . '
Parsing [sent. 15493 len. 4]: A momentary feeling .
Parsing [sent. 15494 len. 4]: Nothing more . '
Parsing [sent. 15495 len. 29]: ` Indignation , ' observed Mr Pecksniff , ` WILL bring the scalding tear into the honest eye , I know ' -- he wiped his own elaborately .
Parsing [sent. 15496 len. 11]: ` But we have highest duties to perform than that .
Parsing [sent. 15497 len. 6]: Rouse yourself , Mr Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 15498 len. 12]: Shall I give expression to your thoughts , my friend ? '
Parsing [sent. 15499 len. 36]: ` Yes , ' said old Martin , leaning back in his chair , and looking at him , half in vacancy and half in admiration , as if he were fascinated by the man .
Parsing [sent. 15500 len. 10]: ` Speak for me , Pecksniff , Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 15501 len. 6]: You are true to me .
Parsing [sent. 15502 len. 4]: Thank you ! '
Parsing [sent. 15503 len. 28]: ` Do not unman me , sir , ' said Mr Pecksniff , shaking his hand vigorously , ` or I shall be unequal to the task .
Parsing [sent. 15504 len. 49]: It is not agreeable to my feelings , my good sir , to address the person who is now before us , for when I ejected him from this house , after hearing of his unnatural conduct from your lips , I renounced communication with him for ever .
Parsing [sent. 15505 len. 10]: But you desire it ; and that is sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 15506 len. 3]: Young man !
Parsing [sent. 15507 len. 11]: The door is immediately behind the companion of your infamy .
Parsing [sent. 15508 len. 16]: Blush if you can ; begone without a blush , if you ca n't . '
Parsing [sent. 15509 len. 19]: Martin looked as steadily at his grandfather as if there had been a dead silence all this time .
Parsing [sent. 15510 len. 11]: The old man looked no less steadily at Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 15511 len. 52]: ` When I ordered you to leave this house upon the last occasion of your being dismissed from it with disgrace , ' said Mr Pecksniff ; ` when , stung and stimulated beyond endurance by your shameless conduct to this extraordinarily noble-minded individual , I exclaimed `` Go forth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15512 len. 10]: I told you that I wept for your depravity .
Parsing [sent. 15513 len. 20]: Do not suppose that the tear which stands in my eye at this moment , is shed for you .
Parsing [sent. 15514 len. 8]: It is shed for him , sir .
Parsing [sent. 15515 len. 7]: It is shed for him . '
Parsing [sent. 15516 len. 31]: Here Mr Pecksniff , accidentally dropping the tear in question on a bald part of Mr Chuzzlewit 's head , wiped the place with his pocket-handkerchief , and begged pardon .
Parsing [sent. 15517 len. 39]: ` It is shed for him , sir , whom you seek to make the victim of your arts , ' said Mr Pecksniff ; ` whom you seek to plunder , to deceive , and to mislead .
Parsing [sent. 15518 len. 27]: It is shed in sympathy with him , and admiration of him ; not in pity for him , for happily he knows what you are .
Parsing [sent. 15519 len. 29]: You shall not wrong him further , sir , in any way , ' said Mr Pecksniff , quite transported with enthusiasm , ` while I have life .
Parsing [sent. 15520 len. 9]: You may bestride my senseless corse , sir .
Parsing [sent. 15521 len. 5]: That is very likely .
Parsing [sent. 15522 len. 17]: I can imagine a mind like yours deriving great satisfaction from any measure of that kind .
Parsing [sent. 15523 len. 21]: But while I continue to be called upon to exist , sir , you must strike at him through me .
Parsing [sent. 15524 len. 3]: Awe ! '
Parsing [sent. 15525 len. 33]: said Mr Pecksniff , shaking his head at Martin with indignant jocularity ; ` and in such a cause you will find me , my young sir , an Ugly Customer ! '
Parsing [sent. 15526 len. 10]: Still Martin looked steadily and mildly at his grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 15527 len. 21]: ` Will you give me no answer , ' he said , at length , ` not a word ? '
Parsing [sent. 15528 len. 30]: ` You hear what has been said , ' replied the old man , without averting his eyes from the face of Mr Pecksniff ; who nodded encouragingly . '
Parsing [sent. 15529 len. 7]: I have not heard your voice .
Parsing [sent. 15530 len. 11]: I have not heard your spirit , ' returned Martin .
Parsing [sent. 15531 len. 21]: ` Tell him again , ' said the old man , still gazing up in Mr Pecksniff 's face . '
Parsing [sent. 15532 len. 45]: I only hear , ' replied Martin , strong in his purpose from the first , and stronger in it as he felt how Pecksniff winced and shrunk beneath his contempt ; ' I only hear what you say to me , grandfather . '
Parsing [sent. 15533 len. 81]: Perhaps it was well for Mr Pecksniff that his venerable friend found in his -LRB- Mr Pecksniff 's -RRB- features an exclusive and engrossing object of contemplation , for if his eyes had gone astray , and he had compared young Martin 's bearing with that of his zealous defender , the latter disinterested gentleman would scarcely have shown to greater advantage than on the memorable afternoon when he took Tom Pinch 's last receipt in full of all demands .
Parsing [sent. 15534 len. 42]: One really might have thought there was some quality in Mr Pecksniff -- an emanation from the brightness and purity within him perhaps -- which set off and adorned his foes ; they looked so gallant and so manly beside him .
Parsing [sent. 15535 len. 6]: ` Not a word ? '
Parsing [sent. 15536 len. 9]: said Martin , for the second time . '
Parsing [sent. 15537 len. 18]: I remember that I have a word to say , Pecksniff , ' observed the old man .
Parsing [sent. 15538 len. 5]: ` But a word .
Parsing [sent. 15539 len. 20]: You spoke of being indebted to the charitable help of some stranger for the means of returning to England .
Parsing [sent. 15540 len. 4]: Who is he ?
Parsing [sent. 15541 len. 11]: And what help in money did he render you ? '
Parsing [sent. 15542 len. 25]: Although he asked this question of Martin , he did not look towards him , but kept his eyes on Mr Pecksniff as before .
Parsing [sent. 15543 len. 25]: It appeared to have become a habit with him , both in a literal and figurative sense , to look to Mr Pecksniff alone .
Parsing [sent. 15544 len. 26]: Martin took out his pencil , tore a leaf from his pocket-book , and hastily wrote down the particulars of his debt to Mr Bevan .
Parsing [sent. 15545 len. 27]: The old man stretched out his hand for the paper , and took it ; but his eyes did not wander from Mr Pecksniff 's face .
Parsing [sent. 15546 len. 48]: ` It would be a poor pride and a false humility , ' said Martin , in a low voice , ` to say , I do not wish that to be paid , or that I have any present hope of being able to pay it .
Parsing [sent. 15547 len. 15]: But I never felt my poverty so deeply as I feel it now . '
Parsing [sent. 15548 len. 14]: ` Read it to me , Pecksniff , ' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 15549 len. 24]: Mr Pecksniff , after approaching the perusal of the paper as if it were a manuscript confession of a murder , complied . '
Parsing [sent. 15550 len. 19]: I think , Pecksniff , ' said old Martin , ' I could wish that to be discharged .
Parsing [sent. 15551 len. 35]: I should not like the lender , who was abroad , who had no opportunity of making inquiry , and who did -LRB- as he thought -RRB- a kind action , to suffer . '
Parsing [sent. 15552 len. 9]: ` An honourable sentiment , my dear sir .
Parsing [sent. 15553 len. 4]: Your own entirely .
Parsing [sent. 15554 len. 17]: But a dangerous precedent , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` permit me to suggest . '
Parsing [sent. 15555 len. 14]: ` It shall not be a precedent , ' returned the old man .
Parsing [sent. 15556 len. 9]: ` It is the only recognition of him .
Parsing [sent. 15557 len. 8]: But we will talk of it again .
Parsing [sent. 15558 len. 5]: You shall advise me .
Parsing [sent. 15559 len. 6]: There is nothing else ? '
Parsing [sent. 15560 len. 38]: ` Nothing else , ' said Mr Pecksniff buoyantly , ` but for you to recover this intrusion -- this cowardly and indefensible outrage on your feelings -- with all possible dispatch , and smile again . '
Parsing [sent. 15561 len. 9]: ` You have nothing more to say ? '
Parsing [sent. 15562 len. 17]: inquired the old man , laying his hand with unusual earnestness on Mr Pecksniff 's sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 15563 len. 11]: Mr Pecksniff would not say what rose to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 15564 len. 8]: For reproaches he observed , were useless .
Parsing [sent. 15565 len. 9]: ` You have nothing at all to urge ?
Parsing [sent. 15566 len. 6]: You are sure of that !
Parsing [sent. 15567 len. 13]: If you have , no matter what it is , speak freely .
Parsing [sent. 15568 len. 16]: I will oppose nothing that you ask of me , ' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 15569 len. 44]: The tears rose in such abundance to Mr Pecksniff 's eyes at this proof of unlimited confidence on the part of his friend , that he was fain to clasp the bridge of his nose convulsively before he could at all compose himself .
Parsing [sent. 15570 len. 38]: When he had the power of utterance again , he said with great emotion , that he hoped he should live to deserve this ; and added , that he had no other observation whatever to make .
Parsing [sent. 15571 len. 37]: For a few moments the old man sat looking at him , with that blank and motionless expression which is not uncommon in the faces of those whose faculties are on the wane , in age .
Parsing [sent. 15572 len. 23]: But he rose up firmly too , and walked towards the door , from which Mark withdrew to make way for him .
Parsing [sent. 15573 len. 8]: The obsequious Mr Pecksniff proffered his arm .
Parsing [sent. 15574 len. 6]: The old man took it .
Parsing [sent. 15575 len. 23]: Turning at the door , he said to Martin , waving him off with his hand , ` You have heard him .
Parsing [sent. 15576 len. 3]: Go away .
Parsing [sent. 15577 len. 5]: It is all over .
Parsing [sent. 15578 len. 3]: Go ! '
Parsing [sent. 15579 len. 58]: Mr Pecksniff murmured certain cheering expressions of sympathy and encouragement as they retired ; and Martin , awakening from the stupor into which the closing portion of this scene had plunged him , to the opportunity afforded by their departure , caught the innocent cause of all in his embrace , and pressed her to his heart .
Parsing [sent. 15580 len. 5]: ` Dear girl ! '
Parsing [sent. 15581 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 15582 len. 7]: ` He has not changed you .
Parsing [sent. 15583 len. 13]: Why , what an impotent and harmless knave the fellow is ! '
Parsing [sent. 15584 len. 8]: ` You have restrained yourself so nobly !
Parsing [sent. 15585 len. 7]: You have borne so much ! '
Parsing [sent. 15586 len. 5]: ` Restrained myself ! '
Parsing [sent. 15587 len. 5]: cried Martin , cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 15588 len. 12]: ` You were by , and were unchanged , I knew .
Parsing [sent. 15589 len. 7]: What more advantage did I want ?
Parsing [sent. 15590 len. 25]: The sight of me was such a bitterness to the dog , that I had my triumph in his being forced to endure it .
Parsing [sent. 15591 len. 28]: But tell me , love -- for the few hasty words we can exchange now are precious -- what is this which has been rumoured to me ?
Parsing [sent. 15592 len. 15]: Is it true that you are persecuted by this knave 's addresses ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 15593 len. 25]: I was , dear Martin , and to some extent am now ; but my chief source of unhappiness has been anxiety for you .
Parsing [sent. 15594 len. 11]: Why did you leave us in such terrible suspense ? '
Parsing [sent. 15595 len. 71]: ` Sickness , distance ; the dread of hinting at our real condition , the impossibility of concealing it except in perfect silence ; the knowledge that the truth would have pained you infinitely more than uncertainty and doubt , ' said Martin , hurriedly ; as indeed everything else was done and said , in those few hurried moments , ` were the causes of my writing only once .
Parsing [sent. 15596 len. 3]: But Pecksniff ?
Parsing [sent. 15597 len. 43]: You need n't fear to tell me the whole tale ; for you saw me with him face to face , hearing him speak , and not taking him by the throat ; what is the history of his pursuit of you ?
Parsing [sent. 15598 len. 8]: Is it known to my grandfather ? '
Parsing [sent. 15599 len. 4]: ` Yes . '
Parsing [sent. 15600 len. 9]: ` And he assists him in it ? '
Parsing [sent. 15601 len. 8]: ` No , ' she answered eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 15602 len. 5]: ` Thank Heaven ! '
Parsing [sent. 15603 len. 17]: cried Martin , ` that it leaves his mind unclouded in that one respect ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 15604 len. 18]: I do not think , ' said Mary , ` it was known to him at first .
Parsing [sent. 15605 len. 17]: When this man had sufficiently prepared his mind , he revealed it to him by degrees .
Parsing [sent. 15606 len. 21]: I think so , but I only know it from my own impression : now from anything they told me .
Parsing [sent. 15607 len. 8]: Then he spoke to me alone . '
Parsing [sent. 15608 len. 6]: ` My grandfather did ? '
Parsing [sent. 15609 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 15610 len. 24]: ` Yes -- spoke to me alone , and told me -- ' ` What the hound had said , ' cried Martin .
Parsing [sent. 15611 len. 7]: ` Do n't repeat it . '
Parsing [sent. 15612 len. 29]: ` And said I knew well what qualities he possessed ; that he was moderately rich ; in good repute ; and high in his favour and confidence .
Parsing [sent. 15613 len. 29]: But seeing me very much distressed , he said that he would not control or force my inclinations , but would content himself with telling me the fact .
Parsing [sent. 15614 len. 31]: He would not pain me by dwelling on it , or reverting to it ; nor has he ever done so since , but has truly kept his word . '
Parsing [sent. 15615 len. 5]: ` The man himself ?
Parsing [sent. 15616 len. 5]: -- ' asked Martin .
Parsing [sent. 15617 len. 11]: ` He has had few opportunities of pursuing his suit .
Parsing [sent. 15618 len. 16]: I have never walked out alone , or remained alone an instant in his presence .
Parsing [sent. 15619 len. 24]: Dear Martin , I must tell you , ' she continued , ` that the kindness of your grandfather to me remains unchanged .
Parsing [sent. 15620 len. 6]: I am his companion still .
Parsing [sent. 15621 len. 31]: An indescribable tenderness and compassion seem to have mingled themselves with his old regard ; and if I were his only child , I could not have a gentler father .
Parsing [sent. 15622 len. 79]: What former fancy or old habit survives in this , when his heart has turned so cold to you , is a mystery I can not penetrate ; but it has been , and it is , a happiness to me , that I remained true to him ; that if he should wake from his delusion , even at the point of death , I am here , love , to recall you to his thoughts . '
Parsing [sent. 15623 len. 17]: Martin looked with admiration on her glowing face , and pressed his lips to hers . '
Parsing [sent. 15624 len. 69]: I have sometimes heard , and read , ' she said , ` that those whose powers had been enfeebled long ago , and whose lives had faded , as it were , into a dream , have been known to rouse themselves before death , and inquire for familiar faces once very dear to them ; but forgotten , unrecognized , hated even , in the meantime .
Parsing [sent. 15625 len. 29]: Think , if with his old impressions of this man , he should suddenly resume his former self , and find in him his only friend ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 15626 len. 29]: I would not urge you to abandon him , dearest , ' said Martin , ` though I could count the years we are to wear out asunder .
Parsing [sent. 15627 len. 16]: But the influence this fellow exercises over him has steadily increased , I fear . '
Parsing [sent. 15628 len. 7]: She could not help admitting that .
Parsing [sent. 15629 len. 14]: Steadily , imperceptibly , and surely , until it was paramount and supreme .
Parsing [sent. 15630 len. 19]: She herself had none ; and yet he treated her with more affection than at any previous time .
Parsing [sent. 15631 len. 12]: Martin thought the inconsistency a part of his weakness and decay .
Parsing [sent. 15632 len. 9]: ` Does the influence extend to fear ? '
Parsing [sent. 15633 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 15634 len. 16]: ` Is he timid of asserting his own opinion in the presence of this infatuation ?
Parsing [sent. 15635 len. 8]: I fancied so just now . ' '
Parsing [sent. 15636 len. 7]: I have thought so , often .
Parsing [sent. 15637 len. 47]: Often when we are sitting alone , almost as we used to do , and I have been reading a favourite book to him or he has been talking quite cheerfully , I have observed that the entrance of Mr Pecksniff has changed his whole demeanour .
Parsing [sent. 15638 len. 14]: He has broken off immediately , and become what you have seen to-day .
Parsing [sent. 15639 len. 28]: When we first came here he had his impetuous outbreaks , in which it was not easy for Mr Pecksniff with his utmost plausibility to appease him .
Parsing [sent. 15640 len. 8]: But these have long since dwindled away .
Parsing [sent. 15641 len. 28]: He defers to him in everything , and has no opinion upon any question , but that which is forced upon him by this treacherous man . '
Parsing [sent. 15642 len. 45]: Such was the account , rapidly furnished in whispers , and interrupted , brief as it was , by many false alarms of Mr Pecksniff 's return ; which Martin received of his grandfather 's decline , and of that good gentleman 's ascendancy .
Parsing [sent. 15643 len. 159]: He heard of Tom Pinch too , and Jonas too , with not a little about himself into the bargain ; for though lovers are remarkable for leaving a great deal unsaid on all occasions , and very properly desiring to come back and say it , they are remarkable also for a wonderful power of condensation , and can , in one way or other , give utterance to more language -- eloquent language -- in any given short space of time , than all the six hundred and fifty-eight members in the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ; who are strong lovers no doubt , but of their country only , which makes all the difference ; for in a passion of that kind -LRB- which is not always returned -RRB- , it is the custom to use as many words as possible , and express nothing whatever .
Parsing [sent. 15644 len. 99]: A caution from Mr Tapley ; a hasty interchange of farewells , and of something else which the proverb says must not be told of afterwards ; a white hand held out to Mr Tapley himself , which he kissed with the devotion of a knight-errant ; more farewells , more something else 's ; a parting word from Martin that he would write from London and would do great things there yet -LRB- Heaven knows what , but he quite believed it -RRB- ; and Mark and he stood on the outside of the Pecksniffian halls . '
Parsing [sent. 15645 len. 9]: A short interview after such an absence ! '
Parsing [sent. 15646 len. 5]: said Martin , sorrowfully .
Parsing [sent. 15647 len. 10]: ` But we are well out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 15648 len. 21]: We might have placed ourselves in a false position by remaining there , even so long , Mark . ' '
Parsing [sent. 15649 len. 39]: I do n't know about ourselves , sir , ' he returned ; ` but somebody else would have got into a false position , if he had happened to come back again , while we was there .
Parsing [sent. 15650 len. 9]: I had the door all ready , sir .
Parsing [sent. 15651 len. 26]: If Pecksniff had showed his head , or had only so much as listened behind it , I would have caught him like a walnut .
Parsing [sent. 15652 len. 24]: He 's the sort of man , ' added Mr Tapley , musing , ` as would squeeze soft , I know . '
Parsing [sent. 15653 len. 18]: A person who was evidently going to Mr Pecksniff 's house , passed them at this moment .
Parsing [sent. 15654 len. 29]: He raised his eyes at the mention of the architect 's name ; and when he had gone on a few yards , stopped and gazed at them .
Parsing [sent. 15655 len. 30]: Mr Tapley , also , looked over his shoulder , and so did Martin ; for the stranger , as he passed , had looked very sharply at them .
Parsing [sent. 15656 len. 10]: ` Who may that be , I wonder ! '
Parsing [sent. 15657 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 15658 len. 17]: ` The face seems familiar to me , but I do n't know the man . '
Parsing [sent. 15659 len. 31]: ` He seems to have a amiable desire that his face should be tolerable familiar to us , ' said Mr Tapley , ` for he 's a-staring pretty hard .
Parsing [sent. 15660 len. 18]: He 'd better not waste his beauty , for he ai n't got much to spare . '
Parsing [sent. 15661 len. 16]: Coming in sight of the Dragon , they saw a travelling carriage at the door .
Parsing [sent. 15662 len. 9]: ` And a Salisbury carriage , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 15663 len. 4]: said Mr Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 15664 len. 11]: ` That 's what he came in depend upon it .
Parsing [sent. 15665 len. 7]: What 's in the wind now ?
Parsing [sent. 15666 len. 9]: A new pupil , I should n't wonder .
Parsing [sent. 15667 len. 18]: P'raps it 's a order for another grammar-school , of the same pattern as the last . '
Parsing [sent. 15668 len. 32]: Before they could enter at the door , Mrs Lupin came running out ; and beckoning them to the carriage showed them a portmanteau with the name of CHUZZLEWIT upon it .
Parsing [sent. 15669 len. 17]: ` Miss Pecksniff 's husband that was , ' said the good woman to Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 15670 len. 23]: I did n't know what terms you might be on , and was quite in a worry till you came back . '
Parsing [sent. 15671 len. 40]: ` He and I have never interchanged a word yet , ' observed Martin ; ` and as I have no wish to be better or worse acquainted with him , I will not put myself in his way .
Parsing [sent. 15672 len. 12]: We passed him on the road , I have no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 15673 len. 11]: I am glad he timed his coming as he did .
Parsing [sent. 15674 len. 4]: Upon my word !
Parsing [sent. 15675 len. 9]: Miss Pecksniff 's husband travels gayly ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 15676 len. 30]: A very fine-looking gentleman with him -- in the best room now , ' whispered Mrs Lupin , glancing up at the window as they went into the house .
Parsing [sent. 15677 len. 24]: ` He has ordered everything that can be got for dinner ; and has the glossiest moustaches and whiskers ever you saw . '
Parsing [sent. 15678 len. 5]: ` Has he ? '
Parsing [sent. 15679 len. 28]: cried Martin , ` why then we 'll endeavour to avoid him too , in the hope that our self-denial may be strong enough for the sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 15680 len. 25]: It is only for a few hours , ' said Martin , dropping wearily into a chair behind the little screen in the bar .
Parsing [sent. 15681 len. 22]: ` Our visit has met with no success , my dear Mrs Lupin , and I must go to London . '
Parsing [sent. 15682 len. 6]: ` Dear , dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 15683 len. 4]: cried the hostess .
Parsing [sent. 15684 len. 19]: ` Yes , one foul wind no more makes a winter , than one swallow makes a summer .
Parsing [sent. 15685 len. 6]: I 'll try it again .
Parsing [sent. 15686 len. 5]: Tom Pinch has succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 15687 len. 13]: With his advice to guide me , I may do the same .
Parsing [sent. 15688 len. 14]: I took Tom under my protection once , God save the mark ! '
Parsing [sent. 15689 len. 17]: said Martin , with a melancholy smile ; ` and promised I would make his fortune .
Parsing [sent. 15690 len. 20]: Perhaps Tom will take me under HIS protection now , and teach me how to earn my bread . '
Parsing [sent. 15691 len. 45]: CHAPTER FORTY -- FOUR FURTHER CONTINUATION OF THE ENTERPRISE OF MR JONAS AND HIS FRIEND It was a special quality , among the many admirable qualities possessed by Mr Pecksniff , that the more he was found out , the more hypocrisy he practised .
Parsing [sent. 15692 len. 21]: Let him be discomfited in one quarter , and he refreshed and recompensed himself by carrying the war into another .
Parsing [sent. 15693 len. 36]: If his workings and windings were detected by A , so much the greater reason was there for practicing without loss of time on B , if it were only to keep his hand in .
Parsing [sent. 15694 len. 23]: He had never been such a saintly and improving spectacle to all about him , as after his detection by Thomas Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 15695 len. 35]: He had scarcely ever been at once so tender in his humanity , and so dignified and exalted in his virtue , as when young Martin 's scorn was fresh and hot upon him .
Parsing [sent. 15696 len. 48]: Having this large stock of superfluous sentiment and morality on hand which must positively be cleared off at any sacrifice , Mr Pecksniff no sooner heard his son-in-law announced , than he regarded him as a kind of wholesale or general order , to be immediately executed .
Parsing [sent. 15697 len. 36]: Descending , therefore , swiftly to the parlour , and clasping the young man in his arms , he exclaimed , with looks and gestures that denoted the perturbation of his spirit : ` Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 15698 len. 7]: My child -- she is well !
Parsing [sent. 15699 len. 7]: There is nothing the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 15700 len. 13]: ` What , you 're at it again , are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 15701 len. 4]: replied his son-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 15702 len. 5]: ` Even with me ?
Parsing [sent. 15703 len. 9]: Get away with you , will you ? '
Parsing [sent. 15704 len. 13]: ` Tell me she is well then , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 15705 len. 10]: ` Tell me she is well my boy ! '
Parsing [sent. 15706 len. 13]: ` She 's well enough , ' retorted Jonas , disengaging himself .
Parsing [sent. 15707 len. 10]: ` There 's nothing the matter with HER . '
Parsing [sent. 15708 len. 10]: ` There is nothing the matter with her ! '
Parsing [sent. 15709 len. 17]: cried Mr Pecksniff , sitting down in the nearest chair , and rubbing up his hair .
Parsing [sent. 15710 len. 6]: ` Fie upon my weakness !
Parsing [sent. 15711 len. 8]: I can not help it , Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 15712 len. 3]: Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 15713 len. 5]: I am better now .
Parsing [sent. 15714 len. 13]: How is my other child ; my eldest ; my Cherrywerrychigo ? '
Parsing [sent. 15715 len. 20]: said Mr Pecksniff , inventing a playful little name for her , in the restored lightness of his heart .
Parsing [sent. 15716 len. 14]: ` She 's much about the same as usual , ' returned Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 15717 len. 9]: ` She sticks pretty close to the vinegar-bottle .
Parsing [sent. 15718 len. 13]: You know she 's got a sweetheart , I suppose ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 15719 len. 81]: I have heard of it , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` from headquarters ; from my child herself I will not deny that it moved me to contemplate the loss of my remaining daughter , Jonas -- I am afraid we parents are selfish , I am afraid we are -- but it has ever been the study of my life to qualify them for the domestic hearth ; and it is a sphere which Cherry will adorn . '
Parsing [sent. 15720 len. 24]: ` She need adorn some sphere or other , ' observed the son-in-law , for she ai n't very ornamental in general . '
Parsing [sent. 15721 len. 13]: ` My girls are now provided for , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 15722 len. 17]: ` They are now happily provided for , and I have not laboured in vain ! '
Parsing [sent. 15723 len. 47]: This is exactly what Mr Pecksniff would have said , if one of his daughters had drawn a prize of thirty thousand pounds in the lottery , or if the other had picked up a valuable purse in the street , which nobody appeared to claim .
Parsing [sent. 15724 len. 40]: In either of these cases he would have invoked a patriarchal blessing on the fortunate head , with great solemnity , and would have taken immense credit to himself , as having meant it from the infant 's cradle .
Parsing [sent. 15725 len. 16]: ` Suppose we talk about something else , now , ' observed Jonas , drily .
Parsing [sent. 15726 len. 6]: ` just for a change .
Parsing [sent. 15727 len. 6]: Are you quite agreeable ? '
Parsing [sent. 15728 len. 8]: ` Quite , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 15729 len. 10]: ` Ah , you wag , you naughty wag !
Parsing [sent. 15730 len. 8]: You laugh at poor old fond papa .
Parsing [sent. 15731 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 15732 len. 4]: He deserves it .
Parsing [sent. 15733 len. 16]: And he do n't mind it either , for his feelings are their own reward .
Parsing [sent. 15734 len. 11]: You have come to stay with me , Jonas ? '
Parsing [sent. 15735 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 15736 len. 12]: I 've got a friend with me , ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 15737 len. 6]: ` Bring your friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 15738 len. 10]: cried Mr Pecksniff , in a gush of hospitality .
Parsing [sent. 15739 len. 9]: ` Bring any number of your friends ! '
Parsing [sent. 15740 len. 19]: ` This ai n't the sort of man to be brought , ' said Jonas , contemptuously . '
Parsing [sent. 15741 len. 17]: I think I see myself `` bringing '' him to your house , for a treat !
Parsing [sent. 15742 len. 25]: Thank ` ee all the same ; but he 's a little too near the top of the tree for that , Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 15743 len. 13]: The good man pricked up his ears ; his interest was awakened .
Parsing [sent. 15744 len. 45]: A position near the top of the tree was greatness , virtue , goodness , sense , genius ; or , it should rather be said , a dispensation from all , and in itself something immeasurably better than all ; with Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 15745 len. 39]: A man who was able to look down upon Mr Pecksniff could not be looked up at , by that gentleman , with too great an amount of deference , or from a position of too much humility .
Parsing [sent. 15746 len. 8]: So it always is with great spirits .
Parsing [sent. 15747 len. 30]: ` I 'll tell you what you may do , if you like , ' said Jonas ; ` you may come and dine with us at the Dragon .
Parsing [sent. 15748 len. 60]: We were forced to come down to Salisbury last night , on some business , and I got him to bring me over here this morning , in his carriage ; at least , not his own carriage , for we had a breakdown in the night , but one we hired instead ; it 's all the same .
Parsing [sent. 15749 len. 9]: Mind what you 're about , you know .
Parsing [sent. 15750 len. 16]: He 's not used to all sorts ; he only mixes with the best ! '
Parsing [sent. 15751 len. 18]: ` Some young nobleman who has been borrowing money of you at good interest , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 15752 len. 10]: said Mr Pecksniff , shaking his forefinger facetiously . '
Parsing [sent. 15753 len. 11]: I shall be delighted to know the gay sprig . '
Parsing [sent. 15754 len. 4]: ` Borrowing ! '
Parsing [sent. 15755 len. 3]: echoed Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 15756 len. 3]: ` Borrowing !
Parsing [sent. 15757 len. 18]: When you 're a twentieth part as rich as he is , you may shut up shop !
Parsing [sent. 15758 len. 23]: We should be pretty well off if we could buy his furniture , and plate , and pictures , by clubbing together .
Parsing [sent. 15759 len. 9]: A likely man to borrow : Mr Montague !
Parsing [sent. 15760 len. 9]: Why since I was lucky enough -LRB- come !
Parsing [sent. 15761 len. 49]: and I 'll say , sharp enough , too -RRB- to get a share in the Assurance office that he 's President of , I 've made -- never mind what I 've made , ' said Jonas , seeming to recover all at once his usual caution .
Parsing [sent. 15762 len. 16]: ` You know me pretty well , and I do n't blab about such things .
Parsing [sent. 15763 len. 11]: But , Ecod , I 've made a trifle . '
Parsing [sent. 15764 len. 26]: ` Really , my dear Jonas , ' cried Mr Pecksniff , with much warmth , ' a gentleman like this should receive some attention .
Parsing [sent. 15765 len. 8]: Would he like to see the church ?
Parsing [sent. 15766 len. 37]: or if he has a taste for the fine arts -- which I have no doubt he has , from the description you give of his circumstances -- I can send him down a few portfolios .
Parsing [sent. 15767 len. 51]: Salisbury Cathedral , my dear Jonas , ' said Mr Pecksniff ; the mention of the portfolios and his anxiety to display himself to advantage , suggesting his usual phraseology in that regard , ` is an edifice replete with venerable associations , and strikingly suggestive of the loftiest emotions .
Parsing [sent. 15768 len. 11]: It is here we contemplate the work of bygone ages .
Parsing [sent. 15769 len. 18]: It is here we listen to the swelling organ , as we stroll through the reverberating aisles .
Parsing [sent. 15770 len. 70]: We have drawings of this celebrated structure from the North , from the South , from the East , from the West , from the South -- East , from the Nor ` West -- ' During this digression , and indeed during the whole dialogue , Jonas had been rocking on his chair , with his hands in his pockets and his head thrown cunningly on one side .
Parsing [sent. 15771 len. 30]: He looked at Mr Pecksniff now with such shrewd meaning twinkling in his eyes , that Mr Pecksniff stopped , and asked him what he was going to say .
Parsing [sent. 15772 len. 4]: ` Ecod ! '
Parsing [sent. 15773 len. 3]: he answered .
Parsing [sent. 15774 len. 27]: ` Pecksniff if I knew how you meant to leave your money , I could put you in the way of doubling it in no time .
Parsing [sent. 15775 len. 16]: It would n't be bad to keep a chance like this snug in the family .
Parsing [sent. 15776 len. 9]: But you 're such a deep one ! '
Parsing [sent. 15777 len. 4]: ` Jonas ! '
Parsing [sent. 15778 len. 22]: cried Mr Pecksniff , much affected , ' I am not a diplomatical character ; my heart is in my hand .
Parsing [sent. 15779 len. 91]: By far the greater part of the inconsiderable savings I have accumulated in the course of -- I hope -- a not dishonourable or useless career , is already given , devised , and bequeathed -LRB- correct me , my dear Jonas , if I am technically wrong -RRB- , with expressions of confidence , which I will not repeat ; and in securities which it is unnecessary to mention to a person whom I can not , whom I will not , whom I need not , name . '
Parsing [sent. 15780 len. 35]: Here he gave the hand of his son-in-law a fervent squeeze , as if he would have added , ` God bless you ; be very careful of it when you get it ! '
Parsing [sent. 15781 len. 29]: Mr Jonas only shook his head and laughed , and , seeming to think better of what he had had in his mind , said , ` No .
Parsing [sent. 15782 len. 8]: He would keep his own counsel . '
Parsing [sent. 15783 len. 43]: But as he observed that he would take a walk , Mr Pecksniff insisted on accompanying him , remarking that he could leave a card for Mr Montague , as they went along , by way of gentleman-usher to himself at dinner-time .
Parsing [sent. 15784 len. 4]: Which he did .
Parsing [sent. 15785 len. 29]: In the course of their walk , Mr Jonas affected to maintain that close reserve which had operated as a timely check upon him during the foregoing dialogue .
Parsing [sent. 15786 len. 47]: And as he made no attempt to conciliate Mr Pecksniff , but , on the contrary , was more boorish and rude to him than usual , that gentleman , so far from suspecting his real design , laid himself out to be attacked with advantage .
Parsing [sent. 15787 len. 59]: For it is in the nature of a knave to think the tools with which he works indispensable to knavery ; and knowing what he would do himself in such a case , Mr Pecksniff argued , ` if this young man wanted anything of me for his own ends , he would be polite and deferential . '
Parsing [sent. 15788 len. 34]: The more Jonas repelled him in his hints and inquiries , the more solicitous , therefore , Mr Pecksniff became to be initiated into the golden mysteries at which he had obscurely glanced .
Parsing [sent. 15789 len. 15]: Why should there be cold and worldly secrets , he observed , between relations ?
Parsing [sent. 15790 len. 6]: What was life without confidence ?
Parsing [sent. 15791 len. 52]: If the chosen husband of his daughter , the man to whom he had delivered her with so much pride and hope , such bounding and such beaming joy ; if he were not a green spot in the barren waste of life , where was that oasis to be bound ?
Parsing [sent. 15792 len. 19]: Little did Mr Pecksniff think on what a very green spot he planted one foot at that moment !
Parsing [sent. 15793 len. 15]: Little did he foresee when he said , ` All is but dust ! '
Parsing [sent. 15794 len. 11]: how very shortly he would come down with his own !
Parsing [sent. 15795 len. 89]: Inch by inch , in his grudging and ill-conditioned way ; sustained to the life , for the hope of making Mr Pecksniff suffer in that tender place , the pocket , where Jonas smarted so terribly himself , gave him an additional and malicious interest in the wiles he was set on to practise ; inch by inch , and bit by bit , Jonas rather allowed the dazzling prospects of the Anglo -- Bengalee establishment to escape him , than paraded them before his greedy listener .
Parsing [sent. 15796 len. 73]: And in the same niggardly spirit , he left Mr Pecksniff to infer , if he chose -LRB- which he DID choose , of course -RRB- , that a consciousness of not having any great natural gifts of speech and manner himself , rendered him desirous to have the credit of introducing to Mr Montague some one who was well endowed in those respects , and so atone for his own deficiencies .
Parsing [sent. 15797 len. 29]: Otherwise , he muttered discontentedly , he would have seen his beloved father-in-law ` far enough off , ' before he would have taken him into his confidence .
Parsing [sent. 15798 len. 37]: Primed in this artful manner , Mr Pecksniff presented himself at dinner-time in such a state of suavity , benevolence , cheerfulness , politeness , and cordiality , as even he had perhaps never attained before .
Parsing [sent. 15799 len. 60]: The frankness of the country gentleman , the refinement of the artist , the good-humoured allowance of the man of the world ; philanthropy , forbearance , piety , toleration , all blended together in a flexible adaptability to anything and everything ; were expressed in Mr Pecksniff , as he shook hands with the great speculator and capitalist .
Parsing [sent. 15800 len. 17]: ` Welcome , respected sir , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` to our humble village !
Parsing [sent. 15801 len. 29]: We are a simple people ; primitive clods , Mr Montague ; but we can appreciate the honour of your visit , as my dear son-in-law can testify .
Parsing [sent. 15802 len. 24]: It is very strange , ' said Mr Pecksniff , pressing his hand almost reverentially , ` but I seem to know you .
Parsing [sent. 15803 len. 39]: That towering forehead , my dear Jonas , ' said Mr Pecksniff aside , ` and those clustering masses of rich hair -- I must have seen you , my dear sir , in the sparkling throng . '
Parsing [sent. 15804 len. 10]: Nothing was more probable , they all agreed . '
Parsing [sent. 15805 len. 34]: I could have wished , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` to have had the honour of introducing you to an elderly inmate of our house : to the uncle of our friend .
Parsing [sent. 15806 len. 19]: Mr Chuzzlewit , sir , would have been proud indeed to have taken you by the hand . '
Parsing [sent. 15807 len. 8]: ` Is the gentleman here now ? '
Parsing [sent. 15808 len. 7]: asked Montague , turning deeply red .
Parsing [sent. 15809 len. 9]: ` He is , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 15810 len. 11]: ` You said nothing about that , Chuzzlewit . ' '
Parsing [sent. 15811 len. 16]: I did n't suppose you 'd care to hear of it , ' returned Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 15812 len. 15]: ` You would n't care to know him , I can promise you . '
Parsing [sent. 15813 len. 3]: ` Jonas !
Parsing [sent. 15814 len. 5]: my dear Jonas ! '
Parsing [sent. 15815 len. 4]: remonstrated Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 15816 len. 4]: ` Really ! '
Parsing [sent. 15817 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 15818 len. 17]: it 's all very well for you to speak up for him , ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 15819 len. 6]: ` You have nailed him .
Parsing [sent. 15820 len. 9]: You 'll get a fortune by him . '
Parsing [sent. 15821 len. 3]: ` Oho !
Parsing [sent. 15822 len. 8]: Is the wind in that quarter ? '
Parsing [sent. 15823 len. 3]: cried Montague .
Parsing [sent. 15824 len. 8]: ` Ha , ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 15825 len. 10]: and here they all laughed -- especially Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 15826 len. 6]: ` No , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 15827 len. 12]: said that gentleman , clapping his son-in-law playfully upon the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 15828 len. 15]: ` You must not believe all that my young relative says , Mr Montague .
Parsing [sent. 15829 len. 28]: You may believe him in official business , and trust him in official business , but you must not attach importance to his flights of fancy . '
Parsing [sent. 15830 len. 25]: ` Upon my life , Mr Pecksniff , ' cried Montague , ' I attach the greatest importance to that last observation of his .
Parsing [sent. 15831 len. 8]: I trust and hope it 's true .
Parsing [sent. 15832 len. 18]: Money can not be turned and turned again quickly enough in the ordinary course , Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 15833 len. 14]: There is nothing like building our fortune on the weaknesses of mankind . '
Parsing [sent. 15834 len. 4]: ` Oh fie !
Parsing [sent. 15835 len. 7]: oh fie , for shame ! '
Parsing [sent. 15836 len. 4]: cried Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 15837 len. 11]: But they all laughed again -- especially Mr Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 15838 len. 14]: I give you my honour that WE do it , ' said Montague .
Parsing [sent. 15839 len. 7]: ` Oh fie , fie ! '
Parsing [sent. 15840 len. 4]: cried Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 15841 len. 6]: ` You are very pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 15842 len. 8]: That I am sure you do n't !
Parsing [sent. 15843 len. 8]: That I am sure you do n't !
Parsing [sent. 15844 len. 8]: How CAN you , you know ? '
Parsing [sent. 15845 len. 14]: Again they all laughed in concert ; and again Mr Pecksniff laughed especially .
Parsing [sent. 15846 len. 6]: This was very agreeable indeed .
Parsing [sent. 15847 len. 28]: It was confidential , easy , straight-forward ; and still left Mr Pecksniff in the position of being in a gentle way the Mentor of the party .
Parsing [sent. 15848 len. 81]: The greatest achievements in the article of cookery that the Dragon had ever performed , were set before them ; the oldest and best wines in the Dragon 's cellar saw the light on that occasion ; a thousand bubbles , indicative of the wealth and station of Mr Montague in the depths of his pursuits , were constantly rising to the surface of the conversation ; and they were as frank and merry as three honest men could be .
Parsing [sent. 15849 len. 23]: Mr Pecksniff thought it a pity -LRB- he said so -RRB- that Mr Montague should think lightly of mankind and their weaknesses .
Parsing [sent. 15850 len. 37]: He was anxious upon this subject ; his mind ran upon it ; in one way or another he was constantly coming back to it ; he must make a convert of him , he said .
Parsing [sent. 15851 len. 28]: And as often as Mr Montague repeated his sentiment about building fortunes on the weaknesses of mankind , and added frankly , ` WE do it ! '
Parsing [sent. 15852 len. 10]: just as often Mr Pecksniff repeated ` Oh fie !
Parsing [sent. 15853 len. 6]: oh fie , for shame !
Parsing [sent. 15854 len. 7]: I am sure you do n't .
Parsing [sent. 15855 len. 8]: How CAN you , you know ? '
Parsing [sent. 15856 len. 11]: laying a greater stress each time on those last words .
Parsing [sent. 15857 len. 94]: The frequent repetition of this playful inquiry on the part of Mr Pecksniff , led at last to playful answers on the part of Mr Montague ; but after some little sharp-shooting on both sides , Mr Pecksniff became grave , almost to tears ; observing that if Mr Montague would give him leave , he would drink the health of his young kinsman , Mr Jonas ; congratulating him upon the valuable and distinguished friendship he had formed , but envying him , he would confess , his usefulness to his fellow-creatures .
Parsing [sent. 15858 len. 77]: For , if he understood the objects of that Institution with which he was newly and advantageously connected -- knowing them but imperfectly -- they were calculated to do Good ; and for his -LRB- Mr Pecksniff 's -RRB- part , if he could in any way promote them , he thought he would be able to lay his head upon his pillow every night , with an absolute certainty of going to sleep at once .
Parsing [sent. 15859 len. 41]: The transition from this accidental remark -LRB- for it was quite accidental and had fallen from Mr Pecksniff in the openness of his soul -RRB- , to the discussion of the subject as a matter of business , was easy .
Parsing [sent. 15860 len. 44]: Books , papers , statements , tables , calculations of various kinds , were soon spread out before them ; and as they were all framed with one object , it is not surprising that they should all have tended to one end .
Parsing [sent. 15861 len. 38]: But still , whenever Montague enlarged upon the profits of the office , and said that as long as there were gulls upon the wing it must succeed , Mr Pecksniff mildly said ` Oh fie ! '
Parsing [sent. 15862 len. 17]: -- and might indeed have remonstrated with him , but that he knew he was joking .
Parsing [sent. 15863 len. 13]: Mr Pecksniff did know he was joking ; because he said so .
Parsing [sent. 15864 len. 42]: There never had been before , and there never would be again , such an opportunity for the investment of a considerable sum -LRB- the rate of advantage increased in proportion to the amount invested -RRB- , as at that moment .
Parsing [sent. 15865 len. 57]: The only time that had at all approached it , was the time when Jonas had come into the concern ; which made him ill-natured now , and inclined him to pick out a doubt in this place , and a flaw in that , and grumbling to advise Mr Pecksniff to think better of it .
Parsing [sent. 15866 len. 71]: The sum which would complete the proprietorship in this snug concern , was nearly equal to Mr Pecksniff 's whole hoard ; not counting Mr Chuzzlewit , that is to say , whom he looked upon as money in the Bank , the possession of which inclined him the more to make a dash with his own private sprats for the capture of such a whale as Mr Montague described .
Parsing [sent. 15867 len. 10]: The returns began almost immediately , and were immense .
Parsing [sent. 15868 len. 51]: The end of it was , that Mr Pecksniff agreed to become the last partner and proprietor in the Anglo -- Bengalee , and made an appointment to dine with Mr Montague , at Salisbury , on the next day but one , then and there to complete the negotiation .
Parsing [sent. 15869 len. 21]: It took so long to bring the subject to this head , that it was nearly midnight when they parted .
Parsing [sent. 15870 len. 19]: When Mr Pecksniff walked downstairs to the door , he found Mrs Lupin standing there , looking out .
Parsing [sent. 15871 len. 8]: ` Ah , my good friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 15872 len. 8]: he said ; ` not a-bed yet !
Parsing [sent. 15873 len. 8]: Contemplating the stars , Mrs Lupin ? '
Parsing [sent. 15874 len. 12]: ` It 's a beautiful starlight night , sir . ' '
Parsing [sent. 15875 len. 13]: A beautiful starlight night , ' said Mr Pecksniff , looking up .
Parsing [sent. 15876 len. 9]: ` Behold the planets , how they shine !
Parsing [sent. 15877 len. 23]: Behold the -- those two persons who were here this morning have left your house , I hope , Mrs Lupin ? '
Parsing [sent. 15878 len. 5]: ` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 15879 len. 6]: They are gone . ' '
Parsing [sent. 15880 len. 12]: I am glad to hear it , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 15881 len. 11]: ` Behold the wonders of the firmament , Mrs Lupin !
Parsing [sent. 15882 len. 6]: how glorious is the scene !
Parsing [sent. 15883 len. 31]: When I look up at those shining orbs , I think that each of them is winking to the other to take notice of the vanity of men 's pursuits .
Parsing [sent. 15884 len. 4]: My fellowmen ! '
Parsing [sent. 15885 len. 25]: cried Mr Pecksniff , shaking his head in pity ; ` you are much mistaken ; my wormy relatives , you are much deceived !
Parsing [sent. 15886 len. 15]: The stars are perfectly contented -LRB- I suppose so -RRB- in their several spheres .
Parsing [sent. 15887 len. 5]: Why are not you ?
Parsing [sent. 15888 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 15889 len. 31]: do not strive and struggle to enrich yourselves , or to get the better of each other , my deluded friends , but look up there , with me ! '
Parsing [sent. 15890 len. 11]: Mrs Lupin shook her head , and heaved a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 15891 len. 5]: It was very affecting .
Parsing [sent. 15892 len. 9]: ` Look up there , with me ! '
Parsing [sent. 15893 len. 24]: repeated Mr Pecksniff , stretching out his hand ; ` With me , a humble individual who is also an insect like yourselves .
Parsing [sent. 15894 len. 14]: Can silver , gold , or precious stones , sparkle like those constellations !
Parsing [sent. 15895 len. 4]: I think not .
Parsing [sent. 15896 len. 22]: Then do not thirst for silver , gold , or precious stones ; but look up there , with me ! '
Parsing [sent. 15897 len. 32]: With those words , the good man patted Mrs Lupin 's hand between his own , as if he would have added ` think of this , my good woman ! '
Parsing [sent. 15898 len. 18]: and walked away in a sort of ecstasy or rapture , with his hat under his arm .
Parsing [sent. 15899 len. 38]: Jonas sat in the attitude in which Mr Pecksniff had left him , gazing moodily at his friend ; who , surrounded by a heap of documents , was writing something on an oblong slip of paper .
Parsing [sent. 15900 len. 19]: ` You mean to wait at Salisbury over the day after to-morrow , do you , then ? '
Parsing [sent. 15901 len. 3]: said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 15902 len. 15]: ` You heard our appointment , ' returned Montague , without raising his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 15903 len. 15]: ` In any case I should have waited to see after the boy . '
Parsing [sent. 15904 len. 19]: They appeared to have changed places again ; Montague being in high spirits ; Jonas gloomy and lowering .
Parsing [sent. 15905 len. 11]: ` You do n't want me , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 15906 len. 4]: said Jonas . '
Parsing [sent. 15907 len. 31]: I want you to put your name here , ' he returned , glancing at him with a smile , ` as soon as I have filled up the stamp .
Parsing [sent. 15908 len. 14]: I may as well have your note of hand for that extra capital .
Parsing [sent. 15909 len. 6]: That 's all I want .
Parsing [sent. 15910 len. 16]: If you wish to go home , I can manage Mr Pecksniff now , alone .
Parsing [sent. 15911 len. 9]: There is a perfect understanding between us . '
Parsing [sent. 15912 len. 12]: Jonas sat scowling at him as he wrote , in silence .
Parsing [sent. 15913 len. 30]: When he had finished his writing , and had dried it on the blotting paper in his travelling-desk ; he looked up , and tossed the pen towards him .
Parsing [sent. 15914 len. 18]: ` What , not a day 's grace , not a day 's trust , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 15915 len. 4]: said Jonas bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 15916 len. 14]: ` Not after the pains I have taken with to-night 's work ? '
Parsing [sent. 15917 len. 23]: ` To night 's work was a part of our bargain , ' replied Montague ; ` and so was this . '
Parsing [sent. 15918 len. 16]: ` You drive a hard bargain , ' said Jonas , advancing to the table .
Parsing [sent. 15919 len. 5]: ` You know best .
Parsing [sent. 15920 len. 5]: Give it here ! '
Parsing [sent. 15921 len. 6]: Montague gave him the paper .
Parsing [sent. 15922 len. 33]: After pausing as if he could not make up his mind to put his name to it , Jonas dipped his pen hastily in the nearest inkstand , and began to write .
Parsing [sent. 15923 len. 16]: But he had scarcely marked the paper when he started back , in a panic .
Parsing [sent. 15924 len. 10]: ` Why , what the devil 's this ? '
Parsing [sent. 15925 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 15926 len. 6]: ` It 's bloody ! '
Parsing [sent. 15927 len. 15]: He had dipped the pen , as another moment showed , into red ink .
Parsing [sent. 15928 len. 12]: But he attached a strange degree of importance to the mistake .
Parsing [sent. 15929 len. 39]: He asked how it had come there , who had brought it , why it had been brought ; and looked at Montague , at first , as if he thought he had put a trick upon him .
Parsing [sent. 15930 len. 31]: Even when he used a different pen , and the right ink , he made some scratches on another paper first , as half believing they would turn red also .
Parsing [sent. 15931 len. 17]: ` Black enough , this time , ' he said , handing the note to Montague .
Parsing [sent. 15932 len. 4]: ` Good-bye . '
Parsing [sent. 15933 len. 4]: ` Going now !
Parsing [sent. 15934 len. 12]: how do you mean to get away from here ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 15935 len. 27]: I shall cross early in the morning to the high road , before you are out of bed ; and catch the day-coach , going up .
Parsing [sent. 15936 len. 3]: Good-bye ! '
Parsing [sent. 15937 len. 9]: ` You are in a hurry ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 15938 len. 10]: I have something to do , ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 15939 len. 4]: ` Good-bye ! '
Parsing [sent. 15940 len. 25]: His friend looked after him as he went out , in surprise , which gradually gave place to an air of satisfaction and relief .
Parsing [sent. 15941 len. 7]: ` It happens all the better .
Parsing [sent. 15942 len. 11]: It brings about what I wanted , without any difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 15943 len. 7]: I shall travel home alone . '
Parsing [sent. 15944 len. 82]: CHAPTER FORTY -- FIVE IN WHICH TOM PINCH AND HIS SISTER TAKE A LITTLE PLEASURE ; BUT QUITE IN A DOMESTIC WAY , AND WITH NO CEREMONY ABOUT IT Tom Pinch and his sister having to part , for the dispatch of the morning 's business , immediately after the dispersion of the other actors in the scene upon the wharf with which the reader has been already made acquainted , had no opportunity of discussing the subject at that time .
Parsing [sent. 15945 len. 46]: But Tom , in his solitary office , and Ruth , in the triangular parlour , thought about nothing else all day ; and , when their hour of meeting in the afternoon approached , they were very full of it , to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 15946 len. 28]: There was a little plot between them , that Tom should always come out of the Temple by one way ; and that was past the fountain .
Parsing [sent. 15947 len. 83]: Coming through Fountain Court , he was just to glance down the steps leading into Garden Court , and to look once all round him ; and if Ruth had come to meet him , there he would see her ; not sauntering , you understand -LRB- on account of the clerks -RRB- , but coming briskly up , with the best little laugh upon her face that ever played in opposition to the fountain , and beat it all to nothing .
Parsing [sent. 15948 len. 55]: For , fifty to one , Tom had been looking for her in the wrong direction , and had quite given her up , while she had been tripping towards him from the first ; jingling that little reticule of hers -LRB- with all the keys in it -RRB- to attract his wandering observation .
Parsing [sent. 15949 len. 49]: Whether there was life enough left in the slow vegetation of Fountain Court for the smoky shrubs to have any consciousness of the brightest and purest-hearted little woman in the world , is a question for gardeners , and those who are learned in the loves of plants .
Parsing [sent. 15950 len. 59]: But , that it was a good thing for that same paved yard to have such a delicate little figure flitting through it ; that it passed like a smile from the grimy old houses , and the worn flagstones , and left them duller , darker , sterner than before ; there is no sort of doubt .
Parsing [sent. 15951 len. 163]: The Temple fountain might have leaped up twenty feet to greet the spring of hopeful maidenhood , that in her person stole on , sparkling , through the dry and dusty channels of the Law ; the chirping sparrows , bred in Temple chinks and crannies , might have held their peace to listen to imaginary skylarks , as so fresh a little creature passed ; the dingy boughs , unused to droop , otherwise than in their puny growth , might have bent down in a kindred gracefulness to shed their benedictions on her graceful head ; old love letters , shut up in iron boxes in the neighbouring offices , and made of no account among the heaps of family papers into which they had strayed , and of which , in their degeneracy , they formed a part , might have stirred and fluttered with a moment 's recollection of their ancient tenderness , as she went lightly by .
Parsing [sent. 15952 len. 19]: Anything might have happened that did not happen , and never will , for the love of Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 15953 len. 14]: Something happened , too , upon the afternoon of which the history treats .
Parsing [sent. 15954 len. 5]: Not for her love .
Parsing [sent. 15955 len. 3]: Oh no !
Parsing [sent. 15956 len. 14]: quite by accident , and without the least reference to her at all .
Parsing [sent. 15957 len. 38]: Either she was a little too soon , or Tom was a little too late -- she was so precise in general , that she timed it to half a minute -- but no Tom was there .
Parsing [sent. 15958 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 15959 len. 27]: But was anybody else there , that she blushed so deeply , after looking round , and tripped off down the steps with such unusual expedition ?
Parsing [sent. 15960 len. 15]: Why , the fact is , that Mr Westlock was passing at that moment .
Parsing [sent. 15961 len. 50]: The Temple is a public thoroughfare ; they may write up on the gates that it is not , but so long as the gates are left open it is , and will be ; and Mr Westlock had as good a right to be there as anybody else .
Parsing [sent. 15962 len. 9]: But why did she run away , then ?
Parsing [sent. 15963 len. 20]: Not being ill dressed , for she was much too neat for that , why did she run away ?
Parsing [sent. 15964 len. 45]: The brown hair that had fallen down beneath her bonnet , and had one impertinent imp of a false flower clinging to it , boastful of its licence before all men , THAT could not have been the cause , for it looked charming .
Parsing [sent. 15965 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 15966 len. 14]: foolish , panting , frightened little heart , why did she run away !
Parsing [sent. 15967 len. 16]: Merrily the tiny fountain played , and merrily the dimples sparkled on its sunny face .
Parsing [sent. 15968 len. 6]: John Westlock hurried after her .
Parsing [sent. 15969 len. 21]: Softly the whispering water broke and fell ; as roguishly the dimples twinkled , as he stole upon her footsteps .
Parsing [sent. 15970 len. 21]: Oh , foolish , panting , timid little heart , why did she feign to be unconscious of his coming !
Parsing [sent. 15971 len. 15]: Why wish herself so far away , yet be so flutteringly happy there ! '
Parsing [sent. 15972 len. 23]: I felt sure it was you , ' said John , when he overtook her in the sanctuary of Garden Court . '
Parsing [sent. 15973 len. 9]: I knew I could n't be mistaken . '
Parsing [sent. 15974 len. 5]: She was SO surprised .
Parsing [sent. 15975 len. 12]: ` You are waiting for your brother , ' said John .
Parsing [sent. 15976 len. 8]: ` Let me bear you company . '
Parsing [sent. 15977 len. 25]: So light was the touch of the coy little hand , that he glanced down to assure himself he had it on his arm .
Parsing [sent. 15978 len. 23]: But his glance , stopping for an instant at the bright eyes , forgot its first design , and went no farther .
Parsing [sent. 15979 len. 18]: They walked up and down three or four times , speaking about Tom and his mysterious employment .
Parsing [sent. 15980 len. 12]: Now that was a very natural and innocent subject , surely .
Parsing [sent. 15981 len. 27]: Then why , whenever Ruth lifted up her eyes , did she let them fall again immediately , and seek the uncongenial pavement of the court ?
Parsing [sent. 15982 len. 25]: They were not such eyes as shun the light ; they were not such eyes as require to be hoarded to enhance their value .
Parsing [sent. 15983 len. 17]: They were much too precious and too genuine to stand in need of arts like those .
Parsing [sent. 15984 len. 8]: Somebody must have been looking at them !
Parsing [sent. 15985 len. 10]: They found out Tom , though , quickly enough .
Parsing [sent. 15986 len. 15]: This pair of eyes descried him in the distance , the moment he appeared .
Parsing [sent. 15987 len. 34]: He was staring about him , as usual , in all directions but the right one ; and was as obstinate in not looking towards them , as if he had intended it .
Parsing [sent. 15988 len. 25]: As it was plain that , being left to himself , he would walk away home , John Westlock darted off to stop him .
Parsing [sent. 15989 len. 20]: This made the approach of poor little Ruth , by herself , one of the most embarrassing of circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 15990 len. 100]: There was Tom , manifesting extreme surprise -LRB- he had no presence of mind , that Tom , on small occasions -RRB- ; there was John , making as light of it as he could , but explaining at the same time with most unnecessary elaboration ; and here was she , coming towards them , with both of them looking at her , conscious of blushing to a terrible extent , but trying to throw up her eyebrows carelessly , and pout her rosy lips , as if she were the coolest and most unconcerned of little women .
Parsing [sent. 15991 len. 31]: Merrily the fountain plashed and plashed , until the dimples , merging into one another , swelled into a general smile , that covered the whole surface of the basin .
Parsing [sent. 15992 len. 7]: ` What an extraordinary meeting ! '
Parsing [sent. 15993 len. 4]: said Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 15994 len. 13]: I should never have dreamed of seeing you two together here . '
Parsing [sent. 15995 len. 11]: ` Quite accidental , ' John was heard to murmur .
Parsing [sent. 15996 len. 17]: ` Exactly , ' cried Tom ; ` that 's what I mean , you know .
Parsing [sent. 15997 len. 15]: If it was n't accidental , there would be nothing remarkable in it . '
Parsing [sent. 15998 len. 9]: ` To be sure , ' said John .
Parsing [sent. 15999 len. 19]: ` Such an out-of-the-way place for you to have met in , ' pursued Tom , quite delighted .
Parsing [sent. 16000 len. 7]: ` Such an unlikely spot ! '
Parsing [sent. 16001 len. 5]: John rather disputed that .
Parsing [sent. 16002 len. 14]: On the contrary , he considered it a very likely spot , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 16003 len. 12]: He was constantly passing to and fro there , he said .
Parsing [sent. 16004 len. 11]: He should n't wonder if it were to happen again .
Parsing [sent. 16005 len. 12]: His only wonder was , that it had never happened before .
Parsing [sent. 16006 len. 21]: By this time Ruth had got round on the farther side of her brother , and had taken his arm .
Parsing [sent. 16007 len. 30]: She was squeezing it now , as much as to say ` Are you going to stop here all day , you dear , old , blundering Tom ? '
Parsing [sent. 16008 len. 12]: Tom answered the squeeze as if it had been a speech .
Parsing [sent. 16009 len. 28]: ` John , ' he said , ` if you 'll give my sister your arm , we 'll take her between us , and walk on .
Parsing [sent. 16010 len. 10]: I have a curious circumstance to relate to you .
Parsing [sent. 16011 len. 9]: Our meeting could not have happened better . '
Parsing [sent. 16012 len. 34]: Merrily the fountain leaped and danced , and merrily the smiling dimples twinkled and expanded more and more , until they broke into a laugh against the basin 's rim , and vanished .
Parsing [sent. 16013 len. 24]: ` Tom , ' said his friend , as they turned into the noisy street , ' I have a proposition to make .
Parsing [sent. 16014 len. 35]: It is , that you and your sister -- if she will so far honour a poor bachelor 's dwelling -- give me a great pleasure , and come and dine with me . '
Parsing [sent. 16015 len. 6]: ` What , to-day ? '
Parsing [sent. 16016 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 16017 len. 5]: ` Yes , to-day .
Parsing [sent. 16018 len. 8]: It 's close by , you know .
Parsing [sent. 16019 len. 9]: Pray , Miss Pinch , insist upon it .
Parsing [sent. 16020 len. 15]: It will be very disinterested , for I have nothing to give you . '
Parsing [sent. 16021 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 16022 len. 12]: you must not believe that , Ruth , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 16023 len. 23]: ` He is the most tremendous fellow , in his housekeeping , that I ever heard of , for a single man .
Parsing [sent. 16024 len. 7]: He ought to be Lord Mayor .
Parsing [sent. 16025 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 16026 len. 5]: what do you say ?
Parsing [sent. 16027 len. 5]: Shall we go ? '
Parsing [sent. 16028 len. 14]: ` If you please , Tom , ' rejoined his dutiful little sister .
Parsing [sent. 16029 len. 29]: ` But I mean , ' said Tom , regarding her with smiling admiration ; ` is there anything you ought to wear , and have n't got ?
Parsing [sent. 16030 len. 28]: I am sure I do n't know , John ; she may not be able to take her bonnet off , for anything I can tell . '
Parsing [sent. 16031 len. 47]: There was a great deal of laughing at this , and there were divers compliments from John Westlock -- not compliments HE said at least -LRB- and really he was right -RRB- , but good , plain , honest truths , which no one could deny .
Parsing [sent. 16032 len. 19]: Ruth laughed , and all that , but she made no objection ; so it was an engagement .
Parsing [sent. 16033 len. 22]: ` If I had known it a little sooner , ' said John , ' I would have tried another pudding .
Parsing [sent. 16034 len. 12]: Not in rivalry ; but merely to exalt that famous one .
Parsing [sent. 16035 len. 14]: I would n't on any account have had it made with suet . '
Parsing [sent. 16036 len. 5]: ` Why not ? '
Parsing [sent. 16037 len. 3]: asked Tom .
Parsing [sent. 16038 len. 23]: ` Because that cookery-book advises suet , ' said John Westlock ; ` and ours was made with flour and eggs . '
Parsing [sent. 16039 len. 6]: ` Oh good gracious ! '
Parsing [sent. 16040 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 16041 len. 12]: ` Ours was made with flour and eggs , was it ?
Parsing [sent. 16042 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 16043 len. 9]: A beefsteak pudding made with flour and eggs !
Parsing [sent. 16044 len. 7]: Why anybody knows better than that .
Parsing [sent. 16045 len. 6]: I know better than that !
Parsing [sent. 16046 len. 7]: Ha , ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 16047 len. 28]: It is unnecessary to say that Tom had been present at the making of the pudding , and had been a devoted believer in it all through .
Parsing [sent. 16048 len. 79]: But he was so delighted to have this joke against his busy little sister and was tickled to that degree at having found her out , that he stopped in Temple Bar to laugh ; and it was no more to Tom , that he was anathematized and knocked about by the surly passengers , than it would have been to a post ; for he continued to exclaim with unabated good humour , ` flour and eggs !
Parsing [sent. 16049 len. 10]: A beefsteak pudding made with flour and eggs ! '
Parsing [sent. 16050 len. 95]: until John Westlock and his sister fairly ran away from him , and left him to have his laugh out by himself ; which he had , and then came dodging across the crowded street to them , with such sweet temper and tenderness -LRB- it was quite a tender joke of Tom 's -RRB- beaming in his face , God bless it , that it might have purified the air , though Temple Bar had been , as in the golden days gone by , embellished with a row of rotting human heads .
Parsing [sent. 16051 len. 33]: There are snug chambers in those Inns where the bachelors live , and , for the desolate fellows they pretend to be , it is quite surprising how well they get on .
Parsing [sent. 16052 len. 32]: John was very pathetic on the subject of his dreary life , and the deplorable makeshifts and apologetic contrivances it involved , but he really seemed to make himself pretty comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 16053 len. 28]: His rooms were the perfection of neatness and convenience at any rate ; and if he were anything but comfortable , the fault was certainly not theirs .
Parsing [sent. 16054 len. 33]: He had no sooner ushered Tom and his sister into his best room -LRB- where there was a beautiful little vase of fresh flowers on the table , all ready for Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 16055 len. 117]: Just as if he had expected her , Tom said -RRB- , than , seizing his hat , he bustled out again , in his most energetically bustling , way ; and presently came hurrying back , as they saw through the half-opened door , attended by a fiery-faced matron attired in a crunched bonnet , with particularly long strings to it hanging down her back ; in conjunction with whom he instantly began to lay the cloth for dinner , polishing up the wine-glasses with his own hands , brightening the silver top of the pepper-caster on his coat-sleeve , drawing corks and filling decanters , with a skill and expedition that were quite dazzling .
Parsing [sent. 16056 len. 83]: And as if , in the course of this rubbing and polishing , he had rubbed an enchanted lamp or a magic ring , obedient to which there were twenty thousand supernatural slaves at least , suddenly there appeared a being in a white waistcoat , carrying under his arm a napkin , and attended by another being with an oblong box upon his head , from which a banquet , piping hot , was taken out and set upon the table .
Parsing [sent. 16057 len. 28]: Salmon , lamb , peas , innocent young potatoes , a cool salad , sliced cucumber , a tender duckling , and a tart -- all there .
Parsing [sent. 16058 len. 8]: They all came at the right time .
Parsing [sent. 16059 len. 55]: Where they came from , did n't appear ; but the oblong box was constantly going and coming , and making its arrival known to the man in the white waistcoat by bumping modestly against the outside of the door ; for , after its first appearance , it entered the room no more .
Parsing [sent. 16060 len. 46]: He was never surprised , this man ; he never seemed to wonder at the extraordinary things he found in the box , but took them out with a face expressive of a steady purpose and impenetrable character , and put them on the table .
Parsing [sent. 16061 len. 21]: He was a kind man ; gentle in his manners , and much interested in what they ate and drank .
Parsing [sent. 16062 len. 32]: He was a learned man , and knew the flavour of John Westlock 's private sauces , which he softly and feelingly described , as he handed the little bottles round .
Parsing [sent. 16063 len. 38]: He was a grave man , and a noiseless ; for dinner being done , and wine and fruit arranged upon the board , he vanished , box and all , like something that had never been .
Parsing [sent. 16064 len. 15]: ` Did n't I say he was a tremendous fellow in his housekeeping ? '
Parsing [sent. 16065 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 16066 len. 5]: ` Bless my soul !
Parsing [sent. 16067 len. 5]: It 's wonderful . '
Parsing [sent. 16068 len. 10]: ` Ah , Miss Pinch , ' said John .
Parsing [sent. 16069 len. 16]: ` This is the bright side of the life we lead in such a place .
Parsing [sent. 16070 len. 30]: It would be a dismal life , indeed , if it did n't brighten up to-day ' ` Do n't believe a word he says , ' cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 16071 len. 20]: ` He lives here like a monarch , and would n't change his mode of life for any consideration .
Parsing [sent. 16072 len. 7]: He only pretends to grumble . '
Parsing [sent. 16073 len. 47]: No , John really did not appear to pretend ; for he was uncommonly earnest in his desire to have it understood that he was as dull , solitary , and uncomfortable on ordinary occasions as an unfortunate young man could , in reason , be .
Parsing [sent. 16074 len. 13]: It was a wretched life , he said , a miserable life .
Parsing [sent. 16075 len. 27]: He thought of getting rid of the chambers as soon as possible ; and meant , in fact , to put a bill up very shortly .
Parsing [sent. 16076 len. 24]: ` Well ' said Tom Pinch , ' I do n't know where you can go , John , to be more comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 16077 len. 7]: That 's all I can say .
Parsing [sent. 16078 len. 8]: What do YOU say , Ruth ? '
Parsing [sent. 16079 len. 31]: Ruth trifled with the cherries on her plate , and said that she thought Mr Westlock ought to be quite happy , and that she had no doubt he was .
Parsing [sent. 16080 len. 16]: Ah , foolish , panting , frightened little heart , how timidly she said it !
Parsing [sent. 16081 len. 26]: ` But you are forgetting what you had to tell , Tom ; what occurred this morning , ' she added in the same breath .
Parsing [sent. 16082 len. 9]: ` So I am , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 16083 len. 22]: ` We have been so talkative on other topics that I declare I have not had time to think of it .
Parsing [sent. 16084 len. 19]: I 'll tell it you at once , John , in case I should forget it altogether . '
Parsing [sent. 16085 len. 34]: On Tom 's relating what had passed upon the wharf , his friend was very much surprised , and took such a great interest in the narrative as Tom could not quite understand .
Parsing [sent. 16086 len. 36]: He believed he knew the old lady whose acquaintance they had made , he said ; and that he might venture to say , from their description of her , that her name was Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 16087 len. 52]: But of what nature the communication could have been which Tom had borne so unexpectedly ; why its delivery had been entrusted to him ; how it happened that the parties were involved together ; and what secret lay at the bottom of the whole affair ; perplexed him very much .
Parsing [sent. 16088 len. 24]: Tom had been sure of his taking some interest in the matter ; but was not prepared for the strong interest he showed .
Parsing [sent. 16089 len. 33]: It held John Westlock to the subject even after Ruth had left the room ; and evidently made him anxious to pursue it further than as a mere subject of conversation . '
Parsing [sent. 16090 len. 46]: I shall remonstrate with my landlord , of course , ' said Tom ; ` though he is a very singular secret sort of man , and not likely to afford me much satisfaction ; even if he knew what was in the letter . '
Parsing [sent. 16091 len. 12]: ` Which you may swear he did , ' John interposed .
Parsing [sent. 16092 len. 7]: ` You think so ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 16093 len. 7]: I am certain of it . '
Parsing [sent. 16094 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 16095 len. 47]: said Tom , ' I shall remonstrate with him when I see him -LRB- he goes in and out in a strange way , but I will try to catch him tomorrow morning -RRB- , on his having asked me to execute such an unpleasant commission .
Parsing [sent. 16096 len. 68]: And I have been thinking , John , that if I went down to Mrs What 's - her-name 's in the City , where I was before , you know -- Mrs Todgers 's -- to-morrow morning , I might find poor Mercy Pecksniff there , perhaps , and be able to explain to her how I came to have any hand in the business . '
Parsing [sent. 16097 len. 20]: ` You are perfectly right , Tom , ' returned his friend , after a short interval of reflection .
Parsing [sent. 16098 len. 7]: ` You can not do better .
Parsing [sent. 16099 len. 66]: It is quite clear to me that whatever the business is , there is little good in it ; and it is so desirable for you to disentangle yourself from any appearance of willful connection with it , that I would counsel you to see her husband , if you can , and wash your hands of it by a plain statement of the facts .
Parsing [sent. 16100 len. 15]: I have a misgiving that there is something dark at work here , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 16101 len. 21]: I will tell you why , at another time ; when I have made an inquiry or two myself . '
Parsing [sent. 16102 len. 9]: All this sounded very mysterious to Tom Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 16103 len. 18]: But as he knew he could rely upon his friend , he resolved to follow this advice .
Parsing [sent. 16104 len. 50]: Ah , but it would have been a good thing to have had a coat of invisibility , wherein to have watched little Ruth , when she was left to herself in John Westlock 's chambers , and John and her brother were talking thus , over their wine !
Parsing [sent. 16105 len. 69]: The gentle way in which she tried to get up a little conversation with the fiery-faced matron in the crunched bonnet , who was waiting to attend her ; after making a desperate rally in regard of her dress , and attiring herself in a washed-out yellow gown with sprigs of the same upon it , so that it looked like a tesselated work of pats of butter .
Parsing [sent. 16106 len. 6]: That would have been pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 16107 len. 57]: The grim and griffin-like inflexibility with which the fiery-faced matron repelled these engaging advances , as proceeding from a hostile and dangerous power , who could have no business there , unless it were to deprive her of a customer , or suggest what became of the self-consuming tea and sugar , and other general trifles .
Parsing [sent. 16108 len. 6]: That would have been agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 16109 len. 49]: The bashful , winning , glorious curiosity , with which little Ruth , when fiery-face was gone , peeped into the books and nick-nacks that were lying about , and had a particular interest in some delicate paper-matches on the chimney-piece ; wondering who could have made them .
Parsing [sent. 16110 len. 7]: That would have been worth seeing .
Parsing [sent. 16111 len. 62]: The faltering hand with which she tied those flowers together ; with which , almost blushing at her own fair self as imaged in the glass , she arranged them in her breast , and looking at them with her head aside , now half resolved to take them out again , now half resolved to leave them where they were .
Parsing [sent. 16112 len. 6]: That would have been delightful !
Parsing [sent. 16113 len. 27]: John seemed to think it all delightful ; for coming in with Tom to tea , he took his seat beside her like a man enchanted .
Parsing [sent. 16114 len. 43]: And when the tea-service had been removed , and Tom , sitting down at the piano , became absorbed in some of his old organ tunes , he was still beside her at the open window , looking out upon the twilight .
Parsing [sent. 16115 len. 11]: There is little enough to see in Furnival 's Inn .
Parsing [sent. 16116 len. 29]: It is a shady , quiet place , echoing to the footsteps of the stragglers who have business there ; and rather monotonous and gloomy on summer evenings .
Parsing [sent. 16117 len. 45]: What gave it such a charm to them , that they remained at the window as unconscious of the flight of time as Tom himself , the dreamer , while the melodies which had so often soothed his spirit were hovering again about him !
Parsing [sent. 16118 len. 67]: What power infused into the fading light , the gathering darkness ; the stars that here and there appeared ; the evening air , the City 's hum and stir , the very chiming of the old church clocks ; such exquisite enthrallment , that the divinest regions of the earth spread out before their eyes could not have held them captive in a stronger chain ?
Parsing [sent. 16119 len. 13]: The shadows deepened , deepened , and the room became quite dark .
Parsing [sent. 16120 len. 22]: Still Tom 's fingers wandered over the keys of the piano , and still the window had its pair of tenants .
Parsing [sent. 16121 len. 22]: At length , her hand upon his shoulder , and her breath upon his forehead , roused Tom from his reverie .
Parsing [sent. 16122 len. 5]: ` Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 16123 len. 9]: he cried , desisting with a start . '
Parsing [sent. 16124 len. 12]: I am afraid I have been very inconsiderate and unpolite . '
Parsing [sent. 16125 len. 12]: Tom little thought how much consideration and politeness he had shown !
Parsing [sent. 16126 len. 13]: ` Sing something to us , my dear , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 16127 len. 7]: ` let us hear your voice .
Parsing [sent. 16128 len. 3]: Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 16129 len. 18]: John Westlock added his entreaties with such earnestness that a flinty heart alone could have resisted them .
Parsing [sent. 16130 len. 7]: Hers was not a flinty heart .
Parsing [sent. 16131 len. 5]: Oh , dear no !
Parsing [sent. 16132 len. 4]: Quite another thing .
Parsing [sent. 16133 len. 19]: So down she sat , and in a pleasant voice began to sing the ballads Tom loved well .
Parsing [sent. 16134 len. 96]: Old rhyming stories , with here and there a pause for a few simple chords , such as a harper might have sounded in the ancient time while looking upward for the current of some half-remembered legend ; words of old poets , wedded to such measures that the strain of music might have been the poet 's breath , giving utterance and expression to his thoughts ; and now a melody so joyous and light-hearted , that the singer seemed incapable of sadness , until in her inconstancy -LRB- oh wicked little singer ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 16135 len. 22]: she relapsed , and broke the listeners ' hearts again ; these were the simple means she used to please them .
Parsing [sent. 16136 len. 25]: And that these simple means prevailed , and she DID please them , let the still darkened chamber , and its long-deferred illumination witness .
Parsing [sent. 16137 len. 14]: The candles came at last , and it was time for moving homeward .
Parsing [sent. 16138 len. 32]: Cutting paper carefully , and rolling it about the stalks of those same flowers , occasioned some delay ; but even this was done in time , and Ruth was ready .
Parsing [sent. 16139 len. 5]: ` Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 16140 len. 4]: said Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 16141 len. 8]: A memorable and delightful visit , John !
Parsing [sent. 16142 len. 4]: Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 16143 len. 8]: John thought he would walk with them .
Parsing [sent. 16144 len. 5]: ` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 16145 len. 4]: Do n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 16146 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 16147 len. 4]: ` What nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 16148 len. 8]: We can get home very well alone .
Parsing [sent. 16149 len. 10]: I could n't think of taking you out . '
Parsing [sent. 16150 len. 7]: But John said he would rather .
Parsing [sent. 16151 len. 9]: ` Are you sure you would rather ? '
Parsing [sent. 16152 len. 4]: said Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 16153 len. 12]: I am afraid you only say so out of politeness . '
Parsing [sent. 16154 len. 16]: John being quite sure , gave his arm to Ruth , and led her out .
Parsing [sent. 16155 len. 28]: Fiery-face , who was again in attendance , acknowledged her departure with so cold a curtsey that it was hardly visible ; and cut Tom , dead .
Parsing [sent. 16156 len. 19]: Their host was bent on walking the whole distance , and would not listen to Tom 's dissuasions .
Parsing [sent. 16157 len. 12]: Happy time , happy walk , happy parting , happy dreams !
Parsing [sent. 16158 len. 20]: But there are some sweet day-dreams , so there are that put the visions of the night to shame .
Parsing [sent. 16159 len. 29]: Busily the Temple fountain murmured in the moonlight , while Ruth lay sleeping , with her flowers beside her ; and John Westlock sketched a portrait -- whose ?
Parsing [sent. 16160 len. 4]: -- from memory .
Parsing [sent. 16161 len. 73]: CHAPTER FORTY -- SIX IN WHICH MISS PECKSNIFF MAKES LOVE , MR JONAS MAKES WRATH , MRS GAMP MAKES TEA , AND MR CHUFFEY MAKES BUSINESS On the next day 's official duties coming to a close , Tom hurried home without losing any time by the way ; and after dinner and a short rest sallied out again , accompanied by Ruth , to pay his projected visit to Todgers 's .
Parsing [sent. 16162 len. 65]: Tom took Ruth with him , not only because it was a great pleasure to him to have her for his companion whenever he could , but because he wished her to cherish and comfort poor Merry ; which she , for her own part -LRB- having heard the wretched history of that young wife from Tom -RRB- , was all eagerness to do .
Parsing [sent. 16163 len. 26]: ` She was so glad to see me , ' said Tom , ` that I am sure she will be glad to see you .
Parsing [sent. 16164 len. 16]: Your sympathy is certain to be much more delicate and acceptable than mine . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16165 len. 25]: I am very far from being certain of that , Tom , ' she replied ; ` and indeed you do yourself an injustice .
Parsing [sent. 16166 len. 4]: Indeed you do .
Parsing [sent. 16167 len. 11]: But I hope she may like me , Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 16168 len. 11]: ` Oh , she is sure to do that ! '
Parsing [sent. 16169 len. 5]: cried Tom , confidently .
Parsing [sent. 16170 len. 19]: ` What a number of friends I should have , if everybody was of your way of thinking .
Parsing [sent. 16171 len. 9]: Should n't I , Tom , dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 16172 len. 10]: said his little sister pinching him upon the cheek .
Parsing [sent. 16173 len. 25]: Tom laughed , and said that with reference to this particular case he had no doubt at all of finding a disciple in Merry .
Parsing [sent. 16174 len. 86]: ` For you women , ' said Tom , ` you women , my dear , are so kind , and in your kindness have such nice perception ; you know so well how to be affectionate and full of solicitude without appearing to be ; your gentleness of feeling is like your touch so light and easy , that the one enables you to deal with wounds of the mind as tenderly as the other enables you to deal with wounds of the body .
Parsing [sent. 16175 len. 12]: You are such -- ' ` My goodness , Tom ! '
Parsing [sent. 16176 len. 4]: his sister interposed .
Parsing [sent. 16177 len. 10]: ` You ought to fall in love immediately . '
Parsing [sent. 16178 len. 25]: Tom put this observation off good humouredly , but somewhat gravely too ; and they were soon very chatty again on some other subject .
Parsing [sent. 16179 len. 63]: As they were passing through a street in the City , not very far from Mrs Todgers 's place of residence , Ruth checked Tom before the window of a large Upholstery and Furniture Warehouse , to call his attention to something very magnificent and ingenious , displayed there to the best advantage , for the admiration and temptation of the public .
Parsing [sent. 16180 len. 69]: Tom had hazarded some most erroneous and extravagantly wrong guess in relation to the price of this article , and had joined his sister in laughing heartily at his mistake , when he pressed her arm in his , and pointed to two persons at a little distance , who were looking in at the same window with a deep interest in the chests of drawers and tables .
Parsing [sent. 16181 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 16182 len. 3]: Tom whispered .
Parsing [sent. 16183 len. 18]: ` Miss Pecksniff , and the young gentleman to whom she is going to be married . '
Parsing [sent. 16184 len. 17]: ` Why does he look as if he was going to be buried , Tom ? '
Parsing [sent. 16185 len. 5]: inquired his little sister .
Parsing [sent. 16186 len. 28]: ` Why , he is naturally a dismal young gentleman , I believe , ' said Tom ` but he is very civil and inoffensive . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16187 len. 12]: I suppose they are furnishing their house , ' whispered Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 16188 len. 12]: ` Yes , I suppose they are , ' replied Tom .
Parsing [sent. 16189 len. 10]: ` We had better avoid speaking to them . '
Parsing [sent. 16190 len. 37]: They could not very well avoid looking at them , however , especially as some obstruction on the pavement , at a little distance , happened to detain them where they were for a few moments .
Parsing [sent. 16191 len. 31]: Miss Pecksniff had quite the air of having taken the unhappy Moddle captive , and brought him up to the contemplation of the furniture like a lamb to the altar .
Parsing [sent. 16192 len. 12]: He offered no resistance , but was perfectly resigned and quiet .
Parsing [sent. 16193 len. 47]: The melancholy depicted in the turn of his languishing head , and in his dejected attitude , was extreme ; and though there was a full-sized four-post bedstead in the window , such a tear stood trembling in his eye as seemed to blot it out .
Parsing [sent. 16194 len. 27]: ` Augustus , my love , ' said Miss Pecksniff , ` ask the price of the eight rosewood chairs , and the loo table . '
Parsing [sent. 16195 len. 11]: ` Perhaps they are ordered already , ' said Augustus .
Parsing [sent. 16196 len. 8]: ` Perhaps they are Another 's . '
Parsing [sent. 16197 len. 17]: ` They can make more like them , if they are , ' rejoined Miss Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 16198 len. 13]: ` No , no , they ca n't , ' said Moddle .
Parsing [sent. 16199 len. 6]: ` It 's impossible ! '
Parsing [sent. 16200 len. 28]: He appeared , for the moment , to be quite overwhelmed and stupefied by the prospect of his approaching happiness ; but recovering , entered the shop .
Parsing [sent. 16201 len. 16]: He returned immediately , saying in a tone of despair ` Twenty-four pound ten ! '
Parsing [sent. 16202 len. 21]: Miss Pecksniff , turning to receive this announcement , became conscious of the observation of Tom Pinch and his sister .
Parsing [sent. 16203 len. 6]: ` Oh , really ! '
Parsing [sent. 16204 len. 20]: cried Miss Pecksniff , glancing about her , as if for some convenient means of sinking into the earth .
Parsing [sent. 16205 len. 30]: ` Upon my word , I -- there never was such a -- to think that one should be so very -- Mr Augustus Moddle , Miss Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 16206 len. 16]: Miss Pecksniff was quite gracious to Miss Pinch in this triumphant introduction ; exceedingly gracious .
Parsing [sent. 16207 len. 12]: She was more than gracious ; she was kind and cordial .
Parsing [sent. 16208 len. 86]: Whether the recollection of the old service Tom had rendered her in knocking Mr Jonas on the head had wrought this change in her opinions ; or whether her separation from her parent had reconciled her to all human-kind , or to all that interesting portion of human-kind which was not friendly to him ; or whether the delight of having some new female acquaintance to whom to communicate her interesting prospects was paramount to every other consideration ; cordial and kind Miss Pecksniff was .
Parsing [sent. 16209 len. 11]: And twice Miss Pecksniff kissed Miss Pinch upon the cheek .
Parsing [sent. 16210 len. 9]: ` Augustus -- Mr Pinch , you know .
Parsing [sent. 16211 len. 5]: My dear girl ! '
Parsing [sent. 16212 len. 7]: said Miss Pecksniff , aside . '
Parsing [sent. 16213 len. 10]: I never was so ashamed in my life . '
Parsing [sent. 16214 len. 10]: Ruth begged her not to think of it . '
Parsing [sent. 16215 len. 14]: I mind your brother less than anybody else , ' simpered Miss Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 16216 len. 12]: ` But the indelicacy of meeting any gentleman under such circumstances !
Parsing [sent. 16217 len. 17]: Augustus , my child , did you -- ' Here Miss Pecksniff whispered in his ear .
Parsing [sent. 16218 len. 11]: The suffering Moddle repeated : ` Twenty-four pound ten ! '
Parsing [sent. 16219 len. 7]: ` Oh , you silly man !
Parsing [sent. 16220 len. 12]: I do n't mean them , ' said Miss Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 16221 len. 13]: I am speaking of the -- ' Here she whispered him again .
Parsing [sent. 16222 len. 28]: ` If it 's the same patterned chintz as that in the window ; thirty-two , twelve , six , ' said Moddle , with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 16223 len. 6]: ` And very dear . '
Parsing [sent. 16224 len. 23]: Miss Pecksniff stopped him from giving any further explanation by laying her hand upon his lips , and betraying a soft embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 16225 len. 12]: She then asked Tom Pinch which way he was going . '
Parsing [sent. 16226 len. 27]: I was going to see if I could find your sister , ' answered Tom , ` to whom I wished to say a few words .
Parsing [sent. 16227 len. 19]: We were going to Mrs Todgers 's , where I had the pleasure of seeing her before . '
Parsing [sent. 16228 len. 34]: ` It 's of no use your going on , then , ' said Cherry , ` for we have not long left there ; and I know she is not at home .
Parsing [sent. 16229 len. 15]: But I 'll take you to my sister 's house , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 16230 len. 21]: Augustus -- Mr Moddle , I mean -- and myself , are on our way to tea there , now .
Parsing [sent. 16231 len. 24]: You need n't think of HIM , ' she added , nodding her head as she observed some hesitation on Tom 's part .
Parsing [sent. 16232 len. 8]: ` He is not at home . '
Parsing [sent. 16233 len. 6]: ` Are you sure ? '
Parsing [sent. 16234 len. 3]: asked Tom .
Parsing [sent. 16235 len. 10]: ` Oh , I am quite sure of that .
Parsing [sent. 16236 len. 15]: I do n't want any MORE revenge , ' said Miss Pecksniff , expressively .
Parsing [sent. 16237 len. 24]: ` But , really , I must beg you two gentlemen to walk on , and allow me to follow with Miss Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 16238 len. 12]: My dear , I never was so taken by surprise ! '
Parsing [sent. 16239 len. 24]: In furtherance of this bashful arrangement , Moddle gave his arm to Tom ; and Miss Pecksniff linked her own in Ruth 's .
Parsing [sent. 16240 len. 45]: ` Of course , my love , ' said Miss Pecksniff , ` it would be useless for me to disguise , after what you have seen , that I am about to be united to the gentleman who is walking with your brother .
Parsing [sent. 16241 len. 9]: It would be in vain to conceal it .
Parsing [sent. 16242 len. 7]: What do you think of him ?
Parsing [sent. 16243 len. 10]: Pray , let me have your candid opinion . '
Parsing [sent. 16244 len. 19]: Ruth intimated that , as far as she could judge , he was a very eligible swain . '
Parsing [sent. 16245 len. 42]: I am curious to know , ' said Miss Pecksniff , with loquacious frankness , ` whether you have observed , or fancied , in this very short space of time , that he is of a rather melancholy turn ? '
Parsing [sent. 16246 len. 11]: ` So very short a time , ' Ruth pleaded .
Parsing [sent. 16247 len. 21]: ` No , no ; but do n't let that interfere with your answer , ' returned Miss Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 16248 len. 10]: I am curious to hear what you say . '
Parsing [sent. 16249 len. 17]: Ruth acknowledged that he had impressed her at first sight as looking ` rather low . '
Parsing [sent. 16250 len. 6]: ` No , really ? '
Parsing [sent. 16251 len. 4]: said Miss Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 16252 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 16253 len. 5]: that is quite remarkable !
Parsing [sent. 16254 len. 5]: Everybody says the same .
Parsing [sent. 16255 len. 23]: Mrs Todgers says the same ; and Augustus informs me that it is quite a joke among the gentlemen in the house .
Parsing [sent. 16256 len. 31]: Indeed , but for the positive commands I have laid upon him , I believe it would have been the occasion of loaded fire-arms being resorted to more than once .
Parsing [sent. 16257 len. 14]: What do you think is the cause of his appearance of depression ? '
Parsing [sent. 16258 len. 21]: Ruth thought of several things ; such as his digestion , his tailor , his mother , and the like .
Parsing [sent. 16259 len. 18]: But hesitating to give utterance to any one of them , she refrained from expressing an opinion .
Parsing [sent. 16260 len. 44]: ` My dear , ' said Miss Pecksniff ; ' I should n't wish it to be known , but I do n't mind mentioning it to you , having known your brother for so many years -- I refused Augustus three times .
Parsing [sent. 16261 len. 37]: He is of a most amiable and sensitive nature , always ready to shed tears if you look at him , which is extremely charming ; and he has never recovered the effect of that cruelty .
Parsing [sent. 16262 len. 25]: For it WAS cruel , ' said Miss Pecksniff , with a self-conviction candour that might have adorned the diadem of her own papa .
Parsing [sent. 16263 len. 8]: ` There is no doubt of it .
Parsing [sent. 16264 len. 10]: I look back upon my conduct now with blushes .
Parsing [sent. 16265 len. 5]: I always liked him .
Parsing [sent. 16266 len. 26]: I felt that he was not to me what the crowd of young men who had made proposals had been , but something very different .
Parsing [sent. 16267 len. 12]: Then what right had I to refuse him three times ? '
Parsing [sent. 16268 len. 17]: ` It was a severe trial of his fidelity , no doubt , ' said Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 16269 len. 9]: ` My dear , ' returned Miss Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 16270 len. 5]: ` It was wrong .
Parsing [sent. 16271 len. 11]: But such is the caprice and thoughtlessness of our sex !
Parsing [sent. 16272 len. 8]: Let me be a warning to you .
Parsing [sent. 16273 len. 72]: Do n't try the feelings of any one who makes you an offer , as I have tried the feelings of Augustus ; but if you ever feel towards a person as I really felt towards him , at the very time when I was driving him to distraction , let that feeling find expression , if that person throws himself at your feet , as Augustus Moddle did at mine .
Parsing [sent. 16274 len. 32]: Think , ' said Miss Pecksniff , ` what my feelings would have been , if I had goaded him to suicide , and it had got into the papers ! '
Parsing [sent. 16275 len. 14]: Ruth observed that she would have been full of remorse , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 16276 len. 4]: ` Remorse ! '
Parsing [sent. 16277 len. 13]: cried Miss Pecksniff , in a sort of snug and comfortable penitence .
Parsing [sent. 16278 len. 25]: ` What my remorse is at this moment , even after making reparation by accepting him , it would be impossible to tell you !
Parsing [sent. 16279 len. 47]: Looking back upon my giddy self , my dear , now that I am sobered down and made thoughtful , by treading on the very brink of matrimony ; and contemplating myself as I was when I was like what you are now ; I shudder .
Parsing [sent. 16280 len. 3]: I shudder .
Parsing [sent. 16281 len. 9]: What is the consequence of my past conduct ?
Parsing [sent. 16282 len. 14]: Until Augustus leads me to the altar he is not sure of me .
Parsing [sent. 16283 len. 21]: I have blighted and withered the affections of his heart to that extent that he is not sure of me .
Parsing [sent. 16284 len. 13]: I see that preying on his mind and feeding on his vitals .
Parsing [sent. 16285 len. 19]: What are the reproaches of my conscience , when I see this in the man I love ! '
Parsing [sent. 16286 len. 24]: Ruth endeavoured to express some sense of her unbounded and flattering confidence ; and presumed that she was going to be married soon .
Parsing [sent. 16287 len. 10]: ` Very soon indeed , ' returned Miss Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 16288 len. 9]: ` As soon as our house is ready .
Parsing [sent. 16289 len. 11]: We are furnishing now as fast as we can . '
Parsing [sent. 16290 len. 75]: In the same vein of confidence Miss Pecksniff ran through a general inventory of the articles that were already bought with the articles that remained to be purchased ; what garments she intended to be married in , and where the ceremony was to be performed ; and gave Miss Pinch , in short -LRB- as she told her -RRB- , early and exclusive information on all points of interest connected with the event .
Parsing [sent. 16291 len. 78]: While this was going forward in the rear , Tom and Mr Moddle walked on , arm in arm , in the front , in a state of profound silence , which Tom at last broke ; after thinking for a long time what he could say that should refer to an indifferent topic , in respect of which he might rely , with some degree of certainty , on Mr Moddle 's bosom being unruffled . '
Parsing [sent. 16292 len. 22]: I wonder , ' said Tom , ` that in these crowded streets the foot-passengers are not oftener run over . '
Parsing [sent. 16293 len. 19]: Mr Moddle , with a dark look , replied : ` The drivers wo n't do it . '
Parsing [sent. 16294 len. 6]: ` Do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 16295 len. 27]: Tom began -- ` That there are some men , ' interrupted Moddle , with a hollow laugh , ` who ca n't get run over .
Parsing [sent. 16296 len. 6]: They live a charmed life .
Parsing [sent. 16297 len. 15]: Coal waggons recoil from them , and even cabs refuse to run them down .
Parsing [sent. 16298 len. 3]: Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 16299 len. 8]: said Augustus , marking Tom 's astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 16300 len. 6]: ` There are such men .
Parsing [sent. 16301 len. 10]: One of 'em is a friend of mine . '
Parsing [sent. 16302 len. 28]: ` Upon my word and honour , ' thought Tom , ` this young gentleman is in a state of mind which is very serious indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 16303 len. 60]: Abandoning all idea of conversation , he did not venture to say another word , but he was careful to keep a tight hold upon Augustus 's arm , lest he should fly into the road , and making another and a more successful attempt , should get up a private little Juggernaut before the eyes of his betrothed .
Parsing [sent. 16304 len. 33]: Tom was so afraid of his committing this rash act , that he had scarcely ever experienced such mental relief as when they arrived in safety at Mrs Jonas Chuzzlewit 's house .
Parsing [sent. 16305 len. 14]: ` Walk up , pray , Mr Pinch , ' said Miss Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 16306 len. 11]: For Tom halted , irresolutely , at the door . '
Parsing [sent. 16307 len. 29]: I am doubtful whether I should be welcome , ' replied Tom , ` or , I ought rather to say , I have no doubt about it .
Parsing [sent. 16308 len. 11]: I will send up a message , I think . '
Parsing [sent. 16309 len. 8]: ` But what nonsense that is ! '
Parsing [sent. 16310 len. 9]: returned Miss Pecksniff , speaking apart to Tom .
Parsing [sent. 16311 len. 11]: ` He is not at home , I am certain .
Parsing [sent. 16312 len. 25]: I know he is not ; and Merry has n't the least idea that you ever -- ' ` No , ' interrupted Tom .
Parsing [sent. 16313 len. 13]: ` Nor would I have her know it , on any account .
Parsing [sent. 16314 len. 14]: I am not so proud of that scuffle , I assure you . '
Parsing [sent. 16315 len. 22]: ` Ah , but then you are so modest , you see , ' returned Miss Pecksniff , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 16316 len. 6]: ` But pray walk up .
Parsing [sent. 16317 len. 22]: If you do n't wish her to know it , and do wish to speak to her , pray walk up .
Parsing [sent. 16318 len. 7]: Pray walk up , Miss Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 16319 len. 6]: Do n't stand here . '
Parsing [sent. 16320 len. 14]: Tom still hesitated for he felt that he was in an awkward position .
Parsing [sent. 16321 len. 41]: But Cherry passing him at this juncture , and leading his sister upstairs , and the house-door being at the same time shut behind them , he followed without quite knowing whether it was well or ill-judged so to do .
Parsing [sent. 16322 len. 7]: ` Merry , my darling ! '
Parsing [sent. 16323 len. 14]: said the fair Miss Pecksniff , opening the door of the usual sitting-room .
Parsing [sent. 16324 len. 13]: ` Here are Mr Pinch and his sister come to see you !
Parsing [sent. 16325 len. 11]: I thought we should find you here , Mrs Todgers !
Parsing [sent. 16326 len. 8]: How do you do , Mrs Gamp ?
Parsing [sent. 16327 len. 26]: And how do you do , Mr Chuffey , though it 's of no use asking you the question , I am well aware . '
Parsing [sent. 16328 len. 26]: Honouring each of these parties , as she severally addressed them , with an acid smile , Miss Charity presented ` Mr Moddle . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16329 len. 13]: I believe you have seen HIM before , ' she pleasantly observed .
Parsing [sent. 16330 len. 13]: ` Augustus , my sweet child , bring me a chair . '
Parsing [sent. 16331 len. 49]: The sweet child did as he was told ; and was then about to retire into a corner to mourn in secret , when Miss Charity , calling him in an audible whisper a ` little pet , ' gave him leave to come and sit beside her .
Parsing [sent. 16332 len. 30]: It is to be hoped , for the general cheerfulness of mankind , that such a doleful little pet was never seen as Mr Moddle looked when he complied .
Parsing [sent. 16333 len. 45]: So despondent was his temper , that he showed no outward thrill of ecstasy when Miss Pecksniff placed her lily hand in his , and concealed this mark of her favour from the vulgar gaze by covering it with a corner of her shawl .
Parsing [sent. 16334 len. 47]: Indeed , he was infinitely more rueful then than he had been before ; and , sitting uncomfortably upright in his chair , surveyed the company with watery eyes , which seemed to say , without the aid of language , ` Oh , good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 16335 len. 3]: look here !
Parsing [sent. 16336 len. 9]: Wo n't some kind Christian help me ! '
Parsing [sent. 16337 len. 33]: But the ecstasies of Mrs Gamp were sufficient to have furnished forth a score of young lovers ; and they were chiefly awakened by the sight of Tom Pinch and his sister .
Parsing [sent. 16338 len. 30]: Mrs Gamp was a lady of that happy temperament which can be ecstatic without any other stimulating cause than a general desire to establish a large and profitable connection .
Parsing [sent. 16339 len. 32]: She added daily so many strings to her bow , that she made a perfect harp of it ; and upon that instrument she now began to perform an extemporaneous concerto .
Parsing [sent. 16340 len. 7]: ` Why , goodness me ! '
Parsing [sent. 16341 len. 7]: she said , ` Mrs Chuzzlewit !
Parsing [sent. 16342 len. 176]: To think as I should see beneath this blessed ` ouse , which well I know it , Miss Pecksniff , my sweet young lady , to be a ` ouse as there is not a many like , worse luck , and wishin ' it were not so , which then this tearful walley would be changed into a flowerin ' guardian , Mr Chuffey ; to think as I should see beneath this indiwidgle roof , identically comin ' , Mr Pinch -LRB- I take the liberty , though almost unbeknown -RRB- , and do assure you of it , sir , the smilinest and sweetest face as ever , Mrs Chuzzlewit , I see exceptin ' yourn , my dear good lady , and YOUR good lady 's too , sir , Mr Moddle , if I may make so bold as speak so plain of what is plain enough to them as need n't look through millstones , Mrs Todgers , to find out wot is wrote upon the wall behind .
Parsing [sent. 16343 len. 18]: Which no offence is meant , ladies and gentlemen ; none bein ' took , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 16344 len. 40]: To think as I should see that smilinest and sweetest face which me and another friend of mine , took notice of among the packages down London Bridge , in this promiscous place , is a surprige in-deed ! '
Parsing [sent. 16345 len. 70]: Having contrived , in this happy manner , to invest every member of her audience with an individual share and immediate personal interest in her address , Mrs Gamp dropped several curtseys to Ruth , and smilingly shaking her head a great many times , pursued the thread of her discourse : ` Now , ai n't we rich in beauty this here joyful arternoon , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 16346 len. 117]: I knows a lady , which her name , I 'll not deceive you , Mrs Chuzzlewit , is Harris , her husband 's brother bein ' six foot three , and marked with a mad bull in Wellington boots upon his left arm , on account of his precious mother havin ' been worrited by one into a shoemaker 's shop , when in a sitiwation which blessed is the man as has his quiver full of sech , as many times I 've said to Gamp when words has roge betwixt us on account of the expense -- and often have I said to Mrs Harris , `` Oh , Mrs Harris , ma'am !
Parsing [sent. 16347 len. 9]: your countenance is quite a angel 's ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16348 len. 10]: Which , but for Pimples , it would be .
Parsing [sent. 16349 len. 36]: `` No , Sairey Gamp , '' says she , `` you best of hard-working and industrious creeturs as ever was underpaid at any price , which underpaid you are , quite diff ` rent .
Parsing [sent. 16350 len. 47]: Harris had it done afore marriage at ten and six , '' she says , `` and wore it faithful next his heart `` till the colour run , when the money was declined to be give back , and no arrangement could be come to .
Parsing [sent. 16351 len. 19]: But he never said it was a angel 's , Sairey , wotever he might have thought . ''
Parsing [sent. 16352 len. 48]: If Mrs Harris 's husband was here now , ' said Mrs Gamp , looking round , and chuckling as she dropped a general curtsey , ` he 'd speak out plain , he would , and his dear wife would be the last to blame him !
Parsing [sent. 16353 len. 47]: For if ever a woman lived as know 'd not wot it was to form a wish to pizon them as had good looks , and had no reagion give her by the best of husbands , Mrs Harris is that ev ` nly dispogician ! '
Parsing [sent. 16354 len. 59]: With these words the worthy woman , who appeared to have dropped in to take tea as a delicate little attention , rather than to have any engagement on the premises in an official capacity , crossed to Mr Chuffey , who was seated in the same corner as of old , and shook him by the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 16355 len. 8]: ` Rouge yourself , and look up !
Parsing [sent. 16356 len. 3]: Come ! '
Parsing [sent. 16357 len. 4]: said Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 16358 len. 10]: ` Here 's company , Mr Chuffey . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16359 len. 19]: I am sorry for it , ' cried the old man , looking humbly round the room . '
Parsing [sent. 16360 len. 8]: I know I 'm in the way .
Parsing [sent. 16361 len. 13]: I ask pardon , but I 've nowhere else to go to .
Parsing [sent. 16362 len. 5]: Where is she ? '
Parsing [sent. 16363 len. 5]: Merry went to him .
Parsing [sent. 16364 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 16365 len. 11]: said the old man , patting her on the check .
Parsing [sent. 16366 len. 5]: ` Here she is .
Parsing [sent. 16367 len. 4]: Here she is !
Parsing [sent. 16368 len. 9]: She 's never hard on poor old Chuffey .
Parsing [sent. 16369 len. 5]: Poor old Chuff ! '
Parsing [sent. 16370 len. 33]: As she took her seat upon a low chair by the old man 's side , and put herself within the reach of his hand , she looked up once at Tom .
Parsing [sent. 16371 len. 22]: It was a sad look that she cast upon him , though there was a faint smile trembling on her face .
Parsing [sent. 16372 len. 13]: It was a speaking look , and Tom knew what it said .
Parsing [sent. 16373 len. 9]: ` You see how misery has changed me .
Parsing [sent. 16374 len. 17]: I can feel for a dependant NOW , and set some value on his attachment . '
Parsing [sent. 16375 len. 6]: ` Aye , aye ! '
Parsing [sent. 16376 len. 7]: cried Chuffey in a soothing tone .
Parsing [sent. 16377 len. 7]: ` Aye , aye , aye !
Parsing [sent. 16378 len. 4]: Never mind him .
Parsing [sent. 16379 len. 11]: It 's hard to hear , but never mind him .
Parsing [sent. 16380 len. 6]: He 'll die one day .
Parsing [sent. 16381 len. 30]: There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year -- three hundred and sixty-six in leap year -- and he may die on any one of 'em . '
Parsing [sent. 16382 len. 39]: ` You 're a wearing old soul , and that 's the sacred truth , ' said Mrs Gamp , contemplating him from a little distance with anything but favour , as he continued to mutter to himself .
Parsing [sent. 16383 len. 40]: ` It 's a pity that you do n't know wot you say , for you 'd tire your own patience out if you did , and fret yourself into a happy releage for all as knows you . '
Parsing [sent. 16384 len. 15]: ` His son , ' murmured the old man , lifting up his hand .
Parsing [sent. 16385 len. 5]: ` His son ! '
Parsing [sent. 16386 len. 8]: ` Well , I 'm sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 16387 len. 15]: said Mrs Gamp , ` you 're a-settlin ' of it , Mr Chuffey .
Parsing [sent. 16388 len. 9]: To your satigefaction , sir , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 16389 len. 21]: But I would n't lay a new pincushion on it myself , sir , though you ARE so well informed .
Parsing [sent. 16390 len. 17]: Drat the old creetur , he 's a-layin ' down the law tolerable confident , too !
Parsing [sent. 16391 len. 7]: A deal he knows of sons !
Parsing [sent. 16392 len. 4]: or darters either !
Parsing [sent. 16393 len. 21]: Suppose you was to favour us with some remarks on twins , sir , WOULD you be so good ! '
Parsing [sent. 16394 len. 39]: The bitter and indignant sarcasm which Mrs Gamp conveyed into these taunts was altogether lost on the unconscious Chuffey , who appeared to be as little cognizant of their delivery as of his having given Mrs Gamp offence .
Parsing [sent. 16395 len. 72]: But that high-minded woman being sensitively alive to any invasion of her professional province , and imagining that Mr Chuffey had given utterance to some prediction on the subject of sons , which ought to have emanated in the first instance from herself as the only lawful authority , or which should at least have been on no account proclaimed without her sanction and concurrence , was not so easily appeased .
Parsing [sent. 16396 len. 68]: She continued to sidle at Mr Chuffey with looks of sharp hostility , and to defy him with many other ironical remarks , uttered in that low key which commonly denotes suppressed indignation ; until the entrance of the teaboard , and a request from Mrs Jonas that she would make tea at a side-table for the party that had unexpectedly assembled , restored her to herself .
Parsing [sent. 16397 len. 15]: She smiled again , and entered on her ministration with her own particular urbanity .
Parsing [sent. 16398 len. 26]: ` And quite a family it is to make tea for , ' said Mrs Gamp ; ` and wot a happiness to do it !
Parsing [sent. 16399 len. 31]: My good young ` ooman ' -- to the servant-girl -- ` p ` raps somebody would like to try a new-laid egg or two , not biled too hard .
Parsing [sent. 16400 len. 132]: Likeways , a few rounds o ' buttered toast , first cuttin ' off the crust , in consequence of tender teeth , and not too many of 'em ; which Gamp himself , Mrs Chuzzlewit , at one blow , being in liquor , struck out four , two single , and two double , as was took by Mrs Harris for a keepsake , and is carried in her pocket at this present hour , along with two cramp-bones , a bit o ' ginger , and a grater like a blessed infant 's shoe , in tin , with a little heel to put the nutmeg in ; as many times I 've seen and said , and used for candle when required , within the month . '
Parsing [sent. 16401 len. 95]: As the privileges of the side-table -- besides including the small prerogatives of sitting next the toast , and taking two cups of tea to other people 's one , and always taking them at a crisis , that is to say , before putting fresh water into the tea-pot , and after it had been standing for some time -- also comprehended a full view of the company , and an opportunity of addressing them as from a rostrum , Mrs Gamp discharged the functions entrusted to her with extreme good-humour and affability .
Parsing [sent. 16402 len. 83]: Sometimes resting her saucer on the palm of her outspread hand , and supporting her elbow on the table , she stopped between her sips of tea to favour the circle with a smile , a wink , a roll of the head , or some other mark of notice ; and at those periods her countenance was lighted up with a degree of intelligence and vivacity , which it was almost impossible to separate from the benignant influence of distilled waters .
Parsing [sent. 16403 len. 14]: But for Mrs Gamp , it would have been a curiously silent party .
Parsing [sent. 16404 len. 14]: Miss Pecksniff only spoke to her Augustus , and to him in whispers .
Parsing [sent. 16405 len. 42]: Augustus spoke to nobody , but sighed for every one , and occasionally gave himself such a sounding slap upon the forehead as would make Mrs Todgers , who was rather nervous , start in her chair with an involuntary exclamation .
Parsing [sent. 16406 len. 11]: Mrs Todgers was occupied in knitting , and seldom spoke .
Parsing [sent. 16407 len. 53]: Poor Merry held the hand of cheerful little Ruth between her own , and listening with evident pleasure to all she said , but rarely speaking herself , sometimes smiled , and sometimes kissed her on the cheek , and sometimes turned aside to hide the tears that trembled in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 16408 len. 59]: Tom felt this change in her so much , and was so glad to see how tenderly Ruth dealt with her , and how she knew and answered to it , that he had not the heart to make any movement towards their departure , although he had long since given utterance to all he came to say .
Parsing [sent. 16409 len. 47]: The old clerk , subsiding into his usual state , remained profoundly silent , while the rest of the little assembly were thus occupied , intent upon the dreams , whatever they might be , which hardly seemed to stir the surface of his sluggish thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 16410 len. 41]: The bent of these dull fancies combining probably with the silent feasting that was going on about him , and some struggling recollection of the last approach to revelry he had witnessed , suggested a strange question to his mind .
Parsing [sent. 16411 len. 18]: He looked round upon a sudden , and said : ` Who 's lying dead upstairs ? '
Parsing [sent. 16412 len. 12]: ` No one , ' said Merry , turning to him .
Parsing [sent. 16413 len. 6]: ` What is the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 16414 len. 6]: We are all here . '
Parsing [sent. 16415 len. 5]: ` All here ! '
Parsing [sent. 16416 len. 5]: cried the old man .
Parsing [sent. 16417 len. 4]: ` All here !
Parsing [sent. 16418 len. 18]: Where is he then -- my old master , Mr Chuzzlewit , who had the only son ?
Parsing [sent. 16419 len. 5]: Where is he ? '
Parsing [sent. 16420 len. 3]: ` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 16421 len. 3]: Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 16422 len. 8]: said Merry , speaking kindly to him .
Parsing [sent. 16423 len. 6]: ` That happened long ago .
Parsing [sent. 16424 len. 6]: Do n't you recollect ? '
Parsing [sent. 16425 len. 4]: ` Recollect ! '
Parsing [sent. 16426 len. 11]: rejoined the old man , with a cry of grief .
Parsing [sent. 16427 len. 7]: ` As if I could forget !
Parsing [sent. 16428 len. 8]: As if I ever could forget ! '
Parsing [sent. 16429 len. 29]: He put his hand up to his face for a moment ; and then repeated turning round exactly as before : ` Who 's lying dead upstairs ? '
Parsing [sent. 16430 len. 5]: ` No one ! '
Parsing [sent. 16431 len. 3]: said Merry .
Parsing [sent. 16432 len. 40]: At first he gazed angrily upon her , as upon a stranger who endeavoured to deceive him ; but peering into her face , and seeing that it was indeed she , he shook his head in sorrowful compassion .
Parsing [sent. 16433 len. 5]: ` You think not .
Parsing [sent. 16434 len. 7]: But they do n't tell you .
Parsing [sent. 16435 len. 7]: No , no , poor thing !
Parsing [sent. 16436 len. 6]: They do n't tell you .
Parsing [sent. 16437 len. 18]: Who are these , and why are they merry-making here , if there is no one dead ?
Parsing [sent. 16438 len. 3]: Foul play !
Parsing [sent. 16439 len. 7]: Go see who it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 16440 len. 26]: She made a sign to them not to speak to him , which indeed they had little inclination to do ; and remained silent herself .
Parsing [sent. 16441 len. 26]: So did he for a short time ; but then he repeated the same question with an eagerness that had a peculiar terror in it .
Parsing [sent. 16442 len. 24]: ` There 's some one dead , ' he said , ` or dying ; and I want to knows who it is .
Parsing [sent. 16443 len. 6]: Go see , go see !
Parsing [sent. 16444 len. 5]: Where 's Jonas ? '
Parsing [sent. 16445 len. 9]: ` In the country , ' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 16446 len. 44]: The old man gazed at her as if he doubted what she said , or had not heard her ; and , rising from his chair , walked across the room and upstairs , whispering as he went , ` Foul play ! '
Parsing [sent. 16447 len. 39]: They heard his footsteps overhead , going up into that corner of the room in which the bed stood -LRB- it was there old Anthony had died -RRB- ; and then they heard him coming down again immediately .
Parsing [sent. 16448 len. 36]: His fancy was not so strong or wild that it pictured to him anything in the deserted bedchamber which was not there ; for he returned much calmer , and appeared to have satisfied himself .
Parsing [sent. 16449 len. 30]: ` They do n't tell you , ' he said to Merry in his quavering voice , as he sat down again , and patted her upon the head .
Parsing [sent. 16450 len. 17]: ` They do n't tell me either ; but I 'll watch , I 'll watch .
Parsing [sent. 16451 len. 11]: They shall not hurt you ; do n't be frightened .
Parsing [sent. 16452 len. 14]: When you have sat up watching , I have sat up watching too .
Parsing [sent. 16453 len. 8]: Aye , aye , I have ! '
Parsing [sent. 16454 len. 11]: he piped out , clenching his weak , shrivelled hand .
Parsing [sent. 16455 len. 10]: ` Many a night I have been ready ! '
Parsing [sent. 16456 len. 40]: He said this with such trembling gaps and pauses in his want of breath , and said it in his jealous secrecy so closely in her ear , that little or nothing of it was understood by the visitors .
Parsing [sent. 16457 len. 64]: But they had heard and seen enough of the old man to be disquieted , and to have left their seats and gathered about him ; thereby affording Mrs Gamp , whose professional coolness was not so easily disturbed , an eligible opportunity for concentrating the whole resources of her powerful mind and appetite upon the toast and butter , tea and eggs .
Parsing [sent. 16458 len. 41]: She had brought them to bear upon those viands with such vigour that her face was in the highest state of inflammation , when she now -LRB- there being nothing left to eat or drink -RRB- saw fit to interpose .
Parsing [sent. 16459 len. 9]: ` Why , highty tighty , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 16460 len. 10]: cried Mrs Gamp , ` is these your manners ?
Parsing [sent. 16461 len. 43]: You want a pitcher of cold water throw 'd over you to bring you round ; that 's my belief , and if you was under Betsey Prig you 'd have it , too , I do assure you , Mr Chuffey .
Parsing [sent. 16462 len. 44]: Spanish Flies is the only thing to draw this nonsense out of you ; and if anybody wanted to do you a kindness , they 'd clap a blister of 'em on your head , and put a mustard poultige on your back .
Parsing [sent. 16463 len. 7]: ` Who 's dead , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 16464 len. 16]: It would n't be no grievous loss if some one was , I think ! '
Parsing [sent. 16465 len. 13]: ` He 's quiet now , Mrs Gamp , ' said Merry .
Parsing [sent. 16466 len. 7]: ` Do n't disturb him . '
Parsing [sent. 16467 len. 26]: ` Oh , bother the old wictim , Mrs Chuzzlewit , ' replied that zealous lady , ' I ai n't no patience with him .
Parsing [sent. 16468 len. 11]: You give him his own way too much by half .
Parsing [sent. 16469 len. 7]: A worritin ' wexagious creetur ! '
Parsing [sent. 16470 len. 95]: No doubt with the view of carrying out the precepts she enforced , and ` bothering the old wictim ' in practice as well as in theory , Mrs Gamp took him by the collar of his coat , and gave him some dozen or two of hearty shakes backward and forward in his chair ; that exercise being considered by the disciples of the Prig school of nursing -LRB- who are very numerous among professional ladies -RRB- as exceedingly conducive to repose , and highly beneficial to the performance of the nervous functions .
Parsing [sent. 16471 len. 33]: Its effect in this instance was to render the patient so giddy and addle-headed , that he could say nothing more ; which Mrs Gamp regarded as the triumph of her art .
Parsing [sent. 16472 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 16473 len. 26]: she said , loosening the old man 's cravat , in consequence of his being rather black in the face , after this scientific treatment .
Parsing [sent. 16474 len. 13]: ` Now , I hope , you 're easy in your mind .
Parsing [sent. 16475 len. 19]: If you should turn at all faint we can soon rewive you , sir , I promige you .
Parsing [sent. 16476 len. 47]: Bite a person 's thumbs , or turn their fingers the wrong way , ' said Mrs Gamp , smiling with the consciousness of at once imparting pleasure and instruction to her auditors , ` and they comes to , wonderful , Lord bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 16477 len. 58]: As this excellent woman had been formerly entrusted with the care of Mr Chuffey on a previous occasion , neither Mrs Jonas nor anybody else had the resolution to interfere directly with her mode of treatment ; though all present -LRB- Tom Pinch and his sister especially -RRB- appeared to be disposed to differ from her views .
Parsing [sent. 16478 len. 79]: For such is the rash boldness of the uninitiated , that they will frequently set up some monstrous abstract principle , such as humanity , or tenderness , or the like idle folly , in obstinate defiance of all precedent and usage ; and will even venture to maintain the same against the persons who have made the precedents and established the usage , and who must therefore be the best and most impartial judges of the subject .
Parsing [sent. 16479 len. 7]: ` Ah , Mr Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 16480 len. 4]: said Miss Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 16481 len. 9]: ` It all comes of this unfortunate marriage .
Parsing [sent. 16482 len. 30]: If my sister had not been so precipitate , and had not united herself to a Wretch , there would have been no Mr Chuffey in the house . '
Parsing [sent. 16483 len. 4]: ` Hush ! '
Parsing [sent. 16484 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 16485 len. 8]: ` She 'll hear you . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16486 len. 48]: I should be very sorry if she did hear me , Mr Pinch , ' said Cherry , raising her voice a little ; ` for it is not in my nature to add to the uneasiness of any person ; far less of my own sister .
Parsing [sent. 16487 len. 23]: I know what a sister 's duties are , Mr Pinch , and I hope I always showed it in my practice .
Parsing [sent. 16488 len. 17]: Augustus , my dear child , find my pocket-handkerchief , and give it to me . '
Parsing [sent. 16489 len. 18]: Augustus obeyed , and took Mrs Todgers aside to pour his griefs into her friendly bosom . '
Parsing [sent. 16490 len. 45]: I am sure , Mr Pinch , ' said Charity , looking after her betrothed and glancing at her sister , ` that I ought to be very grateful for the blessings I enjoy , and those which are yet in store for me .
Parsing [sent. 16491 len. 87]: When I contrast Augustus ' -- here she was modest and embarrased -- ` who , I do n't mind saying to you , is all softness , mildness , and devotion , with the detestable man who is my sister 's husband ; and when I think , Mr Pinch , that in the dispensations of this world , our cases might have been reversed ; I have much to be thankful for , indeed , and much to make me humble and contented . '
Parsing [sent. 16492 len. 13]: Contented she might have been , but humble she assuredly was not .
Parsing [sent. 16493 len. 30]: Her face and manner experienced something so widely different from humility , that Tom could not help understanding and despising the base motives that were working in her breast .
Parsing [sent. 16494 len. 19]: He turned away , and said to Ruth , that it was time for them to go . '
Parsing [sent. 16495 len. 72]: I will write to your husband , ' said Tom to Merry , ` and explain to him , as I would have done if I had met him here , that if he has sustained any inconvenience through my means , it is not my fault ; a postman not being more innocent of the news he brings , than I was when I handed him that letter . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16496 len. 5]: I thank you ! '
Parsing [sent. 16497 len. 3]: said Merry .
Parsing [sent. 16498 len. 8]: ` It may do some good . '
Parsing [sent. 16499 len. 42]: She parted tenderly from Ruth , who with her brother was in the act of leaving the room , when a key was heard in the lock of the door below , and immediately afterwards a quick footstep in the passage .
Parsing [sent. 16500 len. 8]: Tom stopped , and looked at Merry .
Parsing [sent. 16501 len. 9]: It was Jonas , she said timidly . '
Parsing [sent. 16502 len. 32]: I had better not meet him on the stairs , perhaps , ' said Tom , drawing his sister 's arm through his , and coming back a step or two .
Parsing [sent. 16503 len. 12]: ` I 'll wait for him here , a moment . '
Parsing [sent. 16504 len. 14]: He had scarcely said it when the door opened , and Jonas entered .
Parsing [sent. 16505 len. 36]: His wife came forward to receive him ; but he put her aside with his hand , and said in a surly tone : ' I did n't know you 'd got a party . '
Parsing [sent. 16506 len. 37]: As he looked , at the same time , either by accident or design , towards Miss Pecksniff ; and as Miss Pecksniff was only too delighted to quarrel with him , she instantly resented it .
Parsing [sent. 16507 len. 5]: ` Oh dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 16508 len. 5]: she said , rising .
Parsing [sent. 16509 len. 12]: ` Pray do n't let us intrude upon your domestic happiness !
Parsing [sent. 16510 len. 6]: That would be a pity .
Parsing [sent. 16511 len. 38]: We have taken tea here , sir , in your absence ; but if you will have the goodness to send us a note of the expense , receipted , we shall be happy to pay it .
Parsing [sent. 16512 len. 13]: Augustus , my love , we will go , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 16513 len. 20]: Mrs Todgers , unless you wish to remain here , we shall be happy to take you with us .
Parsing [sent. 16514 len. 27]: It would be a pity , indeed , to spoil the bliss which this gentleman always brings with him , especially into his own home . '
Parsing [sent. 16515 len. 3]: ` Charity !
Parsing [sent. 16516 len. 3]: Charity ! '
Parsing [sent. 16517 len. 26]: remonstrated her sister , in such a heartfelt tone that she might have been imploring her to show the cardinal virtue whose name she bore .
Parsing [sent. 16518 len. 62]: ` Merry , my dear , I am much obliged to you for your advice , ' returned Miss Pecksniff , with a stately scorn -- by the way , she had not been offered any -- ` but I am not his slave -- ' ` No , nor would n't have been if you could , ' interrupted Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 16519 len. 8]: ` We know all about it . '
Parsing [sent. 16520 len. 9]: ` WHAT did you say , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 16521 len. 6]: cried Miss Pecksniff , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 16522 len. 7]: ` Did n't you hear ? '
Parsing [sent. 16523 len. 10]: retorted Jonas , lounging down upon a chair . '
Parsing [sent. 16524 len. 9]: I am not a-going to say it again .
Parsing [sent. 16525 len. 10]: If you like to stay , you may stay .
Parsing [sent. 16526 len. 10]: If you like to go , you may go .
Parsing [sent. 16527 len. 11]: But if you stay , please to be civil . '
Parsing [sent. 16528 len. 4]: ` Beast ! '
Parsing [sent. 16529 len. 8]: cried Miss Pecksniff , sweeping past him .
Parsing [sent. 16530 len. 3]: ` Augustus !
Parsing [sent. 16531 len. 7]: He is beneath your notice ! '
Parsing [sent. 16532 len. 14]: Augustus had been making some faint and sickly demonstration of shaking his fist .
Parsing [sent. 16533 len. 17]: ` Come away , child , ' screamed Miss Pecksniff , ' I command you ! '
Parsing [sent. 16534 len. 18]: The scream was elicited from her by Augustus manifesting an intention to return and grapple with him .
Parsing [sent. 16535 len. 37]: But Miss Pecksniff giving the fiery youth a pull , and Mrs Todgers giving him a push they all three tumbled out of the room together , to the music of Miss Pecksniff 's shrill remonstrances .
Parsing [sent. 16536 len. 72]: All this time Jonas had seen nothing of Tom and his sister ; for they were almost behind the door when he opened it , and he had sat down with his back towards them , and had purposely kept his eyes upon the opposite side of the street during his altercation with Miss Pecksniff , in order that his seeming carelessness might increase the exasperation of that wronged young damsel .
Parsing [sent. 16537 len. 18]: His wife now faltered out that Tom had been waiting to see him ; and Tom advanced .
Parsing [sent. 16538 len. 38]: The instant he presented himself , Jonas got up from his chair , and swearing a great oath , caught it in his grasp , as if he would have felled Tom to the ground with it .
Parsing [sent. 16539 len. 33]: As he most unquestionably would have done , but that his very passion and surprise made him irresolute , and gave Tom , in his calmness , an opportunity of being heard .
Parsing [sent. 16540 len. 15]: ` You have no cause to be violent , sir , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 16541 len. 28]: ` Though what I wish to say relates to your own affairs , I know nothing of them , and desire to know nothing of them . '
Parsing [sent. 16542 len. 7]: Jonas was too enraged to speak .
Parsing [sent. 16543 len. 18]: He held the door open ; and stamping his foot upon the ground , motioned Tom away .
Parsing [sent. 16544 len. 42]: ` As you can not suppose , ' said Tom , ` that I am here with any view of conciliating you or pleasing myself , I am quite indifferent to your reception of me , or your dismissal of me .
Parsing [sent. 16545 len. 14]: Hear what I have to say , if you are not a madman !
Parsing [sent. 16546 len. 18]: I gave you a letter the other day , when you were about to go abroad . '
Parsing [sent. 16547 len. 8]: ` You Thief , you did ! '
Parsing [sent. 16548 len. 3]: retorted Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 16549 len. 20]: ` I 'll pay you for the carriage of it one day , and settle an old score besides .
Parsing [sent. 16550 len. 4]: I will ! '
Parsing [sent. 16551 len. 18]: ` Tut , tut , ' said Tom , ` you need n't waste words or threats .
Parsing [sent. 16552 len. 53]: I wish you to understand -- plainly because I would rather keep clear of you and everything that concerns you : not because I have the least apprehension of your doing me any injury : which would be weak indeed -- that I am no party to the contents of that letter .
Parsing [sent. 16553 len. 7]: That I know nothing of it .
Parsing [sent. 16554 len. 29]: That I was not even aware that it was to be delivered to you ; and that I had it from -- ' ` By the Lord ! '
Parsing [sent. 16555 len. 24]: cried Jonas , fiercely catching up the chair , ` I 'll knock your brains out , if you speak another word . '
Parsing [sent. 16556 len. 81]: Tom , nevertheless , persisting in his intention , and opening his lips to speak again , Jonas set upon him like a savage ; and in the quickness and ferocity of his attack would have surely done him some grievous injury , defenceless as he was , and embarrassed by having his frightened sister clinging to his arm , if Merry had not run between them , crying to Tom for the love of Heaven to leave the house .
Parsing [sent. 16557 len. 58]: The agony of this poor creature , the terror of his sister , the impossibility of making himself audible , and the equal impossibility of bearing up against Mrs Gamp , who threw herself upon him like a feather-bed , and forced him backwards down the stairs by the mere oppression of her dead weight , prevailed .
Parsing [sent. 16558 len. 18]: Tom shook the dust of that house off his feet , without having mentioned Nadgett 's name .
Parsing [sent. 16559 len. 98]: If the name could have passed his lips ; if Jonas , in the insolence of his vile nature , had never roused him to do that old act of manliness , for which -LRB- and not for his last offence -RRB- he hated him with such malignity ; if Jonas could have learned , as then he could and would have learned , through Tom 's means , what unsuspected spy there was upon him ; he would have been saved from the commission of a Guilty Deed , then drawing on towards its black accomplishment .
Parsing [sent. 16560 len. 31]: But the fatality was of his own working ; the pit was of his own digging ; the gloom that gathered round him was the shadow of his own life .
Parsing [sent. 16561 len. 21]: His wife had closed the door , and thrown herself before it , on the ground , upon her knees .
Parsing [sent. 16562 len. 28]: She held up her hands to him now , and besought him not to be harsh with her , for she had interposed in fear of bloodshed .
Parsing [sent. 16563 len. 6]: ` So , so ! '
Parsing [sent. 16564 len. 14]: said Jonas , looking down upon her , as he fetched his breath .
Parsing [sent. 16565 len. 14]: ` These are your friends , are they , when I am away ?
Parsing [sent. 16566 len. 14]: You plot and tamper with this sort of people , do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 16567 len. 5]: ` No , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 16568 len. 15]: I have no knowledge of these secrets , and no clue to their meaning .
Parsing [sent. 16569 len. 19]: I have never seen him since I left home but once -- but twice -- before to-day . '
Parsing [sent. 16570 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 16571 len. 8]: sneered Jonas , catching at this correction .
Parsing [sent. 16572 len. 9]: ` But once , but twice , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 16573 len. 5]: Which do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 16574 len. 6]: Twice and once , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 16575 len. 3]: Three times !
Parsing [sent. 16576 len. 9]: How many more , you lying jade ? '
Parsing [sent. 16577 len. 15]: As he made an angry motion with his hand , she shrunk down hastily .
Parsing [sent. 16578 len. 4]: A suggestive action !
Parsing [sent. 16579 len. 6]: Full of a cruel truth !
Parsing [sent. 16580 len. 7]: ` How many more times ? '
Parsing [sent. 16581 len. 3]: he repeated .
Parsing [sent. 16582 len. 4]: ` No more .
Parsing [sent. 16583 len. 12]: The other morning , and to-day , and once besides . '
Parsing [sent. 16584 len. 13]: He was about to retort upon her , when the clock struck .
Parsing [sent. 16585 len. 40]: He started stopped , and listened ; appearing to revert to some engagement , or to some other subject , a secret within his own breast , recalled to him by this record of the progress of the hours .
Parsing [sent. 16586 len. 6]: ` Do n't lie there !
Parsing [sent. 16587 len. 4]: Get up ! '
Parsing [sent. 16588 len. 47]: Having helped her to rise , or rather hauled her up by the arm , he went on to say : ` Listen to me , young lady ; and do n't whine when you have no occasion , or I may make some for you .
Parsing [sent. 16589 len. 27]: If I find him in my house again , or find that you have seen him in anybody else 's house , you 'll repent it .
Parsing [sent. 16590 len. 28]: If you are not deaf and dumb to everything that concerns me , unless you have my leave to hear and speak , you 'll repent it .
Parsing [sent. 16591 len. 15]: If you do n't obey exactly what I order , you 'll repent it .
Parsing [sent. 16592 len. 4]: Now , attend .
Parsing [sent. 16593 len. 6]: What 's the time ? '
Parsing [sent. 16594 len. 9]: ` It struck eight a minute ago . '
Parsing [sent. 16595 len. 38]: He looked towards her intently ; and said , with a laboured distinctness , as if he had got the words off by heart : ' I have been travelling day and night , and am tired .
Parsing [sent. 16596 len. 13]: I have lost some money , and that do n't improve me .
Parsing [sent. 16597 len. 15]: Put my supper in the little off-room below , and have the truckle-bed made .
Parsing [sent. 16598 len. 38]: I shall sleep there to-night , and maybe to-morrow night ; and if I can sleep all day to-morrow , so much the better , for I 've got trouble to sleep off , if I can .
Parsing [sent. 16599 len. 11]: Keep the house quiet , and do n't call me .
Parsing [sent. 16600 len. 2]: Mind !
Parsing [sent. 16601 len. 5]: Do n't call me .
Parsing [sent. 16602 len. 7]: Do n't let anybody call me .
Parsing [sent. 16603 len. 6]: Let me lie there . '
Parsing [sent. 16604 len. 7]: She said it should be done .
Parsing [sent. 16605 len. 4]: Was that all ?
Parsing [sent. 16606 len. 4]: ` All what ?
Parsing [sent. 16607 len. 8]: You must be prying and questioning ! '
Parsing [sent. 16608 len. 4]: he angrily retorted .
Parsing [sent. 16609 len. 11]: ` What more do you want to know ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 16610 len. 14]: I want to know nothing , Jonas , but what you tell me .
Parsing [sent. 16611 len. 12]: All hope of confidence between us has long deserted me ! '
Parsing [sent. 16612 len. 9]: ` Ecod , I should hope so ! '
Parsing [sent. 16613 len. 3]: he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 16614 len. 22]: ` But if you will tell me what you wish , I will be obedient and will try to please you .
Parsing [sent. 16615 len. 24]: I make no merit of that , for I have no friend in my father or my sister , but am quite alone .
Parsing [sent. 16616 len. 7]: I am very humble and submissive .
Parsing [sent. 16617 len. 15]: You told me you would break my spirit , and you have done so .
Parsing [sent. 16618 len. 8]: Do not break my heart too ! '
Parsing [sent. 16619 len. 17]: She ventured , as she said these words , to lay her hand upon his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 16620 len. 39]: He suffered it to rest there , in his exultation ; and the whole mean , abject , sordid , pitiful soul of the man , looked at her , for the moment , through his wicked eyes .
Parsing [sent. 16621 len. 36]: For the moment only ; for , with the same hurried return to something within himself , he bade her , in a surly tone , show her obedience by executing his commands without delay .
Parsing [sent. 16622 len. 36]: When she had withdrawn he paced up and down the room several times ; but always with his right hand clenched , as if it held something ; which it did not , being empty .
Parsing [sent. 16623 len. 49]: When he was tired of this , he threw himself into a chair , and thoughtfully turned up the sleeve of his right arm , as if he were rather musing about its strength than examining it ; but , even then , he kept the hand clenched .
Parsing [sent. 16624 len. 31]: He was brooding in this chair , with his eyes cast down upon the ground , when Mrs Gamp came in to tell him that the little room was ready .
Parsing [sent. 16625 len. 34]: Not being quite sure of her reception after interfering in the quarrel , Mrs Gamp , as a means of interesting and propitiating her patron , affected a deep solicitude in Mr Chuffey .
Parsing [sent. 16626 len. 9]: ` How is he now , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 16627 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 16628 len. 4]: ` Who ? '
Parsing [sent. 16629 len. 12]: cried Jonas , raising his head , and staring at her .
Parsing [sent. 16630 len. 6]: ` To be sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 16631 len. 10]: returned the matron with a smile and a curtsey .
Parsing [sent. 16632 len. 7]: ` What am I thinking of !
Parsing [sent. 16633 len. 14]: You was n't here , sir , when he was took so strange .
Parsing [sent. 16634 len. 91]: I never see a poor dear creetur took so strange in all my life , except a patient much about the same age , as I once nussed , which his calling was the custom -- ` us , and his name was Mrs Harris 's own father , as pleasant a singer , Mr Chuzzlewit , as ever you heerd , with a voice like a Jew 's - harp in the bass notes , that it took six men to hold at sech times , foaming frightful . '
Parsing [sent. 16635 len. 6]: ` Chuffey , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 16636 len. 20]: said Jonas carelessly , seeing that she went up to the old , clerk , and looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 16637 len. 4]: ` Ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 16638 len. 24]: ` The creetur 's head 's so hot , ' said Mrs Gamp , ` that you might heat a flat-iron at it .
Parsing [sent. 16639 len. 15]: And no wonder I am sure , considerin ' the things he said ! '
Parsing [sent. 16640 len. 4]: ` Said ! '
Parsing [sent. 16641 len. 3]: cried Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 16642 len. 7]: ` What did he say ? '
Parsing [sent. 16643 len. 41]: Mrs Gamp laid her hand upon her heart , to put some check upon its palpitations , and turning up her eyes replied in a faint voice : ` The awfulest things , Mr Chuzzlewit , as ever I heerd !
Parsing [sent. 16644 len. 35]: Which Mrs Harris 's father never spoke a word when took so , some does and some do n't , except sayin ' when he come round , `` Where is Sairey Gamp ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16645 len. 29]: But raly , sir , when Mr Chuffey comes to ask who 's lyin ' dead upstairs , and -- ' ` Who 's lying dead upstairs ! '
Parsing [sent. 16646 len. 6]: repeated Jonas , standing aghast .
Parsing [sent. 16647 len. 15]: Mrs Gamp nodded , made as if she were swallowing , and went on .
Parsing [sent. 16648 len. 122]: ` Who 's lying dead upstairs ; sech was his Bible language ; and where was Mr Chuzzlewit as had the only son ; and when he goes upstairs a-looking in the beds and wandering about the rooms , and comes down again a-whisperin ' softly to his-self about foul play and that ; it gives me sech a turn , I do n't deny it , Mr Chuzzlewit , that I never could have kep myself up but for a little drain o ' spirits , which I seldom touches , but could always wish to know where to find , if so dispoged , never knowin ' wot may happen next , the world bein ' so uncertain . '
Parsing [sent. 16649 len. 10]: ` Why , the old fool 's mad ! '
Parsing [sent. 16650 len. 6]: cried Jonas , much disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 16651 len. 21]: ` That 's my opinion , sir , ' said Mrs Gamp , ` and I will not deceive you .
Parsing [sent. 16652 len. 37]: I believe as Mr Chuffey , sir , rekwires attention -LRB- if I may make so bold -RRB- , and should not have his liberty to wex and worrit your sweet lady as he does . '
Parsing [sent. 16653 len. 10]: ` Why , who minds what he says ? '
Parsing [sent. 16654 len. 3]: retorted Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 16655 len. 13]: ` Still he is worritin ' sir , ' said Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 16656 len. 16]: ` No one do n't mind him , but he IS a ill conwenience . '
Parsing [sent. 16657 len. 20]: ` Ecod you 're right , ' said Jonas , looking doubtfully at the subject of this conversation . '
Parsing [sent. 16658 len. 11]: I have half a mind to shut him up . '
Parsing [sent. 16659 len. 23]: Mrs Gamp rubbed her hands , and smiled , and shook her head , and sniffed expressively , as scenting a job .
Parsing [sent. 16660 len. 22]: ` Could you -- could you take care of such an idiot , now , in some spare room upstairs ? '
Parsing [sent. 16661 len. 3]: asked Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 16662 len. 49]: ` Me and a friend of mine , one off , one on , could do it , Mr Chuzzlewit , ' replied the nurse ; ` our charges not bein ' high , but wishin ' they was lower , and allowance made considerin ' not strangers .
Parsing [sent. 16663 len. 52]: Me and Betsey Prig , sir , would undertake Mr Chuffey reasonable , ' said Mrs Gamp , looking at him with her head on one side , as if he had been a piece of goods , for which she was driving a bargain ; ` and give every satigefaction .
Parsing [sent. 16664 len. 36]: Betsey Prig has nussed a many lunacies , and well she knows their ways , which puttin ' 'em right close afore the fire , when fractious , is the certainest and most compoging . '
Parsing [sent. 16665 len. 30]: While Mrs Gamp discoursed to this effect , Jonas was walking up and down the room again , glancing covertly at the old clerk , as he did so .
Parsing [sent. 16666 len. 28]: He now made a stop , and said : ' I must look after him , I suppose , or I may have him doing some mischief .
Parsing [sent. 16667 len. 5]: What say you ? '
Parsing [sent. 16668 len. 7]: ` Nothin ' more likely ! '
Parsing [sent. 16669 len. 4]: Mrs Gamp replied .
Parsing [sent. 16670 len. 15]: ` As well I have experienged , I do assure you , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 16671 len. 3]: ` Well !
Parsing [sent. 16672 len. 38]: Look after him for the present , and -- let me see -- three days from this time let the other woman come here , and we 'll see if we can make a bargain of it .
Parsing [sent. 16673 len. 10]: About nine or ten o'clock at night , say .
Parsing [sent. 16674 len. 16]: Keep your eye upon him in the meanwhile , and do n't talk about it .
Parsing [sent. 16675 len. 10]: He 's as mad as a March hare ! '
Parsing [sent. 16676 len. 4]: ` Madder ! '
Parsing [sent. 16677 len. 5]: cried Mrs Gamp . '
Parsing [sent. 16678 len. 5]: A deal madder ! '
Parsing [sent. 16679 len. 24]: ` See to him , then ; take care that he does no harm ; and recollect what I have told you . '
Parsing [sent. 16680 len. 69]: Leaving Mrs Gamp in the act of repeating all she had been told , and of producing in support of her memory and trustworthiness , many commendations selected from among the most remarkable opinions of the celebrated Mrs Harris , he descended to the little room prepared for him , and pulling off his coat and his boots , put them outside the door before he locked it .
Parsing [sent. 16681 len. 43]: In locking it , he was careful so to adjust the key as to baffle any curious person who might try to peep in through the key-hole ; and when he had taken these precautions , he sat down to his supper .
Parsing [sent. 16682 len. 20]: ` Mr Chuff , ' he muttered , ` it 'll be pretty easy to be even with YOU .
Parsing [sent. 16683 len. 26]: It 's of no use doing things by halves , and as long as I stop here , I 'll take good care of you .
Parsing [sent. 16684 len. 11]: When I 'm off you may say what you please .
Parsing [sent. 16685 len. 40]: But it 's a d -- d strange thing , ' he added , pushing away his untouched plate , and striding moodily to and fro , ` that his drivellings should have taken this turn just now . '
Parsing [sent. 16686 len. 20]: After pacing the little room from end to end several times , he sat down in another chair . '
Parsing [sent. 16687 len. 23]: I say just now , but for anything I know , he may have been carrying on the same game all along .
Parsing [sent. 16688 len. 3]: Old dog !
Parsing [sent. 16689 len. 6]: He shall be gagged ! '
Parsing [sent. 16690 len. 34]: He paced the room again in the same restless and unsteady way ; and then sat down upon the bedstead , leaning his chin upon his hand , and looking at the table .
Parsing [sent. 16691 len. 48]: When he had looked at it for a long time , he remembered his supper ; and resuming the chair he had first occupied , began to eat with great rapacity ; not like a hungry man , but as if he were determined to do it .
Parsing [sent. 16692 len. 43]: He drank too , roundly ; sometimes stopping in the middle of a draught to walk , and change his seat and walk again , and dart back to the table and fall to , in a ravenous hurry , as before .
Parsing [sent. 16693 len. 6]: It was now growing dark .
Parsing [sent. 16694 len. 31]: As the gloom of evening , deepening into night , came on , another dark shade emerging from within him seemed to overspread his face , and slowly change it .
Parsing [sent. 16695 len. 31]: Slowly , slowly ; darker and darker ; more and more haggard ; creeping over him by little and little , until it was black night within him and without .
Parsing [sent. 16696 len. 23]: The room in which he had shut himself up , was on the ground floor , at the back of the house .
Parsing [sent. 16697 len. 49]: It was lighted by a dirty skylight , and had a door in the wall , opening into a narrow covered passage or blind-alley , very little frequented after five or six o'clock in the evening , and not in much use as a thoroughfare at any hour .
Parsing [sent. 16698 len. 10]: But it had an outlet in a neighbouring street .
Parsing [sent. 16699 len. 36]: The ground on which this chamber stood had , at one time , not within his recollection , been a yard ; and had been converted to its present purpose for use as an office .
Parsing [sent. 16700 len. 60]: But the occasion for it died with the man who built it ; and saving that it had sometimes served as an apology for a spare bedroom , and that the old clerk had once held it -LRB- but that was years ago -RRB- as his recognized apartment , it had been little troubled by Anthony Chuzzlewit and Son .
Parsing [sent. 16701 len. 47]: It was a blotched , stained , mouldering room , like a vault ; and there were water-pipes running through it , which at unexpected times in the night , when other things were quiet , clicked and gurgled suddenly , as if they were choking .
Parsing [sent. 16702 len. 32]: The door into the court had not been open for a long , long time ; but the key had always hung in one place , and there it hung now .
Parsing [sent. 16703 len. 39]: He was prepared for its being rusty ; for he had a little bottle of oil in his pocket and the feather of a pen , with which he lubricated the key and the lock too , carefully .
Parsing [sent. 16704 len. 20]: All this while he had been without his coat , and had nothing on his feet but his stockings .
Parsing [sent. 16705 len. 21]: He now got softly into bed in the same state , and tossed from side to side to tumble it .
Parsing [sent. 16706 len. 9]: In his restless condition that was easily done .
Parsing [sent. 16707 len. 62]: When he arose , he took from his portmanteau , which he had caused to be carried into that place when he came home , a pair of clumsy shoes , and put them on his feet ; also a pair of leather leggings , such as countrymen are used to wear , with straps to fasten them to the waistband .
Parsing [sent. 16708 len. 8]: In these he dressed himself at leisure .
Parsing [sent. 16709 len. 34]: Lastly , he took out a common frock of coarse dark jean , which he drew over his own under-clothing ; and a felt hat -- he had purposely left his own upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 16710 len. 18]: He then sat himself down by the door , with the key in his hand , waiting .
Parsing [sent. 16711 len. 15]: He had no light ; the time was dreary , long , and awful .
Parsing [sent. 16712 len. 19]: The ringers were practicing in a neighbouring church , and the clashing of the bells was almost maddening .
Parsing [sent. 16713 len. 31]: Curse the clamouring bells , they seemed to know that he was listening at the door , and to proclaim it in a crowd of voices to all the town !
Parsing [sent. 16714 len. 6]: Would they never be still ?
Parsing [sent. 16715 len. 24]: They ceased at last , and then the silence was so new and terrible that it seemed the prelude to some dreadful noise .
Parsing [sent. 16716 len. 5]: Footsteps in the court !
Parsing [sent. 16717 len. 3]: Two men .
Parsing [sent. 16718 len. 21]: He fell back from the door on tiptoe , as if they could have seen him through its wooden panels .
Parsing [sent. 16719 len. 41]: They passed on , talking -LRB- he could make out -RRB- about a skeleton which had been dug up yesterday , in some work of excavation near at hand , and was supposed to be that of a murdered man .
Parsing [sent. 16720 len. 24]: ` So murder is not always found out , you see , ' they said to one another as they turned the corner .
Parsing [sent. 16721 len. 2]: Hush !
Parsing [sent. 16722 len. 12]: He put the key into the lock , and turned it .
Parsing [sent. 16723 len. 38]: The door resisted for a while , but soon came stiffly open ; mingling with the sense of fever in his mouth , a taste of rust , and dust , and earth , and rotting wood .
Parsing [sent. 16724 len. 12]: He looked out ; passed out ; locked it after him .
Parsing [sent. 16725 len. 11]: All was clear and quiet , as he fled away .
Parsing [sent. 16726 len. 35]: CHAPTER FORTY -- SEVEN CONCLUSION OF THE ENTERPRISE OF MR JONAS AND HIS FRIEND Did no men passing through the dim streets shrink without knowing why , when he came stealing up behind them ?
Parsing [sent. 16727 len. 29]: As he glided on , had no child in its sleep an indistinct perception of a guilty shadow falling on its bed , that troubled its innocent rest ?
Parsing [sent. 16728 len. 53]: Did no dog howl , and strive to break its rattling chain , that it might tear him ; no burrowing rat , scenting the work he had in hand , essay to gnaw a passage after him , that it might hold a greedy revel at the feast of his providing ?
Parsing [sent. 16729 len. 43]: When he looked back , across his shoulder , was it to see if his quick footsteps still fell dry upon the dusty pavement , or were already moist and clogged with the red mire that stained the naked feet of Cain !
Parsing [sent. 16730 len. 29]: He shaped his course for the main western road , and soon reached it ; riding a part of the way , then alighting and walking on again .
Parsing [sent. 16731 len. 68]: He travelled for a considerable distance upon the roof of a stage-coach , which came up while he was afoot ; and when it turned out of his road , bribed the driver of a return post-chaise to take him on with him ; and then made across the country at a run , and saved a mile or two before he struck again into the road .
Parsing [sent. 16732 len. 44]: At last , as his plan was , he came up with a certain lumbering , slow , night-coach , which stopped wherever it could , and was stopping then at a public-house , while the guard and coachman ate and drank within .
Parsing [sent. 16733 len. 13]: He bargained for a seat outside this coach , and took it .
Parsing [sent. 16734 len. 25]: And he quitted it no more until it was within a few miles of its destination , but occupied the same place all night .
Parsing [sent. 16735 len. 3]: All night !
Parsing [sent. 16736 len. 13]: It is a common fancy that nature seems to sleep by night .
Parsing [sent. 16737 len. 14]: It is a false fancy , as who should know better than he ?
Parsing [sent. 16738 len. 42]: The fishes slumbered in the cold , bright , glistening streams and rivers , perhaps ; and the birds roosted on the branches of the trees ; and in their stalls and pastures beasts were quiet ; and human creatures slept .
Parsing [sent. 16739 len. 27]: But what of that , when the solemn night was watching , when it never winked , when its darkness watched no less than its light !
Parsing [sent. 16740 len. 30]: The stately trees , the moon and shining stars , the softly stirring wind , the over-shadowed lane , the broad , bright countryside , they all kept watch .
Parsing [sent. 16741 len. 33]: There was not a blade of growing grass or corn , but watched ; and the quieter it was , the more intent and fixed its watch upon him seemed to be .
Parsing [sent. 16742 len. 5]: And yet he slept .
Parsing [sent. 16743 len. 21]: Riding on among those sentinels of God , he slept , and did not change the purpose of his journey .
Parsing [sent. 16744 len. 18]: If he forgot it in his troubled dreams , it came up steadily , and woke him .
Parsing [sent. 16745 len. 15]: But it never woke him to remorse , or to abandonment of his design .
Parsing [sent. 16746 len. 41]: He dreamed at one time that he was lying calmly in his bed , thinking of a moonlight night and the noise of wheels , when the old clerk put his head in at the door , and beckoned him .
Parsing [sent. 16747 len. 66]: At this signal he arose immediately -- being already dressed in the clothes he actually wore at that time -- and accompanied him into a strange city , where the names of the streets were written on the walls in characters quite new to him ; which gave him no surprise or uneasiness , for he remembered in his dream to have been there before .
Parsing [sent. 16748 len. 92]: Although these streets were very precipitous , insomuch that to get from one to another it was necessary to descend great heights by ladders that were too short , and ropes that moved deep bells , and swung and swayed as they were clung to , the danger gave him little emotion beyond the first thrill of terror ; his anxieties being concentrated on his dress which was quite unfitted for some festival that was about to be holden there , and in which he had come to take a part .
Parsing [sent. 16749 len. 58]: Already , great crowds began to fill the streets , and in one direction myriads of people came rushing down an interminable perspective , strewing flowers and making way for others on white horses , when a terrible figure started from the throng , and cried out that it was the Last Day for all the world .
Parsing [sent. 16750 len. 125]: The cry being spread , there was a wild hurrying on to Judgment ; and the press became so great that he and his companion -LRB- who was constantly changing , and was never the same man two minutes together , though he never saw one man come or another go -RRB- , stood aside in a porch , fearfully surveying the multitude ; in which there were many faces that he knew , and many that he did not know , but dreamed he did ; when all at once a struggling head rose up among the rest -- livid and deadly , but the same as he had known it -- and denounced him as having appointed that direful day to happen .
Parsing [sent. 16751 len. 4]: They closed together .
Parsing [sent. 16752 len. 41]: As he strove to free the hand in which he held a club , and strike the blow he had so often thought of , he started to the knowledge of his waking purpose and the rising of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 16753 len. 7]: The sun was welcome to him .
Parsing [sent. 16754 len. 18]: There were life and motion , and a world astir , to divide the attention of Day .
Parsing [sent. 16755 len. 35]: It was the eye of Night -- of wakeful , watchful , silent , and attentive Night , with so much leisure for the observation of his wicked thoughts -- that he dreaded most .
Parsing [sent. 16756 len. 8]: There is no glare in the night .
Parsing [sent. 16757 len. 15]: Even Glory shows to small advantage in the night , upon a crowded battle-field .
Parsing [sent. 16758 len. 10]: How then shows Glory 's blood-relation , bastard Murder !
Parsing [sent. 16759 len. 2]: Aye !
Parsing [sent. 16760 len. 13]: He made no compromise , and held no secret with himself now .
Parsing [sent. 16761 len. 2]: Murder .
Parsing [sent. 16762 len. 7]: He had come to do it .
Parsing [sent. 16763 len. 18]: ` Let me get down here ' he said ` Short of the town , eh ! '
Parsing [sent. 16764 len. 5]: observed the coachman . '
Parsing [sent. 16765 len. 12]: I may get down where I please , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 16766 len. 16]: ` You got up to please yourself , and may get down to please yourself .
Parsing [sent. 16767 len. 24]: It wo n't break our hearts to lose you , and it would n't have broken 'em if we 'd never found you .
Parsing [sent. 16768 len. 5]: Be a little quicker .
Parsing [sent. 16769 len. 5]: That 's all . '
Parsing [sent. 16770 len. 16]: The guard had alighted , and was waiting in the road to take his money .
Parsing [sent. 16771 len. 30]: In the jealousy and distrust of what he contemplated , he thought this man looked at him with more than common curiosity ` What are you staring at ? '
Parsing [sent. 16772 len. 3]: said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 16773 len. 12]: ` Not at a handsome man , ' returned the guard .
Parsing [sent. 16774 len. 17]: ` If you want your fortune told , I 'll tell you a bit of it .
Parsing [sent. 16775 len. 6]: You wo n't be drowned .
Parsing [sent. 16776 len. 8]: That 's a consolation for you . '
Parsing [sent. 16777 len. 35]: Before he could retort or turn away , the coachman put an end to the dialogue by giving him a cut with his whip , and biddig him get out for a surly dog .
Parsing [sent. 16778 len. 33]: The guard jumped up to his seat at the same moment , and they drove off , laughing ; leaving him to stand in the road and shake his fist at them .
Parsing [sent. 16779 len. 36]: He was not displeased though , on second thoughts , to have been taken for an ill-conditioned common country fellow ; but rather congratulated himself upon it as a proof that he was well disguised .
Parsing [sent. 16780 len. 64]: Wandering into a copse by the road-side -- but not in that place ; two or three miles off -- he tore out from a fence a thick , hard , knotted stake ; and , sitting down beneath a hayrick , spent some time in shaping it , in peeling off the bark , and fashioning its jagged head with his knife .
Parsing [sent. 16781 len. 5]: The day passed on .
Parsing [sent. 16782 len. 6]: Noon , afternoon , evening .
Parsing [sent. 16783 len. 2]: Sunset .
Parsing [sent. 16784 len. 26]: At that serene and peaceful time two men , riding in a gig , came out of the city by a road not much frequented .
Parsing [sent. 16785 len. 15]: It was the day on which Mr Pecksniff had agreed to dine with Montague .
Parsing [sent. 16786 len. 12]: He had kept his appointment , and was now going home .
Parsing [sent. 16787 len. 32]: His host was riding with him for a short distance ; meaning to return by a pleasant track , which Mr Pecksniff had engaged to show him , through some fields .
Parsing [sent. 16788 len. 5]: Jonas knew their plans .
Parsing [sent. 16789 len. 18]: He had hung about the inn-yard while they were at dinner and had heard their orders given .
Parsing [sent. 16790 len. 31]: They were loud and merry in their conversation , and might have been heard at some distance ; far above the sound of their carriage wheels or horses ' hoofs .
Parsing [sent. 16791 len. 17]: They came on noisily , to where a stile and footpath indicated their point of separation .
Parsing [sent. 16792 len. 4]: Here they stopped .
Parsing [sent. 16793 len. 6]: ` It 's too soon .
Parsing [sent. 16794 len. 9]: Much too soon , ' said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 16795 len. 11]: ` But this is the place , my dear sir .
Parsing [sent. 16796 len. 16]: Keep the path , and go straight through the little wood you 'll come to .
Parsing [sent. 16797 len. 13]: The path is narrower there , but you ca n't miss it .
Parsing [sent. 16798 len. 7]: When shall I see you again ?
Parsing [sent. 16799 len. 6]: Soon I hope ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 16800 len. 8]: I hope so , ' replied Montague .
Parsing [sent. 16801 len. 5]: ` Good night ! '
Parsing [sent. 16802 len. 4]: ` Good night .
Parsing [sent. 16803 len. 6]: And a pleasant ride ! '
Parsing [sent. 16804 len. 31]: So long as Mr Pecksniff was in sight , and turned his head at intervals to salute him , Montague stood in the road smiling , and waving his hand .
Parsing [sent. 16805 len. 39]: But when his new partner had disappeared , and this show was no longer necessary , he sat down on the stile with looks so altered , that he might have grown ten years older in the meantime .
Parsing [sent. 16806 len. 10]: He was flushed with wine , but not gay .
Parsing [sent. 16807 len. 11]: His scheme had succeeded , but he showed no triumph .
Parsing [sent. 16808 len. 62]: The effort of sustaining his difficult part before his late companion had fatigued him , perhaps , or it may be that the evening whispered to his conscience , or it may be -LRB- as it HAS been -RRB- that a shadowy veil was dropping round him , closing out all thoughts but the presentiment and vague foreknowledge of impending doom .
Parsing [sent. 16809 len. 80]: If there be fluids , as we know there are , which , conscious of a coming wind , or rain , or frost , will shrink and strive to hide themselves in their glass arteries ; may not that subtle liquor of the blood perceive , by properties within itself , that hands are raised to waste and spill it ; and in the veins of men run cold and dull as his did , in that hour !
Parsing [sent. 16810 len. 33]: So cold , although the air was warm ; so dull , although the sky was bright ; that he rose up shivering from his seat , and hastily resumed his walk .
Parsing [sent. 16811 len. 27]: He checked himself as hastily ; undecided whether to pursue the footpath , which was lonely and retired , or to go back by the road .
Parsing [sent. 16812 len. 5]: He took the footpath .
Parsing [sent. 16813 len. 11]: The glory of the departing sun was on his face .
Parsing [sent. 16814 len. 10]: The music of the birds was in his ears .
Parsing [sent. 16815 len. 7]: Sweet wild flowers bloomed about him .
Parsing [sent. 16816 len. 32]: Thatched roofs of poor men 's homes were in the distance ; and an old grey spire , surmounted by a Cross , rose up between him and the coming night .
Parsing [sent. 16817 len. 44]: He had never read the lesson which these things conveyed ; he had ever mocked and turned away from it ; but , before going down into a hollow place , he looked round , once , upon the evening prospect , sorrowfully .
Parsing [sent. 16818 len. 13]: Then he went down , down , down , into the dell .
Parsing [sent. 16819 len. 30]: It brought him to the wood ; a close , thick , shadowy wood , through which the path went winding on , dwindling away into a slender sheep-track .
Parsing [sent. 16820 len. 15]: He paused before entering ; for the stillness of this spot almost daunted him .
Parsing [sent. 16821 len. 49]: The last rays of the sun were shining in , aslant , making a path of golden light along the stems and branches in its range , which , even as he looked , began to die away , yielding gently to the twilight that came creeping on .
Parsing [sent. 16822 len. 35]: It was so very quiet that the soft and stealthy moss about the trunks of some old trees , seemed to have grown out of the silence , and to be its proper offspring .
Parsing [sent. 16823 len. 51]: Those other trees which were subdued by blasts of wind in winter time , had not quite tumbled down , but being caught by others , lay all bare and scathed across their leafy arms , as if unwilling to disturb the general repose by the crash of their fall .
Parsing [sent. 16824 len. 80]: Vistas of silence opened everywhere , into the heart and innermost recesses of the wood ; beginning with the likeness of an aisle , a cloister , or a ruin open to the sky ; then tangling off into a deep green rustling mystery , through which gnarled trunks , and twisted boughs , and ivy-covered stems , and trembling leaves , and bark-stripped bodies of old trees stretched out at length , were faintly seen in beautiful confusion .
Parsing [sent. 16825 len. 17]: As the sunlight died away , and evening fell upon the wood , he entered it .
Parsing [sent. 16826 len. 21]: Moving , here and there a bramble or a drooping bough which stretched across his path , he slowly disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 16827 len. 33]: At intervals a narrow opening showed him passing on , or the sharp cracking of some tender branch denoted where he went ; then , he was seen or heard no more .
Parsing [sent. 16828 len. 16]: Never more beheld by mortal eye or heard by mortal ear ; one man excepted .
Parsing [sent. 16829 len. 26]: That man , parting the leaves and branches on the other side , near where the path emerged again , came leaping out soon afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 16830 len. 21]: What had he left within the wood , that he sprang out of it as if it were a hell !
Parsing [sent. 16831 len. 7]: The body of a murdered man .
Parsing [sent. 16832 len. 27]: In one thick solitary spot , it lay among the last year 's leaves of oak and beech , just as it had fallen headlong down .
Parsing [sent. 16833 len. 71]: Sopping and soaking in among the leaves that formed its pillow ; oozing down into the boggy ground , as if to cover itself from human sight ; forcing its way between and through the curling leaves , as if those senseless things rejected and forswore it and were coiled up in abhorrence ; went a dark , dark stain that dyed the whole summer night from earth to heaven .
Parsing [sent. 16834 len. 41]: The doer of this deed came leaping from the wood so fiercely , that he cast into the air a shower of fragments of young boughs , torn away in his passage , and fell with violence upon the grass .
Parsing [sent. 16835 len. 25]: But he quickly gained his feet again , and keeping underneath a hedge with his body bent , went running on towards the road .
Parsing [sent. 16836 len. 18]: The road once reached , he fell into a rapid walk , and set on toward London .
Parsing [sent. 16837 len. 11]: And he was not sorry for what he had done .
Parsing [sent. 16838 len. 17]: He was frightened when he thought of it -- when did he not think of it !
Parsing [sent. 16839 len. 7]: -- but he was not sorry .
Parsing [sent. 16840 len. 48]: He had had a terror and dread of the wood when he was in it ; but being out of it , and having committed the crime , his fears were now diverted , strangely , to the dark room he had left shut up at home .
Parsing [sent. 16841 len. 17]: He had a greater horror , infinitely greater , of that room than of the wood .
Parsing [sent. 16842 len. 23]: Now that he was on his return to it , it seemed beyond comparison more dismal and more dreadful than the wood .
Parsing [sent. 16843 len. 29]: His hideous secret was shut up in the room , and all its terrors were there ; to his thinking it was not in the wood at all .
Parsing [sent. 16844 len. 55]: He walked on for ten miles ; and then stopped at an ale-house for a coach , which he knew would pass through , on its way to London , before long ; and which he also knew was not the coach he had travelled down by , for it came from another place .
Parsing [sent. 16845 len. 21]: He sat down outside the door here , on a bench , beside a man who was smoking his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 16846 len. 25]: Having called for some beer , and drunk , he offered it to this companion , who thanked him , and took a draught .
Parsing [sent. 16847 len. 29]: He could not help thinking that , if the man had known all , he might scarcely have relished drinking out of the same cup with him . '
Parsing [sent. 16848 len. 7]: A fine night , master ! '
Parsing [sent. 16849 len. 4]: said this person .
Parsing [sent. 16850 len. 8]: ` And a rare sunset . ' '
Parsing [sent. 16851 len. 12]: I did n't see it , ' was his hasty answer .
Parsing [sent. 16852 len. 7]: ` Did n't see it ? '
Parsing [sent. 16853 len. 4]: returned the man .
Parsing [sent. 16854 len. 15]: ` How the devil could I see it , if I was asleep ? '
Parsing [sent. 16855 len. 3]: ` Asleep !
Parsing [sent. 16856 len. 5]: Aye , aye . '
Parsing [sent. 16857 len. 20]: The man appeared surprised by his unexpected irritability , and saying no more , smoked his pipe in silence .
Parsing [sent. 16858 len. 14]: They had not sat very long , when there was a knocking within .
Parsing [sent. 16859 len. 6]: ` What 's that ? '
Parsing [sent. 16860 len. 3]: cried Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 16861 len. 14]: ` Ca n't say , I 'm sure , ' replied the man .
Parsing [sent. 16862 len. 18]: He made no further inquiry , for the last question had escaped him in spite of himself .
Parsing [sent. 16863 len. 93]: But he was thinking , at the moment , of the closed-up room ; of the possibility of their knocking at the door on some special occasion ; of their being alarmed at receiving no answer ; of their bursting it open ; of their finding the room empty ; of their fastening the door into the court , and rendering it impossible for him to get into the house without showing himself in the garb he wore , which would lead to rumour , rumour to detection , detection to death .
Parsing [sent. 16864 len. 19]: At that instant , as if by some design and order of circumstances , the knocking had come .
Parsing [sent. 16865 len. 17]: It still continued ; like a warning echo of the dread reality he had conjured up .
Parsing [sent. 16866 len. 19]: As he could not sit and hear it , he paid for his beer and walked on again .
Parsing [sent. 16867 len. 56]: And having slunk about , in places unknown to him all day ; and being out at night , in a lonely road , in an unusual dress and in that wandering and unsettled frame of mind ; he stopped more than once to look about him , hoping he might be in a dream .
Parsing [sent. 16868 len. 6]: Still he was not sorry .
Parsing [sent. 16869 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 16870 len. 24]: He had hated the man too much , and had been bent , too desperately and too long , on setting himself free .
Parsing [sent. 16871 len. 16]: If the thing could have come over again , he would have done it again .
Parsing [sent. 16872 len. 11]: His malignant and revengeful passions were not so easily laid .
Parsing [sent. 16873 len. 20]: There was no more penitence or remorse within him now than there had been while the deed was brewing .
Parsing [sent. 16874 len. 25]: Dread and fear were upon him , to an extent he had never counted on , and could not manage in the least degree .
Parsing [sent. 16875 len. 12]: He was so horribly afraid of that infernal room at home .
Parsing [sent. 16876 len. 121]: This made him , in a gloomy murderous , mad way , not only fearful FOR himself , but OF himself ; for being , as it were , a part of the room : a something supposed to be there , yet missing from it : he invested himself with its mysterious terrors ; and when he pictured in his mind the ugly chamber , false and quiet , false and quiet , through the dark hours of two nights ; and the tumbled bed , and he not in it , though believed to be ; he became in a manner his own ghost and phantom , and was at once the haunting spirit and the haunted man .
Parsing [sent. 16877 len. 24]: When the coach came up , which it soon did , he got a place outside and was carried briskly onward towards home .
Parsing [sent. 16878 len. 68]: Now , in taking his seat among the people behind , who were chiefly country people , he conceived a fear that they knew of the murder , and would tell him that the body had been found ; which , considering the time and place of the commission of the crime , were events almost impossible to have happened yet , as he very well knew .
Parsing [sent. 16879 len. 35]: But although he did know it , and had therefore no reason to regard their ignorance as anything but the natural sequence to the facts , still this very ignorance of theirs encouraged him .
Parsing [sent. 16880 len. 25]: So far encouraged him , that he began to believe the body never would be found , and began to speculate on that probability .
Parsing [sent. 16881 len. 69]: Setting off from this point , and measuring time by the rapid hurry of his guilty thoughts , and what had gone before the bloodshed , and the troops of incoherent and disordered images of which he was the constant prey ; he came by daylight to regard the murder as an old murder , and to think himself comparatively safe because it had not been discovered yet .
Parsing [sent. 16882 len. 2]: Yet !
Parsing [sent. 16883 len. 45]: When the sun which looked into the wood , and gilded with its rising light a dead man 's lace , had seen that man alive , and sought to win him to a thought of Heaven , on its going down last night !
Parsing [sent. 16884 len. 7]: But here were London streets again .
Parsing [sent. 16885 len. 2]: Hush !
Parsing [sent. 16886 len. 6]: It was but five o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 16887 len. 33]: He had time enough to reach his own house unobserved , and before there were many people in the streets , if nothing had happened so far , tending to his discovery .
Parsing [sent. 16888 len. 41]: He slipped down from the coach without troubling the driver to stop his horses ; and hurrying across the road , and in and out of every by-way that lay near his course , at length approached his own dwelling .
Parsing [sent. 16889 len. 38]: He used additional caution in his immediate neighbourhood ; halting first to look all down the street before him ; then gliding swiftly through that one , and stopping to survey the next , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 16890 len. 13]: The passage-way was empty when his murderer 's face looked into it .
Parsing [sent. 16891 len. 21]: He stole on , to the door on tiptoe , as if he dreaded to disturb his own imaginary rest .
Parsing [sent. 16892 len. 3]: He listened .
Parsing [sent. 16893 len. 4]: Not a sound .
Parsing [sent. 16894 len. 27]: As he turned the key with a trembling hand , and pushed the door softly open with his knee , a monstrous fear beset his mind .
Parsing [sent. 16895 len. 10]: What if the murdered man were there before him !
Parsing [sent. 16896 len. 8]: He cast a fearful glance all round .
Parsing [sent. 16897 len. 6]: But there was nothing there .
Parsing [sent. 16898 len. 34]: He went in , locked the door , drew the key through and through the dust and damp in the fire-place to sully it again , and hung it up as of old .
Parsing [sent. 16899 len. 32]: He took off his disguise , tied it up in a bundle ready for carrying away and sinking in the river before night , and locked it up in a cupboard .
Parsing [sent. 16900 len. 11]: These precautions taken , he undressed and went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 16901 len. 126]: The raging thirst , the fire that burnt within him as he lay beneath the clothes , the augmented horror of the room when they shut it out from his view ; the agony of listening , in which he paid enforced regard to every sound , and thought the most unlikely one the prelude to that knocking which should bring the news ; the starts with which he left his couch , and looking in the glass , imagined that his deed was broadly written in his face , and lying down and burying himself once more beneath the blankets , heard his own heart beating Murder , Murder , Murder , in the bed ; what words can paint tremendous truths like these !
Parsing [sent. 16902 len. 4]: The morning advanced .
Parsing [sent. 16903 len. 7]: There were footsteps in the house .
Parsing [sent. 16904 len. 23]: He heard the blinds drawn up , and shutters opened ; and now and then a stealthy tread outside his own door .
Parsing [sent. 16905 len. 24]: He tried to call out , more than once , but his mouth was dry as if it had been filled with sand .
Parsing [sent. 16906 len. 18]: At last he sat up in his bed , and cried : ` Who 's there ? '
Parsing [sent. 16907 len. 5]: It was his wife .
Parsing [sent. 16908 len. 8]: He asked her what it was o'clock ?
Parsing [sent. 16909 len. 2]: Nine .
Parsing [sent. 16910 len. 13]: ` Did -- did no one knock at my door yesterday ? '
Parsing [sent. 16911 len. 3]: he faltered .
Parsing [sent. 16912 len. 24]: ` Something disturbed me ; but unless you had knocked the door down , you would have got no notice from me . '
Parsing [sent. 16913 len. 8]: ` No one , ' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 16914 len. 4]: That was well .
Parsing [sent. 16915 len. 11]: He had waited , almost breathless , for her answer .
Parsing [sent. 16916 len. 12]: It was a relief to him , if anything could be .
Parsing [sent. 16917 len. 29]: ` Mr Nadgett wanted to see you , ' she said , ` but I told him you were tired , and had requested not to be disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 16918 len. 12]: He said it was of little consequence , and went away .
Parsing [sent. 16919 len. 34]: As I was opening my window to let in the cool air , I saw him passing through the street this morning , very early ; but he has n't been again . '
Parsing [sent. 16920 len. 7]: Passing through the street that morning ?
Parsing [sent. 16921 len. 3]: Very early !
Parsing [sent. 16922 len. 44]: Jonas trembled at the thought of having had a narrow chance of seeing him himself ; even him , who had no object but to avoid people , and sneak on unobserved , and keep his own secrets ; and who saw nothing .
Parsing [sent. 16923 len. 43]: He called to her to get his breakfast ready , and prepared to go upstairs ; attiring himself in the clothes he had taken off when he came into that room , which had been , ever since , outside the door .
Parsing [sent. 16924 len. 69]: In his secret dread of meeting the household for the first time , after what he had done , he lingered at the door on slight pretexts that they might see him without looking in his face ; and left it ajar while he dressed ; and called out to have the windows opened , and the pavement watered , that they might become accustomed to his voice .
Parsing [sent. 16925 len. 56]: Even when he had put off the time , by one means or other , so that he had seen or spoken to them all , he could not muster courage for a long while to go in among them , but stood at his own door listening to the murmur of their distant conversation .
Parsing [sent. 16926 len. 13]: He could not stop there for ever , and so joined them .
Parsing [sent. 16927 len. 25]: His last glance at the glass had seen a tell-tale face , but that might have been because of his anxious looking in it .
Parsing [sent. 16928 len. 20]: He dared not look at them to see if they observed him , but he thought them very silent .
Parsing [sent. 16929 len. 20]: And whatsoever guard he kept upon himself , he could not help listening , and showing that he listened .
Parsing [sent. 16930 len. 54]: Whether he attended to their talk , or tried to think of other things , or talked himself , or held his peace , or resolutely counted the dull tickings of a hoarse clock at his back , he always lapsed , as if a spell were on him , into eager listening .
Parsing [sent. 16931 len. 7]: For he knew it must come .
Parsing [sent. 16932 len. 18]: And his present punishment , and torture and distraction , were , to listen for its coming .
Parsing [sent. 16933 len. 2]: Hush !
Parsing [sent. 16934 len. 26]: CHAPTER FORTY -- EIGHT BEARS TIDINGS OF MARTIN AND OF MARK , AS WELL AS OF A THIRD PERSON NOT QUITE UNKNOWN TO THE READER .
Parsing [sent. 16935 len. 259]: EXHIBITS FILIAL PIETY IN AN UGLY ASPECT ; AND CASTS A DOUBTFUL RAY OF LIGHT UPON A VERY DARK PLACE Tom Pinch and Ruth were sitting at their early breakfast , with the window open , and a row of the freshest little plants ranged before it on the inside by Ruth 's own hands ; and Ruth had fastened a sprig of geranium in Tom 's button-hole , to make him very smart and summer-like for the day -LRB- it was obliged to be fastened in , or that dear old Tom was certain to lose it -RRB- ; and people were crying flowers up and down the street ; and a blundering bee , who had got himself in between the two sashes of the window , was bruising his head against the glass , endeavouring to force himself out into the fine morning , and considering himself enchanted because he could n't do it ; and the morning was as fine a morning as ever was seen ; and the fragrant air was kissing Ruth and rustling about Tom , as if it said , ` how are you , my dears ; I came all this way on purpose to salute you ; ' and it was one of those glad times when we form , or ought to form , the wish that every one on earth were able to be happy , and catching glimpses of the summer of the heart , to feel the beauty of the summer of the year .
Parsing [sent. 16936 len. 17]: It was even a pleasanter breakfast than usual ; and it was always a pleasant one .
Parsing [sent. 16937 len. 50]: For little Ruth had now two pupils to attend , each three times a week ; and each two hours at a time ; and besides this , she had painted some screens and card-racks , and , unknown to Tom -LRB- was there ever anything so delightful ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 16938 len. 37]: , had walked into a certain shop which dealt in such articles , after often peeping through the window ; and had taken courage to ask the Mistress of that shop whether she would buy them .
Parsing [sent. 16939 len. 46]: And the mistress had not only bought them , but had ordered more , and that very morning Ruth had made confession of these facts to Tom , and had handed him the money in a little purse she had worked expressly for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 16940 len. 65]: They had been in a flutter about this , and perhaps had shed a happy tear or two for anything the history knows to the contrary ; but it was all over now ; and a brighter face than Tom 's , or a brighter face than Ruth 's , the bright sun had not looked on since he went to bed last night .
Parsing [sent. 16941 len. 48]: ` My dear girl , ' said Tom , coming so abruptly on the subject , that he interrupted himself in the act of cutting a slice of bread , and left the knife sticking in the loaf , ` what a queer fellow our landlord is !
Parsing [sent. 16942 len. 18]: I do n't believe he has been home once since he got me into that unsatisfactory scrape .
Parsing [sent. 16943 len. 11]: I begin to think he will never come home again .
Parsing [sent. 16944 len. 14]: What a mysterious life that man does lead , to be sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 16945 len. 4]: ` Very strange .
Parsing [sent. 16946 len. 7]: Is it not , Tom ? '
Parsing [sent. 16947 len. 15]: ` Really , ' said Tom , ' I hope it is only strange .
Parsing [sent. 16948 len. 10]: I hope there may be nothing wrong in it .
Parsing [sent. 16949 len. 9]: Sometimes I begin to be doubtful of that .
Parsing [sent. 16950 len. 32]: I must have an explanation with him , ' said Tom , shaking his head as if this were a most tremendous threat , ` when I can catch him ! '
Parsing [sent. 16951 len. 23]: A short double knock at the door put Tom 's menacing looks to flight , and awakened an expression of surprise instead .
Parsing [sent. 16952 len. 4]: ` Heyday ! '
Parsing [sent. 16953 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 16954 len. 7]: ` An early hour for visitors !
Parsing [sent. 16955 len. 9]: It must be John , I suppose . '
Parsing [sent. 16956 len. 21]: ` I -- I -- do n't think it was his knock , Tom , ' observed his little sister .
Parsing [sent. 16957 len. 4]: ` No ? '
Parsing [sent. 16958 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 16959 len. 28]: ` It surely ca n't be my employer suddenly arrived in town ; directed here by Mr Fips ; and come for the key of the office .
Parsing [sent. 16960 len. 10]: It 's somebody inquiring for me , I declare !
Parsing [sent. 16961 len. 8]: Come in , if you please ! '
Parsing [sent. 16962 len. 26]: But when the person came in , Tom Pinch , instead of saying , ` Did you wish to speak with me , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 16963 len. 20]: or , ` My name is Pinch , sir ; what is your business , may I ask ? '
Parsing [sent. 16964 len. 18]: or addressing him in any such distant terms ; cried out , ` Good gracious Heaven ! '
Parsing [sent. 16965 len. 16]: and seized him by both hands , with the liveliest manifestations of astonishment and pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 16966 len. 28]: The visitor was not less moved than Tom himself , and they shook hands a great many times , without another word being spoken on either side .
Parsing [sent. 16967 len. 9]: Tom was the first to find his voice .
Parsing [sent. 16968 len. 7]: ` Mark Tapley , too ! '
Parsing [sent. 16969 len. 15]: said Tom , running towards the door , and shaking hands with somebody else .
Parsing [sent. 16970 len. 8]: ` My dear Mark , come in .
Parsing [sent. 16971 len. 6]: How are you , Mark ?
Parsing [sent. 16972 len. 16]: He do n't look a day older than he used to do at the Dragon .
Parsing [sent. 16973 len. 7]: How ARE you , Mark ? '
Parsing [sent. 16974 len. 21]: ` Uncommonly jolly , sir , thank ` ee , ' returned Mr Tapley , all smiles and bows . '
Parsing [sent. 16975 len. 10]: I hope I see you well , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 16976 len. 6]: ` Good gracious me ! '
Parsing [sent. 16977 len. 10]: cried Tom , patting him tenderly on the back .
Parsing [sent. 16978 len. 12]: ` How delightful it is to hear his old voice again !
Parsing [sent. 16979 len. 7]: My dear Martin , sit down .
Parsing [sent. 16980 len. 5]: My sister , Martin .
Parsing [sent. 16981 len. 6]: Mr Chuzzlewit , my love .
Parsing [sent. 16982 len. 9]: Mark Tapley from the Dragon , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 16983 len. 10]: Good gracious me , what a surprise this is !
Parsing [sent. 16984 len. 3]: Sit down .
Parsing [sent. 16985 len. 6]: Lord , bless me ! '
Parsing [sent. 16986 len. 46]: Tom was in such a state of excitement that he could n't keep himself still for a moment , but was constantly running between Mark and Martin , shaking hands with them alternately , and presenting them over and over again to his sister . '
Parsing [sent. 16987 len. 21]: I remember the day we parted , Martin , as well as if it were yesterday , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 16988 len. 7]: ` What a day it was !
Parsing [sent. 16989 len. 8]: and what a passion you were in !
Parsing [sent. 16990 len. 38]: And do n't you remember my overtaking you in the road that morning , Mark , when I was going to Salisbury in the gig to fetch him , and you were looking out for a situation ?
Parsing [sent. 16991 len. 20]: And do n't you recollect the dinner we had at Salisbury , Martin , with John Westlock , eh !
Parsing [sent. 16992 len. 4]: Good gracious me !
Parsing [sent. 16993 len. 8]: Ruth , my dear , Mr Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 16994 len. 10]: Mark Tapley , my love , from the Dragon .
Parsing [sent. 16995 len. 9]: More cups and saucers , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 16996 len. 14]: Bless my soul , how glad I am to see you both ! '
Parsing [sent. 16997 len. 103]: And then Tom -LRB- as John Westlock had done on his arrival -RRB- ran off to the loaf to cut some bread and butter for them ; and before he had spread a single slice , remembered something else , and came running back again to tell it ; and then he shook hands with them again ; and then he introduced his sister again ; and then he did everything he had done already all over again ; and nothing Tom could do , and nothing Tom could say , was half sufficient to express his joy at their safe return .
Parsing [sent. 16998 len. 10]: Mr Tapley was the first to resume his composure .
Parsing [sent. 16999 len. 67]: In a very short space of time he was discovered to have somehow installed himself in office as waiter , or attendant upon the party ; a fact which was first suggested to them by his temporary absence in the kitchen , and speedy return with a kettle of boiling water , from which he replenished the tea-pot with a self-possession that was quite his own .
Parsing [sent. 17000 len. 15]: ` Sit down , and take your breakfast , Mark , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 17001 len. 13]: ` Make him sit down and take his breakfast , Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 17002 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 17003 len. 15]: I gave him up , long ago , as incorrigible , ' Martin replied .
Parsing [sent. 17004 len. 9]: ` He takes his own way , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 17005 len. 15]: You would excuse him , Miss Pinch , if you knew his value . '
Parsing [sent. 17006 len. 9]: ` She knows it , bless you ! '
Parsing [sent. 17007 len. 4]: said Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 17008 len. 9]: I have told her all about Mark Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 17009 len. 7]: Have I not , Ruth ? '
Parsing [sent. 17010 len. 6]: ` Yes , Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 17011 len. 13]: ` Not all , ' returned Martin , in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 17012 len. 29]: ` The best of Mark Tapley is only known to one man , Tom ; and but for Mark he would hardly be alive to tell it ! '
Parsing [sent. 17013 len. 4]: ` Mark ! '
Parsing [sent. 17014 len. 22]: said Tom Pinch energetically ; ` if you do n't sit down this minute , I 'll swear at you ! '
Parsing [sent. 17015 len. 22]: ` Well , sir , ' returned Mr Tapley , ` sooner than you should do that , I 'll com-ply .
Parsing [sent. 17016 len. 64]: It 's a considerable invasion of a man 's jollity to be made so partickler welcome , but a Werb is a word as signifies to be , to do , or to suffer -LRB- which is all the grammar , and enough too , as ever I wos taught -RRB- ; and if there 's a Werb alive , I 'm it .
Parsing [sent. 17017 len. 17]: For I 'm always a-bein ' , sometimes a-doin ' , and continually a-sufferin ' . '
Parsing [sent. 17018 len. 6]: ` Not jolly yet ? '
Parsing [sent. 17019 len. 7]: asked Tom , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 17020 len. 26]: ` Why , I was rather so , over the water , sir , ' returned Mr Tapley ; ` and not entirely without credit .
Parsing [sent. 17021 len. 18]: But Human Natur ' is in a conspiracy again ' me ; I ca n't get on .
Parsing [sent. 17022 len. 38]: I shall have to leave it in my will , sir , to be wrote upon my tomb : `` He was a man as might have come out strong if he could have got a chance .
Parsing [sent. 17023 len. 8]: But it was denied him . '' '
Parsing [sent. 17024 len. 34]: Mr Tapley took this occasion of looking about him with a grin , and subsequently attacking the breakfast , with an appetite not at all expressive of blighted hopes , or insurmountable despondency .
Parsing [sent. 17025 len. 50]: In the meanwhile , Martin drew his chair a little nearer to Tom and his sister , and related to them what had passed at Mr Pecksniff 's house ; adding in few words a general summary of the distresses and disappointments he had undergone since he left England .
Parsing [sent. 17026 len. 35]: ` For your faithful stewardship in the trust I left with you , Tom , ' he said , ` and for all your goodness and disinterestedness , I can never thank you enough .
Parsing [sent. 17027 len. 14]: When I add Mary 's thanks to mine -- ' Ah , Tom !
Parsing [sent. 17028 len. 37]: The blood retreated from his cheeks , and came rushing back , so violently , that it was pain to feel it ; ease though , ease , compared with the aching of his wounded heart .
Parsing [sent. 17029 len. 54]: ` When I add Mary 's thanks to mine , ' said Martin , ' I have made the only poor acknowledgment it is in our power to offer ; but if you knew how much we feel , Tom , you would set some store by it , I am sure . '
Parsing [sent. 17030 len. 27]: And if they had known how much Tom felt -- but that no human creature ever knew -- they would have set some store by him .
Parsing [sent. 17031 len. 4]: Indeed they would .
Parsing [sent. 17032 len. 7]: Tom changed the topic of discourse .
Parsing [sent. 17033 len. 24]: He was sorry he could not pursue it , as it gave Martin pleasure ; but he was unable , at that moment .
Parsing [sent. 17034 len. 23]: No drop of envy or bitterness was in his soul ; but he could not master the firm utterance of her name .
Parsing [sent. 17035 len. 8]: He inquired what Martin 's projects were .
Parsing [sent. 17036 len. 21]: ` No longer to make your fortune , Tom , ' said Martin , ` but to try to live .
Parsing [sent. 17037 len. 12]: I tried that once in London , Tom ; and failed .
Parsing [sent. 17038 len. 22]: If you will give me the benefit of your advice and friendly counsel , I may succeed better under your guidance .
Parsing [sent. 17039 len. 17]: I will do anything Tom , anything , to gain a livelihood by my own exertions .
Parsing [sent. 17040 len. 11]: My hopes do not soar above that , now . '
Parsing [sent. 17041 len. 5]: High-hearted , noble Tom !
Parsing [sent. 17042 len. 45]: Sorry to find the pride of his old companion humbled , and to hear him speaking in this altered strain at once , at once , he drove from his breast the inability to contend with its deep emotions , and spoke out bravely .
Parsing [sent. 17043 len. 10]: ` Your hopes do not soar above that ! '
Parsing [sent. 17044 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 17045 len. 5]: ` Yes they do .
Parsing [sent. 17046 len. 6]: How can you talk so !
Parsing [sent. 17047 len. 16]: They soar up to the time when you will be happy with her , Martin .
Parsing [sent. 17048 len. 17]: They soar up to the time when you will be able to claim her , Martin .
Parsing [sent. 17049 len. 30]: They soar up to the time when you will not be able to believe that you were ever cast down in spirit , or poor in pocket , Martin .
Parsing [sent. 17050 len. 6]: Advice , and friendly counsel !
Parsing [sent. 17051 len. 5]: Why , of course .
Parsing [sent. 17052 len. 20]: But you shall have better advice and counsel -LRB- though you can not have more friendly -RRB- than mine .
Parsing [sent. 17053 len. 6]: You shall consult John Westlock .
Parsing [sent. 17054 len. 6]: We 'll go there immediately .
Parsing [sent. 17055 len. 43]: It is yet so early that I shall have time to take you to his chambers before I go to business ; they are in my way ; and I can leave you there , to talk over your affairs with him .
Parsing [sent. 17056 len. 4]: So come along .
Parsing [sent. 17057 len. 3]: Come along .
Parsing [sent. 17058 len. 28]: I am a man of occupation now , you know , ' said Tom , with his pleasantest smile ; ` and have no time to lose .
Parsing [sent. 17059 len. 9]: Your hopes do n't soar higher than that ?
Parsing [sent. 17060 len. 7]: I dare say they do n't .
Parsing [sent. 17061 len. 7]: I know you , pretty well .
Parsing [sent. 17062 len. 22]: They 'll be soaring out of sight soon , Martin , and leaving all the rest of us leagues behind . '
Parsing [sent. 17063 len. 3]: ` Aye !
Parsing [sent. 17064 len. 23]: But I may be a little changed , ' said Martin , ` since you knew me pretty well , Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 17065 len. 5]: ` What nonsense ! '
Parsing [sent. 17066 len. 3]: exclaimed Tom .
Parsing [sent. 17067 len. 7]: ` Why should you be changed ?
Parsing [sent. 17068 len. 10]: You talk as if you were an old man .
Parsing [sent. 17069 len. 7]: I never heard such a fellow !
Parsing [sent. 17070 len. 8]: Come to John Westlock 's , come .
Parsing [sent. 17071 len. 6]: Come along , Mark Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 17072 len. 26]: It 's Mark 's doing , I have no doubt ; and it serves you right for having such a grumbler for your companion . '
Parsing [sent. 17073 len. 33]: ` There 's no credit to be got through being jolly with YOU , Mr Pinch , anyways , ' said Mark , with his face all wrinkled up with grins . '
Parsing [sent. 17074 len. 9]: A parish doctor might be jolly with you .
Parsing [sent. 17075 len. 34]: There 's nothing short of goin ' to the U-nited States for a second trip , as would make it at all creditable to be jolly , arter seein ' you again ! '
Parsing [sent. 17076 len. 53]: Tom laughed , and taking leave of his sister , hurried Mark and Martin out into the street , and away to John Westlock 's by the nearest road ; for his hour of business was very near at hand , and he prided himself on always being exact to his time .
Parsing [sent. 17077 len. 41]: John Westlock was at home , but , strange to say , was rather embarrassed to see them ; and when Tom was about to go into the room where he was breakfasting , said he had a stranger there .
Parsing [sent. 17078 len. 26]: It appeared to be a mysterious stranger , for John shut that door as he said it , and led them into the next room .
Parsing [sent. 17079 len. 22]: He was very much delighted , though , to see Mark Tapley ; and received Martin with his own frank courtesy .
Parsing [sent. 17080 len. 33]: But Martin felt that he did not inspire John Westlock with any unusual interest ; and twice or thrice observed that he looked at Tom Pinch doubtfully ; not to say compassionately .
Parsing [sent. 17081 len. 17]: He thought , and blushed to think , that he knew the cause of this . '
Parsing [sent. 17082 len. 20]: I apprehend you are engaged , ' said Martin , when Tom had announced the purport of their visit .
Parsing [sent. 17083 len. 24]: ` If you will allow me to come again at your own time , I shall be glad to do so . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17084 len. 38]: I AM engaged , ' replied John , with some reluctance ; ` but the matter on which I am engaged is one , to say the truth , more immediately demanding your knowledge than mine . '
Parsing [sent. 17085 len. 4]: ` Indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 17086 len. 3]: cried Martin .
Parsing [sent. 17087 len. 17]: ` It relates to a member of your family , and is of a serious nature .
Parsing [sent. 17088 len. 38]: If you will have the kindness to remain here , it will be a satisfaction to me to have it privately communicated to you , in order that you may judge of its importance for yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 17089 len. 24]: ` And in the meantime , ' said Tom , ' I must really take myself off , without any further ceremony . '
Parsing [sent. 17090 len. 25]: ` Is your business so very particular , ' asked Martin , ` that you can not remain with us for half an hour ?
Parsing [sent. 17091 len. 5]: I wish you could .
Parsing [sent. 17092 len. 8]: What IS your business , Tom ? '
Parsing [sent. 17093 len. 70]: It was Tom 's turn to be embarrassed now ; but he plainly said , after a little hesitation : ` Why , I am not at liberty to say what it is , Martin ; though I hope soon to be in a condition to do so , and am aware of no other reason to prevent my doing so now , than the request of my employer .
Parsing [sent. 17094 len. 46]: It 's an awkward position to be placed in , ' said Tom , with an uneasy sense of seeming to doubt his friend , ` as I feel every day ; but I really can not help it , can I , John ? '
Parsing [sent. 17095 len. 56]: John Westlock replied in the negative ; and Martin , expressing himself perfectly satisfied , begged them not to say another word ; though he could not help wondering very much what curious office Tom held , and why he was so secret , and embarrassed , and unlike himself , in reference to it .
Parsing [sent. 17096 len. 55]: Nor could he help reverting to it , in his own mind , several times after Tom went away , which he did as soon as this conversation was ended , taking Mr Tapley with him , who , as he laughingly said , might accompany him as far as Fleet Street without injury .
Parsing [sent. 17097 len. 12]: ` And what do you mean to do , Mark ? '
Parsing [sent. 17098 len. 9]: asked Tom , as they walked on together .
Parsing [sent. 17099 len. 8]: ` Mean to do , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 17100 len. 4]: returned Mr Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 17101 len. 3]: ` Aye .
Parsing [sent. 17102 len. 11]: What course of life do you mean to pursue ? '
Parsing [sent. 17103 len. 10]: ` Well , sir , ' said Mr Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 17104 len. 19]: ` The fact is , that I have been a-thinking rather of the matrimonial line , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 17105 len. 10]: ` You do n't say so , Mark ! '
Parsing [sent. 17106 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 17107 len. 5]: ` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 17108 len. 10]: I 've been a-turnin ' of it over . '
Parsing [sent. 17109 len. 10]: ` And who is the lady , Mark ? '
Parsing [sent. 17110 len. 7]: ` The which , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 17111 len. 4]: said Mr Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 17112 len. 4]: ` The lady .
Parsing [sent. 17113 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 17114 len. 20]: You know what I said , ' replied Tom , laughing , ` as well as I do ! '
Parsing [sent. 17115 len. 33]: Mr Tapley suppressed his own inclination to laugh ; and with one of his most whimsically-twisted looks , replied : ` You could n't guess , I suppose , Mr Pinch ? '
Parsing [sent. 17116 len. 7]: ` How is it possible ? '
Parsing [sent. 17117 len. 4]: said Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 17118 len. 11]: I do n't know any of your flames , Mark .
Parsing [sent. 17119 len. 7]: Except Mrs Lupin , indeed . '
Parsing [sent. 17120 len. 6]: ` Well , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 17121 len. 4]: retorted Mr Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 17122 len. 8]: ` And supposing it was her ! '
Parsing [sent. 17123 len. 33]: Tom stopping in the street to look at him , Mr Tapley for a moment presented to his view an utterly stolid and expressionless face ; a perfect dead wall of countenance .
Parsing [sent. 17124 len. 43]: But opening window after window in it with astonishing rapidity , and lighting them all up as for a general illumination , he repeated : ` Supposin ' , for the sake of argument , as it was her , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 17125 len. 19]: ` Why I thought such a connection would n't suit you , Mark , on any terms ! '
Parsing [sent. 17126 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 17127 len. 5]: ` Well , sir !
Parsing [sent. 17128 len. 13]: I used to think so myself , once , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 17129 len. 11]: ` But I ai n't so clear about it now .
Parsing [sent. 17130 len. 10]: A dear , sweet creetur , sir ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 17131 len. 6]: A dear , sweet creature ?
Parsing [sent. 17132 len. 10]: To be sure she is , ' cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 17133 len. 16]: ` But she always was a dear , sweet creature , was she not ? '
Parsing [sent. 17134 len. 6]: ` WAS she not ! '
Parsing [sent. 17135 len. 4]: assented Mr Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 17136 len. 42]: ` Then why on earth did n't you marry her at first , Mark , instead of wandering abroad , and losing all this time , and leaving her alone by herself , liable to be courted by other people ? '
Parsing [sent. 17137 len. 27]: ` Why , sir , ' retorted Mr Tapley , in a spirit of unbounded confidence , ` I 'll tell you how it come about .
Parsing [sent. 17138 len. 20]: You know me , Mr Pinch , sir ; there ai n't a gentleman alive as knows me better .
Parsing [sent. 17139 len. 15]: You 're acquainted with my constitution , and you 're acquainted with my weakness .
Parsing [sent. 17140 len. 22]: My constitution is , to be jolly ; and my weakness is , to wish to find a credit in it .
Parsing [sent. 17141 len. 5]: Wery good , sir .
Parsing [sent. 17142 len. 46]: In this state of mind , I gets a notion in my head that she looks on me with a eye of -- with what you may call a favourable sort of a eye in fact , ' said Mr Tapley , with modest hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 17143 len. 8]: ` No doubt , ' replied Tom .
Parsing [sent. 17144 len. 22]: ` We knew that perfectly well when we spoke on this subject long ago ; before you left the Dragon . '
Parsing [sent. 17145 len. 5]: Mr Tapley nodded assent .
Parsing [sent. 17146 len. 5]: ` Well , sir !
Parsing [sent. 17147 len. 44]: But bein ' at that time full of hopeful wisions , I arrives at the conclusion that no credit is to be got out of such a way of life as that , where everything agreeable would be ready to one 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 17148 len. 53]: Lookin ' on the bright side of human life in short , one of my hopeful wisions is , that there 's a deal of misery awaitin ' for me ; in the midst of which I may come out tolerable strong , and be jolly under circumstances as reflects some credit .
Parsing [sent. 17149 len. 16]: I goes into the world , sir , wery boyant , and I tries this .
Parsing [sent. 17150 len. 33]: I goes aboard ship first , and wery soon discovers -LRB- by the ease with which I 'm jolly , mind you -RRB- as there 's no credit to be got THERE .
Parsing [sent. 17151 len. 18]: I might have took warning by this , and gave it up ; but I did n't .
Parsing [sent. 17152 len. 29]: I gets to the U-nited States ; and then I DO begin , I wo n't deny it , to feel some little credit in sustaining my spirits .
Parsing [sent. 17153 len. 3]: What follows ?
Parsing [sent. 17154 len. 23]: Jest as I 'm a-beginning to come out , and am a-treadin ' on the werge , my master deceives me . '
Parsing [sent. 17155 len. 5]: ` Deceives you ! '
Parsing [sent. 17156 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 17157 len. 13]: ` Swindles me , ' retorted Mr Tapley with a beaming face .
Parsing [sent. 17158 len. 28]: ` Turns his back on everything as made his service a creditable one , and leaves me high and dry , without a leg to stand upon .
Parsing [sent. 17159 len. 7]: In which state I returns home .
Parsing [sent. 17160 len. 3]: Wery good .
Parsing [sent. 17161 len. 95]: Then all my hopeful wisions bein ' crushed ; and findin ' that there ai n't no credit for me nowhere ; I abandons myself to despair , and says , `` Let me do that as has the least credit in it of all ; marry a dear , sweet creetur , as is wery fond of me ; me bein ' , at the same time , wery fond of her ; lead a happy life , and struggle no more again ' the blight which settles on my prospects . '' '
Parsing [sent. 17162 len. 34]: ` If your philosophy , Mark , ' said Tom , who laughed heartily at this speech , ` be the oddest I ever heard of , it is not the least wise .
Parsing [sent. 17163 len. 12]: Mrs Lupin has said `` yes , '' of course ? '
Parsing [sent. 17164 len. 23]: ` Why , no , sir , ' replied Mr Tapley ; ` she has n't gone so far as that yet .
Parsing [sent. 17165 len. 12]: Which I attribute principally to my not havin ' asked her .
Parsing [sent. 17166 len. 19]: But we was wery agreeable together -- comfortable , I may say -- the night I come home .
Parsing [sent. 17167 len. 8]: It 's all right , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 17168 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 17169 len. 10]: said Tom , stopping at the Temple Gate . '
Parsing [sent. 17170 len. 12]: I wish you joy , Mark , with all my heart .
Parsing [sent. 17171 len. 11]: I shall see you again to-day , I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 17172 len. 6]: Good-bye for the present . '
Parsing [sent. 17173 len. 5]: ` Good-bye , sir !
Parsing [sent. 17174 len. 6]: Good-bye , Mr Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 17175 len. 14]: he added by way of soliloquy , as he stood looking after him .
Parsing [sent. 17176 len. 11]: ` Although you ARE a damper to a honourable ambition .
Parsing [sent. 17177 len. 15]: You little think it , but you was the first to dash my hopes .
Parsing [sent. 17178 len. 17]: Pecksniff would have built me up for life , but your sweet temper pulled me down .
Parsing [sent. 17179 len. 6]: Good-bye , Mr Pinch ! '
Parsing [sent. 17180 len. 20]: While these confidences were interchanged between Tom Pinch and Mark , Martin and John Westlock were very differently engaged .
Parsing [sent. 17181 len. 49]: They were no sooner left alone together than Martin said , with an effort he could not disguise : ` Mr Westlock , we have met only once before , but you have known Tom a long while , and that seems to render you familiar to me .
Parsing [sent. 17182 len. 22]: I can not talk freely with you on any subject unless I relieve my mind of what oppresses it just now .
Parsing [sent. 17183 len. 39]: I see with pain that you so far mistrust me that you think me likely to impose on Tom 's regardlessness of himself , or on his kind nature , or some of his good qualities . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17184 len. 28]: I had no intention , ' replied John , ` of conveying any such impression to you , and am exceedingly sorry to have done so . '
Parsing [sent. 17185 len. 7]: ` But you entertain it ? '
Parsing [sent. 17186 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 17187 len. 60]: ` You ask me so pointedly and directly , ' returned the other , ` that I can not deny the having accustomed myself to regard you as one who , not in wantonness but in mere thoughtlessness of character , did not sufficiently consider his nature and did not quite treat it as it deserves to be treated .
Parsing [sent. 17188 len. 13]: It is much easier to slight than to appreciate Tom Pinch . '
Parsing [sent. 17189 len. 33]: This was not said warmly , but was energetically spoken too ; for there was no subject in the world -LRB- but one -RRB- on which the speaker felt so strongly . '
Parsing [sent. 17190 len. 34]: I grew into the knowledge of Tom , ' he pursued , ` as I grew towards manhood ; and I have learned to love him as something , infinitely better than myself .
Parsing [sent. 17191 len. 13]: I did not think that you understood him when we met before .
Parsing [sent. 17192 len. 12]: I did not think that you greatly cared to understand him .
Parsing [sent. 17193 len. 29]: The instances of this which I observed in you were , like my opportunities for observation , very trivial -- and were very harmless , I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 17194 len. 28]: But they were not agreeable to me , and they forced themselves upon me ; for I was not upon the watch for them , believe me .
Parsing [sent. 17195 len. 34]: You will say , ' added John , with a smile , as he subsided into more of his accustomed manner , ` that I am not by any means agreeable to you .
Parsing [sent. 17196 len. 23]: I can only assure you , in reply , that I would not have originated this topic on any account . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17197 len. 42]: I originated it , ' said Martin ; ` and so far from having any complaint to make against you , highly esteem the friendship you entertain for Tom , and the very many proofs you have given him of it .
Parsing [sent. 17198 len. 44]: Why should I endeavour to conceal from you ' -- he coloured deeply though -- ` that I neither understood him nor cared to understand him when I was his companion ; and that I am very truly sorry for it now ! '
Parsing [sent. 17199 len. 46]: It was so sincerely said , at once so modestly and manfully , that John offered him his hand as if he had not done so before ; and Martin giving his in the same open spirit , all constraint between the young men vanished .
Parsing [sent. 17200 len. 45]: ` Now pray , ' said John , ` when I tire your patience very much in what I am going to say , recollect that it has an end to it , and that the end is the point of the story . '
Parsing [sent. 17201 len. 47]: With this preface , he related all the circumstances connected with his having presided over the illness and slow recovery of the patient at the Bull ; and tacked on to the skirts of that narrative Tom 's own account of the business on the wharf .
Parsing [sent. 17202 len. 39]: Martin was not a little puzzled when he came to an end , for the two stories seemed to have no connection with each other , and to leave him , as the phrase is , all abroad .
Parsing [sent. 17203 len. 31]: ` If you will excuse me for one moment , ' said John , rising , ' I will beg you almost immediately to come into the next room . '
Parsing [sent. 17204 len. 26]: Upon that , he left Martin to himself , in a state of considerable astonishment ; and soon came back again to fulfil his promise .
Parsing [sent. 17205 len. 30]: Accompanying him into the next room , Martin found there a third person ; no doubt the stranger of whom his host had spoken when Tom Pinch introduced him .
Parsing [sent. 17206 len. 13]: He was a young man ; with deep black hair and eyes .
Parsing [sent. 17207 len. 17]: He was gaunt and pale ; and evidently had not long recovered from a severe illness .
Parsing [sent. 17208 len. 14]: He stood as Martin entered , but sat again at John 's desire .
Parsing [sent. 17209 len. 35]: His eyes were cast downward ; and but for one glance at them both , half in humiliation and half in entreaty , he kept them so , and sat quite still and silent .
Parsing [sent. 17210 len. 38]: ` This person 's name is Lewsome , ' said John Westlock , ` whom I have mentioned to you as having been seized with an illness at the inn near here , and undergone so much .
Parsing [sent. 17211 len. 30]: He has had a very hard time of it , ever since he began to recover ; but , as you see , he is now doing well . '
Parsing [sent. 17212 len. 32]: As he did not move or speak , and John Westlock made a pause , Martin , not knowing what to say , said that he was glad to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 17213 len. 59]: ` The short statement that I wish you to hear from his own lips , Mr Chuzzlewit , ' John pursued -- looking attentively at him , and not at Martin -- ` he made to me for the first time yesterday , and repeated to me this morning , without the least variation of any essential particular .
Parsing [sent. 17214 len. 33]: I have already told you that he informed me before he was removed from the Inn , that he had a secret to disclose to me which lay heavy on his mind .
Parsing [sent. 17215 len. 37]: But , fluctuating between sickness and health and between his desire to relieve himself of it , and his dread of involving himself by revealing it , he has , until yesterday , avoided the disclosure .
Parsing [sent. 17216 len. 105]: I never pressed him for it -LRB- having no idea of its weight or import , or of my right to do so -RRB- , until within a few days past ; when , understanding from him , on his own voluntary avowal , in a letter from the country , that it related to a person whose name was Jonas Chuzzlewit ; and thinking that it might throw some light on that little mystery which made Tom anxious now and then ; I urged the point upon him , and heard his statement , as you will now , from his own lips .
Parsing [sent. 17217 len. 53]: It is due to him to say , that in the apprehension of death , he committed it to writing sometime since , and folded it in a sealed paper , addressed to me ; which he could not resolve , however , to place of his own act in my hands .
Parsing [sent. 17218 len. 16]: He has the paper in his breast , I believe , at this moment . '
Parsing [sent. 17219 len. 13]: The young man touched it hastily ; in corroboration of the fact .
Parsing [sent. 17220 len. 18]: ` It will be well to leave that in our charge , perhaps , ' said John .
Parsing [sent. 17221 len. 9]: ` But do not mind it now . '
Parsing [sent. 17222 len. 16]: As he said this , he held up his hand to bespeak Martin 's attention .
Parsing [sent. 17223 len. 47]: It was already fixed upon the man before him , who , after a short silence said , in a low , weak , hollow voice : ` What relation was Mr Anthony Chuzzlewit , who -- ' ' -- Who died -- to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 17224 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 17225 len. 10]: ` He was my grandfather 's brother . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17226 len. 8]: I fear he was made away with .
Parsing [sent. 17227 len. 3]: Murdered ! '
Parsing [sent. 17228 len. 5]: ` My God ! '
Parsing [sent. 17229 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 17230 len. 5]: ` By whom ? '
Parsing [sent. 17231 len. 29]: The young man , Lewsome , looked up in his face , and casting down his eyes again , replied : ' I fear , by me . '
Parsing [sent. 17232 len. 5]: ` By you ? '
Parsing [sent. 17233 len. 3]: cried Martin .
Parsing [sent. 17234 len. 14]: ` Not by my act , but I fear by my means . '
Parsing [sent. 17235 len. 5]: ` Speak out ! '
Parsing [sent. 17236 len. 11]: said Martin , ` and speak the truth . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17237 len. 8]: I fear this IS the truth . '
Parsing [sent. 17238 len. 58]: Martin was about to interrupt him again , but John Westlock saying softly , ` Let him tell his story in his own way , ' Lewsome went on thus : ' I have been bred a surgeon , and for the last few years have served a general practitioner in the City , as his assistant .
Parsing [sent. 17239 len. 13]: While I was in his employment I became acquainted with Jonas Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 17240 len. 9]: He is the principal in this deed . '
Parsing [sent. 17241 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 17242 len. 5]: demanded Martin , sternly .
Parsing [sent. 17243 len. 20]: ` Do you know he is the son of the old man of whom you have spoken ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 17244 len. 7]: I do , ' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 17245 len. 20]: He remained silent for some moments , when he resumed at the point where he had left off . '
Parsing [sent. 17246 len. 34]: I have reason to know it ; for I have often heard him wish his old father dead , and complain of his being wearisome to him , and a drag upon him .
Parsing [sent. 17247 len. 26]: He was in the habit of doing so , at a place of meeting we had -- three or four of us -- at night .
Parsing [sent. 17248 len. 23]: There was no good in the place you may suppose , when you hear that he was the chief of the party .
Parsing [sent. 17249 len. 13]: I wish I had died myself , and never seen it ! '
Parsing [sent. 17250 len. 10]: He stopped again ; and again resumed as before .
Parsing [sent. 17251 len. 22]: ` We met to drink and game ; not for large sums , but for sums that were large to us .
Parsing [sent. 17252 len. 4]: He generally won .
Parsing [sent. 17253 len. 37]: Whether or no , he lent money at interest to those who lost ; and in this way , though I think we all secretly hated him , he came to be the master of us .
Parsing [sent. 17254 len. 44]: To propitiate him we made a jest of his father ; it began with his debtors ; I was one ; and we used to toast a quicker journey to the old man , and a swift inheritance to the young one . '
Parsing [sent. 17255 len. 4]: He paused again .
Parsing [sent. 17256 len. 12]: ` One night he came there in a very bad humour .
Parsing [sent. 17257 len. 16]: He had been greatly tried , he said , by the old man that day .
Parsing [sent. 17258 len. 59]: He and I were alone together ; and he angrily told me , that the old man was in his second childhood ; that he was weak , imbecile , and drivelling ; as unbearable to himself as he was to other people ; and that it would be a charity to put him out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 17259 len. 27]: He swore that he had often thought of mixing something with the stuff he took for his cough , which should help him to die easily .
Parsing [sent. 17260 len. 28]: People were sometimes smothered who were bitten by mad dogs , he said ; and why not help these lingering old men out of their troubles too ?
Parsing [sent. 17261 len. 26]: He looked full at me as he said so , and I looked full at him ; but it went no farther that night . '
Parsing [sent. 17262 len. 22]: He stopped once more , and was silent for so long an interval that John Westlock said ` Go on . '
Parsing [sent. 17263 len. 24]: Martin had never removed his eyes from his face , but was so absorbed in horror and astonishment that he could not speak .
Parsing [sent. 17264 len. 51]: ` It may have been a week after that , or it may have been less or more -- the matter was in my mind all the time , but I can not recollect the time , as I should any other period -- when he spoke to me again .
Parsing [sent. 17265 len. 16]: We were alone then , too ; being there before the usual hour of assembling .
Parsing [sent. 17266 len. 27]: There was no appointment between us ; but I think I went there to meet him , and I know he came there to meet me .
Parsing [sent. 17267 len. 5]: He was there first .
Parsing [sent. 17268 len. 23]: He was reading a newspaper when I went in , and nodded to me without looking up , or leaving off reading .
Parsing [sent. 17269 len. 9]: I sat down opposite and close to him .
Parsing [sent. 17270 len. 19]: He said , immediately , that he wanted me to get him some of two sorts of drugs .
Parsing [sent. 17271 len. 15]: One that was instantaneous in its effect ; of which he wanted very little .
Parsing [sent. 17272 len. 16]: One that was slow and not suspicious in appearance ; of which he wanted more .
Parsing [sent. 17273 len. 12]: While he was speaking to me he still read the newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 17274 len. 13]: He said `` Drugs , '' and never used any other word .
Parsing [sent. 17275 len. 21]: Neither did I. ' ` This all agrees with what I have heard before , ' observed John Westlock . '
Parsing [sent. 17276 len. 10]: I asked him what he wanted the drugs for ?
Parsing [sent. 17277 len. 17]: He said for no harm ; to physic cats ; what did it matter to me ?
Parsing [sent. 17278 len. 51]: I was going out to a distant colony -LRB- I had recently got the appointment , which , as Mr Westlock knows , I have since lost by my sickness , and which was my only hope of salvation from ruin -RRB- , and what did it matter to me ?
Parsing [sent. 17279 len. 25]: He could get them without my aid at half a hundred places , but not so easily as he could get them of me .
Parsing [sent. 17280 len. 4]: This was true .
Parsing [sent. 17281 len. 30]: He might not want them at all , he said , and he had no present idea of using them ; but he wished to have them by him .
Parsing [sent. 17282 len. 9]: All this time he still read the newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 17283 len. 6]: We talked about the price .
Parsing [sent. 17284 len. 34]: He was to forgive me a small debt -- I was quite in his power -- and to pay me five pounds ; and there the matter dropped , through others coming in .
Parsing [sent. 17285 len. 42]: But , next night , under exactly similar circumstances , I gave him the drugs , on his saying I was a fool to think that he should ever use them for any harm ; and he gave me the money .
Parsing [sent. 17286 len. 6]: We have never met since .
Parsing [sent. 17287 len. 35]: I only know that the poor old father died soon afterwards , just as he would have died from this cause ; and that I have undergone , and suffer now , intolerable misery .
Parsing [sent. 17288 len. 16]: Nothing ' he added , stretching out his hands , ` can paint my misery !
Parsing [sent. 17289 len. 12]: It is well deserved , but nothing can paint it . '
Parsing [sent. 17290 len. 30]: With that he hung his head , and said no more , wasted and wretched , he was not a creature upon whom to heap reproaches that were unavailing .
Parsing [sent. 17291 len. 27]: ` Let him remain at hand , ' said Martin , turning from him ; ` but out of sight , in Heaven 's name ! '
Parsing [sent. 17292 len. 10]: ` He will remain here , ' John whispered .
Parsing [sent. 17293 len. 6]: ` Come with me ! '
Parsing [sent. 17294 len. 26]: Softly turning the key upon him as they went out , he conducted Martin into the adjoining room , in which they had been before .
Parsing [sent. 17295 len. 54]: Martin was so amazed , so shocked , and confounded by what he had heard that it was some time before he could reduce it to any order in his mind , or could sufficiently comprehend the bearing of one part upon another , to take in all the details at one view .
Parsing [sent. 17296 len. 70]: When he , at length , had the whole narrative clearly before him , John Westlock went on to point out the great probability of the guilt of Jonas being known to other people , who traded in it for their own benefit , and who were , by such means , able to exert that control over him which Tom Pinch had accidentally witnessed , and unconsciously assisted .
Parsing [sent. 17297 len. 33]: This appeared so plain , that they agreed upon it without difficulty ; but instead of deriving the least assistance from this source , they found that it embarrassed them the more .
Parsing [sent. 17298 len. 12]: They knew nothing of the real parties who possessed this power .
Parsing [sent. 17299 len. 10]: The only person before them was Tom 's landlord .
Parsing [sent. 17300 len. 33]: They had no right to question Tom 's landlord , even if they could find him , which , according to Tom 's account , it would not be easy to do .
Parsing [sent. 17301 len. 64]: And granting that they did question him , and he answered -LRB- which was taking a good deal for granted -RRB- , he had only to say , with reference to the adventure on the wharf , that he had been sent from such and such a place to summon Jonas back on urgent business , and there was an end of it .
Parsing [sent. 17302 len. 17]: Besides , there was the great difficulty and responsibility of moving at all in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 17303 len. 39]: Lewsome 's story might be false ; in his wretched state it might be greatly heightened by a diseased brain ; or admitting it to be entirely true , the old man might have died a natural death .
Parsing [sent. 17304 len. 36]: Mr Pecksniff had been there at the time ; as Tom immediately remembered , when he came back in the afternoon , and shared their counsels ; and there had been no secrecy about it .
Parsing [sent. 17305 len. 39]: Martin 's grandfather was of right the person to decide upon the course that should be taken ; but to get at his views would be impossible , for Mr Pecksniff 's views were certain to be his .
Parsing [sent. 17306 len. 20]: And the nature of Mr Pecksniff 's views in reference to his own son-in-law might be easily reckoned upon .
Parsing [sent. 17307 len. 35]: Apart from these considerations , Martin could not endure the thought of seeming to grasp at this unnatural charge against his relative , and using it as a stepping-stone to his grandfather 's favour .
Parsing [sent. 17308 len. 53]: But that he would seem to do so , if he presented himself before his grandfather in Mr Pecksniff 's house again , for the purpose of declaring it ; and that Mr Pecksniff , of all men , would represent his conduct in that despicable light , he perfectly well knew .
Parsing [sent. 17309 len. 39]: On the other hand to be in possession of such a statement , and take no measures of further inquiry in reference to it , was tantamount to being a partner in the guilt it professed to disclose .
Parsing [sent. 17310 len. 29]: In a word , they were wholly unable to discover any outlet from this maze of difficulty , which did not lie through some perplexed and entangled thicket .
Parsing [sent. 17311 len. 68]: And although Mr Tapley was promptly taken into their confidence ; and the fertile imagination of that gentleman suggested many bold expedients , which , to do him justice , he was quite ready to carry into instant operation on his own personal responsibility ; still ` bating the general zeal of Mr Tapley 's nature , nothing was made particularly clearer by these offers of service .
Parsing [sent. 17312 len. 71]: It was in this position of affairs that Tom 's account of the strange behaviour of the decayed clerk , on the night of the tea-party , became of great moment , and finally convinced them that to arrive at a more accurate knowledge of the workings of that old man 's mind and memory , would be to take a most important stride in their pursuit of the truth .
Parsing [sent. 17313 len. 47]: So , having first satisfied themselves that no communication had ever taken place between Lewsome and Mr Chuffey -LRB- which would have accounted at once for any suspicions the latter might entertain -RRB- , they unanimously resolved that the old clerk was the man they wanted .
Parsing [sent. 17314 len. 59]: But , like the unanimous resolution of a public meeting , which will oftentimes declare that this or that grievance is not to be borne a moment longer , which is nevertheless borne for a century or two afterwards , without any modification , they only reached in this the conclusion that they were all of one mind .
Parsing [sent. 17315 len. 68]: For it was one thing to want Mr Chuffey , and another thing to get at him ; and to do that without alarming him , or without alarming Jonas , or without being discomfited by the difficulty of striking , in an instrument so out of tune and so unused , the note they sought , was an end as far from their reach as ever .
Parsing [sent. 17316 len. 21]: The question then became , who of those about the old clerk had had most influence with him that night ?
Parsing [sent. 17317 len. 7]: Tom said his young mistress clearly .
Parsing [sent. 17318 len. 28]: But Tom and all of them shrunk from the thought of entrapping her , and making her the innocent means of bringing retribution on her cruel husband .
Parsing [sent. 17319 len. 5]: Was there nobody else ?
Parsing [sent. 17320 len. 3]: Why yes .
Parsing [sent. 17321 len. 36]: In a very different way , Tom said , he was influenced by Mrs Gamp , the nurse ; who had once had the control of him , as he understood , for some time .
Parsing [sent. 17322 len. 6]: They caught at this immediately .
Parsing [sent. 17323 len. 15]: Here was a new way out , developed in a quarter until then overlooked .
Parsing [sent. 17324 len. 44]: John Westlock knew Mrs Gamp ; he had given her employment ; he was acquainted with her place of residence : for that good lady had obligingly furnished him , at parting , with a pack of her professional cards for general distribution .
Parsing [sent. 17325 len. 52]: It was decided that Mrs Gamp should be approached with caution , but approached without delay ; and that the depths of that discreet matron 's knowledge of Mr Chuffey , and means of bringing them , or one of them , into communication with him , should be carefully sounded .
Parsing [sent. 17326 len. 56]: On this service , Martin and John Westlock determined to proceed that night ; waiting on Mrs Gamp first , at her lodgings ; and taking their chance of finding her in the repose of private life , or of having to seek her out , elsewhere , in the exercise of her professional duties .
Parsing [sent. 17327 len. 27]: Tom returned home , that he might lose no opportunity of having an interview with Nadgett , by being absent in the event of his reappearance .
Parsing [sent. 17328 len. 49]: And Mr Tapley remained -LRB- by his own particular desire -RRB- for the time being in Furnival 's Inn , to look after Lewsome ; who might safely have been left to himself , however , for any thought he seemed to entertain of giving them the slip .
Parsing [sent. 17329 len. 64]: Before they parted on their several errands , they caused him to read aloud , in the presence of them all , the paper which he had about him , and the declaration he had attached to it , which was to the effect that he had written it voluntarily , in the fear of death and in the torture of his mind .
Parsing [sent. 17330 len. 31]: And when he had done so , they all signed it , and taking it from him , of his free will , locked it in a place of safety .
Parsing [sent. 17331 len. 39]: Martin also wrote , by John 's advice , a letter to the trustees of the famous Grammar School , boldly claiming the successful design as his , and charging Mr Pecksniff with the fraud he had committed .
Parsing [sent. 17332 len. 58]: In this proceeding also , John was hotly interested ; observing , with his usual irreverance , that Mr Pecksniff had been a successful rascal all his life through , and that it would be a lasting source of happiness to him -LRB- John -RRB- if he could help to do him justice in the smallest particular .
Parsing [sent. 17333 len. 4]: A busy day !
Parsing [sent. 17334 len. 36]: But Martin had no lodgings yet ; so when these matters were disposed of , he excused himself from dining with John Westlock and was fain to wander out alone , and look for some .
Parsing [sent. 17335 len. 30]: He succeeded , after great trouble , in engaging two garrets for himself and Mark , situated in a court in the Strand , not far from Temple Bar .
Parsing [sent. 17336 len. 84]: Their luggage , which was waiting for them at a coach-office , he conveyed to this new place of refuge ; and it was with a glow of satisfaction , which as a selfish man he never could have known and never had , that , thinking how much pains and trouble he had saved Mark , and how pleased and astonished Mark would be , he afterwards walked up and down , in the Temple , eating a meat-pie for his dinner .
Parsing [sent. 17337 len. 42]: CHAPTER FORTY -- NINE IN WHICH MRS HARRIS ASSISTED BY A TEAPOT , IS THE CAUSE OF A DIVISION BETWEEN FRIENDS Mrs Gamp 's apartment in Kingsgate Street , High Holborn , wore , metaphorically speaking , a robe of state .
Parsing [sent. 17338 len. 12]: It was swept and garnished for the reception of a visitor .
Parsing [sent. 17339 len. 54]: That visitor was Betsey Prig ; Mrs Prig , of Bartlemy 's ; or as some said Barklemy 's , or as some said Bardlemy 's ; for by all these endearing and familiar appellations , had the hospital of Saint Bartholomew become a household word among the sisterhood which Betsey Prig adorned .
Parsing [sent. 17340 len. 46]: Mrs Gamp 's apartment was not a spacious one , but , to a contented mind , a closet is a palace ; and the first-floor front at Mr Sweedlepipe 's may have been , in the imagination of Mrs Gamp , a stately pile .
Parsing [sent. 17341 len. 38]: If it were not exactly that , to restless intellects , it at least comprised as much accommodation as any person , not sanguine to insanity , could have looked for in a room of its dimensions .
Parsing [sent. 17342 len. 15]: For only keep the bedstead always in your mind ; and you were safe .
Parsing [sent. 17343 len. 6]: That was the grand secret .
Parsing [sent. 17344 len. 46]: Remembering the bedstead , you might even stoop to look under the little round table for anything you had dropped , without hurting yourself much against the chest of drawers , or qualifying as a patient of Saint Bartholomew , by falling into the fire .
Parsing [sent. 17345 len. 27]: Visitors were much assisted in their cautious efforts to preserve an unflagging recollection of this piece of furniture , by its size ; which was great .
Parsing [sent. 17346 len. 72]: It was not a turn-up bedstead , nor yet a French bedstead , nor yet a four-post bedstead , but what is poetically called a tent ; the sacking whereof was low and bulgy , insomuch that Mrs Gamp 's box would not go under it , but stopped half-way , in a manner which , while it did violence to the reason , likewise endangered the legs of a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 17347 len. 52]: The frame too , which would have supported the canopy and hangings if there had been any , was ornamented with divers pippins carved in timber , which on the slightest provocation , and frequently on none at all , came tumbling down ; harassing the peaceful guest with inexplicable terrors .
Parsing [sent. 17348 len. 55]: The bed itself was decorated with a patchwork quilt of great antiquity ; and at the upper end , upon the side nearest to the door , hung a scanty curtain of blue check , which prevented the Zephyrs that were abroad in Kingsgate Street , from visiting Mrs Gamp 's head too roughly .
Parsing [sent. 17349 len. 64]: Some rusty gowns and other articles of that lady 's wardrobe depended from the posts ; and these had so adapted themselves by long usage to her figure , that more than one impatient husband coming in precipitately , at about the time of twilight , had been for an instant stricken dumb by the supposed discovery that Mrs Gamp had hanged herself .
Parsing [sent. 17350 len. 29]: One gentleman , coming on the usual hasty errand , had said indeed , that they looked like guardian angels ` watching of her in her sleep . '
Parsing [sent. 17351 len. 28]: But that , as Mrs Gamp said , ` was his first ; ' and he never repeated the sentiment , though he often repeated his visit .
Parsing [sent. 17352 len. 28]: The chairs in Mrs Gamp 's apartment were extremely large and broad-backed , which was more than a sufficient reason for there being but two in number .
Parsing [sent. 17353 len. 58]: They were both elbow-chairs , of ancient mahogany ; and were chiefly valuable for the slippery nature of their seats , which had been originally horsehair , but were now covered with a shiny substance of a bluish tint , from which the visitor began to slide away with a dismayed countenance , immediately after sitting down .
Parsing [sent. 17354 len. 87]: What Mrs Gamp wanted in chairs she made up in bandboxes ; of which she had a great collection , devoted to the reception of various miscellaneous valuables , which were not , however , as well protected as the good woman , by a pleasant fiction , seemed to think ; for , though every bandbox had a carefully closed lid , not one among them had a bottom ; owing to which cause the property within was merely , as it were , extinguished .
Parsing [sent. 17355 len. 63]: The chest of drawers having been originally made to stand upon the top of another chest , had a dwarfish , elfin look , alone ; but in regard of its security it had a great advantage over the bandboxes , for as all the handles had been long ago pulled off , it was very difficult to get at its contents .
Parsing [sent. 17356 len. 39]: This indeed was only to be done by one or two devices ; either by tilting the whole structure forward until all the drawers fell out together , or by opening them singly with knives , like oysters .
Parsing [sent. 17357 len. 49]: Mrs Gamp stored all her household matters in a little cupboard by the fire-place ; beginning below the surface -LRB- as in nature -RRB- with the coals , and mounting gradually upwards to the spirits , which , from motives of delicacy , she kept in a teapot .
Parsing [sent. 17358 len. 35]: The chimney-piece was ornamented with a small almanack , marked here and there in Mrs Gamp 's own hand with a memorandum of the date at which some lady was expected to fall due .
Parsing [sent. 17359 len. 59]: It was also embellished with three profiles : one , in colours , of Mrs Gamp herself in early life ; one , in bronze , of a lady in feathers , supposed to be Mrs Harris , as she appeared when dressed for a ball ; and one , in black , of Mr Gamp , deceased .
Parsing [sent. 17360 len. 27]: The last was a full length , in order that the likeness might be rendered more obvious and forcible by the introduction of the wooden leg .
Parsing [sent. 17361 len. 63]: A pair of bellows , a pair of pattens , a toasting-fork , a kettle , a pap-boat , a spoon for the administration of medicine to the refractory , and lastly , Mrs Gamp 's umbrella , which as something of great price and rarity , was displayed with particular ostentation , completed the decorations of the chimney-piece and adjacent wall .
Parsing [sent. 17362 len. 44]: Towards these objects Mrs Gamp raised her eyes in satisfaction when she had arranged the tea-board , and had concluded her arrangements for the reception of Betsey Prig , even unto the setting forth of two pounds of Newcastle salmon , intensely pickled .
Parsing [sent. 17363 len. 3]: ` There !
Parsing [sent. 17364 len. 12]: Now drat you , Betsey , do n't be long ! '
Parsing [sent. 17365 len. 9]: said Mrs Gamp , apostrophizing her absent friend .
Parsing [sent. 17366 len. 14]: ` For I ca n't abear to wait , I do assure you .
Parsing [sent. 17367 len. 66]: To wotever place I goes , I sticks to this one mortar , `` I 'm easy pleased ; it is but little as I wants ; but I must have that little of the best , and to the minute when the clock strikes , else we do not part as I could wish , but bearin ' malice in our arts . '' '
Parsing [sent. 17368 len. 37]: Her own preparations were of the best , for they comprehended a delicate new loaf , a plate of fresh butter , a basin of fine white sugar , and other arrangements on the same scale .
Parsing [sent. 17369 len. 22]: Even the snuff with which she now refreshed herself , was so choice in quality that she took a second pinch .
Parsing [sent. 17370 len. 22]: ` There 's the little bell a-ringing now , ' said Mrs Gamp , hurrying to the stair-head and looking over .
Parsing [sent. 17371 len. 20]: ` Betsey Prig , my -- why it 's that there disapintin ' Sweedlepipes , I do believe . '
Parsing [sent. 17372 len. 24]: ` Yes , it 's me , ' said the barber in a faint voice ; ` I 've just come in . '
Parsing [sent. 17373 len. 27]: ` You 're always a-comin ' in , I think , ' muttered Mrs Gamp to herself , ` except wen you 're a-goin ' out .
Parsing [sent. 17374 len. 11]: I ha 'n' t no patience with that man ! '
Parsing [sent. 17375 len. 10]: ` Mrs Gamp , ' said the barber . '
Parsing [sent. 17376 len. 3]: I say !
Parsing [sent. 17377 len. 4]: Mrs Gamp ! '
Parsing [sent. 17378 len. 16]: ` Well , ' cried Mrs Gamp , impatiently , as she descended the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 17379 len. 5]: ` What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 17380 len. 14]: Is the Thames a-fire , and cooking its own fish , Mr Sweedlepipes ?
Parsing [sent. 17381 len. 14]: Why wot 's the man gone and been a-doin ' of to himself ?
Parsing [sent. 17382 len. 8]: He 's as white as chalk ! '
Parsing [sent. 17383 len. 25]: She added the latter clause of inquiry , when she got downstairs , and found him seated in the shaving-chair , pale and disconsolate .
Parsing [sent. 17384 len. 8]: ` You recollect , ' said Poll .
Parsing [sent. 17385 len. 12]: ` You recollect young -- ' ` Not young Wilkins ! '
Parsing [sent. 17386 len. 4]: cried Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 17387 len. 11]: ` Do n't say young Wilkins , wotever you do .
Parsing [sent. 17388 len. 23]: If young Wilkins 's wife is took -- ' ` It is n't anybody 's wife , ' exclaimed the little barber .
Parsing [sent. 17389 len. 7]: ` Bailey , young Bailey ! '
Parsing [sent. 17390 len. 18]: ` Why , wot do you mean to say that chit 's been a-doin ' of ? '
Parsing [sent. 17391 len. 6]: retorted Mrs Gamp , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 17392 len. 9]: ` Stuff and nonsense , Mrs Sweedlepipes ! '
Parsing [sent. 17393 len. 9]: ` He has n't been a-doing anything ! '
Parsing [sent. 17394 len. 7]: exclaimed poor Poll , quite desperate .
Parsing [sent. 17395 len. 26]: ` What do you catch me up so short for , when you see me put out to that extent that I can hardly speak ?
Parsing [sent. 17396 len. 7]: He 'll never do anything again .
Parsing [sent. 17397 len. 5]: He 's done for .
Parsing [sent. 17398 len. 4]: He 's killed .
Parsing [sent. 17399 len. 23]: The first time I ever see that boy , ' said Poll , ' I charged him too much for a red-poll .
Parsing [sent. 17400 len. 19]: I asked him three-halfpence for a penny one , because I was afraid he 'd beat me down .
Parsing [sent. 17401 len. 5]: But he did n't .
Parsing [sent. 17402 len. 53]: And now he 's dead ; and if you was to crowd all the steam-engines and electric fluids that ever was , into this shop , and set 'em every one to work their hardest , they could n't square the account , though it 's only a ha ` penny ! '
Parsing [sent. 17403 len. 15]: Mr Sweedlepipe turned aside to the towel , and wiped his eyes with it .
Parsing [sent. 17404 len. 10]: ` And what a clever boy he was ! '
Parsing [sent. 17405 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 17406 len. 9]: ` What a surprising young chap he was !
Parsing [sent. 17407 len. 4]: How he talked !
Parsing [sent. 17408 len. 8]: and what a deal he know 'd !
Parsing [sent. 17409 len. 24]: Shaved in this very chair he was ; only for fun ; it was all his fun ; he was full of it .
Parsing [sent. 17410 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 17411 len. 11]: to think that he 'll never be shaved in earnest !
Parsing [sent. 17412 len. 42]: The birds might every one have died , and welcome , ' cried the little barber , looking round him at the cages , and again applying to the towel , ` sooner than I 'd have heard this news ! '
Parsing [sent. 17413 len. 11]: ` How did you ever come to hear it ? '
Parsing [sent. 17414 len. 4]: said Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 17415 len. 7]: ` who told you ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 17416 len. 62]: I went out , ' returned the little barber , ` into the City , to meet a sporting gent upon the Stock Exchange , that wanted a few slow pigeons to practice at ; and when I 'd done with him , I went to get a little drop of beer , and there I heard everybody a-talking about it .
Parsing [sent. 17417 len. 7]: It 's in the papers . '
Parsing [sent. 17418 len. 17]: ` You are in a nice state of confugion , Mr Sweedlepipes , you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 17419 len. 40]: said Mrs Gamp , shaking her head ; ` and my opinion is , as half-a-dudgeon fresh young lively leeches on your temples , would n't be too much to clear your mind , which so I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 17420 len. 15]: Wot were they a-talkin ' on , and wot was in the papers ? '
Parsing [sent. 17421 len. 6]: ` All about it ! '
Parsing [sent. 17422 len. 4]: cried the barber .
Parsing [sent. 17423 len. 7]: ` What else do you suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 17424 len. 28]: Him and his master were upset on a journey , and he was carried to Salisbury , and was breathing his last when the account came away .
Parsing [sent. 17425 len. 5]: He never spoke afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 17426 len. 5]: Not a single word .
Parsing [sent. 17427 len. 15]: That 's the worst of it to me ; but that ai n't all .
Parsing [sent. 17428 len. 7]: His master ca n't be found .
Parsing [sent. 17429 len. 35]: The other manager of their office in the city , Crimple , David Crimple , has gone off with the money , and is advertised for , with a reward , upon the walls .
Parsing [sent. 17430 len. 16]: Mr Montague , poor young Bailey 's master -LRB- what a boy he was ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 17431 len. 6]: is advertised for , too .
Parsing [sent. 17432 len. 33]: Some say he 's slipped off , to join his friend abroad ; some say he may n't have got away yet ; and they 're looking for him high and low .
Parsing [sent. 17433 len. 10]: Their office is a smash ; a swindle altogether .
Parsing [sent. 17434 len. 11]: But what 's a Life Assurance office to a Life !
Parsing [sent. 17435 len. 10]: And what a Life Young Bailey 's was ! '
Parsing [sent. 17436 len. 17]: ` He was born into a wale , ' said Mrs Gamp , with philosophical coolness .
Parsing [sent. 17437 len. 19]: ` and he lived in a wale ; and he must take the consequences of sech a sitiwation .
Parsing [sent. 17438 len. 14]: But do n't you hear nothink of Mr Chuzzlewit in all this ? '
Parsing [sent. 17439 len. 13]: ` No , ' said Poll , ` nothing to speak of .
Parsing [sent. 17440 len. 22]: His name was n't printed as one of the board , though some people say it was just going to be .
Parsing [sent. 17441 len. 31]: Some believe he was took in , and some believe he was one of the takers-in ; but however that may be , they ca n't prove nothing against him .
Parsing [sent. 17442 len. 60]: This morning he went up of his own accord afore the Lord Mayor or some of them City big-wigs , and complained that he 'd been swindled , and that these two persons had gone off and cheated him , and that he had just found out that Montague 's name was n't even Montague , but something else .
Parsing [sent. 17443 len. 15]: And they do say that he looked like Death , owing to his losses .
Parsing [sent. 17444 len. 30]: But , Lord forgive me , ' cried the barber , coming back again to the subject of his individual grief , ` what 's his looks to me !
Parsing [sent. 17445 len. 20]: He might have died and welcome , fifty times , and not been such a loss as Bailey ! '
Parsing [sent. 17446 len. 20]: At this juncture the little bell rang , and the deep voice of Mrs Prig struck into the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 17447 len. 3]: ` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 17448 len. 11]: You 're a-talkin ' about it , are you ! '
Parsing [sent. 17449 len. 4]: observed that lady .
Parsing [sent. 17450 len. 21]: ` Well , I hope you 've got it over , for I ai n't interested in it myself . '
Parsing [sent. 17451 len. 17]: ` My precious Betsey , ' said Mrs Gamp , ` how late you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 17452 len. 65]: The worthy Mrs Prig replied , with some asperity , ` that if perwerse people went off dead , when they was least expected , it war n't no fault of her ` n. ' And further , ` that it was quite aggrawation enough to be made late when one was dropping for one 's tea , without hearing on it again . '
Parsing [sent. 17453 len. 38]: Mrs Gamp , deriving from this exhibition of repartee some clue to the state of Mrs Prig 's feelings , instantly conducted her upstairs ; deeming that the sight of pickled salmon might work a softening change .
Parsing [sent. 17454 len. 7]: But Betsey Prig expected pickled salmon .
Parsing [sent. 17455 len. 32]: It was obvious that she did ; for her first words , after glancing at the table , were : ' I know 'd she would n't have a cowcumber ! '
Parsing [sent. 17456 len. 12]: Mrs Gamp changed colour , and sat down upon the bedstead .
Parsing [sent. 17457 len. 13]: ` Lord bless you , Betsey Prig , your words is true .
Parsing [sent. 17458 len. 6]: I quite forgot it ! '
Parsing [sent. 17459 len. 71]: Mrs Prig , looking steadfastly at her friend , put her hand in her pocket , and with an air of surly triumph drew forth either the oldest of lettuces or youngest of cabbages , but at any rate , a green vegetable of an expansive nature , and of such magnificent proportions that she was obliged to shut it up like an umbrella before she could pull it out .
Parsing [sent. 17460 len. 86]: She also produced a handful of mustard and cress , a trifle of the herb called dandelion , three bunches of radishes , an onion rather larger than an average turnip , three substantial slices of beetroot , and a short prong or antler of celery ; the whole of this garden-stuff having been publicly exhibited , but a short time before , as a twopenny salad , and purchased by Mrs Prig on condition that the vendor could get it all into her pocket .
Parsing [sent. 17461 len. 19]: Which had been happily accomplished , in High Holborn , to the breathless interest of a hackney-coach stand .
Parsing [sent. 17462 len. 48]: And she laid so little stress on this surprising forethought , that she did not even smile , but returning her pocket into its accustomed sphere , merely recommended that these productions of nature should be sliced up , for immediate consumption , in plenty of vinegar .
Parsing [sent. 17463 len. 19]: ` And do n't go a-droppin ' none of your snuff in it , ' said Mrs Prig .
Parsing [sent. 17464 len. 18]: ` In gruel , barley-water , apple-tea , mutton-broth , and that , it do n't signify .
Parsing [sent. 17465 len. 5]: It stimulates a patient .
Parsing [sent. 17466 len. 9]: But I do n't relish it myself . '
Parsing [sent. 17467 len. 7]: ` Why , Betsey Prig ! '
Parsing [sent. 17468 len. 12]: cried Mrs Gamp , ` how CAN you talk so ! '
Parsing [sent. 17469 len. 27]: ` Why , ai n't your patients , wotever their diseases is , always asneezin ' their wery heads off , along of your snuff ? '
Parsing [sent. 17470 len. 4]: said Mrs Prig .
Parsing [sent. 17471 len. 8]: ` And wot if they are ! '
Parsing [sent. 17472 len. 14]: said Mrs Gamp ` Nothing if they are , ' said Mrs Prig .
Parsing [sent. 17473 len. 10]: ` But do n't deny it , Sairah . '
Parsing [sent. 17474 len. 7]: ` Who deniges of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 17475 len. 4]: Mrs Gamp inquired .
Parsing [sent. 17476 len. 6]: Mrs Prig returned no answer .
Parsing [sent. 17477 len. 9]: ` WHO deniges of it , Betsey ? '
Parsing [sent. 17478 len. 5]: Mrs Gamp inquired again .
Parsing [sent. 17479 len. 22]: Then Mrs Gamp , by reversing the question , imparted a deeper and more awful character of solemnity to the same .
Parsing [sent. 17480 len. 9]: ` Betsey , who deniges of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 17481 len. 60]: It was the nearest possible approach to a very decided difference of opinion between these ladies ; but Mrs Prig 's impatience for the meal being greater at the moment than her impatience of contradiction , she replied , for the present , ` Nobody , if you do n't , Sairah , ' and prepared herself for tea .
Parsing [sent. 17482 len. 20]: For a quarrel can be taken up at any time , but a limited quantity of salmon can not .
Parsing [sent. 17483 len. 5]: Her toilet was simple .
Parsing [sent. 17484 len. 47]: She had merely to ` chuck ' her bonnet and shawl upon the bed ; give her hair two pulls , one upon the right side and one upon the left , as if she were ringing a couple of bells ; and all was done .
Parsing [sent. 17485 len. 26]: The tea was already made , Mrs Gamp was not long over the salad , and they were soon at the height of their repast .
Parsing [sent. 17486 len. 20]: The temper of both parties was improved , for the time being , by the enjoyments of the table .
Parsing [sent. 17487 len. 44]: When the meal came to a termination -LRB- which it was pretty long in doing -RRB- , and Mrs Gamp having cleared away , produced the teapot from the top shelf , simultaneously with a couple of wine-glasses , they were quite amiable .
Parsing [sent. 17488 len. 25]: ` Betsey , ' said Mrs Gamp , filling her own glass and passing the teapot , ' I will now propoge a toast .
Parsing [sent. 17489 len. 8]: My frequent pardner , Betsey Prig ! '
Parsing [sent. 17490 len. 25]: ` Which , altering the name to Sairah Gamp ; I drink , ' said Mrs Prig , ` with love and tenderness . '
Parsing [sent. 17491 len. 31]: From this moment symptoms of inflammation began to lurk in the nose of each lady ; and perhaps , notwithstanding all appearances to the contrary , in the temper also .
Parsing [sent. 17492 len. 27]: ` Now , Sairah , ' said Mrs Prig , ` joining business with pleasure , wot is this case in which you wants me ? '
Parsing [sent. 17493 len. 24]: Mrs Gamp betraying in her face some intention of returning an evasive answer , Betsey added : ` IS it Mrs Harris ? '
Parsing [sent. 17494 len. 17]: ` No , Betsey Prig , it ai n't , ' was Mrs Gamp 's reply .
Parsing [sent. 17495 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 17496 len. 9]: said Mrs Prig , with a short laugh .
Parsing [sent. 17497 len. 12]: ` I 'm glad of that , at any rate . '
Parsing [sent. 17498 len. 12]: ` Why should you be glad of that , Betsey ? '
Parsing [sent. 17499 len. 6]: Mrs Gamp retorted , warmly .
Parsing [sent. 17500 len. 16]: ` She is unbeknown to you except by hearsay , why should you be glad ?
Parsing [sent. 17501 len. 41]: If you have anythink to say contrairy to the character of Mrs Harris , which well I knows behind her back , afore her face , or anywheres , is not to be impeaged , out with it , Betsey .
Parsing [sent. 17502 len. 101]: I have know 'd that sweetest and best of women , ' said Mrs Gamp , shaking her head , and shedding tears , ` ever since afore her First , which Mr Harris who was dreadful timid went and stopped his ears in a empty dog-kennel , and never took his hands away or come out once till he was showed the baby , wen bein ' took with fits , the doctor collared him and laid him on his back upon the airy stones , and she was told to ease her mind , his owls was organs .
Parsing [sent. 17503 len. 78]: And I have know 'd her , Betsey Prig , when he has hurt her feelin ' art by sayin ' of his Ninth that it was one too many , if not two , while that dear innocent was cooin ' in his face , which thrive it did though bandy , but I have never know 'd as you had occagion to be glad , Betsey , on accounts of Mrs Harris not requiring you .
Parsing [sent. 17504 len. 28]: Require she never will , depend upon it , for her constant words in sickness is , and will be , `` Send for Sairey ? '' '
Parsing [sent. 17505 len. 40]: During this touching address , Mrs Prig adroitly feigning to be the victim of that absence of mind which has its origin in excessive attention to one topic , helped herself from the teapot without appearing to observe it .
Parsing [sent. 17506 len. 16]: Mrs Gamp observed it , however , and came to a premature close in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 17507 len. 25]: ` Well , it ai n't her , it seems , ' said Mrs Prig , coldly ; ` who is it then ? '
Parsing [sent. 17508 len. 56]: ` You have heerd me mention , Betsey , ' Mrs Gamp replied , after glancing in an expressive and marked manner at the tea-pot , ' a person as I took care on at the time as you and me was pardners off and on , in that there fever at the Bull ? '
Parsing [sent. 17509 len. 9]: ` Old Snuffey , ' Mrs Prig observed .
Parsing [sent. 17510 len. 55]: Sarah Gamp looked at her with an eye of fire , for she saw in this mistake of Mrs Prig , another willful and malignant stab at that same weakness or custom of hers , an ungenerous allusion to which , on the part of Betsey , had first disturbed their harmony that evening .
Parsing [sent. 17511 len. 37]: And she saw it still more clearly , when , politely but firmly correcting that lady by the distinct enunciation of the word ` Chuffey , ' Mrs Prig received the correction with a diabolical laugh .
Parsing [sent. 17512 len. 72]: The best among us have their failings , and it must be conceded of Mrs Prig , that if there were a blemish in the goodness of her disposition , it was a habit she had of not bestowing all its sharp and acid properties upon her patients -LRB- as a thoroughly amiable woman would have done -RRB- , but of keeping a considerable remainder for the service of her friends .
Parsing [sent. 17513 len. 61]: Highly pickled salmon , and lettuces chopped up in vinegar , may , as viands possessing some acidity of their own , have encouraged and increased this failing in Mrs Prig ; and every application to the teapot certainly did ; for it was often remarked of her by her friends , that she was most contradictory when most elevated .
Parsing [sent. 17514 len. 40]: It is certain that her countenance became about this time derisive and defiant , and that she sat with her arms folded , and one eye shut up , in a somewhat offensive , because obstrusively intelligent , manner .
Parsing [sent. 17515 len. 38]: Mrs Gamp observing this , felt it the more necessary that Mrs Prig should know her place , and be made sensible of her exact station in society , as well as of her obligations to herself .
Parsing [sent. 17516 len. 25]: She therefore assumed an air of greater patronage and importance , as she went on to answer Mrs Prig a little more in detail .
Parsing [sent. 17517 len. 18]: ` Mr Chuffey , Betsey , ' said Mrs Gamp , ` is weak in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 17518 len. 57]: Excuge me if I makes remark , that he may neither be so weak as people thinks , nor people may not think he is so weak as they pretends , and what I knows , I knows ; and what you do n't , you do n't ; so do not ask me , Betsey .
Parsing [sent. 17519 len. 31]: But Mr Chuffey 's friends has made propojals for his bein ' took care on , and has said to me , `` Mrs Gamp , WILL you undertake it ?
Parsing [sent. 17520 len. 31]: We could n't think , '' they says , `` of trusting him to nobody but you , for , Sairey , you are gold as has passed the furnage .
Parsing [sent. 17521 len. 21]: Will you undertake it , at your own price , day and night , and by your own self ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17522 len. 12]: `` No , '' I says , `` I will not .
Parsing [sent. 17523 len. 6]: Do not reckon on it .
Parsing [sent. 17524 len. 27]: There is , '' I says , but one creetur in the world as I would undertake on sech terms , and her name is Harris .
Parsing [sent. 17525 len. 30]: But , '' I says , `` I am acquainted with a friend , whose name is Betsey Prig , that I can recommend , and will assist me .
Parsing [sent. 17526 len. 26]: Betsey , '' I says , `` is always to be trusted under me , and will be guided as I could desire . '' '
Parsing [sent. 17527 len. 26]: Here Mrs Prig , without any abatement of her offensive manner again counterfeited abstraction of mind , and stretched out her hand to the teapot .
Parsing [sent. 17528 len. 9]: It was more than Mrs Gamp could bear .
Parsing [sent. 17529 len. 23]: She stopped the hand of Mrs Prig with her own , and said , with great feeling : ` No , Betsey !
Parsing [sent. 17530 len. 8]: Drink fair , wotever you do ! '
Parsing [sent. 17531 len. 48]: Mrs Prig , thus baffled , threw herself back in her chair , and closing the same eye more emphatically , and folding her arms tighter , suffered her head to roll slowly from side to side , while she surveyed her friend with a contemptuous smile .
Parsing [sent. 17532 len. 17]: Mrs Gamp resumed : ` Mrs Harris , Betsey -- ' ` Bother Mrs Harris ! '
Parsing [sent. 17533 len. 4]: said Betsey Prig .
Parsing [sent. 17534 len. 50]: Mrs Gamp looked at her with amazement , incredulity , and indignation ; when Mrs Prig , shutting her eye still closer , and folding her arms still tighter , uttered these memorable and tremendous words : ' I do n't believe there 's no sich a person ! '
Parsing [sent. 17535 len. 60]: After the utterance of which expressions , she leaned forward , and snapped her fingers once , twice , thrice ; each time nearer to the face of Mrs Gamp , and then rose to put on her bonnet , as one who felt that there was now a gulf between them , which nothing could ever bridge across .
Parsing [sent. 17536 len. 55]: The shock of this blow was so violent and sudden , that Mrs Gamp sat staring at nothing with uplifted eyes , and her mouth open as if she were gasping for breath , until Betsey Prig had put on her bonnet and her shawl , and was gathering the latter about her throat .
Parsing [sent. 17537 len. 14]: Then Mrs Gamp rose -- morally and physically rose -- and denounced her .
Parsing [sent. 17538 len. 4]: ` What ! '
Parsing [sent. 17539 len. 36]: said Mrs Gamp , ` you bage creetur , have I know 'd Mrs Harris five and thirty year , to be told at last that there ai n't no sech a person livin ' !
Parsing [sent. 17540 len. 46]: Have I stood her friend in all her troubles , great and small , for it to come at last to sech a end as this , which her own sweet picter hanging up afore you all the time , to shame your Bragian words !
Parsing [sent. 17541 len. 56]: But well you may n't believe there 's no sech a creetur , for she would n't demean herself to look at you , and often has she said , when I have made mention of your name , which , to my sinful sorrow , I have done , `` What , Sairey Gamp !
Parsing [sent. 17542 len. 6]: debage yourself to HER ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17543 len. 6]: Go along with you ! '
Parsing [sent. 17544 len. 13]: ` I 'm a-goin ' , ma'am , ai n't I ? '
Parsing [sent. 17545 len. 10]: said Mrs Prig , stopping as she said it .
Parsing [sent. 17546 len. 12]: ` You had better , ma'am , ' said Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 17547 len. 13]: ` Do you know who you 're talking to , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 17548 len. 4]: inquired her visitor .
Parsing [sent. 17549 len. 22]: ` Aperiently , ' said Mrs Gamp , surveying her with scorn from head to foot , ` to Betsey Prig .
Parsing [sent. 17550 len. 3]: Aperiently so .
Parsing [sent. 17551 len. 4]: I know her .
Parsing [sent. 17552 len. 4]: No one better .
Parsing [sent. 17553 len. 6]: Go along with you ! '
Parsing [sent. 17554 len. 13]: ` And YOU was a-goin ' to take me under you ! '
Parsing [sent. 17555 len. 15]: cried Mrs Prig , surveying Mrs Gamp from head to foot in her turn .
Parsing [sent. 17556 len. 7]: ` YOU was , was you ?
Parsing [sent. 17557 len. 5]: Oh , how kind !
Parsing [sent. 17558 len. 28]: Why , deuce take your imperence , ' said Mrs Prig , with a rapid change from banter to ferocity , ` what do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 17559 len. 7]: ` Go along with you ! '
Parsing [sent. 17560 len. 5]: said Mrs Gamp . '
Parsing [sent. 17561 len. 6]: I blush for you . '
Parsing [sent. 17562 len. 17]: ` You had better blush a little for yourself , while you ARE about it ! '
Parsing [sent. 17563 len. 4]: said Mrs Prig .
Parsing [sent. 17564 len. 6]: ` You and your Chuffeys !
Parsing [sent. 17565 len. 15]: What , the poor old creetur is n't mad enough , is n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 17566 len. 3]: Aha ! '
Parsing [sent. 17567 len. 23]: ` He 'd very soon be mad enough , if you had anything to do with him , ' said Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 17568 len. 14]: ` And that 's what I was wanted for , is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 17569 len. 6]: cried Mrs Prig , triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 17570 len. 3]: ` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 17571 len. 7]: But you 'll find yourself deceived .
Parsing [sent. 17572 len. 7]: I wo n't go near him .
Parsing [sent. 17573 len. 10]: We shall see how you get on without me .
Parsing [sent. 17574 len. 11]: I wo n't have nothink to do with him . '
Parsing [sent. 17575 len. 11]: ` You never spoke a truer word than that ! '
Parsing [sent. 17576 len. 4]: said Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 17577 len. 7]: ` Go along with you ! '
Parsing [sent. 17578 len. 80]: She was prevented from witnessing the actual retirement of Mrs Prig from the room , notwithstanding the great desire she had expressed to behold it , by that lady , in her angry withdrawal , coming into contact with the bedstead , and bringing down the previously mentioned pippins ; three or four of which came rattling on the head of Mrs Gamp so smartly , that when she recovered from this wooden shower-bath , Mrs Prig was gone .
Parsing [sent. 17579 len. 46]: She had the satisfaction , however , of hearing the deep voice of Betsey , proclaiming her injuries and her determination to have nothing to do with Mr Chuffey , down the stairs , and along the passage , and even out in Kingsgate Street .
Parsing [sent. 17580 len. 21]: Likewise of seeing in her own apartment , in the place of Mrs Prig , Mr Sweedlepipe and two gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 17581 len. 8]: ` Why , bless my life ! '
Parsing [sent. 17582 len. 10]: exclaimed the little barber , ` what 's amiss ?
Parsing [sent. 17583 len. 11]: The noise you ladies have been making , Mrs Gamp !
Parsing [sent. 17584 len. 37]: Why , these two gentlemen have been standing on the stairs , outside the door , nearly all the time , trying to make you hear , while you were pelting away , hammer and tongs !
Parsing [sent. 17585 len. 19]: It 'll be the death of the little bullfinch in the shop , that draws his own water .
Parsing [sent. 17586 len. 24]: In his fright , he 's been a-straining himself all to bits , drawing more water than he could drink in a twelvemonth .
Parsing [sent. 17587 len. 9]: He must have thought it was Fire ! '
Parsing [sent. 17588 len. 78]: Mrs Gamp had in the meanwhile sunk into her chair , from whence , turning up her overflowing eyes , and clasping her hands , she delivered the following lamentation : ` Oh , Mr Sweedlepipes , which Mr Westlock also , if my eyes do not deceive , and a friend not havin ' the pleasure of bein ' beknown , wot I have took from Betsey Prig this blessed night , no mortial creetur knows !
Parsing [sent. 17589 len. 69]: If she had abuged me , bein ' in liquor , which I thought I smelt her wen she come , but could not so believe , not bein ' used myself ' -- Mrs Gamp , by the way , was pretty far gone , and the fragrance of the teapot was strong in the room -- ' I could have bore it with a thankful art .
Parsing [sent. 17590 len. 14]: But the words she spoke of Mrs Harris , lambs could not forgive .
Parsing [sent. 17591 len. 5]: No , Betsey ! '
Parsing [sent. 17592 len. 17]: said Mrs Gamp , in a violent burst of feeling , ` nor worms forget ! '
Parsing [sent. 17593 len. 25]: The little barber scratched his head , and shook it , and looked at the teapot , and gradually got out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 17594 len. 16]: John Westlock , taking a chair , sat down on one side of Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 17595 len. 15]: Martin , taking the foot of the bed , supported her on the other .
Parsing [sent. 17596 len. 14]: ` You wonder what we want , I daresay , ' observed John .
Parsing [sent. 17597 len. 12]: ` I 'll tell you presently , when you have recovered .
Parsing [sent. 17598 len. 12]: It 's not pressing , for a few minutes or so .
Parsing [sent. 17599 len. 6]: How do you find yourself ?
Parsing [sent. 17600 len. 3]: Better ? '
Parsing [sent. 17601 len. 17]: Mrs Gamp shed more tears , shook her head and feebly pronounced Mrs Harris 's name .
Parsing [sent. 17602 len. 16]: ` Have a little -- ' John was at a loss what to call it .
Parsing [sent. 17603 len. 7]: ` Tea , ' suggested Martin .
Parsing [sent. 17604 len. 11]: ` It ai n't tea , ' said Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 17605 len. 13]: ` Physic of some sort , I suppose , ' cried John .
Parsing [sent. 17606 len. 6]: ` Have a little . '
Parsing [sent. 17607 len. 10]: Mrs Gamp was prevailed upon to take a glassful .
Parsing [sent. 17608 len. 22]: ` On condition , ' she passionately observed , ` as Betsey never has another stroke of work from me . '
Parsing [sent. 17609 len. 8]: ` Certainly not , ' said John .
Parsing [sent. 17610 len. 10]: ` She shall never help to nurse ME . '
Parsing [sent. 17611 len. 35]: ` To think , ' said Mrs Gamp , ` as she should ever have helped to nuss that friend of yourn , and been so near of hearing things that -- Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 17612 len. 5]: John looked at Martin .
Parsing [sent. 17613 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 17614 len. 11]: ` That was a narrow escape , Mrs Gamp . '
Parsing [sent. 17615 len. 6]: ` Narrer , in-deed ! '
Parsing [sent. 17616 len. 3]: she returned .
Parsing [sent. 17617 len. 27]: ` It was only my having the night , and hearin ' of him in his wanderins ; and her the day , that saved it .
Parsing [sent. 17618 len. 21]: Wot would she have said and done , if she had know 'd what I know ; that perfeejus wretch !
Parsing [sent. 17619 len. 8]: Yet , oh good gracious me ! '
Parsing [sent. 17620 len. 38]: cried Mrs Gamp , trampling on the floor , in the absence of Mrs Prig , ` that I should hear from that same woman 's lips what I have heerd her speak of Mrs Harris ! '
Parsing [sent. 17621 len. 8]: ` Never mind , ' said John .
Parsing [sent. 17622 len. 9]: ` You know it is not true . '
Parsing [sent. 17623 len. 6]: ` Is n't true ! '
Parsing [sent. 17624 len. 4]: cried Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 17625 len. 3]: ` True !
Parsing [sent. 17626 len. 140]: Do n't I know as that dear woman is expecting of me at this minnit , Mr Westlock , and is a-lookin ' out of window down the street , with little Tommy Harris in her arms , as calls me his own Gammy , and truly calls , for bless the mottled little legs of that there precious child -LRB- like Canterbury Brawn his own dear father says , which so they are -RRB- his own I have been , ever since I found him , Mr Westlock , with his small red worsted shoe a-gurglin ' in his throat , where he had put it in his play , a chick , wile they was leavin ' of him on the floor a-lookin ' for it through the ouse and him a-choakin ' sweetly in the parlour !
Parsing [sent. 17627 len. 28]: Oh , Betsey Prig , what wickedness you 've showed this night , but never shall you darken Sairey 's doors agen , you twining serpiant ! '
Parsing [sent. 17628 len. 12]: ` You were always so kind to her , too ! '
Parsing [sent. 17629 len. 5]: said John , consolingly .
Parsing [sent. 17630 len. 7]: ` That 's the cutting part .
Parsing [sent. 17631 len. 26]: That 's where it hurts me , Mr Westlock , ' Mrs Gamp replied ; holding out her glass unconsciously , while Martin filled it .
Parsing [sent. 17632 len. 10]: ` Chosen to help you with Mr Lewsome ! '
Parsing [sent. 17633 len. 3]: said John .
Parsing [sent. 17634 len. 10]: ` Chosen to help you with Mr Chuffey ! '
Parsing [sent. 17635 len. 14]: ` Chose once , but chose no more , ' cried Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 17636 len. 11]: ` No pardnership with Betsey Prig agen , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 17637 len. 9]: ` No , no , ' said John .
Parsing [sent. 17638 len. 8]: ` That would never do . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17639 len. 29]: I do n't know as it ever would have done , sir , ' Mrs Gamp replied , with a solemnity peculiar to a certain stage of intoxication .
Parsing [sent. 17640 len. 36]: ` Now that the marks , ' by which Mrs Gamp is supposed to have meant mask , ` is off that creetur 's face , I do not think it ever would have done .
Parsing [sent. 17641 len. 29]: There are reagions in families for keeping things a secret , Mr Westlock , and havin ' only them about you as you knows you can repoge in .
Parsing [sent. 17642 len. 23]: Who could repoge in Betsey Prig , arter her words of Mrs Harris , setting in that chair afore my eyes ! '
Parsing [sent. 17643 len. 11]: ` Quite true , ' said John ; ` quite .
Parsing [sent. 17644 len. 14]: I hope you have time to find another assistant , Mrs Gamp ? '
Parsing [sent. 17645 len. 20]: Between her indignation and the teapot , her powers of comprehending what was said to her began to fail .
Parsing [sent. 17646 len. 38]: She looked at John with tearful eyes , and murmuring the well-remembered name which Mrs Prig had challenged -- as if it were a talisman against all earthly sorrows -- seemed to wander in her mind . '
Parsing [sent. 17647 len. 18]: I hope , ' repeated John , ` that you have time to find another assistant ? '
Parsing [sent. 17648 len. 29]: ` Which short it is , indeed , ' cried Mrs Gamp , turning up her languid eyes , and clasping Mr Westlock 's wrist with matronly affection .
Parsing [sent. 17649 len. 13]: ` To-morrow evenin ' , sir , I waits upon his friends .
Parsing [sent. 17650 len. 10]: Mr Chuzzlewit apinted it from nine to ten . '
Parsing [sent. 17651 len. 17]: ` From nine to ten , ' said John , with a significant glance at Martin .
Parsing [sent. 17652 len. 14]: ` and then Mr Chuffey retires into safe keeping , does he ? '
Parsing [sent. 17653 len. 22]: ` He needs to be kep safe , I do assure you , ' Mrs Gamp replied with a mysterious air .
Parsing [sent. 17654 len. 14]: ` Other people besides me has had a happy deliverance from Betsey Prig .
Parsing [sent. 17655 len. 7]: I little know 'd that woman .
Parsing [sent. 17656 len. 8]: She 'd have let it out ! '
Parsing [sent. 17657 len. 12]: ` Let HIM out , you mean , ' said John .
Parsing [sent. 17658 len. 5]: ` Do I ! '
Parsing [sent. 17659 len. 4]: retorted Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 17660 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 17661 len. 30]: The severely ironical character of this reply was strengthened by a very slow nod , and a still slower drawing down of the corners of Mrs Gamp 's mouth .
Parsing [sent. 17662 len. 30]: She added with extreme stateliness of manner after indulging in a short doze : ` But I am a-keepin ' of you gentlemen , and time is precious . '
Parsing [sent. 17663 len. 69]: Mingling with that delusion of the teapot which inspired her with the belief that they wanted her to go somewhere immediately , a shrewd avoidance of any further reference to the topics into which she had lately strayed , Mrs Gamp rose ; and putting away the teapot in its accustomed place , and locking the cupboard with much gravity proceeded to attire herself for a professional visit .
Parsing [sent. 17664 len. 44]: This preparation was easily made , as it required nothing more than the snuffy black bonnet , the snuffy black shawl , the pattens and the indispensable umbrella , without which neither a lying-in nor a laying-out could by any possibility be attempted .
Parsing [sent. 17665 len. 25]: When Mrs Gamp had invested herself with these appendages she returned to her chair , and sitting down again , declared herself quite ready .
Parsing [sent. 17666 len. 26]: ` It 's a ` appiness to know as one can benefit the poor sweet creetur , ' she observed , ` I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 17667 len. 7]: It is n't all as can .
Parsing [sent. 17668 len. 9]: The torters Betsey Prig inflicts is frightful ! '
Parsing [sent. 17669 len. 32]: Closing her eyes as she made this remark , in the acuteness of her commiseration for Betsey 's patients , she forgot to open them again until she dropped a patten .
Parsing [sent. 17670 len. 28]: Her nap was also broken at intervals like the fabled slumbers of Friar Bacon , by the dropping of the other patten , and of the umbrella .
Parsing [sent. 17671 len. 15]: But when she had got rid of those incumbrances , her sleep was peaceful .
Parsing [sent. 17672 len. 36]: The two young men looked at each other , ludicrously enough ; and Martin , stifling his disposition to laugh , whispered in John Westlock 's ear , ` What shall we do now ? '
Parsing [sent. 17673 len. 8]: ` Stay here , ' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 17674 len. 14]: Mrs Gamp was heard to murmur ` Mrs Harris ' in her sleep .
Parsing [sent. 17675 len. 31]: ` Rely upon it , ' whispered John , looking cautiously towards her , ` that you shall question this old clerk , though you go as Mrs Harris herself .
Parsing [sent. 17676 len. 39]: We know quite enough to carry her our own way now , at all events ; thanks to this quarrel , which confirms the old saying that when rogues fall out , honest people get what they want .
Parsing [sent. 17677 len. 17]: Let Jonas Chuzzlewit look to himself ; and let her sleep as long as she likes .
Parsing [sent. 17678 len. 10]: We shall gain our end in good time . '
Parsing [sent. 17679 len. 109]: CHAPTER FIFTY SURPRISES TOM PINCH VERY MUCH , AND SHOWS HOW CERTAIN CONFIDENCES PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND HIS SISTER It was the next evening ; and Tom and his sister were sitting together before tea , talking , in their usual quiet way , about a great many things , but not at all about Lewsome 's story or anything connected with it ; for John Westlock -- really John , for so young a man , was one of the most considerate fellows in the world -- had particularly advised Tom not to mention it to his sister just yet , in case it should disquiet her .
Parsing [sent. 17680 len. 49]: ` And I would n't , Tom , ' he said , with a little hesitation , ' I would n't have a shadow on her happy face , or an uneasy thought in her gentle heart , for all the wealth and honours of the universe ! '
Parsing [sent. 17681 len. 9]: Really John was uncommonly kind ; extraordinarily kind .
Parsing [sent. 17682 len. 21]: If he had been her father , Tom said , he could not have taken a greater interest in her .
Parsing [sent. 17683 len. 22]: But although Tom and his sister were extremely conversational , they were less lively , and less cheerful , than usual .
Parsing [sent. 17684 len. 22]: Tom had no idea that this originated with Ruth , but took it for granted that he was rather dull himself .
Parsing [sent. 17685 len. 23]: In truth he was ; for the lightest cloud upon the Heaven of her quiet mind , cast its shadow upon Tom .
Parsing [sent. 17686 len. 11]: And there was a cloud on little Ruth that evening .
Parsing [sent. 17687 len. 4]: Yes , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 17688 len. 33]: When Tom was looking in another direction , her bright eyes , stealing on towards his face , would sparkle still more brightly than their custom was , and then grow dim .
Parsing [sent. 17689 len. 129]: When Tom was silent , looking out upon the summer weather , she would sometimes make a hasty movement , as if she were about to throw herself upon his neck ; then check the impulse , and when he looked round , show a laughing face , and speak to him very merrily ; when she had anything to give Tom , or had any excuse for coming near him , she would flutter about him , and lay her bashful hand upon his shoulder , and not be willing to withdraw it ; and would show by all such means that there was something on her heart which in her great love she longed to say to him , but had not the courage to utter .
Parsing [sent. 17690 len. 35]: So they were sitting , she with her work before her , but not working , and Tom with his book beside him , but not reading , when Martin knocked at the door .
Parsing [sent. 17691 len. 22]: Anticipating who it was , Tom went to open it ; and he and Martin came back into the room together .
Parsing [sent. 17692 len. 18]: Tom looked surprised , for in answer to his cordial greeting Martin had hardly spoken a word .
Parsing [sent. 17693 len. 34]: Ruth also saw that there was something strange in the manner of their visitor , and raised her eyes inquiringly to Tom 's face , as if she were seeking an explanation there .
Parsing [sent. 17694 len. 14]: Tom shook his head , and made the same mute appeal to Martin .
Parsing [sent. 17695 len. 18]: Martin did not sit down but walked up to the window , and stood there looking out .
Parsing [sent. 17696 len. 21]: He turned round after a few moments to speak , but hastily averted his head again , without doing so .
Parsing [sent. 17697 len. 8]: ` What has happened , Martin ? '
Parsing [sent. 17698 len. 4]: Tom anxiously inquired .
Parsing [sent. 17699 len. 13]: ` My dear fellow , what bad news do you bring ? '
Parsing [sent. 17700 len. 6]: ` Oh , Tom ! '
Parsing [sent. 17701 len. 10]: replied Martin , in a tone of deep reproach .
Parsing [sent. 17702 len. 24]: ` To hear you feign that interest in anything that happens to me , hurts me even more than your ungenerous dealing . '
Parsing [sent. 17703 len. 5]: ` My ungenerous dealing !
Parsing [sent. 17704 len. 2]: Martin !
Parsing [sent. 17705 len. 9]: My -- ' Tom could say no more .
Parsing [sent. 17706 len. 38]: ` How could you , Tom , how could you suffer me to thank you so fervently and sincerely for your friendship ; and not tell me , like a man , that you had deserted me !
Parsing [sent. 17707 len. 6]: Was it true , Tom !
Parsing [sent. 17708 len. 4]: Was it honest !
Parsing [sent. 17709 len. 37]: Was it worthy of what you used to be -- of what I am sure you used to be -- to tempt me , when you had turned against me , into pouring out my heart !
Parsing [sent. 17710 len. 5]: Oh , Tom ! '
Parsing [sent. 17711 len. 81]: His tone was one of such strong injury and yet of so much grief for the loss of a friend he had trusted in -- it expressed such high past love for Tom , and so much sorrow and compassion for his supposed unworthiness -- that Tom , for a moment , put his hand before his face , and had no more power of justifying himself , than if he had been a monster of deceit and falsehood . '
Parsing [sent. 17712 len. 37]: I protest , as I must die , ' said Martin , ` that I grieve over the loss of what I thought you ; and have no anger in the recollection of my own injuries .
Parsing [sent. 17713 len. 30]: It is only at such a time , and after such a discovery , that we know the full measure of our old regard for the subject of it .
Parsing [sent. 17714 len. 37]: I swear , little as I showed it -- little as I know I showed it -- that when I had the least consideration for you , Tom , I loved you like a brother . '
Parsing [sent. 17715 len. 32]: Tom was composed by this time , and might have been the Spirit of Truth , in a homely dress -- it very often wears a homely dress , thank God !
Parsing [sent. 17716 len. 7]: -- when he replied to him .
Parsing [sent. 17717 len. 30]: ` Martin , ' he said , ' I do n't know what is in your mind , or who has abused it , or by what extraordinary means .
Parsing [sent. 17718 len. 6]: But the means are false .
Parsing [sent. 17719 len. 13]: There is no truth whatever in the impression under which you labour .
Parsing [sent. 17720 len. 24]: It is a delusion from first to last ; and I warn you that you will deeply regret the wrong you do me .
Parsing [sent. 17721 len. 16]: I can honestly say that I have been true to you , and to myself .
Parsing [sent. 17722 len. 8]: You will be very sorry for this .
Parsing [sent. 17723 len. 14]: Indeed , you will be very sorry for it , Martin . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17724 len. 13]: I AM sorry , ' returned Martin , shaking his head . '
Parsing [sent. 17725 len. 19]: I think I never knew what it was to be sorry in my heart , until now . '
Parsing [sent. 17726 len. 67]: ` At least , ' said Tom , ` if I had always been what you charge me with being now , and had never had a place in your regard , but had always been despised by you , and had always deserved it , you should tell me in what you have found me to be treacherous ; and on what grounds you proceed .
Parsing [sent. 17727 len. 30]: I do not intreat you , therefore , to give me that satisfaction as a favour , Martin , but I ask it of you as a right . '
Parsing [sent. 17728 len. 12]: ` My own eyes are my witnesses , ' returned Martin .
Parsing [sent. 17729 len. 8]: ` Am I to believe them ? '
Parsing [sent. 17730 len. 9]: ` No , ' said Tom , calmly .
Parsing [sent. 17731 len. 8]: ` Not if they accuse me . '
Parsing [sent. 17732 len. 5]: ` Your own words .
Parsing [sent. 17733 len. 8]: Your own manner , ' pursued Martin .
Parsing [sent. 17734 len. 8]: ` Am I to believe THEM ? '
Parsing [sent. 17735 len. 9]: ` No , ' replied Tom , calmly .
Parsing [sent. 17736 len. 7]: ` Not if they accuse me .
Parsing [sent. 17737 len. 7]: But they never have accused me .
Parsing [sent. 17738 len. 32]: Whoever has perverted them to such a purpose , has wronged me almost as cruelly ' -- his calmness rather failed him here -- ` as you have done . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17739 len. 30]: I came here , ' said Martin ; ` and I appeal to your good sister to hear me -- ' ` Not to her , ' interrupted Tom .
Parsing [sent. 17740 len. 9]: ` Pray , do not appeal to her .
Parsing [sent. 17741 len. 7]: She will never believe you . '
Parsing [sent. 17742 len. 14]: He drew her arm through his own , as he said it . '
Parsing [sent. 17743 len. 7]: I believe it , Tom ! '
Parsing [sent. 17744 len. 14]: ` No , no , ' cried Tom , ` of course not .
Parsing [sent. 17745 len. 4]: I said so .
Parsing [sent. 17746 len. 8]: Why , tut , tut , tut .
Parsing [sent. 17747 len. 10]: What a silly little thing you are ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 17748 len. 19]: I never meant , ' said Martin , hastily , ` to appeal to you against your brother .
Parsing [sent. 17749 len. 9]: Do not think me so unmanly and unkind .
Parsing [sent. 17750 len. 33]: I merely appealed to you to hear my declaration , that I came here for no purpose of reproach -- I have not one reproach to vent -- but in deep regret .
Parsing [sent. 17751 len. 52]: You could not know in what bitterness of regret , unless you knew how often I have thought of Tom ; how long in almost hopeless circumstances , I have looked forward to the better estimation of his friendship ; and how steadfastly I have believed and trusted in him . '
Parsing [sent. 17752 len. 18]: ` Tut , tut , ' said Tom , stopping her as she was about to speak .
Parsing [sent. 17753 len. 5]: ` He is mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 17754 len. 4]: He is deceived .
Parsing [sent. 17755 len. 5]: Why should you mind ?
Parsing [sent. 17756 len. 11]: He is sure to be set right at last . '
Parsing [sent. 17757 len. 11]: ` Heaven bless the day that sets me right ! '
Parsing [sent. 17758 len. 11]: cried Martin , ` if it could ever come ! '
Parsing [sent. 17759 len. 4]: ` Amen ! '
Parsing [sent. 17760 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 17761 len. 6]: ` And it will ! '
Parsing [sent. 17762 len. 29]: Martin paused , and then said in a still milder voice : ` You have chosen for yourself , Tom , and will be relieved by our parting .
Parsing [sent. 17763 len. 7]: It is not an angry one .
Parsing [sent. 17764 len. 21]: There is no anger on my side -- ' ` There is none on mine , ' said Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 17765 len. 16]: -- It is merely what you have brought about , and worked to bring about .
Parsing [sent. 17766 len. 10]: I say again , you have chosen for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 17767 len. 27]: You have made the choice that might have been expected in most people situated as you are , but which I did not expect in you .
Parsing [sent. 17768 len. 15]: For that , perhaps , I should blame my own judgment more than you .
Parsing [sent. 17769 len. 29]: There is wealth and favour worth having , on one side ; and there is the worthless friendship of an abandoned , struggling fellow , on the other .
Parsing [sent. 17770 len. 20]: You were free to make your election , and you made it ; and the choice was not difficult .
Parsing [sent. 17771 len. 78]: But those who have not the courage to resist such temptations , should have the courage to avow what they have yielded to them ; and I DO blame you for this , Tom : that you received me with a show of warmth , encouraged me to be frank and plain-spoken , tempted me to confide in you , and professed that you were able to be mine ; when you had sold yourself to others .
Parsing [sent. 17772 len. 70]: I do not believe , ' said Martin , with emotion -- ` hear me say it from my heart -- I CAN NOT believe , Tom , now that I am standing face to face with you , that it would have been in your nature to do me any serious harm , even though I had not discovered , by chance , in whose employment you were .
Parsing [sent. 17773 len. 63]: But I should have encumbered you ; I should have led you into more double-dealing ; I should have hazarded your retaining the favour for which you have paid so high a price , bartering away your former self ; and it is best for both of us that I have found out what you so much desired to keep secret . '
Parsing [sent. 17774 len. 38]: ` Be just , ' said Tom ; who , had not removed his mild gaze from Martin 's face since the commencement of this last address ; ` be just even in your injustice , Martin .
Parsing [sent. 17775 len. 3]: You forget .
Parsing [sent. 17776 len. 12]: You have not yet told me what your accusation is ! '
Parsing [sent. 17777 len. 6]: ` Why should I ? '
Parsing [sent. 17778 len. 13]: returned Martin , waving his hand , and moving towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 17779 len. 32]: ` You could not know it the better for my dwelling on it , and though it would be really none the worse , it might seem to me to be .
Parsing [sent. 17780 len. 4]: No , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 17781 len. 7]: Bygones shall be bygones between us .
Parsing [sent. 17782 len. 43]: I can take leave of you at this moment , and in this place -- in which you are so amiable and so good -- as heartily , if not as cheerfully , as ever I have done since we first met .
Parsing [sent. 17783 len. 8]: All good go with you , Tom !
Parsing [sent. 17784 len. 10]: -- I -- ' ` You leave me so ?
Parsing [sent. 17785 len. 10]: You can leave me so , can you ? '
Parsing [sent. 17786 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 17787 len. 13]: ` I -- you -- you have chosen for yourself , Tom !
Parsing [sent. 17788 len. 15]: I -- I hope it was a rash choice , ' Martin faltered . '
Parsing [sent. 17789 len. 5]: I think it was .
Parsing [sent. 17790 len. 6]: I am sure it was !
Parsing [sent. 17791 len. 3]: Good-bye ! '
Parsing [sent. 17792 len. 5]: And he was gone .
Parsing [sent. 17793 len. 16]: Tom led his little sister to her chair , and sat down in his own .
Parsing [sent. 17794 len. 13]: He took his book , and read , or seemed to read .
Parsing [sent. 17795 len. 22]: Presently he said aloud , turning a leaf as he spoke : ` He will be very sorry for this . '
Parsing [sent. 17796 len. 14]: And a tear stole down his face , and dropped upon the page .
Parsing [sent. 17797 len. 17]: Ruth nestled down beside him on her knees , and clasped her arms about his neck .
Parsing [sent. 17798 len. 5]: ` No , Tom !
Parsing [sent. 17799 len. 4]: No , no !
Parsing [sent. 17800 len. 3]: Be comforted !
Parsing [sent. 17801 len. 5]: Dear Tom ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 17802 len. 10]: I am quite -- comforted , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 17803 len. 8]: ` It will be set right . '
Parsing [sent. 17804 len. 9]: ` Such a cruel , bad return ! '
Parsing [sent. 17805 len. 3]: cried Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 17806 len. 9]: ` No , no , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 17807 len. 5]: ` He believes it .
Parsing [sent. 17808 len. 6]: I can not imagine why .
Parsing [sent. 17809 len. 8]: But it will be set right . '
Parsing [sent. 17810 len. 19]: More closely yet , she nestled down about him ; and wept as if her heart would break .
Parsing [sent. 17811 len. 4]: ` Do n't .
Parsing [sent. 17812 len. 7]: Do n't , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 17813 len. 12]: ` Why do you hide your face , my dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 17814 len. 14]: Then in a burst of tears , it all broke out at last .
Parsing [sent. 17815 len. 13]: ` Oh Tom , dear Tom , I know your secret heart .
Parsing [sent. 17816 len. 15]: I have found it out ; you could n't hide the truth from me .
Parsing [sent. 17817 len. 7]: Why did n't you tell me ?
Parsing [sent. 17818 len. 14]: I am sure I could have made you happier , if you had !
Parsing [sent. 17819 len. 10]: You love her , Tom , so dearly ! '
Parsing [sent. 17820 len. 35]: Tom made a motion with his hand as if he would have put his sister hurriedly away ; but it clasped upon hers , and all his little history was written in the action .
Parsing [sent. 17821 len. 10]: All its pathetic eloquence was in the silent touch .
Parsing [sent. 17822 len. 78]: ` In spite of that , ' said Ruth , ` you have been so faithful and so good , dear ; in spite of that , you have been so true and self-denying , and have struggled with yourself ; in spite of that , you have been so gentle , and so kind , and even-tempered , that I have never seen you give a hasty look , or heard you say one irritable word .
Parsing [sent. 17823 len. 12]: In spite of all , you have been so cruelly mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 17824 len. 13]: Oh Tom , dear Tom , will THIS be set right too !
Parsing [sent. 17825 len. 5]: Will it , Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 17826 len. 25]: Will you always have this sorrow in your breast ; you who deserve to be so happy ; or is there any hope ? '
Parsing [sent. 17827 len. 40]: And still she hid her face from Tom , and clasped him round the neck , and wept for him , and poured out all her woman 's heart and soul in the relief and pain of this disclosure .
Parsing [sent. 17828 len. 28]: It was not very long before she and Tom were sitting side by side , and she was looking with an earnest quietness in Tom 's face .
Parsing [sent. 17829 len. 28]: Then Tom spoke to her thus , cheerily , though gravely : ' I am very glad , my dear , that this has passed between us .
Parsing [sent. 17830 len. 32]: Not because it assures me of your tender affection -LRB- for I was well assured of that before -RRB- , but because it relieves my mind of a great weight . '
Parsing [sent. 17831 len. 19]: Tom 's eyes glistened when he spoke of her affection ; and he kissed her on the cheek .
Parsing [sent. 17832 len. 52]: ` My dear girl , ' said Tom ; ` with whatever feeling I regard her ' -- they seemed to avoid the name by mutual consent -- ' I have long ago -- I am sure I may say from the very first -- looked upon it as a dream .
Parsing [sent. 17833 len. 18]: As something that might possibly have happened under very different circumstances , but which can never be .
Parsing [sent. 17834 len. 5]: Now , tell me .
Parsing [sent. 17835 len. 8]: What would you have set right ? '
Parsing [sent. 17836 len. 30]: She gave Tom such a significant little look , that he was obliged to take it for an answer whether he would or no ; and to go on .
Parsing [sent. 17837 len. 31]: ` By her own choice and free consent , my love , she is betrothed to Martin ; and was , long before either of them knew of my existence .
Parsing [sent. 17838 len. 9]: You would have her betrothed to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 17839 len. 8]: ` Yes , ' she said directly .
Parsing [sent. 17840 len. 20]: ` Yes , ' rejoined Tom , ` but that might be setting it wrong , instead of right .
Parsing [sent. 17841 len. 37]: Do you think , ' said Tom , with a grave smile , ` that even if she had never seen him , it is very likely she would have fallen in love with Me ? '
Parsing [sent. 17842 len. 8]: ` Why not , dear Tom ? '
Parsing [sent. 17843 len. 9]: Tom shook his head , and smiled again .
Parsing [sent. 17844 len. 64]: ` You think of me , Ruth , ' said Tom , ` and it is very natural that you should , as if I were a character in a book ; and you make it a sort of poetical justice that I should , by some impossible means or other , come , at last , to marry the person I love .
Parsing [sent. 17845 len. 25]: But there is a much higher justice than poetical justice , my dear , and it does not order events upon the same principle .
Parsing [sent. 17846 len. 54]: Accordingly , people who read about heroes in books , and choose to make heroes of themselves out of books , consider it a very fine thing to be discontented and gloomy , and misanthropical , and perhaps a little blasphemous , because they can not have everything ordered for their individual accommodation .
Parsing [sent. 17847 len. 14]: Would you like me to become one of that sort of people ? '
Parsing [sent. 17848 len. 5]: ` No , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 17849 len. 25]: But still I know , ' she added timidly , ` that this is a sorrow to you in your own better way . '
Parsing [sent. 17850 len. 7]: Tom thought of disputing the position .
Parsing [sent. 17851 len. 14]: But it would have been mere folly , and he gave it up .
Parsing [sent. 17852 len. 22]: ` My dear , ' said Tom , ' I will repay your affection with the Truth and all the Truth .
Parsing [sent. 17853 len. 7]: It is a sorrow to me .
Parsing [sent. 17854 len. 17]: I have proved it to be so sometimes , though I have always striven against it .
Parsing [sent. 17855 len. 52]: But somebody who is precious to you may die , and you may dream that you are in heaven with the departed spirit , and you may find it a sorrow to wake to the life on earth , which is no harder to be borne than when you fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 17856 len. 34]: It is sorrowful to me to contemplate my dream which I always knew was a dream , even when it first presented itself ; but the realities about me are not to blame .
Parsing [sent. 17857 len. 8]: They are the same as they were .
Parsing [sent. 17858 len. 37]: My sister , my sweet companion , who makes this place so dear , is she less devoted to me , Ruth , than she would have been , if this vision had never troubled me ?
Parsing [sent. 17859 len. 24]: My old friend John , who might so easily have treated me with coldness and neglect , is he less cordial to me ?
Parsing [sent. 17860 len. 12]: The world about me , is there less good in that ?
Parsing [sent. 17861 len. 65]: Are my words to be harsh and my looks to be sour , and is my heart to grow cold , because there has fallen in my way a good and beautiful creature , who but for the selfish regret that I can not call her my own , would , like all other good and beautiful creatures , make me happier and better !
Parsing [sent. 17862 len. 6]: No , my dear sister .
Parsing [sent. 17863 len. 7]: No , ' said Tom stoutly .
Parsing [sent. 17864 len. 48]: ` Remembering all my means of happiness , I hardly dare to call this lurking something a sorrow ; but whatever name it may justly bear , I thank Heaven that it renders me more sensible of affection and attachment , and softens me in fifty ways .
Parsing [sent. 17865 len. 4]: Not less happy .
Parsing [sent. 17866 len. 7]: Not less happy , Ruth ! '
Parsing [sent. 17867 len. 17]: She could not speak to him , but she loved him , as he well deserved .
Parsing [sent. 17868 len. 9]: Even as he deserved , she loved him .
Parsing [sent. 17869 len. 32]: ` She will open Martin 's eyes , ' said Tom , with a glow of pride , ` and that -LRB- which is indeed wrong -RRB- will be set right .
Parsing [sent. 17870 len. 14]: Nothing will persuade her , I know , that I have betrayed him .
Parsing [sent. 17871 len. 17]: It will be set right through her , and he will be very sorry for it .
Parsing [sent. 17872 len. 16]: Our secret , Ruth , is our own , and lives and dies with us .
Parsing [sent. 17873 len. 35]: I do n't believe I ever could have told it you , ' said Tom , with a smile , ` but how glad I am to think you have found it out ! '
Parsing [sent. 17874 len. 14]: They had never taken such a pleasant walk as they took that night .
Parsing [sent. 17875 len. 42]: Tom told her all so freely and so simply , and was so desirous to return her tenderness with his fullest confidence , that they prolonged it far beyond their usual hour , and sat up late when they came home .
Parsing [sent. 17876 len. 57]: And when they parted for the night there was such a tranquil , beautiful expression in Tom 's face , that she could not bear to shut it out , but going back on tiptoe to his chamber-door , looked in and stood there till he saw her , and then embracing him again , withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 17877 len. 20]: And in her prayers and in her sleep -- good times to be remembered with such fervour , Tom !
Parsing [sent. 17878 len. 6]: -- his name was uppermost .
Parsing [sent. 17879 len. 26]: When he was left alone , Tom pondered very much on this discovery of hers , and greatly wondered what had led her to it .
Parsing [sent. 17880 len. 15]: ` Because , ' thought Tom , ' I have been so very careful .
Parsing [sent. 17881 len. 37]: It was foolish and unnecessary in me , as I clearly see now , when I am so relieved by her knowing it ; but I have been so very careful to conceal it from her .
Parsing [sent. 17882 len. 32]: Of course I knew that she was intelligent and quick , and for that reason was more upon my guard ; but I was not in the least prepared for this .
Parsing [sent. 17883 len. 10]: I am sure her discovery has been sudden too .
Parsing [sent. 17884 len. 4]: Dear me ! '
Parsing [sent. 17885 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 17886 len. 11]: ` It 's a most singular instance of penetration ! '
Parsing [sent. 17887 len. 10]: Tom could not get it out of his head .
Parsing [sent. 17888 len. 12]: There it was , when his head was on his pillow .
Parsing [sent. 17889 len. 15]: ` How she trembled when she began to tell me she knew it ! '
Parsing [sent. 17890 len. 18]: thought Tom , recalling all the little incidents and circumstances ; ` and how her face flushed !
Parsing [sent. 17891 len. 5]: But that was natural !
Parsing [sent. 17892 len. 5]: Oh , quite natural !
Parsing [sent. 17893 len. 7]: That needs no accounting for . '
Parsing [sent. 17894 len. 8]: Tom little thought how natural it was .
Parsing [sent. 17895 len. 29]: Tom little knew that there was that in Ruth 's own heart , but newly set there , which had helped her to the reading of his mystery .
Parsing [sent. 17896 len. 4]: Ah , Tom !
Parsing [sent. 17897 len. 18]: He did n't understand the whispers of the Temple Fountain , though he passed it every day .
Parsing [sent. 17898 len. 11]: Who so lively and cheerful as busy Ruth next morning !
Parsing [sent. 17899 len. 26]: Her early tap at Tom 's door , and her light foot outside , would have been music to him though she had not spoken .
Parsing [sent. 17900 len. 32]: But she said it was the brightest morning ever seen ; and so it was ; and if it had been otherwise , she would have made it so to Tom .
Parsing [sent. 17901 len. 36]: She was ready with his neat breakfast when he went downstairs , and had her bonnet ready for the early walk , and was so full of news , that Tom was lost in wonder .
Parsing [sent. 17902 len. 14]: She might have been up all night , collecting it for his entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 17903 len. 133]: There was Mr Nadgett not come home yet , and there was bread down a penny a loaf , and there was twice as much strength in this tea as in the last , and the milk-woman 's husband had come out of the hospital cured , and the curly-headed child over the way had been lost all yesterday , and she was going to make all sorts of preserves in a desperate hurry , and there happened to be a saucepan in the house which was the very saucepan for the purpose ; and she knew all about the last book Tom had brought home , all through , though it was a teaser to read ; and she had so much to tell him that she had finished breakfast first .
Parsing [sent. 17904 len. 55]: Then she had her little bonnet on , and the tea and sugar locked up , and the keys in her reticule , and the flower , as usual , in Tom 's coat , and was in all respects quite ready to accompany him , before Tom knew she had begun to prepare .
Parsing [sent. 17905 len. 34]: And in short , as Tom said , with a confidence in his own assertion which amounted to a defiance of the public in general , there never was such a little woman .
Parsing [sent. 17906 len. 5]: She made Tom talkative .
Parsing [sent. 17907 len. 7]: It was impossible to resist her .
Parsing [sent. 17908 len. 32]: She put such enticing questions to him ; about books , and about dates of churches , and about organs and about the Temple , and about all kinds of things .
Parsing [sent. 17909 len. 35]: Indeed , she lightened the way -LRB- and Tom 's heart with it -RRB- to that degree , that the Temple looked quite blank and solitary when he parted from her at the gate .
Parsing [sent. 17910 len. 21]: ` No Mr Fips 's friend to-day , I suppose , ' thought Tom , as he ascended the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 17911 len. 23]: Not yet , at any rate , for the door was closed as usual , and Tom opened it with his key .
Parsing [sent. 17912 len. 34]: He had got the books into perfect order now , and had mended the torn leaves , and had pasted up the broken backs , and substituted neat labels for the worn-out letterings .
Parsing [sent. 17913 len. 13]: It looked a different place , it was so orderly and neat .
Parsing [sent. 17914 len. 24]: Tom felt some pride in comtemplating the change he had wrought , though there was no one to approve or disapprove of it .
Parsing [sent. 17915 len. 50]: He was at present occupied in making a fair copy of his draught of the catalogue ; on which , as there was no hurry , he was painfully concentrating all the ingenious and laborious neatness he had ever expended on map or plan in Mr Pecksniff 's workroom .
Parsing [sent. 17916 len. 43]: It was a very marvel of a catalogue ; for Tom sometimes thought he was really getting his money too easily , and he had determined within himself that this document should take a little of his superfluous leisure out of him .
Parsing [sent. 17917 len. 29]: So with pens and ruler , and compasses and india-rubber , and pencil , and black ink , and red ink , Tom worked away all the morning .
Parsing [sent. 17918 len. 46]: He thought a good deal about Martin , and their interview of yesterday , and would have been far easier in his mind if he could have resolved to confide it to his friend John , and to have taken his opinion on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 17919 len. 55]: But besides that he knew what John 's boiling indignation would be , he bethought himself that he was helping Martin now in a matter of great moment , and that to deprive the latter of his assistance at such a crisis of affairs , would be to inflict a serious injury upon him .
Parsing [sent. 17920 len. 17]: ` So I 'll keep it to myself , ' said Tom , with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 17921 len. 9]: ` I 'll keep it to myself . '
Parsing [sent. 17922 len. 39]: And to work he went again , more assiduously than ever , with the pens , and the ruler , and the india-rubber , and the pencils , and the red ink , that he might forget it .
Parsing [sent. 17923 len. 21]: He had laboured away another hour or more , when he heard a footstep in the entry , down below .
Parsing [sent. 17924 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 17925 len. 27]: said Tom , looking towards the door ; ` time was , not long ago either , when that would have set me wondering and expecting .
Parsing [sent. 17926 len. 8]: But I have left off now . '
Parsing [sent. 17927 len. 9]: The footstep came on , up the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 17928 len. 13]: ` Thirty-six , thirty-seven , thirty-eight , ' said Tom , counting .
Parsing [sent. 17929 len. 6]: ` Now you 'll stop .
Parsing [sent. 17930 len. 9]: Nobody ever comes past the thirty-eighth stair . '
Parsing [sent. 17931 len. 19]: The person did , certainly , but only to take breath ; for up the footstep came again .
Parsing [sent. 17932 len. 10]: Forty , forty-one , forty-two , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 17933 len. 5]: The door stood open .
Parsing [sent. 17934 len. 13]: As the tread advanced , Tom looked impatiently and eagerly towards it .
Parsing [sent. 17935 len. 35]: When a figure came upon the landing , and arriving in the doorway , stopped and gazed at him , he rose up from his chair , and half believed he saw a spirit .
Parsing [sent. 17936 len. 4]: Old Martin Chuzzlewit !
Parsing [sent. 17937 len. 15]: The same whom he had left at Mr Pecksniff 's , weak and sinking !
Parsing [sent. 17938 len. 3]: The same ?
Parsing [sent. 17939 len. 40]: No , not the same , for this old man , though old , was strong , and leaned upon his stick with a vigorous hand , while with the other he signed to Tom to make no noise .
Parsing [sent. 17940 len. 37]: One glance at the resolute face , the watchful eye , the vigorous hand upon the staff , the triumphant purpose in the figure , and such a light broke in on Tom as blinded him .
Parsing [sent. 17941 len. 17]: ` You have expected me , ' said Martin , ' a long time . ' '
Parsing [sent. 17942 len. 22]: I was told that my employer would arrive soon , ' said Tom ; ` but -- ' ' I know .
Parsing [sent. 17943 len. 7]: You were ignorant who he was .
Parsing [sent. 17944 len. 5]: It was my desire .
Parsing [sent. 17945 len. 10]: I am glad it has been so well observed .
Parsing [sent. 17946 len. 10]: I intended to have been with you much sooner .
Parsing [sent. 17947 len. 7]: I thought the time had come .
Parsing [sent. 17948 len. 27]: I thought I could know no more , and no worse , of him , than I did on that day when I saw you last .
Parsing [sent. 17949 len. 6]: But I was wrong . '
Parsing [sent. 17950 len. 18]: He had by this time come up to Tom , and now he grasped his hand . '
Parsing [sent. 17951 len. 21]: I have lived in his house , Pinch , and had him fawning on me days and weeks and months .
Parsing [sent. 17952 len. 4]: You know it .
Parsing [sent. 17953 len. 13]: I have suffered him to treat me like his tool and instrument .
Parsing [sent. 17954 len. 10]: You know it ; you have seen me there .
Parsing [sent. 17955 len. 27]: I have undergone ten thousand times as much as I could have endured if I had been the miserable weak old man he took me for .
Parsing [sent. 17956 len. 4]: You know it .
Parsing [sent. 17957 len. 9]: I have seen him offer love to Mary .
Parsing [sent. 17958 len. 14]: You know it ; who better -- who better , my true heart !
Parsing [sent. 17959 len. 21]: I have had his base soul bare before me , day by day , and have not betrayed myself once .
Parsing [sent. 17960 len. 16]: I never could have undergone such torture but for looking forward to this time . '
Parsing [sent. 17961 len. 31]: He stopped , even in the passion of his speech -- if that can be called passion which was so resolute and steady -- to press Tom 's hand again .
Parsing [sent. 17962 len. 17]: Then he said , in great excitement : ` Close the door , close the door .
Parsing [sent. 17963 len. 14]: He will not be long after me , but may come too soon .
Parsing [sent. 17964 len. 31]: The time now drawing on , ' said the old man , hurriedly -- his eyes and whole face brightening as he spoke -- ` will make amends for all .
Parsing [sent. 17965 len. 16]: I would n't have him die or hang himself , for millions of golden pieces !
Parsing [sent. 17966 len. 5]: Close the door ! '
Parsing [sent. 17967 len. 16]: Tom did so ; hardly knowing yet whether he was awake or in a dream .
Parsing [sent. 17968 len. 47]: CHAPTER FIFTY -- ONE SHEDS NEW AND BRIGHTER LIGHT UPON THE VERY DARK PLACE ; AND CONTAINS THE SEQUEL OF THE ENTERPRISE OF MR JONAS AND HIS FRIEND The night had now come , when the old clerk was to be delivered over to his keepers .
Parsing [sent. 17969 len. 14]: In the midst of his guilty distractions , Jonas had not forgotten it .
Parsing [sent. 17970 len. 31]: It was a part of his guilty state of mind to remember it ; for on his persistence in the scheme depended one of his precautions for his own safety .
Parsing [sent. 17971 len. 31]: A hint , a word , from the old man , uttered at such a moment in attentive ears , might fire the train of suspicion , and destroy him .
Parsing [sent. 17972 len. 29]: His watchfulness of every avenue by which the discovery of his guilt might be approached , sharpened with his sense of the danger by which he was encompassed .
Parsing [sent. 17973 len. 38]: With murder on his soul , and its innumerable alarms and terrors dragging at him night and day , he would have repeated the crime , if he had seen a path of safety stretching out beyond .
Parsing [sent. 17974 len. 13]: It was in his punishment ; it was in his guilty condition .
Parsing [sent. 17975 len. 19]: The very deed which his fears rendered insupportable , his fears would have impelled him to commit again .
Parsing [sent. 17976 len. 17]: But keeping the old man close , according to his design , would serve his turn .
Parsing [sent. 17977 len. 27]: His purpose was to escape , when the first alarm and wonder had subsided ; and when he could make the attempt without awakening instant suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 17978 len. 25]: In the meanwhile these women would keep him quiet ; and if the talking humour came upon him , would not be easily startled .
Parsing [sent. 17979 len. 5]: He knew their trade .
Parsing [sent. 17980 len. 15]: Nor had he spoken idly when he said the old man should be gagged .
Parsing [sent. 17981 len. 19]: He had resolved to ensure his silence ; and he looked to the end , not the means .
Parsing [sent. 17982 len. 28]: He had been rough and rude and cruel to the old man all his life ; and violence was natural to his mind in connection with him .
Parsing [sent. 17983 len. 29]: ` He shall be gagged if he speaks , and pinioned if he writes , ' said Jonas , looking at him ; for they sat alone together .
Parsing [sent. 17984 len. 16]: ` He is mad enough for that ; I 'll go through with it ! '
Parsing [sent. 17985 len. 2]: Hush !
Parsing [sent. 17986 len. 3]: Still listening !
Parsing [sent. 17987 len. 4]: To every sound .
Parsing [sent. 17988 len. 13]: He had listened ever since , and it had not come yet .
Parsing [sent. 17989 len. 111]: The exposure of the Assurance office ; the flight of Crimple and Bullamy with the plunder , and among the rest , as he feared , with his own bill , which he had not found in the pocket-book of the murdered man , and which with Mr Pecksniff 's money had probably been remitted to one or other of those trusty friends for safe deposit at the banker 's ; his immense losses , and peril of being still called to account as a partner in the broken firm ; all these things rose in his mind at one time and always , but he could not contemplate them .
Parsing [sent. 17990 len. 44]: He was aware of their presence , and of the rage , discomfiture , and despair , they brought along with them ; but he thought -- of his own controlling power and direction he thought -- of the one dread question only .
Parsing [sent. 17991 len. 10]: When they would find the body in the wood .
Parsing [sent. 17992 len. 81]: He tried -- he had never left off trying -- not to forget it was there , for that was impossible , but to forget to weary himself by drawing vivid pictures of it in his fancy ; by going softly about it and about it among the leaves , approaching it nearer and nearer through a gap in the boughs , and startling the very flies that were thickly sprinkled all over it , like heaps of dried currants .
Parsing [sent. 17993 len. 54]: His mind was fixed and fastened on the discovery , for intelligence of which he listened intently to every cry and shout ; listened when any one came in or went out ; watched from the window the people who passed up and down the street ; mistrusted his own looks and words .
Parsing [sent. 17994 len. 30]: And the more his thoughts were set upon the discovery , the stronger was the fascination which attracted them to the thing itself ; lying alone in the wood .
Parsing [sent. 17995 len. 20]: He was for ever showing and presenting it , as it were , to every creature whom he saw .
Parsing [sent. 17996 len. 4]: ` Look here !
Parsing [sent. 17997 len. 6]: Do you know of this ?
Parsing [sent. 17998 len. 4]: Is it found ?
Parsing [sent. 17999 len. 6]: Do you suspect ME ? '
Parsing [sent. 18000 len. 57]: If he had been condemned to bear the body in his arms , and lay it down for recognition at the feet of every one he met , it could not have been more constantly with him , or a cause of more monotonous and dismal occupation than it was in this state of his mind .
Parsing [sent. 18001 len. 6]: Still he was not sorry .
Parsing [sent. 18002 len. 25]: It was no contrition or remorse for what he had done that moved him ; it was nothing but alarm for his own security .
Parsing [sent. 18003 len. 43]: The vague consciousness he possessed of having wrecked his fortune in the murderous venture , intensified his hatred and revenge , and made him set the greater store by what he had gained The man was dead ; nothing could undo that .
Parsing [sent. 18004 len. 10]: He felt a triumph yet , in the reflection .
Parsing [sent. 18005 len. 29]: He had kept a jealous watch on Chuffey ever since the deed ; seldom leaving him but on compulsion , and then for as short intervals as possible .
Parsing [sent. 18006 len. 6]: They were alone together now .
Parsing [sent. 18007 len. 13]: It was twilight , and the appointed time drew near at hand .
Parsing [sent. 18008 len. 8]: Jonas walked up and down the room .
Parsing [sent. 18009 len. 9]: The old man sat in his accustomed corner .
Parsing [sent. 18010 len. 41]: The slightest circumstance was matter of disquiet to the murderer , and he was made uneasy at this time by the absence of his wife , who had left home early in the afternoon , and had not returned yet .
Parsing [sent. 18011 len. 37]: No tenderness for her was at the bottom of this ; but he had a misgiving that she might have been waylaid , and tempted into saying something that would criminate him when the news came .
Parsing [sent. 18012 len. 26]: For anything he knew , she might have knocked at the door of his room , while he was away , and discovered his plot .
Parsing [sent. 18013 len. 18]: Confound her , it was like her pale face to be wandering up and down the house !
Parsing [sent. 18014 len. 5]: Where was she now ?
Parsing [sent. 18015 len. 27]: ` She went to her good friend , Mrs Todgers , ' said the old man , when he asked the question with an angry oath .
Parsing [sent. 18016 len. 2]: Aye !
Parsing [sent. 18017 len. 4]: To be sure !
Parsing [sent. 18018 len. 10]: Always stealing away into the company of that woman .
Parsing [sent. 18019 len. 7]: She was no friend of his .
Parsing [sent. 18020 len. 12]: Who could tell what devil 's mischief they might hatch together !
Parsing [sent. 18021 len. 7]: Let her be fetched home directly .
Parsing [sent. 18022 len. 39]: The old man , muttering some words softly , rose as if he would have gone himself , but Jonas thrust him back into his chair with an impatient imprecation , and sent a servant-girl to fetch her .
Parsing [sent. 18023 len. 42]: When he had charged her with her errand he walked to and fro again , and never stopped till she came back , which she did pretty soon ; the way being short , and the woman having made good haste .
Parsing [sent. 18024 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 18025 len. 4]: Where was she ?
Parsing [sent. 18026 len. 4]: Had she come ?
Parsing [sent. 18027 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 18028 len. 9]: She had left there , full three hours .
Parsing [sent. 18029 len. 4]: ` Left there !
Parsing [sent. 18030 len. 3]: Alone ? '
Parsing [sent. 18031 len. 11]: The messenger had not asked ; taking that for granted .
Parsing [sent. 18032 len. 7]: ` Curse you for a fool .
Parsing [sent. 18033 len. 4]: Bring candles ! '
Parsing [sent. 18034 len. 32]: She had scarcely left the room when the old clerk , who had been unusually observant of him ever since he had asked about his wife , came suddenly upon him .
Parsing [sent. 18035 len. 6]: ` Give her up ! '
Parsing [sent. 18036 len. 5]: cried the old man .
Parsing [sent. 18037 len. 3]: ` Come !
Parsing [sent. 18038 len. 6]: Give her up to me !
Parsing [sent. 18039 len. 9]: Tell me what you have done with her .
Parsing [sent. 18040 len. 2]: Quick !
Parsing [sent. 18041 len. 9]: I have made no promises on that score .
Parsing [sent. 18042 len. 10]: Tell me what you have done with her . '
Parsing [sent. 18043 len. 18]: He laid his hands upon his collar as he spoke , and grasped it ; tightly too .
Parsing [sent. 18044 len. 8]: ` You shall not leave me ! '
Parsing [sent. 18045 len. 6]: cried the old man . '
Parsing [sent. 18046 len. 21]: I am strong enough to cry out to the neighbours , and I will , unless you give her up .
Parsing [sent. 18047 len. 7]: Give her up to me ! '
Parsing [sent. 18048 len. 44]: Jonas was so dismayed and conscience-stricken , that he had not even hardihood enough to unclench the old man 's hands with his own ; but stood looking at him as well as he could in the darkness , without moving a finger .
Parsing [sent. 18049 len. 16]: It was as much as he could do to ask him what he meant . '
Parsing [sent. 18050 len. 11]: I will know what you have done with her ! '
Parsing [sent. 18051 len. 3]: retorted Chuffey .
Parsing [sent. 18052 len. 15]: ` If you hurt a hair of her head , you shall answer it .
Parsing [sent. 18053 len. 3]: Poor thing !
Parsing [sent. 18054 len. 3]: Poor thing !
Parsing [sent. 18055 len. 5]: Where is she ? '
Parsing [sent. 18056 len. 8]: ` Why , you old madman ! '
Parsing [sent. 18057 len. 13]: said Jonas , in a low voice , and with trembling lips .
Parsing [sent. 18058 len. 11]: ` What Bedlam fit has come upon you now ? '
Parsing [sent. 18059 len. 19]: ` It is enough to make me mad , seeing what I have seen in this house ! '
Parsing [sent. 18060 len. 3]: cried Chuffey .
Parsing [sent. 18061 len. 8]: ` Where is my dear old master !
Parsing [sent. 18062 len. 16]: Where is his only son that I have nursed upon my knee , a child !
Parsing [sent. 18063 len. 29]: Where is she , she who was the last ; she that I 've seen pining day by day , and heard weeping in the dead of night !
Parsing [sent. 18064 len. 12]: She was the last , the last of all my friends !
Parsing [sent. 18065 len. 11]: Heaven help me , she was the very last ! '
Parsing [sent. 18066 len. 35]: Seeing that the tears were stealing down his face , Jonas mustered courage to unclench his hands , and push him off before he answered : ` Did you hear me ask for her ?
Parsing [sent. 18067 len. 8]: Did you hear me send for her ?
Parsing [sent. 18068 len. 14]: How can I give you up what I have n't got , idiot !
Parsing [sent. 18069 len. 25]: Ecod , I 'd give her up to you and welcome , if I could ; and a precious pair you 'd be ! '
Parsing [sent. 18070 len. 16]: ` If she has come to any harm , ' cried Chuffey , ` mind !
Parsing [sent. 18071 len. 50]: I 'm old and silly ; but I have my memory sometimes ; and if she has come to any harm -- ' ` Devil take you , ' interrupted Jonas , but in a suppressed voice still ; ` what harm do you suppose she has come to ?
Parsing [sent. 18072 len. 16]: I know no more where she is than you do ; I wish I did .
Parsing [sent. 18073 len. 15]: Wait till she comes home , and see ; she ca n't be long .
Parsing [sent. 18074 len. 6]: Will that content you ? '
Parsing [sent. 18075 len. 4]: ` Mind ! '
Parsing [sent. 18076 len. 5]: exclaimed the old man .
Parsing [sent. 18077 len. 8]: ` Not a hair of her head !
Parsing [sent. 18078 len. 8]: not a hair of her head ill-used !
Parsing [sent. 18079 len. 6]: I wo n't bear it .
Parsing [sent. 18080 len. 11]: I -- I -- have borne it too long Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 18081 len. 13]: I am silent , but I -- I -- I can speak .
Parsing [sent. 18082 len. 33]: I -- I -- I can speak -- ' he stammered , as he crept back to his chair , and turned a threatening , though a feeble , look upon him .
Parsing [sent. 18083 len. 9]: ` You can speak , can you ! '
Parsing [sent. 18084 len. 3]: thought Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 18085 len. 11]: ` So , so , we 'll stop your speaking .
Parsing [sent. 18086 len. 11]: It 's well I knew of this in good time .
Parsing [sent. 18087 len. 7]: Prevention is better than cure . '
Parsing [sent. 18088 len. 45]: He had made a poor show of playing the bully and evincing a desire to conciliate at the same time , but was so afraid of the old man that great drops had started out upon his brow ; and they stood there yet .
Parsing [sent. 18089 len. 42]: His unusual tone of voice and agitated manner had sufficiently expressed his fear ; but his face would have done so now , without that aid , as he again walked to and fro , glancing at him by the candelight .
Parsing [sent. 18090 len. 8]: He stopped at the window to think .
Parsing [sent. 18091 len. 23]: An opposite shop was lighted up ; and the tradesman and a customer were reading some printed bill together across the counter .
Parsing [sent. 18092 len. 15]: The sight brought him back , instantly , to the occupation he had forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 18093 len. 4]: ` Look here !
Parsing [sent. 18094 len. 6]: Do you know of this ?
Parsing [sent. 18095 len. 4]: Is it found ?
Parsing [sent. 18096 len. 6]: Do you suspect ME ? '
Parsing [sent. 18097 len. 6]: A hand upon the door .
Parsing [sent. 18098 len. 7]: ` What 's that ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 18099 len. 35]: A pleasant evenin ' , ' said the voice of Mrs Gamp , ` though warm , which , bless you , Mr Chuzzlewit , we must expect when cowcumbers is three for twopence .
Parsing [sent. 18100 len. 12]: How does Mr Chuffey find his self to-night , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 18101 len. 18]: Mrs Gamp kept particularly close to the door in saying this , and curtseyed more than usual .
Parsing [sent. 18102 len. 17]: She did not appear to be quite so much at her ease as she generally was .
Parsing [sent. 18103 len. 22]: ` Get him to his room , ' said Jonas , walking up to her , and speaking in her ear .
Parsing [sent. 18104 len. 10]: ` He has been raving to-night -- stark mad .
Parsing [sent. 18105 len. 14]: Do n't talk while he 's here , but come down again . '
Parsing [sent. 18106 len. 6]: ` Poor sweet dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 18107 len. 8]: cried Mrs Gamp , with uncommon tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 18108 len. 9]: ` He 's all of a tremble . '
Parsing [sent. 18109 len. 19]: ` Well he may be , ' said Jonas , ` after the mad fit he has had .
Parsing [sent. 18110 len. 5]: Get him upstairs . '
Parsing [sent. 18111 len. 10]: She was by this time assisting him to rise .
Parsing [sent. 18112 len. 9]: ` There 's my blessed old chick ! '
Parsing [sent. 18113 len. 15]: cried Mrs Gamp , in a tone that was at once soothing and encouraging .
Parsing [sent. 18114 len. 9]: ` There 's my darlin ' Mr Chuffey !
Parsing [sent. 18115 len. 37]: Now come up to your own room , sir , and lay down on your bed a bit ; for you 're a-shakin ' all over , as if your precious jints was hung upon wires .
Parsing [sent. 18116 len. 6]: That 's a good creetur !
Parsing [sent. 18117 len. 5]: Come with Sairey ! '
Parsing [sent. 18118 len. 7]: ` Is she come home ? '
Parsing [sent. 18119 len. 5]: inquired the old man .
Parsing [sent. 18120 len. 13]: ` She 'll be here directly minit , ' returned Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 18121 len. 8]: ` Come with Sairey , Mr Chuffey .
Parsing [sent. 18122 len. 7]: Come with your own Sairey ! '
Parsing [sent. 18123 len. 40]: The good woman had no reference to any female in the world in promising this speedy advent of the person for whom Mr Chuffey inquired , but merely threw it out as a means of pacifying the old man .
Parsing [sent. 18124 len. 21]: It had its effect , for he permitted her to lead him away ; and they quitted the room together .
Parsing [sent. 18125 len. 8]: Jonas looked out of the window again .
Parsing [sent. 18126 len. 22]: They were still reading the printed paper in the shop opposite , and a third man had joined in the perusal .
Parsing [sent. 18127 len. 11]: What could it be , to interest them so ? '
Parsing [sent. 18128 len. 48]: A dispute or discussion seemed to arise among them , for they all looked up from their reading together , and one of the three , who had been glancing over the shoulder of another , stepped back to explain or illustrate some action by his gestures .
Parsing [sent. 18129 len. 2]: Horror !
Parsing [sent. 18130 len. 11]: How like the blow he had struck in the wood !
Parsing [sent. 18131 len. 14]: It beat him from the window as if it had lighted on himself .
Parsing [sent. 18132 len. 24]: As he staggered into a chair , he thought of the change in Mrs Gamp exhibited in her new-born tenderness to her charge .
Parsing [sent. 18133 len. 7]: Was that because it was found ?
Parsing [sent. 18134 len. 7]: -- because she knew of it ?
Parsing [sent. 18135 len. 6]: -- because she suspected him ?
Parsing [sent. 18136 len. 41]: ` Mr Chuffey is a-lyin ' down , ' said Mrs Gamp , returning , ` and much good may it do him , Mr Chuzzlewit , which harm it ca n't and good it may ; be joyful ! '
Parsing [sent. 18137 len. 19]: ` Sit down , ' said Jonas , hoarsely , ` and let us get this business done .
Parsing [sent. 18138 len. 7]: Where is the other woman ? '
Parsing [sent. 18139 len. 13]: ` The other person 's with him now , ' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 18140 len. 9]: ` That 's right , ' said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 18141 len. 11]: ` He is not fit to be left to himself .
Parsing [sent. 18142 len. 19]: Why , he fastened on me to-night ; here , upon my coat ; like a savage dog .
Parsing [sent. 18143 len. 21]: Old as he is , and feeble as he is usually , I had some trouble to shake him off .
Parsing [sent. 18144 len. 4]: You -- Hush !
Parsing [sent. 18145 len. 5]: -- It 's nothing .
Parsing [sent. 18146 len. 9]: You told me the other woman 's name .
Parsing [sent. 18147 len. 6]: I forget it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18148 len. 10]: I mentioned Betsey Prig , ' said Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 18149 len. 11]: ` She is to be trusted , is she ? '
Parsing [sent. 18150 len. 7]: ` That she ai n't ! '
Parsing [sent. 18151 len. 14]: said Mrs Gamp ; ` nor have I brought her , Mr Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 18152 len. 13]: I 've brought another , which engages to give every satigefaction . '
Parsing [sent. 18153 len. 7]: ` What is her name ? '
Parsing [sent. 18154 len. 3]: asked Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 18155 len. 22]: Mrs Gamp looked at him in an odd way without returning any answer , but appeared to understand the question too .
Parsing [sent. 18156 len. 7]: ` What is her name ? '
Parsing [sent. 18157 len. 3]: repeated Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 18158 len. 14]: ` Her name , ' said Mrs Gamp , ` is Harris . '
Parsing [sent. 18159 len. 21]: It was extraordinary how much effort it cost Mrs Gamp to pronounce the name she was commonly so ready with .
Parsing [sent. 18160 len. 44]: She made some three or four gasps before she could get it out ; and , when she had uttered it , pressed her hand upon her side , and turned up her eyes , as if she were going to faint away .
Parsing [sent. 18161 len. 56]: But , knowing her to labour under a complication of internal disorders , which rendered a few drops of spirits indispensable at certain times to her existence , and which came on very strong when that remedy was not at hand , Jonas merely supposed her to be the victim of one of these attacks .
Parsing [sent. 18162 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 18163 len. 21]: he said , hastily , for he felt how incapable he was of confining his wandering attention to the subject .
Parsing [sent. 18164 len. 16]: ` You and she have arranged to take care of him , have you ? '
Parsing [sent. 18165 len. 29]: Mrs Gamp replied in the affirmative , and softly discharged herself of her familiar phrase , ` Turn and turn about ; one off , one on . '
Parsing [sent. 18166 len. 26]: But she spoke so tremulously that she felt called upon to add , ` which fiddle-strings is weakness to expredge my nerves this night ! '
Parsing [sent. 18167 len. 5]: Jonas stopped to listen .
Parsing [sent. 18168 len. 13]: Then said , hurriedly : ` We shall not quarrel about terms .
Parsing [sent. 18169 len. 10]: Let them be the same as they were before .
Parsing [sent. 18170 len. 9]: Keep him close , and keep him quiet .
Parsing [sent. 18171 len. 5]: He must be restrained .
Parsing [sent. 18172 len. 26]: He has got it in his head to-night that my wife 's dead , and has been attacking me as if I had killed her .
Parsing [sent. 18173 len. 20]: It 's -- it 's common with mad people to take the worst fancies of those they like best .
Parsing [sent. 18174 len. 5]: Is n't it ? '
Parsing [sent. 18175 len. 8]: Mrs Gamp assented with a short groan .
Parsing [sent. 18176 len. 21]: ` Keep him close , then , or in one of his fits he 'll be doing me a mischief .
Parsing [sent. 18177 len. 23]: And do n't trust him at any time ; for when he seems most rational , he 's wildest in his talk .
Parsing [sent. 18178 len. 6]: But that you know already .
Parsing [sent. 18179 len. 7]: Let me see the other . '
Parsing [sent. 18180 len. 10]: ` The t ` other person , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 18181 len. 4]: said Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 18182 len. 3]: ` Aye !
Parsing [sent. 18183 len. 9]: Go you to him and send the other .
Parsing [sent. 18184 len. 2]: Quick !
Parsing [sent. 18185 len. 5]: I 'm busy . '
Parsing [sent. 18186 len. 16]: Mrs Gamp took two or three backward steps towards the door , and stopped there .
Parsing [sent. 18187 len. 29]: ` It is your wishes , Mr Chuzzlewit , ' she said , in a sort of quavering croak , ` to see the t ` other person .
Parsing [sent. 18188 len. 4]: Is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 18189 len. 16]: But the ghastly change in Jonas told her that the other person was already seen .
Parsing [sent. 18190 len. 28]: Before she could look round towards the door , she was put aside by old Martin 's hand ; and Chuffey and John Westlock entered with him .
Parsing [sent. 18191 len. 12]: ` Let no one leave the house , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 18192 len. 9]: ` This man is my brother 's son .
Parsing [sent. 18193 len. 6]: Ill-met , ill-trained , ill-begotten .
Parsing [sent. 18194 len. 33]: If he moves from the spot on which he stands , or speaks a word above his breath to any person here , open the window , and call for help ! '
Parsing [sent. 18195 len. 14]: ` What right have you to give such directions in this house ? '
Parsing [sent. 18196 len. 4]: asked Jonas faintly .
Parsing [sent. 18197 len. 7]: ` The right of your wrong-doing .
Parsing [sent. 18198 len. 5]: Come in there ! '
Parsing [sent. 18199 len. 17]: An irrepressible exclamation burst from the lips of Jonas , as Lewsome entered at the door .
Parsing [sent. 18200 len. 61]: It was not a groan , or a shriek , or a word , but was wholly unlike any sound that had ever fallen on the ears of those who heard it , while at the same time it was the most sharp and terrible expression of what was working in his guilty breast , that nature could have invented .
Parsing [sent. 18201 len. 7]: He had done murder for this !
Parsing [sent. 18202 len. 18]: He had girdled himself about with perils , agonies of mind , innumerable fears , for this !
Parsing [sent. 18203 len. 65]: He had hidden his secret in the wood ; pressed and stamped it down into the bloody ground ; and here it started up when least expected , miles upon miles away ; known to many ; proclaiming itself from the lips of an old man who had renewed his strength and vigour as by a miracle , to give it voice against him !
Parsing [sent. 18204 len. 16]: He leaned his hand on the back of a chair , and looked at them .
Parsing [sent. 18205 len. 17]: It was in vain to try to do so scornfully , or with his usual insolence .
Parsing [sent. 18206 len. 8]: He required the chair for his support .
Parsing [sent. 18207 len. 9]: But he made a struggle for it . '
Parsing [sent. 18208 len. 24]: I know that fellow , ' he said , fetching his breath at every word , and pointing his trembling finger towards Lewsome .
Parsing [sent. 18209 len. 8]: ` He 's the greatest liar alive .
Parsing [sent. 18210 len. 6]: What 's his last tale ?
Parsing [sent. 18211 len. 4]: Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 18212 len. 7]: You 're rare fellows , too !
Parsing [sent. 18213 len. 34]: Why , that uncle of mine is childish ; he 's even a greater child than his brother , my father , was , in his old age ; or than Chuffey is .
Parsing [sent. 18214 len. 49]: What the devil do you mean , ' he added , looking fiercely at John Westlock and Mark Tapley -LRB- the latter had entered with Lewsome -RRB- , ` by coming here , and bringing two idiots and a knave with you to take my house by storm ?
Parsing [sent. 18215 len. 4]: Hallo , there !
Parsing [sent. 18216 len. 4]: Open the door !
Parsing [sent. 18217 len. 7]: Turn these strangers out ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 18218 len. 39]: I tell you what , ' cried Mr Tapley , coming forward , ` if it was n't for your name , I 'd drag you through the streets of my own accord , and single-handed I would !
Parsing [sent. 18219 len. 5]: Ah , I would !
Parsing [sent. 18220 len. 9]: Do n't try and look bold at me .
Parsing [sent. 18221 len. 6]: You ca n't do it !
Parsing [sent. 18222 len. 13]: Now go on , sir , ' this was to old Martin .
Parsing [sent. 18223 len. 10]: ` Bring the murderin ' wagabond upon his knees !
Parsing [sent. 18224 len. 40]: If he wants noise , he shall have enough of it ; for as sure as he 's a shiverin ' from head to foot I 'll raise a uproar at this winder that shall bring half London in .
Parsing [sent. 18225 len. 5]: Go on , sir !
Parsing [sent. 18226 len. 20]: Let him try me once , and see whether I 'm a man of my word or not . '
Parsing [sent. 18227 len. 59]: With that , Mark folded his arms , and took his seat upon the window-ledge , with an air of general preparation for anything , which seemed to imply that he was equally ready to jump out himself , or to throw Jonas out , upon receiving the slightest hint that it would be agreeable to the company .
Parsing [sent. 18228 len. 22]: Old Martin turned to Lewsome : ` This is the man , ' he said , extending his hand towards Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 18229 len. 5]: ` Is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 18230 len. 31]: ` You need do no more than look at him to be sure of that , or of the truth of what I have said , ' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 18231 len. 7]: ` He is my witness . '
Parsing [sent. 18232 len. 6]: ` Oh , brother ! '
Parsing [sent. 18233 len. 13]: cried old Martin , clasping his hands and lifting up his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 18234 len. 7]: ` Oh , brother , brother !
Parsing [sent. 18235 len. 30]: Were we strangers half our lives that you might breed a wretch like this , and I make life a desert by withering every flower that grew about me !
Parsing [sent. 18236 len. 49]: Is it the natural end of your precepts and mine , that this should be the creature of your rearing , training , teaching , hoarding , striving for ; and I the means of bringing him to punishment , when nothing can repair the wasted past ! '
Parsing [sent. 18237 len. 23]: He sat down upon a chair as he spoke , and turning away his face , was silent for a few moments .
Parsing [sent. 18238 len. 21]: Then with recovered energy he proceeded : ` But the accursed harvest of our mistaken lives shall be trodden down .
Parsing [sent. 18239 len. 8]: It is not too late for that .
Parsing [sent. 18240 len. 23]: You are confronted with this man , you monster there ; not to be spared , but to be dealt with justly .
Parsing [sent. 18241 len. 5]: Hear what he says !
Parsing [sent. 18242 len. 16]: Reply , be silent , contradict , repeat , defy , do what you please .
Parsing [sent. 18243 len. 7]: My course will be the same .
Parsing [sent. 18244 len. 3]: Go on !
Parsing [sent. 18245 len. 26]: And you , ' he said to Chuffey , ` for the love of your old friend , speak out , good fellow ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 18246 len. 9]: I have been silent for his love ! '
Parsing [sent. 18247 len. 5]: cried the old man .
Parsing [sent. 18248 len. 7]: ` He urged me to it .
Parsing [sent. 18249 len. 10]: He made me promise it upon his dying bed .
Parsing [sent. 18250 len. 14]: I never would have spoken , but for your finding out so much .
Parsing [sent. 18251 len. 36]: I have thought about it ever since ; I could n't help that ; and sometimes I have had it all before me in a dream ; but in the day-time , not in sleep .
Parsing [sent. 18252 len. 9]: Is there such a kind of dream ? '
Parsing [sent. 18253 len. 11]: said Chuffey , looking anxiously in old Martin 's face .
Parsing [sent. 18254 len. 18]: As Martin made him an encouraging reply , he listened attentively to his voice , and smiled .
Parsing [sent. 18255 len. 6]: ` Ah , aye ! '
Parsing [sent. 18256 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 18257 len. 9]: ` He often spoke to me like that .
Parsing [sent. 18258 len. 29]: We were at school together , he and I. I could n't turn against his son , you know -- his only son , Mr Chuzzlewit ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 18259 len. 11]: I would to Heaven you had been his son ! '
Parsing [sent. 18260 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 18261 len. 29]: ` You speak so like my dear old master , ' cried the old man with a childish delight , ` that I almost think I hear him .
Parsing [sent. 18262 len. 14]: I can hear you quite as well as I used to hear him .
Parsing [sent. 18263 len. 6]: It makes me young again .
Parsing [sent. 18264 len. 13]: He never spoke unkindly to me , and I always understood him .
Parsing [sent. 18265 len. 13]: I could always see him too , though my sight was dim .
Parsing [sent. 18266 len. 4]: Well , well !
Parsing [sent. 18267 len. 8]: He 's dead , he 's dead .
Parsing [sent. 18268 len. 13]: He was very good to me , my dear old master ! '
Parsing [sent. 18269 len. 11]: He shook his head mournfully over the brother 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 18270 len. 19]: At this moment Mark , who had been glancing out of the window , left the room . '
Parsing [sent. 18271 len. 16]: I could n't turn against his only son , you know , ' said Chuffey .
Parsing [sent. 18272 len. 17]: ` He has nearly driven me to do it sometimes ; he very nearly did tonight .
Parsing [sent. 18273 len. 3]: Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 18274 len. 13]: cried the old man , with a sudden recollection of the cause .
Parsing [sent. 18275 len. 5]: ` Where is she ?
Parsing [sent. 18276 len. 7]: She 's not come home ! '
Parsing [sent. 18277 len. 8]: ` Do you mean his wife ? '
Parsing [sent. 18278 len. 4]: said Mr Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 18279 len. 5]: ` Yes . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18280 len. 5]: I have removed her .
Parsing [sent. 18281 len. 19]: She is in my care , and will be spared the present knowledge of what is passing here .
Parsing [sent. 18282 len. 11]: She has known misery enough , without that addition . '
Parsing [sent. 18283 len. 8]: Jonas heard this with a sinking heart .
Parsing [sent. 18284 len. 21]: He knew that they were on his heels , and felt that they were resolute to run him to destruction .
Parsing [sent. 18285 len. 38]: Inch by inch the ground beneath him was sliding from his feet ; faster and faster the encircling ruin contracted and contracted towards himself , its wicked centre , until it should close in and crush him .
Parsing [sent. 18286 len. 43]: And now he heard the voice of his accomplice stating to his face , with every circumstance of time and place and incident ; and openly proclaiming , with no reserve , suppression , passion , or concealment ; all the truth .
Parsing [sent. 18287 len. 61]: The truth , which nothing would keep down ; which blood would not smother , and earth would not hide ; the truth , whose terrible inspiration seemed to change dotards into strong men ; and on whose avenging wings , one whom he had supposed to be at the extremest corner of the earth came swooping down upon him .
Parsing [sent. 18288 len. 13]: He tried to deny it , but his tongue would not move .
Parsing [sent. 18289 len. 33]: He conceived some desperate thought of rushing away , and tearing through the streets ; but his limbs would as little answer to his will as his stark , stiff staring face .
Parsing [sent. 18290 len. 12]: All this time the voice went slowly on , denouncing him .
Parsing [sent. 18291 len. 20]: It was as if every drop of blood in the wood had found a voice to jeer him with .
Parsing [sent. 18292 len. 63]: When it ceased , another voice took up the tale , but strangely ; for the old clerk , who had watched , and listened to the whole , and had wrung his hands from time to time , as if he knew its truth and could confirm it , broke in with these words : ` No , no , no !
Parsing [sent. 18293 len. 12]: you 're wrong ; you 're wrong -- all wrong together !
Parsing [sent. 18294 len. 13]: Have patience , for the truth is only known to me ! '
Parsing [sent. 18295 len. 21]: ` How can that be , ' said his old master 's brother , ` after what you have heard ?
Parsing [sent. 18296 len. 30]: Besides , you said just now , above-stairs , when I told you of the accusation against him , that you knew he was his father 's murderer . '
Parsing [sent. 18297 len. 5]: ` Aye , yes !
Parsing [sent. 18298 len. 6]: and so he was ! '
Parsing [sent. 18299 len. 5]: cried Chuffey , wildly .
Parsing [sent. 18300 len. 12]: ` But not as you suppose -- not as you suppose .
Parsing [sent. 18301 len. 2]: Stay !
Parsing [sent. 18302 len. 7]: Give me a moment 's time .
Parsing [sent. 18303 len. 9]: I have it all here -- all here !
Parsing [sent. 18304 len. 16]: It was foul , foul , cruel , bad ; but not as you suppose .
Parsing [sent. 18305 len. 5]: Stay , stay ! '
Parsing [sent. 18306 len. 17]: He put his hands up to his head , as if it throbbed or pained him .
Parsing [sent. 18307 len. 30]: After looking about him in a wandering and vacant manner for some moments , his eyes rested upon Jonas , when they kindled up with sudden recollection and intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 18308 len. 4]: ` Yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 18309 len. 7]: cried old Chuffey , ` yes !
Parsing [sent. 18310 len. 6]: That 's how it was .
Parsing [sent. 18311 len. 7]: It 's all upon me now .
Parsing [sent. 18312 len. 70]: He -- he got up from his bed before he died , to be sure , to say that he forgave him ; and he came down with me into this room ; and when he saw him -- his only son , the son he loved -- his speech forsook him ; he had no speech for what he knew -- and no one understood him except me .
Parsing [sent. 18313 len. 8]: But I did -- I did ! '
Parsing [sent. 18314 len. 12]: Old Martin regarded him in amazement ; so did his companions .
Parsing [sent. 18315 len. 62]: Mrs Gamp , who had said nothing yet ; but had kept two-thirds of herself behind the door , ready for escape , and one-third in the room , ready for siding with the strongest party ; came a little further in and remarked , with a sob , that Mr Chuffey was ` the sweetest old creetur goin ' . '
Parsing [sent. 18316 len. 50]: ` He bought the stuff , ' said Chuffey , stretching out his arm towards Jonas while an unwonted fire shone in his eye , and lightened up his face ; ` he bought the stuff , no doubt , as you have heard , and brought it home .
Parsing [sent. 18317 len. 9]: He mixed the stuff -- look at him !
Parsing [sent. 18318 len. 42]: -- with some sweetmeat in a jar , exactly as the medicine for his father 's cough was mixed , and put it in a drawer ; in that drawer yonder in the desk ; he knows which drawer I mean !
Parsing [sent. 18319 len. 7]: He kept it there locked up .
Parsing [sent. 18320 len. 14]: But his courage failed him or his heart was touched -- my God !
Parsing [sent. 18321 len. 7]: I hope it was his heart !
Parsing [sent. 18322 len. 6]: He was his only son !
Parsing [sent. 18323 len. 26]: -- and he did not put it in the usual place , where my old master would have taken it twenty times a day . '
Parsing [sent. 18324 len. 16]: The trembling figure of the old man shook with the strong emotions that possessed him .
Parsing [sent. 18325 len. 40]: But , with the same light in his eye , and with his arm outstretched , and with his grey hair stirring on his head , he seemed to grow in size , and was like a man inspired .
Parsing [sent. 18326 len. 19]: Jonas shrunk from looking at him , and cowered down into the chair by which he had held .
Parsing [sent. 18327 len. 14]: It seemed as if this tremendous Truth could make the dumb speak . '
Parsing [sent. 18328 len. 8]: I know it every word now ! '
Parsing [sent. 18329 len. 3]: cried Chuffey .
Parsing [sent. 18330 len. 4]: ` Every word !
Parsing [sent. 18331 len. 12]: He put it in that drawer , as I have said .
Parsing [sent. 18332 len. 29]: He went so often there , and was so secret , that his father took notice of it ; and when he was out , had it opened .
Parsing [sent. 18333 len. 16]: We were there together , and we found the mixture -- Mr Chuzzlewit and I .
Parsing [sent. 18334 len. 44]: He took it into his possession , and made light of it at the time ; but in the night he came to my bedside , weeping , and told me that his own son had it in his mind to poison him .
Parsing [sent. 18335 len. 16]: `` Oh , Chuff , '' he said , `` oh , dear old Chuff !
Parsing [sent. 18336 len. 18]: a voice came into my room to-night , and told me that this crime began with me .
Parsing [sent. 18337 len. 28]: It began when I taught him to be too covetous of what I have to leave , and made the expectation of it his great business ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18338 len. 13]: Those were his words ; aye , they are his very words !
Parsing [sent. 18339 len. 17]: If he was a hard man now and then , it was for his only son .
Parsing [sent. 18340 len. 15]: He loved his only son , and he was always good to me ! '
Parsing [sent. 18341 len. 6]: Jonas listened with increased attention .
Parsing [sent. 18342 len. 8]: Hope was breaking in upon him . '
Parsing [sent. 18343 len. 56]: `` He shall not weary for my death , Chuff ; '' that was what he said next , ' pursued the old clerk , as he wiped his eyes ; ` that was what he said next , crying like a little child : `` He shall not weary for my death , Chuff .
Parsing [sent. 18344 len. 37]: He shall have it now ; he shall marry where he has a fancy , Chuff , although it do n't please me ; and you and I will go away and live upon a little .
Parsing [sent. 18345 len. 12]: I always loved him ; perhaps he 'll love me then .
Parsing [sent. 18346 len. 15]: It 's a dreadful thing to have my own child thirsting for my death .
Parsing [sent. 18347 len. 7]: But I might have known it .
Parsing [sent. 18348 len. 9]: I have sown , and I must reap .
Parsing [sent. 18349 len. 40]: He shall believe that I am taking this ; and when I see that he is sorry , and has all he wants , I 'll tell him that I found it out , and I 'll forgive him .
Parsing [sent. 18350 len. 24]: He 'll make a better man of his own son , and be a better man himself , perhaps , Chuff ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 18351 len. 9]: Poor Chuffey paused to dry his eyes again .
Parsing [sent. 18352 len. 10]: Old Martin 's face was hidden in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 18353 len. 19]: Jonas listened still more keenly , and his breast heaved like a swollen water , but with hope .
Parsing [sent. 18354 len. 4]: With growing hope .
Parsing [sent. 18355 len. 81]: ` My dear old master made believe next day , ' said Chuffey , ` that he had opened the drawer by mistake with a key from the bunch , which happened to fit it -LRB- we had one made and hung upon it -RRB- ; and that he had been surprised to find his fresh supply of cough medicine in such a place , but supposed it had been put there in a hurry when the drawer stood open .
Parsing [sent. 18356 len. 19]: We burnt it ; but his son believed that he was taking it -- he knows he did .
Parsing [sent. 18357 len. 29]: Once Mr Chuzzlewit , to try him , took heart to say it had a strange taste ; and he got up directly , and went out . '
Parsing [sent. 18358 len. 34]: Jonas gave a short , dry cough ; and , changing his position for an easier one , folded his arms without looking at them , though they could now see his face .
Parsing [sent. 18359 len. 40]: ` Mr Chuzzlewit wrote to her father ; I mean the father of the poor thing who 's his wife , ' said Chuffey ; ` and got him to come up , intending to hasten on the marriage .
Parsing [sent. 18360 len. 20]: But his mind , like mine , went a little wrong through grief , and then his heart broke .
Parsing [sent. 18361 len. 24]: He sank and altered from the time when he came to me in the night ; and never held up his head again .
Parsing [sent. 18362 len. 19]: It was only a few days , but he had never changed so much in twice the years .
Parsing [sent. 18363 len. 7]: `` Spare him , Chuff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18364 len. 7]: he said , before he died .
Parsing [sent. 18365 len. 9]: They were the only words he could speak .
Parsing [sent. 18366 len. 7]: `` Spare him , Chuff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18367 len. 6]: I promised him I would .
Parsing [sent. 18368 len. 7]: I 've tried to do it .
Parsing [sent. 18369 len. 7]: He 's his only son . '
Parsing [sent. 18370 len. 30]: On his recollection of the last scene in his old friend 's life , poor Chuffey 's voice , which had grown weaker and weaker , quite deserted him .
Parsing [sent. 18371 len. 43]: Making a motion with his hand , as if he would have said that Anthony had taken it , and had died with it in his , he retreated to the corner where he usually concealed his sorrows ; and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 18372 len. 12]: Jonas could look at his company now , and vauntingly too .
Parsing [sent. 18373 len. 4]: ` Well ! '
Parsing [sent. 18374 len. 7]: he said , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 18375 len. 5]: ` Are you satisfied ?
Parsing [sent. 18376 len. 11]: or have you any more of your plots to broach ?
Parsing [sent. 18377 len. 15]: Why that fellow , Lewsome , can invent 'em for you by the score .
Parsing [sent. 18378 len. 4]: Is this all ?
Parsing [sent. 18379 len. 6]: Have you nothing else ? '
Parsing [sent. 18380 len. 7]: Old Martin looked at him steadily .
Parsing [sent. 18381 len. 50]: ` Whether you are what you seemed to be at Pecksniff 's , or are something else and a mountebank , I do n't know and I do n't care , ' said Jonas , looking downward with a smile , ` but I do n't want you here .
Parsing [sent. 18382 len. 39]: You were here so often when your brother was alive , and were always so fond of him -LRB- your dear , dear brother , and you would have been cuffing one another before this , ecod ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 18383 len. 40]: , that I am not surprised at your being attached to the place ; but the place is not attached to you , and you ca n't leave it too soon , though you may leave it too late .
Parsing [sent. 18384 len. 22]: And for my wife , old man , send her home straight , or it will be the worse for her .
Parsing [sent. 18385 len. 4]: Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 18386 len. 10]: You carry it with a high hand , too !
Parsing [sent. 18387 len. 42]: But it is n't hanging yet for a man to keep a penn ` orth of poison for his own purposes , and have it taken from him by two old crazy jolter-heads who go and act a play about it .
Parsing [sent. 18388 len. 4]: Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 18389 len. 7]: Do you see the door ? '
Parsing [sent. 18390 len. 41]: His base triumph , struggling with his cowardice , and shame , and guilt , was so detestable , that they turned away from him , as if he were some obscene and filthy animal , repugnant to the sight .
Parsing [sent. 18391 len. 19]: And here that last black crime was busy with him too ; working within him to his perdition .
Parsing [sent. 18392 len. 42]: But for that , the old clerk 's story might have touched him , though never so lightly ; but for that , the sudden removal of so great a load might have brought about some wholesome change even in him .
Parsing [sent. 18393 len. 63]: With that deed done , however ; with that unnecessary wasteful danger haunting him ; despair was in his very triumph and relief ; wild , ungovernable , raging despair , for the uselessness of the peril into which he had plunged ; despair that hardened him and maddened him , and set his teeth a-grinding in a moment of his exultation .
Parsing [sent. 18394 len. 6]: ` My good friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 18395 len. 12]: said old Martin , laying his hand on Chuffey 's sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 18396 len. 11]: ` This is no place for you to remain in .
Parsing [sent. 18397 len. 5]: Come with me . '
Parsing [sent. 18398 len. 7]: ` Just his old way ! '
Parsing [sent. 18399 len. 10]: cried Chuffey , looking up into his face . '
Parsing [sent. 18400 len. 10]: I almost believe it 's Mr Chuzzlewit alive again .
Parsing [sent. 18401 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 18402 len. 5]: Take me with you !
Parsing [sent. 18403 len. 7]: Stay , though , stay . '
Parsing [sent. 18404 len. 5]: ` For what ? '
Parsing [sent. 18405 len. 5]: asked old Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 18406 len. 10]: I ca n't leave her , poor thing ! '
Parsing [sent. 18407 len. 3]: said Chuffey .
Parsing [sent. 18408 len. 9]: ` She has been very good to me .
Parsing [sent. 18409 len. 9]: I ca n't leave her , Mr Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 18410 len. 4]: Thank you kindly .
Parsing [sent. 18411 len. 5]: I 'll remain here .
Parsing [sent. 18412 len. 14]: I have n't long to remain ; it 's no great matter . '
Parsing [sent. 18413 len. 32]: As he meekly shook his poor , grey head , and thanked old Martin in these words , Mrs Gamp , now entirely in the room , was affected to tears .
Parsing [sent. 18414 len. 8]: ` The mercy as it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 18415 len. 43]: she said , ` as sech a dear , good , reverend creetur never got into the clutches of Betsey Prig , which but for me he would have done , undoubted ; facts bein ' stubborn and not easy drove ! '
Parsing [sent. 18416 len. 20]: ` You heard me speak to you just now , old man , ' said Jonas to his uncle .
Parsing [sent. 18417 len. 15]: ` I 'll have no more tampering with my people , man or woman .
Parsing [sent. 18418 len. 7]: Do you see the door ? '
Parsing [sent. 18419 len. 8]: ` Do YOU see the door ? '
Parsing [sent. 18420 len. 11]: returned the voice of Mark , coming from that direction .
Parsing [sent. 18421 len. 6]: ` Look at it ! '
Parsing [sent. 18422 len. 10]: He looked , and his gaze was nailed there .
Parsing [sent. 18423 len. 57]: Fatal , ill-omened blighted threshold , cursed by his father 's footsteps in his dying hour , cursed by his young wife 's sorrowing tread , cursed by the daily shadow of the old clerk 's figure , cursed by the crossing of his murderer 's feet -- what men were standing in the door way !
Parsing [sent. 18424 len. 3]: Nadgett foremost .
Parsing [sent. 18425 len. 2]: Hark !
Parsing [sent. 18426 len. 9]: It came on , roaring like a sea !
Parsing [sent. 18427 len. 79]: Hawkers burst into the street , crying it up and down ; windows were thrown open that the inhabitants might hear it ; people stopped to listen in the road and on the pavement ; the bells , the same bells , began to ring ; tumbling over one another in a dance of boisterous joy at the discovery -LRB- that was the sound they had in his distempered thoughts -RRB- , and making their airy play-ground rock .
Parsing [sent. 18428 len. 10]: ` That is the man , ' said Nadgett .
Parsing [sent. 18429 len. 6]: ` By the window ! '
Parsing [sent. 18430 len. 14]: Three others came in , laid hands upon him , and secured him .
Parsing [sent. 18431 len. 27]: It was so quickly done , that he had not lost sight of the informer 's face for an instant when his wrists were manacled together .
Parsing [sent. 18432 len. 14]: ` Murder , ' said Nadgett , looking round on the astonished group .
Parsing [sent. 18433 len. 7]: ` Let no one interfere . '
Parsing [sent. 18434 len. 11]: The sounding street repeated Murder ; barbarous and dreadful Murder .
Parsing [sent. 18435 len. 6]: Murder , Murder , Murder .
Parsing [sent. 18436 len. 32]: Rolling on from house to house , and echoing from stone to stone , until the voices died away into the distant hum , which seemed to mutter the same word !
Parsing [sent. 18437 len. 21]: They all stood silent : listening , and gazing in each other 's faces , as the noise passed on .
Parsing [sent. 18438 len. 8]: Old Martin was the first to speak .
Parsing [sent. 18439 len. 8]: ` What terrible history is this ? '
Parsing [sent. 18440 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 18441 len. 8]: ` Ask HIM , ' said Nadgett .
Parsing [sent. 18442 len. 8]: ` You 're his friend , sir .
Parsing [sent. 18443 len. 9]: He can tell you , if he will .
Parsing [sent. 18444 len. 15]: He knows more of it than I do , though I know much . '
Parsing [sent. 18445 len. 9]: ` How do you know much ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 18446 len. 16]: I have not been watching him so long for nothing , ' returned Nadgett . '
Parsing [sent. 18447 len. 14]: I never watched a man so close as I have watched him . '
Parsing [sent. 18448 len. 10]: Another of the phantom forms of this terrific Truth !
Parsing [sent. 18449 len. 17]: Another of the many shapes in which it started up about him , out of vacancy .
Parsing [sent. 18450 len. 40]: This man , of all men in the world , a spy upon him ; this man , changing his identity ; casting off his shrinking , purblind , unobservant character , and springing up into a watchful enemy !
Parsing [sent. 18451 len. 19]: The dead man might have come out of his grave , and not confounded and appalled him more .
Parsing [sent. 18452 len. 5]: The game was up .
Parsing [sent. 18453 len. 15]: The race was at an end ; the rope was woven for his neck .
Parsing [sent. 18454 len. 74]: If , by a miracle , he could escape from this strait , he had but to turn his face another way , no matter where , and there would rise some new avenger front to front with him ; some infant in an hour grown old , or old man in an hour grown young , or blind man with his sight restored , or deaf man with his hearing given him .
Parsing [sent. 18455 len. 5]: There was no chance .
Parsing [sent. 18456 len. 19]: He sank down in a heap against the wall , and never hoped again from that moment . '
Parsing [sent. 18457 len. 21]: I am not his friend , although I have the honour to be his relative , ' said Mr Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 18458 len. 7]: ` You may speak to me .
Parsing [sent. 18459 len. 13]: Where have you watched , and what have you seen ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 18460 len. 16]: I have watched in many places , ' returned Nadgett , ` night and day .
Parsing [sent. 18461 len. 23]: I have watched him lately , almost without rest or relief ; ' his anxious face and bloodshot eyes confirmed it . '
Parsing [sent. 18462 len. 11]: I little thought to what my watching was to lead .
Parsing [sent. 18463 len. 29]: As little as he did when he slipped out in the night , dressed in those clothes which he afterwards sunk in a bundle at London Bridge ! '
Parsing [sent. 18464 len. 12]: Jonas moved upon the ground like a man in bodily torture .
Parsing [sent. 18465 len. 41]: He uttered a suppressed groan , as if he had been wounded by some cruel weapon ; and plucked at the iron band upon his wrists , as though -LRB- his hands being free -RRB- he would have torn himself .
Parsing [sent. 18466 len. 6]: ` Steady , kinsman ! '
Parsing [sent. 18467 len. 8]: said the chief officer of the party .
Parsing [sent. 18468 len. 7]: ` Do n't be violent . '
Parsing [sent. 18469 len. 8]: ` Whom do you call kinsman ? '
Parsing [sent. 18470 len. 5]: asked old Martin sternly .
Parsing [sent. 18471 len. 13]: ` You , ' said the man , ` among others . '
Parsing [sent. 18472 len. 8]: Martin turned his scrutinizing gaze upon him .
Parsing [sent. 18473 len. 39]: He was sitting lazily across a chair with his arms resting on the back ; eating nuts , and throwing the shells out of window as he cracked them , which he still continued to do while speaking .
Parsing [sent. 18474 len. 12]: ` Aye , ' he said , with a sulky nod .
Parsing [sent. 18475 len. 23]: ` You may deny your nephews till you die ; but Chevy Slyme is Chevy Slyme still , all the world over .
Parsing [sent. 18476 len. 19]: Perhaps even you may feel it some disgrace to your own blood to be employed in this way .
Parsing [sent. 18477 len. 8]: I 'm to be bought off . '
Parsing [sent. 18478 len. 6]: ` At every turn ! '
Parsing [sent. 18479 len. 3]: cried Martin .
Parsing [sent. 18480 len. 7]: ` Self , self , self .
Parsing [sent. 18481 len. 8]: Every one among them for himself ! '
Parsing [sent. 18482 len. 27]: ` You had better save one or two among them the trouble then and be for them as well as YOURself , ' replied his nephew .
Parsing [sent. 18483 len. 6]: ` Look here at me !
Parsing [sent. 18484 len. 34]: Can you see the man of your family who has more talent in his little finger than all the rest in their united brains , dressed as a police officer without being ashamed ?
Parsing [sent. 18485 len. 12]: I took up with this trade on purpose to shame you .
Parsing [sent. 18486 len. 18]: I did n't think I should have to make a capture in the family , though . '
Parsing [sent. 18487 len. 30]: ` If your debauchery , and that of your chosen friends , has really brought you to this level , ' returned the old man , ` keep it .
Parsing [sent. 18488 len. 14]: You are living honestly , I hope , and that 's something . '
Parsing [sent. 18489 len. 24]: ` Do n't be hard upon my chosen friends , ' returned Slyme , ` for they were sometimes your chosen friends too .
Parsing [sent. 18490 len. 15]: Do n't say you never employed my friend Tigg , for I know better .
Parsing [sent. 18491 len. 7]: We quarrelled upon it . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18492 len. 17]: I hired the fellow , ' retorted Mr Chuzzlewit , ` and I paid him . '
Parsing [sent. 18493 len. 25]: ` It 's well you paid him , ' said his nephew , ` for it would be too late to do so now .
Parsing [sent. 18494 len. 17]: He has given his receipt in full ; or had it forced from him rather . '
Parsing [sent. 18495 len. 25]: The old man looked at him as if he were curious to know what he meant , but scorned to prolong the conversation . '
Parsing [sent. 18496 len. 65]: I have always expected that he and I would be brought together again in the course of business , ' said Slyme , taking a fresh handful of nuts from his pocket ; ` but I thought he would be wanted for some swindling job ; it never entered my head that I should hold a warrant for the apprehension of his murderer . '
Parsing [sent. 18497 len. 5]: ` HIS murderer ! '
Parsing [sent. 18498 len. 10]: cried Mr Chuzzlewit , looking from one to another .
Parsing [sent. 18499 len. 11]: ` His or Mr Montague 's , ' said Nadgett .
Parsing [sent. 18500 len. 10]: ` They are the same , I am told .
Parsing [sent. 18501 len. 23]: I accuse him yonder of the murder of Mr Montague , who was found last night , killed , in a wood .
Parsing [sent. 18502 len. 20]: You will ask me why I accuse him as you have already asked me how I know so much .
Parsing [sent. 18503 len. 5]: I 'll tell you .
Parsing [sent. 18504 len. 9]: It ca n't remain a secret long . '
Parsing [sent. 18505 len. 29]: The ruling passion of the man expressed itself even then , in the tone of regret in which he deplored the approaching publicity of what he knew . '
Parsing [sent. 18506 len. 13]: I told you I had watched him , ' he proceeded . '
Parsing [sent. 18507 len. 20]: I was instructed to do so by Mr Montague , in whose employment I have been for some time .
Parsing [sent. 18508 len. 32]: We had our suspicions of him ; and you know what they pointed at , for you have been discussing it since we have been waiting here , outside the room .
Parsing [sent. 18509 len. 86]: If you care to hear , now it 's all over , in what our suspicions began , I 'll tell you plainly : in a quarrel -LRB- it first came to our ears through a hint of his own -RRB- between him and another office in which his father 's life was insured , and which had so much doubt and distrust upon the subject , that he compounded with them , and took half the money ; and was glad to do it .
Parsing [sent. 18510 len. 17]: Bit by bit , I ferreted out more circumstances against him , and not a few .
Parsing [sent. 18511 len. 12]: It required a little patience , but it 's my calling .
Parsing [sent. 18512 len. 29]: I found the nurse -- here she is to confirm me ; I found the doctor , I found the undertaker , I found the undertaker 's man .
Parsing [sent. 18513 len. 41]: I found out how the old gentleman there , Mr Chuffey , had behaved at the funeral ; and I found out what this man , ' touching Lewsome on the arm , ` had talked about in his fever .
Parsing [sent. 18514 len. 60]: I found out how he conducted himself before his father 's death , and how since and how at the time ; and writing it all down , and putting it carefully together , made case enough for Mr Montague to tax him with the crime , which -LRB- as he himself believed until to-night -RRB- he had committed .
Parsing [sent. 18515 len. 8]: I was by when this was done .
Parsing [sent. 18516 len. 5]: You see him now .
Parsing [sent. 18517 len. 10]: He is only worse than he was then . '
Parsing [sent. 18518 len. 7]: Oh , miserable , miserable fool !
Parsing [sent. 18519 len. 7]: oh , insupportable , excruciating torture !
Parsing [sent. 18520 len. 25]: To find alive and active -- a party to it all -- the brain and right-hand of the secret he had thought to crush !
Parsing [sent. 18521 len. 27]: In whom , though he had walled the murdered man up , by enchantment in a rock , the story would have lived and walked abroad !
Parsing [sent. 18522 len. 19]: He tried to stop his ears with his fettered arms , that he might shut out the rest .
Parsing [sent. 18523 len. 21]: As he crouched upon the floor , they drew away from him as if a pestilence were in his breath .
Parsing [sent. 18524 len. 22]: They fell off , one by one , from that part of the room , leaving him alone upon the ground .
Parsing [sent. 18525 len. 30]: Even those who had him in their keeping shunned him , and -LRB- with the exception of Slyme , who was still occupied with his nuts -RRB- kept apart .
Parsing [sent. 18526 len. 29]: ` From that garret-window opposite , ' said Nadgett , pointing across the narrow street , ' I have watched this house and him for days and nights .
Parsing [sent. 18527 len. 25]: From that garret-window opposite I saw him return home , alone , from a journey on which he had set out with Mr Montague .
Parsing [sent. 18528 len. 33]: That was my token that Mr Montague 's end was gained ; and I might rest easy on my watch , though I was not to leave it until he dismissed me .
Parsing [sent. 18529 len. 37]: But , standing at the door opposite , after dark that same night , I saw a countryman steal out of this house , by a side-door in the court , who had never entered it .
Parsing [sent. 18530 len. 13]: I knew his walk , and that it was himself , disguised .
Parsing [sent. 18531 len. 5]: I followed him immediately .
Parsing [sent. 18532 len. 13]: I lost him on the western road , still travelling westward . '
Parsing [sent. 18533 len. 15]: Jonas looked up at him for an instant , and muttered an oath . '
Parsing [sent. 18534 len. 30]: I could not comprehend what this meant , ' said Nadgett ; ` but , having seen so much , I resolved to see it out , and through .
Parsing [sent. 18535 len. 4]: And I did .
Parsing [sent. 18536 len. 58]: Learning , on inquiry at his house from his wife , that he was supposed to be sleeping in the room from which I had seen him go out , and that he had given strict orders not to be disturbed , I knew that he was coming back ; and for his coming back I watched .
Parsing [sent. 18537 len. 41]: I kept my watch in the street -- in doorways , and such places -- all that night ; at the same window , all next day ; and when night came on again , in the street once more .
Parsing [sent. 18538 len. 23]: For I knew he would come back , as he had gone out , when this part of the town was empty .
Parsing [sent. 18539 len. 3]: He did .
Parsing [sent. 18540 len. 17]: Early in the morning , the same countryman came creeping , creeping , creeping home . '
Parsing [sent. 18541 len. 5]: ` Look sharp ! '
Parsing [sent. 18542 len. 10]: interposed Slyme , who had now finished his nuts .
Parsing [sent. 18543 len. 11]: ` This is quite irregular , Mr Nadgett . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18544 len. 17]: I kept at the window all day , ' said Nadgett , without heeding him . '
Parsing [sent. 18545 len. 8]: I think I never closed my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 18546 len. 12]: At night , I saw him come out with a bundle .
Parsing [sent. 18547 len. 5]: I followed him again .
Parsing [sent. 18548 len. 16]: He went down the steps at London Bridge , and sunk it in the river .
Parsing [sent. 18549 len. 35]: I now began to entertain some serious fears , and made a communication to the Police , which caused that bundle to be -- ' ` To be fished up , ' interrupted Slyme .
Parsing [sent. 18550 len. 8]: ` Be alive , Mr Nadgett . '
Parsing [sent. 18551 len. 25]: ` It contained the dress I had seen him wear , ' said Nadgett ; ` stained with clay , and spotted with blood .
Parsing [sent. 18552 len. 11]: Information of the murder was received in town last night .
Parsing [sent. 18553 len. 55]: The wearer of that dress is already known to have been seen near the place ; to have been lurking in that neighbourhood ; and to have alighted from a coach coming from that part of the country , at a time exactly tallying with the very minute when I saw him returning home .
Parsing [sent. 18554 len. 17]: The warrant has been out , and these officers have been with me , some hours .
Parsing [sent. 18555 len. 60]: We chose our time ; and seeing you come in , and seeing this person at the window -- ' ` Beckoned to him , ' said Mark , taking up the thread of the narrative , on hearing this allusion to himself , ` to open the door ; which he did with a deal of pleasure . '
Parsing [sent. 18556 len. 49]: ` That 's all at present , ' said Nadgett , putting up his great pocketbook , which from mere habit he had produced when he began his revelation , and had kept in his hand all the time ; ` but there is plenty more to come .
Parsing [sent. 18557 len. 23]: You asked me for the facts , so far I have related them , and need not detain these gentlemen any longer .
Parsing [sent. 18558 len. 8]: Are you ready , Mr Slyme ? '
Parsing [sent. 18559 len. 12]: ` And something more , ' replied that worthy , rising .
Parsing [sent. 18560 len. 18]: ` If you walk round to the office , we shall be there as soon as you .
Parsing [sent. 18561 len. 2]: Tom !
Parsing [sent. 18562 len. 5]: Get a coach ! '
Parsing [sent. 18563 len. 11]: The officer to whom he spoke departed for that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 18564 len. 53]: Old Martin lingered for a few moments , as if he would have addressed some words to Jonas ; but looking round , and seeing him still seated on the floor , rocking himself in a savage manner to and fro , took Chuffey 's arm , and slowly followed Nadgett out .
Parsing [sent. 18565 len. 8]: John Westlock and Mark Tapley accompanied them .
Parsing [sent. 18566 len. 42]: Mrs Gamp had tottered out first , for the better display of her feelings , in a kind of walking swoon ; for Mrs Gamp performed swoons of different sorts , upon a moderate notice , as Mr Mould did Funerals .
Parsing [sent. 18567 len. 4]: ` Ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 18568 len. 7]: muttered Slyme , looking after them .
Parsing [sent. 18569 len. 5]: ` Upon my soul !
Parsing [sent. 18570 len. 33]: As insensible of being disgraced by having such a nephew as myself , in such a situation , as he was of my being an honour and a credit to the family !
Parsing [sent. 18571 len. 27]: That 's the return I get for having humbled my spirit -- such a spirit as mine -- to earn a livelihood , is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 18572 len. 13]: He got up from his chair , and kicked it away indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 18573 len. 7]: ` And such a livelihood too !
Parsing [sent. 18574 len. 25]: When there are hundreds of men , not fit to hold a candle to me , rolling in carriages and living on their fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 18575 len. 10]: Upon my soul it 's a nice world ! '
Parsing [sent. 18576 len. 21]: His eyes encountered Jonas , who looked earnestly towards him , and moved his lips as if he were whispering .
Parsing [sent. 18577 len. 4]: ` Eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 18578 len. 3]: said Slyme .
Parsing [sent. 18579 len. 24]: Jonas glanced at the attendant whose back was towards him , and made a clumsy motion with his bound hands towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 18580 len. 4]: ` Humph ! '
Parsing [sent. 18581 len. 6]: said Slyme , thoughtfully . '
Parsing [sent. 18582 len. 20]: I could n't hope to disgrace him into anything when you have shot so far ahead of me though .
Parsing [sent. 18583 len. 5]: I forgot that . '
Parsing [sent. 18584 len. 8]: Jonas repeated the same look and gesture .
Parsing [sent. 18585 len. 4]: ` Jack ! '
Parsing [sent. 18586 len. 3]: said Slyme .
Parsing [sent. 18587 len. 4]: ` Hallo ! '
Parsing [sent. 18588 len. 4]: returned his man .
Parsing [sent. 18589 len. 12]: ` Go down to the door , ready for the coach .
Parsing [sent. 18590 len. 6]: Call out when it comes .
Parsing [sent. 18591 len. 7]: I 'd rather have you there .
Parsing [sent. 18592 len. 18]: Now then , ' he added , turning hastily to Jonas , when the man was gone .
Parsing [sent. 18593 len. 7]: ` What 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 18594 len. 5]: Jonas essayed to rise .
Parsing [sent. 18595 len. 9]: ` Stop a bit , ' said Slyme .
Parsing [sent. 18596 len. 13]: ` It 's not so easy when your wrists are tight together .
Parsing [sent. 18597 len. 3]: Now then !
Parsing [sent. 18598 len. 2]: Up !
Parsing [sent. 18599 len. 5]: What is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 18600 len. 8]: ` Put your hand in my pocket .
Parsing [sent. 18601 len. 2]: Here !
Parsing [sent. 18602 len. 9]: The breast pocket , on the left ! '
Parsing [sent. 18603 len. 3]: said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 18604 len. 10]: He did so ; and drew out a purse .
Parsing [sent. 18605 len. 33]: ` There 's a hundred pound in it , ' said Jonas , whose words were almost unintelligible ; as his face , in its pallor and agony , was scarcely human .
Parsing [sent. 18606 len. 17]: Slyme looked at him ; gave it into his hands ; and shook his head . '
Parsing [sent. 18607 len. 4]: I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 18608 len. 4]: I dare n't .
Parsing [sent. 18609 len. 7]: I could n't if I dared .
Parsing [sent. 18610 len. 15]: Those fellows below -- ' ` Escape 's impossible , ' said Jonas . '
Parsing [sent. 18611 len. 4]: I know it .
Parsing [sent. 18612 len. 13]: One hundred pound for only five minutes in the next room ! '
Parsing [sent. 18613 len. 6]: ` What to do ? '
Parsing [sent. 18614 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 18615 len. 19]: The face of his prisoner as he advanced to whisper in his ear , made him recoil involuntarily .
Parsing [sent. 18616 len. 8]: But he stopped and listened to him .
Parsing [sent. 18617 len. 16]: The words were few , but his own face changed as he heard them . '
Parsing [sent. 18618 len. 29]: I have it about me , ' said Jonas , putting his hands to his throat , as though whatever he referred to were hidden in his neckerchief .
Parsing [sent. 18619 len. 8]: ` How should you know of it ?
Parsing [sent. 18620 len. 5]: How could you know ?
Parsing [sent. 18621 len. 12]: A hundred pound for only five minutes in the next room !
Parsing [sent. 18622 len. 5]: The time 's passing .
Parsing [sent. 18623 len. 3]: Speak ! '
Parsing [sent. 18624 len. 21]: ` It would be more -- more creditable to the family , ' observed Slyme , with trembling lips . '
Parsing [sent. 18625 len. 11]: I wish you had n't told me half so much .
Parsing [sent. 18626 len. 7]: Less would have served your purpose .
Parsing [sent. 18627 len. 10]: You might have kept it to yourself . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18628 len. 12]: A hundred pound for only five minutes in the next room !
Parsing [sent. 18629 len. 3]: Speak ! '
Parsing [sent. 18630 len. 5]: cried Jonas , desperately .
Parsing [sent. 18631 len. 5]: He took the purse .
Parsing [sent. 18632 len. 17]: Jonas , with a wild unsteady step , retreated to the door in the glass partition .
Parsing [sent. 18633 len. 4]: ` Stop ! '
Parsing [sent. 18634 len. 9]: cried Slyme , catching at his skirts . '
Parsing [sent. 18635 len. 7]: I do n't know about this .
Parsing [sent. 18636 len. 8]: Yet it must end so at last .
Parsing [sent. 18637 len. 5]: Are you guilty ? '
Parsing [sent. 18638 len. 4]: ` Yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 18639 len. 3]: said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 18640 len. 12]: ` Are the proofs as they were told just now ? '
Parsing [sent. 18641 len. 4]: ` Yes ! '
Parsing [sent. 18642 len. 3]: said Jonas .
Parsing [sent. 18643 len. 23]: ` Will you -- will you engage to say a -- a Prayer , now , or something of that sort ? '
Parsing [sent. 18644 len. 3]: faltered Slyme .
Parsing [sent. 18645 len. 14]: Jonas broke from him without replying , and closed the door between them .
Parsing [sent. 18646 len. 6]: Slyme listened at the keyhole .
Parsing [sent. 18647 len. 23]: After that , he crept away on tiptoe , as far off as he could ; and looked awfully towards the place .
Parsing [sent. 18648 len. 17]: He was roused by the arrival of the coach , and their letting down the steps .
Parsing [sent. 18649 len. 36]: ` He 's getting a few things together , ' he said , leaning out of window , and speaking to the two men below , who stood in the full light of a street-lamp .
Parsing [sent. 18650 len. 18]: ` Keep your eye upon the back , one of you , for form 's sake . '
Parsing [sent. 18651 len. 9]: One of the men withdrew into the court .
Parsing [sent. 18652 len. 53]: The other , seating himself self on the steps of the coach , remained in conversation with Slyme at the window who perhaps had risen to be his superior , in virtue of his old propensity -LRB- one so much lauded by the murdered man -RRB- of being always round the corner .
Parsing [sent. 18653 len. 8]: A useful habit in his present calling .
Parsing [sent. 18654 len. 6]: ` Where is he ? '
Parsing [sent. 18655 len. 4]: asked the man .
Parsing [sent. 18656 len. 25]: Slyme looked into the room for an instant and gave his head a jerk as much as to say , ` Close at hand .
Parsing [sent. 18657 len. 5]: I see him . '
Parsing [sent. 18658 len. 10]: ` He 's booked , ' observed the man .
Parsing [sent. 18659 len. 7]: ` Through , ' said Slyme .
Parsing [sent. 18660 len. 13]: They looked at each other , and up and down the street .
Parsing [sent. 18661 len. 22]: The man on the coach-steps took his hat off , and put it on again , and whistled a little . '
Parsing [sent. 18662 len. 3]: I say !
Parsing [sent. 18663 len. 7]: He 's taking his time ! '
Parsing [sent. 18664 len. 4]: he remonstrated . '
Parsing [sent. 18665 len. 10]: I allowed him five minutes , ' said Slyme .
Parsing [sent. 18666 len. 9]: ` Time 's more than up , though .
Parsing [sent. 18667 len. 7]: I 'll bring him down . '
Parsing [sent. 18668 len. 18]: He withdrew from the window accordingly , and walked on tiptoe to the door in the partition .
Parsing [sent. 18669 len. 3]: He listened .
Parsing [sent. 18670 len. 7]: There was not a sound within .
Parsing [sent. 18671 len. 15]: He set the candles near it , that they might shine through the glass .
Parsing [sent. 18672 len. 20]: It was not easy , he found , to make up his mind to the opening of the door .
Parsing [sent. 18673 len. 16]: But he flung it wide open suddenly , and with a noise ; then retreated .
Parsing [sent. 18674 len. 10]: After peeping in and listening again , he entered .
Parsing [sent. 18675 len. 24]: He started back as his eyes met those of Jonas , standing in an angle of the wall , and staring at him .
Parsing [sent. 18676 len. 11]: His neckerchief was off ; his face was ashy pale .
Parsing [sent. 18677 len. 15]: ` You 're too soon , ' said Jonas , with an abject whimper .
Parsing [sent. 18678 len. 7]: ` I 've not had time .
Parsing [sent. 18679 len. 9]: I have not been able to do it .
Parsing [sent. 18680 len. 10]: I -- five minutes more -- two minutes more !
Parsing [sent. 18681 len. 5]: -- only one ! '
Parsing [sent. 18682 len. 25]: Slyme gave him no reply , but thrusting the purse upon him and forcing it back into his pocket , called up his men .
Parsing [sent. 18683 len. 31]: He whined , and cried , and cursed , and entreated them , and struggled , and submitted , in the same breath , and had no power to stand .
Parsing [sent. 18684 len. 34]: They got him away and into the coach , where they put him on a seat ; but he soon fell moaning down among the straw at the bottom , and lay there .
Parsing [sent. 18685 len. 7]: The two men were with him .
Parsing [sent. 18686 len. 15]: Slyme being on the box with the driver ; and they let him lie .
Parsing [sent. 18687 len. 36]: Happening to pass a fruiterer 's on their way ; the door of which was open , though the shop was by this time shut ; one of them remarked how faint the peaches smelled .
Parsing [sent. 18688 len. 21]: The other assented at the moment , but presently stooped down in quick alarm , and looked at the prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 18689 len. 5]: ` Stop the coach !
Parsing [sent. 18690 len. 5]: He has poisoned himself !
Parsing [sent. 18691 len. 11]: The smell comes from this bottle in his hand ! '
Parsing [sent. 18692 len. 8]: The hand had shut upon it tight .
Parsing [sent. 18693 len. 28]: With that rigidity of grasp with which no living man , in the full strength and energy of life , can clutch a prize he has won .
Parsing [sent. 18694 len. 29]: They dragged him out into the dark street ; but jury , judge , and hangman , could have done no more , and could do nothing now .
Parsing [sent. 18695 len. 6]: Dead , dead , dead .
Parsing [sent. 18696 len. 70]: CHAPTER FIFTY -- TWO IN WHICH THE TABLES ARE TURNED , COMPLETELY UPSIDE DOWN Old Martin 's cherished projects , so long hidden in his own breast , so frequently in danger of abrupt disclosure through the bursting forth of the indignation he had hoarded up during his residence with Mr Pecksniff , were retarded , but not beyond a few hours , by the occurrences just now related .
Parsing [sent. 18697 len. 114]: Stunned , as he had been at first by the intelligence conveyed to him through Tom Pinch and John Westlock , of the supposed manner of his brother 's death ; overwhelmed as he was by the subsequent narratives of Chuffey and Nadgett , and the forging of that chain of circumstances ending in the death of Jonas , of which catastrophe he was immediately informed ; scattered as his purposes and hopes were for the moment , by the crowding in of all these incidents between him and his end ; still their very intensity and the tumult of their assemblage nerved him to the rapid and unyielding execution of his scheme .
Parsing [sent. 18698 len. 25]: In every single circumstance , whether it were cruel , cowardly , or false , he saw the flowering of the same pregnant seed .
Parsing [sent. 18699 len. 36]: Self ; grasping , eager , narrow-ranging , overreaching self ; with its long train of suspicions , lusts , deceits , and all their growing consequences ; was the root of the vile tree .
Parsing [sent. 18700 len. 72]: Mr Pecksniff had so presented his character before the old man 's eyes , that he -- the good , the tolerant , enduring Pecksniff -- had become the incarnation of all selfishness and treachery ; and the more odious the shapes in which those vices ranged themselves before him now , the sterner consolation he had in his design of setting Mr Pecksniff right and Mr Pecksniff 's victims too .
Parsing [sent. 18701 len. 62]: To this work he brought , not only the energy and determination natural to his character -LRB- which , as the reader may have observed in the beginning of his or her acquaintance with this gentleman , was remarkable for the strong development of those qualities -RRB- , but all the forced and unnaturally nurtured energy consequent upon their long suppression .
Parsing [sent. 18702 len. 58]: And these two tides of resolution setting into one and sweeping on , became so strong and vigorous , that , to prevent themselves from being carried away before it , Heaven knows where , was as much as John Westlock and Mark Tapley together -LRB- though they were tolerably energetic too -RRB- could manage to effect .
Parsing [sent. 18703 len. 26]: He had sent for John Westlock immediately on his arrival ; and John , under the conduct of Tom Pinch , had waited on him .
Parsing [sent. 18704 len. 44]: Having a lively recollection of Mr Tapley , he had caused that gentleman 's attendance to be secured , through John 's means , without delay ; and thus , as we have seen , they had all repaired together to the City .
Parsing [sent. 18705 len. 29]: But his grandson he had refused to see until to-morrow , when Mr Tapley was instructed to summon him to the Temple at ten o'clock in the forenoon .
Parsing [sent. 18706 len. 82]: Tom he would not allow to be employed in anything , lest he should be wrongfully suspected ; but he was a party to all their proceedings , and was with them until late at night -- until after they knew of the death of Jonas ; when he went home to tell all these wonders to little Ruth , and to prepare her for accompanying him to the Temple in the morning , agreeably to Mr Chuzzlewit 's particular injunction .
Parsing [sent. 18707 len. 65]: It was characteristic of old Martin , and his looking on to something which he had distinctly before him , that he communicated to them nothing of his intentions , beyond such hints of reprisal on Mr Pecksniff as they gathered from the game he had played in that gentleman 's house , and the brightening of his eyes whenever his name was mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 18708 len. 34]: Even to John Westlock , in whom he was evidently disposed to place great confidence -LRB- which may indeed be said of every one of them -RRB- , he gave no explanation whatever .
Parsing [sent. 18709 len. 31]: He merely requested him to return in the morning ; and with this for their utmost satisfaction , they left him , when the night was far advanced , alone .
Parsing [sent. 18710 len. 36]: The events of such a day might have worn out the body and spirit of a much younger man than he , but he sat in deep and painful meditation until the morning was bright .
Parsing [sent. 18711 len. 48]: Nor did he even then seek any prolonged repose , but merely slumbered in his chair , until seven o'clock , when Mr Tapley had appointed to come to him by his desire ; and came -- as fresh and clean and cheerful as the morning itself .
Parsing [sent. 18712 len. 28]: ` You are punctual , ' said Mr Chuzzlewit , opening the door to him in reply to his light knock , which had roused him instantly .
Parsing [sent. 18713 len. 37]: ` My wishes , sir , ' replied Mr Tapley , whose mind would appear from the context to have been running on the matrimonial service , ` is to love , honour , and obey .
Parsing [sent. 18714 len. 9]: The clock 's a-striking now , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 18715 len. 5]: ` Come in ! '
Parsing [sent. 18716 len. 24]: ` Thank ` ee , sir , ' rejoined Mr Tapley , ` what could I do for you first , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 18717 len. 9]: ` You gave my message to Martin ? '
Parsing [sent. 18718 len. 12]: said the old man , bending his eyes upon him . '
Parsing [sent. 18719 len. 28]: I did , sir , ' returned Mark ; ` and you never see a gentleman more surprised in all your born days than he was . '
Parsing [sent. 18720 len. 9]: ` What more did you tell him ? '
Parsing [sent. 18721 len. 4]: Mr Chuzzlewit inquired .
Parsing [sent. 18722 len. 39]: ` Why , sir , ' said Mr Tapley , smiling , ' I should have liked to tell him a deal more , but not being able , sir , I did n't tell it him . '
Parsing [sent. 18723 len. 9]: ` You told him all you knew ? '
Parsing [sent. 18724 len. 14]: ` But it was precious little , sir , ' retorted Mr Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 18725 len. 18]: ` There was very little respectin ' you that I was able to tell him , sir .
Parsing [sent. 18726 len. 34]: I only mentioned my opinion that Mr Pecksniff would find himself deceived , sir , and that you would find yourself deceived , and that he would find himself deceived , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 18727 len. 5]: ` In what ? '
Parsing [sent. 18728 len. 4]: asked Mr Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 18729 len. 7]: ` Meaning him , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 18730 len. 8]: ` Meaning both him and me . '
Parsing [sent. 18731 len. 10]: ` Well , sir , ' said Mr Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 18732 len. 9]: ` In your old opinions of each other .
Parsing [sent. 18733 len. 18]: As to him , sir , and his opinions , I know he 's a altered man .
Parsing [sent. 18734 len. 4]: I know it .
Parsing [sent. 18735 len. 21]: I know 'd it long afore he spoke to you t ` other day , and I must say it .
Parsing [sent. 18736 len. 13]: Nobody do n't know half as much of him as I do .
Parsing [sent. 18737 len. 4]: Nobody ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 18738 len. 21]: There was always a deal of good in him , but a little of it got crusted over , somehow .
Parsing [sent. 18739 len. 26]: I ca n't say who rolled the paste of that ` ere crust myself , but -- ' ` Go on , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 18740 len. 7]: ` Why do you stop ? '
Parsing [sent. 18741 len. 6]: ` But it -- well !
Parsing [sent. 18742 len. 16]: I beg your pardon , but I think it may have been you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 18743 len. 9]: Unintentional I think it may have been you .
Parsing [sent. 18744 len. 16]: I do n't believe that neither of you gave the other quite a fair chance .
Parsing [sent. 18745 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 18746 len. 44]: Now I 've got rid on it , ' said Mr Tapley in a fit of desperation : ' I ca n't go a-carryin ' it about in my own mind , bustin ' myself with it ; yesterday was quite long enough .
Parsing [sent. 18747 len. 5]: It 's out now .
Parsing [sent. 18748 len. 6]: I ca n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 18749 len. 6]: I 'm sorry for it .
Parsing [sent. 18750 len. 13]: Do n't wisit on him , sir , that 's all . '
Parsing [sent. 18751 len. 19]: It was clear that Mark expected to be ordered out immediately , and was quite prepared to go .
Parsing [sent. 18752 len. 28]: ` So you think , ' said Martin , ` that his old faults are , in some degree , of my creation , do you ? '
Parsing [sent. 18753 len. 23]: ` Well , sir , ' retorted Mr Tapley , ` I 'm werry sorry , but I ca n't unsay it .
Parsing [sent. 18754 len. 26]: It 's hardly fair of you , sir , to make a ignorant man conwict himself in this way , but I DO think so .
Parsing [sent. 18755 len. 23]: I am as respectful disposed to you , sir , as a man can be ; but I DO think so . '
Parsing [sent. 18756 len. 28]: The light of a faint smile seemed to break through the dull steadiness of Martin 's face , as he looked attentively at him , without replying .
Parsing [sent. 18757 len. 19]: ` Yet you are an ignorant man , you say , ' he observed after a long pause .
Parsing [sent. 18758 len. 10]: ` Werry much so , ' Mr Tapley replied .
Parsing [sent. 18759 len. 13]: ` And I a learned , well-instructed man , you think ? '
Parsing [sent. 18760 len. 11]: ` Likewise wery much so , ' Mr Tapley answered .
Parsing [sent. 18761 len. 31]: The old man , with his chin resting on his hand , paced the room twice or thrice before he added : ` You have left him this morning ? '
Parsing [sent. 18762 len. 10]: ` Come straight from him now , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 18763 len. 8]: ` For what does he suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 18764 len. 16]: ` He do n't know what to suppose , sir , no more than myself .
Parsing [sent. 18765 len. 30]: I told him jest wot passed yesterday , sir , and that you had said to me , `` Can you be here by seven in the morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18766 len. 23]: and that you had said to him , through me , `` Can you be here by ten in the morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18767 len. 11]: and that I had said `` Yes '' to both .
Parsing [sent. 18768 len. 7]: That 's all , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 18769 len. 11]: His frankness was so genuine that it plainly WAS all .
Parsing [sent. 18770 len. 25]: ` Perhaps , ' said Martin , ` he may think you are going to desert him , and to serve me ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 18771 len. 52]: I have served him in that sort of way , sir , ' replied Mark , without the loss of any atom of his self-possession ; ` and we have been that sort of companions in misfortune , that my opinion is , he do n't believe a word on it .
Parsing [sent. 18772 len. 9]: No more than you do , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 18773 len. 18]: ` Will you help me to dress , and get me some breakfast from the hotel ? '
Parsing [sent. 18774 len. 3]: asked Martin .
Parsing [sent. 18775 len. 10]: ` With pleasure , sir , ' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 18776 len. 42]: ` And by-and-bye , ' said Martin , ` remaining in the room , as I wish you to do , will you attend to the door yonder -- give admission to visitors , I mean , when they knock ? '
Parsing [sent. 18777 len. 10]: ` Certainly , sir , ' said Mr Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 18778 len. 18]: ` You will not find it necessary to express surprise at their appearance , ' Martin suggested .
Parsing [sent. 18779 len. 8]: ` Oh dear no , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 18780 len. 10]: said Mr Tapley , ` not at all . '
Parsing [sent. 18781 len. 21]: Although he pledged himself to this with perfect confidence , he was in a state of unbounded astonishment even now .
Parsing [sent. 18782 len. 51]: Martin appeared to observe it , and to have some sense of the ludicrous bearing of Mr Tapley under these perplexing circumstances ; for , in spite of the composure of his voice and the gravity of his face , the same indistinct light flickered on the latter several times .
Parsing [sent. 18783 len. 38]: Mark bestirred himself , however , to execute the offices with which he was entrusted ; and soon lost all tendency to any outward expression of his surprise , in the occupation of being brisk and busy .
Parsing [sent. 18784 len. 105]: But when he had put Mr Chuzzlewit 's clothes in good order for dressing , and when that gentleman was dressed and sitting at his breakfast , Mr Tapley 's feelings of wonder began to return upon him with great violence ; and , standing beside the old man with a napkin under his arm -LRB- it was as natural and easy to joke to Mark to be a butler in the Temple , as it had been to volunteer as cook on board the Screw -RRB- , he found it difficult to resist the temptation of casting sidelong glances at him very often .
Parsing [sent. 18785 len. 27]: Nay , he found it impossible ; and accordingly yielded to this impulse so often , that Martin caught him in the fact some fifty times .
Parsing [sent. 18786 len. 108]: The extraordinary things Mr Tapley did with his own face when any of these detections occurred ; the sudden occasions he had to rub his eyes or his nose or his chin ; the look of wisdom with which he immediately plunged into the deepest thought , or became intensely interested in the habits and customs of the flies upon the ceiling , or the sparrows out of doors ; or the overwhelming politeness with which he endeavoured to hide his confusion by handing the muffin ; may not unreasonably be assumed to have exercised the utmost power of feature that even Martin Chuzzlewit the elder possessed .
Parsing [sent. 18787 len. 37]: But he sat perfectly quiet and took his breakfast at his leisure , or made a show of doing so , for he scarcely ate or drank , and frequently lapsed into long intervals of musing .
Parsing [sent. 18788 len. 31]: When he had finished , Mark sat down to his breakfast at the same table ; and Mr Chuzzlewit , quite silent still , walked up and down the room .
Parsing [sent. 18789 len. 54]: Mark cleared away in due course , and set a chair out for him , in which , as the time drew on towards ten o'clock , he took his seat , leaning his hands upon his stick , and clenching them upon the handle , and resting his chin on them again .
Parsing [sent. 18790 len. 85]: All his impatience and abstraction of manner had vanished now ; and as he sat there , looking , with his keen eyes , steadily towards the door , Mark could not help thinking what a firm , square , powerful face it was ; or exulting in the thought that Mr Pecksniff , after playing a pretty long game of bowls with its owner , seemed to be at last in a very fair way of coming in for a rubber or two .
Parsing [sent. 18791 len. 28]: Mark 's uncertainty in respect of what was going to be done or said , and by whom to whom , would have excited him in itself .
Parsing [sent. 18792 len. 35]: But knowing for a certainty besides , that young Martin was coming , and in a very few minutes must arrive , he found it by no means easy to remain quiet and silent .
Parsing [sent. 18793 len. 32]: But , excepting that he occasionally coughed in a hollow and unnatural manner to relieve himself , he behaved with great decorum through the longest ten minutes he had ever known .
Parsing [sent. 18794 len. 6]: A knock at the door .
Parsing [sent. 18795 len. 3]: Mr Westlock .
Parsing [sent. 18796 len. 27]: Mr Tapley , in admitting him , raised his eyebrows to the highest possible pitch , implying thereby that he considered himself in an unsatisfactory position .
Parsing [sent. 18797 len. 7]: Mr Chuzzlewit received him very courteously .
Parsing [sent. 18798 len. 19]: Mark waited at the door for Tom Pinch and his sister , who were coming up the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 18799 len. 21]: The old man went to meet them ; took their hands in his ; and kissed her on the cheek .
Parsing [sent. 18800 len. 10]: As this looked promising , Mr Tapley smiled benignantly .
Parsing [sent. 18801 len. 18]: Mr Chuzzlewit had resumed his chair before young Martin , who was close behind them , entered .
Parsing [sent. 18802 len. 15]: The old man , scarcely looking at him , pointed to a distant seat .
Parsing [sent. 18803 len. 13]: This was less encouraging ; and Mr Tapley 's spirits fell again .
Parsing [sent. 18804 len. 11]: He was quickly summoned to the door by another knock .
Parsing [sent. 18805 len. 72]: He did not start , or cry , or tumble down , at sight of Miss Graham and Mrs Lupin , but he drew a very long breath , and came back perfectly resigned , looking on them and on the rest with an expression which seemed to say that nothing could surprise him any more ; and that he was rather glad to have done with that sensation for ever .
Parsing [sent. 18806 len. 17]: The old man received Mary no less tenderly than he had received Tom Pinch 's sister .
Parsing [sent. 18807 len. 23]: A look of friendly recognition passed between himself and Mrs Lupin , which implied the existence of a perfect understanding between them .
Parsing [sent. 18808 len. 28]: It engendered no astonishment in Mr Tapley ; for , as he afterwards observed , he had retired from the business , and sold off the stock .
Parsing [sent. 18809 len. 32]: Not the least curious feature in this assemblage was , that everybody present was so much surprised and embarrassed by the sight of everybody else , that nobody ventured to speak .
Parsing [sent. 18810 len. 6]: Mr Chuzzlewit alone broke silence .
Parsing [sent. 18811 len. 9]: ` Set the door open , Mark ! '
Parsing [sent. 18812 len. 9]: he said ; ` and come here . '
Parsing [sent. 18813 len. 3]: Mark obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 18814 len. 10]: The last appointed footstep sounded now upon the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 18815 len. 5]: They all knew it .
Parsing [sent. 18816 len. 31]: It was Mr Pecksniff 's ; and Mr Pecksniff was in a hurry too , for he came bounding up with such uncommon expedition that he stumbled twice or thrice .
Parsing [sent. 18817 len. 8]: ` Where is my venerable friend ? '
Parsing [sent. 18818 len. 16]: he cried upon the upper landing ; and then with open arms came darting in .
Parsing [sent. 18819 len. 24]: Old Martin merely looked at him ; but Mr Pecksniff started back as if he had received the charge from an electric battery .
Parsing [sent. 18820 len. 8]: ` My venerable friend is well ? '
Parsing [sent. 18821 len. 4]: cried Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 18822 len. 5]: ` Quite well . '
Parsing [sent. 18823 len. 8]: It seemed to reassure the anxious inquirer .
Parsing [sent. 18824 len. 18]: He clasped his hands and , looking upwards with a pious joy , silently expressed his gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 18825 len. 15]: He then looked round on the assembled group , and shook his head reproachfully .
Parsing [sent. 18826 len. 9]: For such a man severely , quite severely .
Parsing [sent. 18827 len. 6]: ` Oh , vermin ! '
Parsing [sent. 18828 len. 4]: said Mr Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 18829 len. 5]: ` Oh , bloodsuckers !
Parsing [sent. 18830 len. 183]: Is it not enough that you have embittered the existence of an individual wholly unparalleled in the biographical records of amiable persons , but must you now , even now , when he has made his election , and reposed his trust in a Numble , but at least sincere and disinterested relative ; must you now , vermin and swarmers -LRB- I regret to make use of these strong expressions , my dear sir , but there are times when honest indignation will not be controlled -RRB- , must you now , vermin and swarmers -LRB- for I WILL repeat it -RRB- , take advantage of his unprotected state , assemble round him from all quarters , as wolves and vultures , and other animals of the feathered tribe assemble round -- I will not say round carrion or a carcass , for Mr Chuzzlewit is quite the contrary -- but round their prey ; their prey ; to rifle and despoil ; gorging their voracious maws , and staining their offensive beaks , with every description of carnivorous enjoyment ! '
Parsing [sent. 18831 len. 22]: As he stopped to fetch his breath , he waved them off , in a solemn manner , with his hand .
Parsing [sent. 18832 len. 9]: ` Horde of unnatural plunderers and robbers ! '
Parsing [sent. 18833 len. 7]: he continued ; ` leave him !
Parsing [sent. 18834 len. 6]: leave him , I say !
Parsing [sent. 18835 len. 2]: Begone !
Parsing [sent. 18836 len. 2]: Abscond !
Parsing [sent. 18837 len. 6]: You had better be off !
Parsing [sent. 18838 len. 61]: Wander over the face of the earth , young sirs , like vagabonds as you are , and do not presume to remain in a spot which is hallowed by the grey hairs of the patriarchal gentleman to whose tottering limbs I have the honour to act as an unworthy , but I hope an unassuming , prop and staff .
Parsing [sent. 18839 len. 40]: And you , my tender sir , ' said Mr Pecksniff , addressing himself in a tone of gentle remonstrance to the old man , ` how could you ever leave me , though even for this short period !
Parsing [sent. 18840 len. 37]: You have absented yourself , I do not doubt , upon some act of kindness to me ; bless you for it ; but you must not do it ; you must not be so venturesome .
Parsing [sent. 18841 len. 15]: I should really be angry with you if I could , my friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 18842 len. 13]: He advanced with outstretched arms to take the old man 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 18843 len. 17]: But he had not seen how the hand clasped and clutched the stick within its grasp .
Parsing [sent. 18844 len. 48]: As he came smiling on , and got within his reach , old Martin , with his burning indignation crowded into one vehement burst , and flashing out of every line and wrinkle in his face , rose up , and struck him down upon the ground .
Parsing [sent. 18845 len. 33]: With such a well-directed nervous blow , that down he went , as heavily and true as if the charge of a Life -- Guardsman had tumbled him out of a saddle .
Parsing [sent. 18846 len. 97]: And whether he was stunned by the shock , or only confused by the wonder and novelty of this warm reception , he did not offer to get up again ; but lay there , looking about him with a disconcerted meekness in his face so enormously ridiculous , that neither Mark Tapley nor John Westlock could repress a smile , though both were actively interposing to prevent a repetition of the blow ; which the old man 's gleaming eyes and vigorous attitude seemed to render one of the most probable events in the world .
Parsing [sent. 18847 len. 5]: ` Drag him away !
Parsing [sent. 18848 len. 8]: Take him out of my reach ! '
Parsing [sent. 18849 len. 11]: said Martin ; ` or I ca n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 18850 len. 16]: The strong restraint I have put upon my hands has been enough to palsy them .
Parsing [sent. 18851 len. 13]: I am not master of myself while he is within their range .
Parsing [sent. 18852 len. 5]: Drag him away ! '
Parsing [sent. 18853 len. 39]: Seeing that he still did not rise , Mr Tapley , without any compromise about it , actually did drag him away , and stick him up on the floor , with his back against the opposite wall .
Parsing [sent. 18854 len. 7]: ` Hear me , rascal ! '
Parsing [sent. 18855 len. 5]: said Mr Chuzzlewit . '
Parsing [sent. 18856 len. 11]: I have summoned you here to witness your own work .
Parsing [sent. 18857 len. 21]: I have summoned you here to witness it , because I know it will be gall and wormwood to you !
Parsing [sent. 18858 len. 28]: I have summoned you here to witness it , because I know the sight of everybody here must be a dagger in your mean , false heart !
Parsing [sent. 18859 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 18860 len. 12]: do you know me as I am , at last ! '
Parsing [sent. 18861 len. 26]: Mr Pecksniff had cause to stare at him , for the triumph in his face and speech and figure was a sight to stare at .
Parsing [sent. 18862 len. 5]: ` Look there ! '
Parsing [sent. 18863 len. 15]: said the old man , pointing at him , and appealing to the rest .
Parsing [sent. 18864 len. 4]: ` Look there !
Parsing [sent. 18865 len. 13]: And then -- come hither , my dear Martin -- look here !
Parsing [sent. 18866 len. 2]: here !
Parsing [sent. 18867 len. 3]: here ! '
Parsing [sent. 18868 len. 15]: At every repetition of the word he pressed his grandson closer to his breast .
Parsing [sent. 18869 len. 29]: ` The passion I felt , Martin , when I dared not do this , ' he said , ` was in the blow I struck just now .
Parsing [sent. 18870 len. 6]: Why did we ever part !
Parsing [sent. 18871 len. 6]: How could we ever part !
Parsing [sent. 18872 len. 11]: How could you ever fly from me to him ! '
Parsing [sent. 18873 len. 15]: Martin was about to answer , but he stopped him , and went on .
Parsing [sent. 18874 len. 10]: ` The fault was mine no less than yours .
Parsing [sent. 18875 len. 24]: Mark has told me so today , and I have known it long ; though not so long as I might have done .
Parsing [sent. 18876 len. 9]: Mary , my love , come here . '
Parsing [sent. 18877 len. 32]: As she trembled and was very pale , he sat her in his own chair , and stood beside it with her hand in his ; and Martin standing by him .
Parsing [sent. 18878 len. 35]: ` The curse of our house , ' said the old man , looking kindly down upon her , ` has been the love of self ; has ever been the love of self .
Parsing [sent. 18879 len. 20]: How often have I said so , when I never knew that I had wrought it upon others . '
Parsing [sent. 18880 len. 34]: He drew one hand through Martin 's arm , and standing so , between them , proceeded thus : ` You all know how I bred this orphan up , to tend me .
Parsing [sent. 18881 len. 58]: None of you can know by what degrees I have come to regard her as a daughter ; for she has won upon me , by her self-forgetfulness , her tenderness , her patience , all the goodness of her nature , when Heaven is her witness that I took but little pains to draw it forth .
Parsing [sent. 18882 len. 11]: It blossomed without cultivation , and it ripened without heat .
Parsing [sent. 18883 len. 29]: I can not find it in my heart to say that I am sorry for it now , or yonder fellow might be holding up his head . '
Parsing [sent. 18884 len. 33]: Mr Pecksniff put his hand into his waistcoat , and slightly shook that part of him to which allusion had been made ; as if to signify that it was still uppermost .
Parsing [sent. 18885 len. 68]: ` There is a kind of selfishness , ' said Martin -- ' I have learned it in my own experience of my own breast -- which is constantly upon the watch for selfishness in others ; and holding others at a distance , by suspicions and distrusts , wonders why they do n't approach , and do n't confide , and calls that selfishness in them .
Parsing [sent. 18886 len. 25]: Thus I once doubted those about me -- not without reason in the beginning -- and thus I once doubted you , Martin . '
Parsing [sent. 18887 len. 13]: ` Not without reason , ' Martin answered , ` either . '
Parsing [sent. 18888 len. 5]: ` Listen , hypocrite !
Parsing [sent. 18889 len. 10]: Listen , smooth-tongued , servile , crawling knave ! '
Parsing [sent. 18890 len. 3]: said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 18891 len. 7]: ` Listen , you shallow dog .
Parsing [sent. 18892 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 18893 len. 23]: When I was seeking him , you had already spread your nets ; you were already fishing for him , were ye ?
Parsing [sent. 18894 len. 28]: When I lay ill in this good woman 's house and your meek spirit pleaded for my grandson , you had already caught him , had ye ?
Parsing [sent. 18895 len. 25]: Counting on the restoration of the love you knew I bore him , you designed him for one of your two daughters did ye ?
Parsing [sent. 18896 len. 32]: Or failing that , you traded in him as a speculation which at any rate should blind me with the lustre of your charity , and found a claim upon me !
Parsing [sent. 18897 len. 14]: Why , even then I knew you , and I told you so .
Parsing [sent. 18898 len. 14]: Did I tell you that I knew you , even then ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 18899 len. 15]: I am not angry , sir , ' said Mr Pecksniff , softly . '
Parsing [sent. 18900 len. 9]: I can bear a great deal from you .
Parsing [sent. 18901 len. 10]: I will never contradict you , Mr Chuzzlewit . '
Parsing [sent. 18902 len. 4]: ` Observe ! '
Parsing [sent. 18903 len. 7]: said Martin , looking round . '
Parsing [sent. 18904 len. 29]: I put myself in that man 's hands on terms as mean and base , and as degrading to himself , as I could render them in words .
Parsing [sent. 18905 len. 51]: I stated them at length to him , before his own children , syllable by syllable , as coarsely as I could , and with as much offence , and with as plain an exposition of my contempt , as words -- not looks and manner merely -- could convey .
Parsing [sent. 18906 len. 20]: If I had only called the angry blood into his face , I would have wavered in my purpose .
Parsing [sent. 18907 len. 19]: If I had only stung him into being a man for a minute I would have abandoned it .
Parsing [sent. 18908 len. 63]: If he had offered me one word of remonstrance , in favour of the grandson whom he supposed I had disinherited ; if he had pleaded with me , though never so faintly , against my appeal to him to abandon him to misery and cast him from his house ; I think I could have borne with him for ever afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 18909 len. 9]: But not a word , not a word .
Parsing [sent. 18910 len. 23]: Pandering to the worst of human passions was the office of his nature ; and faithfully he did his work ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 18911 len. 11]: I am not angry , ' observed Mr Pecksniff . '
Parsing [sent. 18912 len. 23]: I am hurt , Mr Chuzzlewit ; wounded in my feelings ; but I am not angry , my good sir . '
Parsing [sent. 18913 len. 4]: Mr Chuzzlewit resumed .
Parsing [sent. 18914 len. 68]: ` Once resolved to try him , I was resolute to pursue the trial to the end ; but while I was bent on fathoming the depth of his duplicity , I made a sacred compact with myself that I would give him credit on the other side for any latent spark of goodness , honour , forbearance -- any virtue -- that might glimmer in him .
Parsing [sent. 18915 len. 11]: For first to last there has been no such thing .
Parsing [sent. 18916 len. 3]: Not once .
Parsing [sent. 18917 len. 11]: He can not say I have not given him opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 18918 len. 11]: He can not say I have ever led him on .
Parsing [sent. 18919 len. 41]: He can not say I have not left him freely to himself in all things ; or that I have not been a passive instrument in his hands , which he might have used for good as easily as evil .
Parsing [sent. 18920 len. 8]: Or if he can , he Lies !
Parsing [sent. 18921 len. 9]: And that 's his nature , too . '
Parsing [sent. 18922 len. 12]: ` Mr Chuzzlewit , ' interrupted Pecksniff , shedding tears . '
Parsing [sent. 18923 len. 7]: I am not angry , sir .
Parsing [sent. 18924 len. 8]: I can not be angry with you .
Parsing [sent. 18925 len. 54]: But did you never , my dear sir , express a desire that the unnatural young man who by his wicked arts has estranged your good opinion from me , for the time being ; only for the time being ; that your grandson , Mr Chuzzlewit , should be dismissed my house ?
Parsing [sent. 18926 len. 9]: Recollect yourself , my Christian friend . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18927 len. 10]: I have said so , have I not ? '
Parsing [sent. 18928 len. 8]: retorted the old man , sternly . '
Parsing [sent. 18929 len. 36]: I could not tell how far your specious hypocrisy had deceived him , knave ; and knew no better way of opening his eyes than by presenting you before him in your own servile character .
Parsing [sent. 18930 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 18931 len. 6]: I did express that desire .
Parsing [sent. 18932 len. 46]: And you leaped to meet it ; and you met it ; and turning in an instant on the hand you had licked and beslavered , as only such hounds can , you strengthened , and confirmed , and justified me in my scheme . '
Parsing [sent. 18933 len. 19]: Mr Pecksniff made a bow ; a submissive , not to say a grovelling and an abject bow .
Parsing [sent. 18934 len. 23]: If he had been complimented on his practice of the loftiest virtues , he never could have bowed as he bowed then .
Parsing [sent. 18935 len. 33]: ` The wretched man who has been murdered , ' Mr Chuzzlewit went on to say ; ` then passing by the name of -- ' ` Tigg , ' suggested Mark .
Parsing [sent. 18936 len. 51]: ` Of Tigg ; brought begging messages to me on behalf of a friend of his , and an unworthy relative of mine ; and finding him a man well enough suited to my purpose , I employed him to glean some news of you , Martin , for me .
Parsing [sent. 18937 len. 17]: It was from him I learned that you had taken up your abode with yonder fellow .
Parsing [sent. 18938 len. 19]: It was he , who meeting you here in town , one evening -- you remember where ? '
Parsing [sent. 18939 len. 11]: ` At the pawnbroker 's shop , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 18940 len. 20]: ` Yes ; watched you to your lodging , and enabled me to send you a bank-note . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18941 len. 30]: I little thought , ' said Martin , greatly moved , ` that it had come from you ; I little thought that you were interested in my fate .
Parsing [sent. 18942 len. 39]: If I had -- ' ` If you had , ' returned the old man , sorrowfully , ` you would have shown less knowledge of me as I seemed to be , and as I really was .
Parsing [sent. 18943 len. 13]: I hoped to bring you back , Martin , penitent and humbled .
Parsing [sent. 18944 len. 11]: I hoped to distress you into coming back to me .
Parsing [sent. 18945 len. 32]: Much as I loved you , I had that to acknowledge which I could not reconcile it to myself to avow , then , unless you made submission to me first .
Parsing [sent. 18946 len. 7]: Thus it was I lost you .
Parsing [sent. 18947 len. 34]: If I have had , indirectly , any act or part in the fate of that unhappy man , by putting means , however small , within his reach , Heaven forgive me !
Parsing [sent. 18948 len. 32]: I might have known , perhaps , that he would misuse money ; that it was ill-bestowed upon him ; and that sown by his hands it could engender mischief only .
Parsing [sent. 18949 len. 56]: But I never thought of him at that time as having the disposition or ability to be a serious impostor , or otherwise than as a thoughtless , idle-humoured , dissipated spendthrift , sinning more against himself than others , and frequenting low haunts and indulging vicious tastes , to his own ruin only . '
Parsing [sent. 18950 len. 61]: ` Beggin ' your pardon , sir , ' said Mr Tapley , who had Mrs Lupin on his arm by this time , quite agreeably ; ` if I may make so bold as say so , my opinion is , as you was quite correct , and that he turned out perfectly nat ` ral for all that .
Parsing [sent. 18951 len. 46]: There 's surprisin ' number of men sir , who as long as they 've only got their own shoes and stockings to depend upon , will walk down hill , along the gutters quiet enough and by themselves , and not do much harm .
Parsing [sent. 18952 len. 56]: But set any on 'em up with a coach and horses , sir ; and it 's wonderful what a knowledge of drivin ' he 'll show , and how he 'll fill his wehicle with passengers , and start off in the middle of the road , neck or nothing , to the Devil !
Parsing [sent. 18953 len. 37]: Bless your heart , sir , there 's ever so many Tiggs a-passin ' this here Temple-gate any hour in the day , that only want a chance to turn out full-blown Montagues every one ! '
Parsing [sent. 18954 len. 30]: ` Your ignorance , as you call it , Mark , ' said Mr Chuzzlewit , ` is wiser than some men 's enlightenment , and mine among them .
Parsing [sent. 18955 len. 11]: You are right ; not for the first time to-day .
Parsing [sent. 18956 len. 8]: Now hear me out , my dears .
Parsing [sent. 18957 len. 29]: And hear me , you , who , if what I have been told be accurately stated , are Bankrupt in pocket no less than in good name !
Parsing [sent. 18958 len. 19]: And when you have heard me , leave this place , and poison my sight no more ! '
Parsing [sent. 18959 len. 13]: Mr Pecksniff laid his hand upon his breast , and bowed again .
Parsing [sent. 18960 len. 28]: ` The penance I have done in this house , ' said Mr Chuzzlewit , ` has earned this reflection with it constantly , above all others .
Parsing [sent. 18961 len. 38]: That if it had pleased Heaven to visit such infirmity on my old age as really had reduced me to the state in which I feigned to be , I should have brought its misery upon myself .
Parsing [sent. 18962 len. 100]: Oh , you whose wealth , like mine , has been a source of continual unhappiness , leading you to distrust the nearest and dearest , and to dig yourself a living grave of suspicion and reserve ; take heed that , having cast off all whom you might have bound to you , and tenderly , you do not become in your decay the instrument of such a man as this , and waken in another world to the knowledge of such wrong as would embitter Heaven itself , if wrong or you could ever reach it ! '
Parsing [sent. 18963 len. 111]: And then he told them how he had sometimes thought , in the beginning , that love might grow up between Mary and Martin ; and how he had pleased his fancy with the picture of observing it when it was new , and taking them to task , apart , in counterfeited doubt , and then confessing to them that it had been an object dear to his heart ; and by his sympathy with them , and generous provision for their young fortunes , establishing a claim on their affection and regard which nothing should wither , and which should surround his old age with means of happiness .
Parsing [sent. 18964 len. 65]: How in the first dawn of this design , and when the pleasure of such a scheme for the happiness of others was new and indistinct within him , Martin had come to tell him that he had already chosen for himself ; knowing that he , the old man , had some faint project on that head , but ignorant whom it concerned .
Parsing [sent. 18965 len. 72]: How it was little comfort to him to know that Martin had chosen Her , because the grace of his design was lost , and because finding that she had returned his love , he tortured himself with the reflection that they , so young , to whom he had been so kind a benefactor , were already like the world , and bent on their own selfish , stealthy ends .
Parsing [sent. 18966 len. 63]: How in the bitterness of this impression , and of his past experience , he had reproached Martin so harshly -LRB- forgetting that he had never invited his confidence on such a point , and confounding what he had meant to do with what he had done -RRB- , that high words sprung up between them , and they separated in wrath .
Parsing [sent. 18967 len. 12]: How he loved him still , and hoped he would return .
Parsing [sent. 18968 len. 71]: How on the night of his illness at the Dragon , he had secretly written tenderly of him , and made him his heir , and sanctioned his marriage with Mary ; and how , after his interview with Mr Pecksniff , he had distrusted him again , and burnt the paper to ashes , and had lain down in his bed distracted by suspicions , doubts , and regrets .
Parsing [sent. 18969 len. 75]: And then he told them how , resolved to probe this Pecksniff , and to prove the constancy and truth of Mary -LRB- to himself no less than Martin -RRB- , he had conceived and entered on his plan ; and how , beneath her gentleness and patience , he had softened more and more ; still more and more beneath the goodness and simplicity , the honour and the manly faith of Tom .
Parsing [sent. 18970 len. 54]: And when he spoke of Tom , he said God bless him ; and the tears were in his eyes ; for he said that Tom , mistrusted and disliked by him at first , had come like summer rain upon his heart ; and had disposed it to believe in better things .
Parsing [sent. 18971 len. 36]: And Martin took him by the hand , and Mary too , and John , his old friend , stoutly too ; and Mark , and Mrs Lupin , and his sister , little Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 18972 len. 18]: And peace of mind , deep , tranquil peace of mind , was in Tom 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 18973 len. 81]: The old man then related how nobly Mr Pecksniff had performed the duty in which he stood indebted to society , in the matter of Tom 's dismissal ; and how , having often heard disparagement of Mr Westlock from Pecksniffian lips , and knowing him to be a friend to Tom , he had used , through his confidential agent and solicitor , that little artifice which had kept him in readiness to receive his unknown friend in London .
Parsing [sent. 18974 len. 51]: And he called on Mr Pecksniff -LRB- by the name of Scoundrel -RRB- to remember that there again he had not trapped him to do evil , but that he had done it of his own free will and agency ; nay , that he had cautioned him against it .
Parsing [sent. 18975 len. 66]: And once again he called on Mr Pecksniff -LRB- by the name of Hang-dog -RRB- to remember that when Martin coming home at last , an altered man , had sued for the forgiveness which awaited him , he , Pecksniff , had rejected him in language of his own , and had remorsely stepped in between him and the least touch of natural tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 18976 len. 32]: ` For which , ' said the old man , ` if the bending of my finger would remove a halter from your neck , I would n't bend it ! '
Parsing [sent. 18977 len. 41]: ` Martin , ' he added , ` your rival has not been a dangerous one , but Mrs Lupin here has played duenna for some weeks ; not so much to watch your love as to watch her lover .
Parsing [sent. 18978 len. 32]: For that Ghoul ' -- his fertility in finding names for Mr Pecksniff was astonishing -- ` would have crawled into her daily walks otherwise , and polluted the fresh air .
Parsing [sent. 18979 len. 4]: What 's this ?
Parsing [sent. 18980 len. 6]: Her hand is trembling strangely .
Parsing [sent. 18981 len. 8]: See if you can hold it . '
Parsing [sent. 18982 len. 3]: Hold it !
Parsing [sent. 18983 len. 13]: If he clasped it half as tightly as he did her waist .
Parsing [sent. 18984 len. 4]: Well , well !
Parsing [sent. 18985 len. 49]: But it was good in him that even then , in his high fortune and happiness , with her lips nearly printed on his own , and her proud young beauty in his close embrace , he had a hand still left to stretch out to Tom Pinch .
Parsing [sent. 18986 len. 5]: ` Oh , Tom !
Parsing [sent. 18987 len. 3]: Dear Tom !
Parsing [sent. 18988 len. 9]: I saw you , accidentally , coming here .
Parsing [sent. 18989 len. 4]: Forgive me ! '
Parsing [sent. 18990 len. 4]: ` Forgive ! '
Parsing [sent. 18991 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 18992 len. 22]: ` I 'll never forgive you as long as I live , Martin , if you say another syllable about it .
Parsing [sent. 18993 len. 5]: Joy to you both !
Parsing [sent. 18994 len. 11]: Joy , my dear fellow , fifty thousand times . '
Parsing [sent. 18995 len. 2]: Joy !
Parsing [sent. 18996 len. 14]: There is not a blessing on earth that Tom did not wish them .
Parsing [sent. 18997 len. 21]: There is not a blessing on earth that Tom would not have bestowed upon them , if he could . '
Parsing [sent. 18998 len. 37]: I beg your pardon , sir , ' said Mr Tapley , stepping forward , ` but yow was mentionin ' , just now , a lady of the name of Lupin , sir . ' '
Parsing [sent. 18999 len. 12]: I was , ' returned old Martin ` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 19000 len. 10]: It 's a pretty name , sir ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 19001 len. 9]: A very good name , ' said Martin .
Parsing [sent. 19002 len. 16]: ` It seems a ` most a pity to change such a name into Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 19003 len. 7]: Do n't it , sir ? '
Parsing [sent. 19004 len. 3]: said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 19005 len. 7]: ` That depends upon the lady .
Parsing [sent. 19006 len. 6]: What is HER opinion ? '
Parsing [sent. 19007 len. 72]: ` Why , sir , ' said Mr Tapley , retiring , with a bow , towards the buxom hostess , ` her opinion is as the name ai n't a change for the better , but the indiwidual may be , and , therefore , if nobody ai n't acquainted with no jest cause or impediment , et cetrer , the Blue Dragon will be con-werted into the Jolly Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 19008 len. 9]: A sign of my own inwention , sir .
Parsing [sent. 19009 len. 9]: Wery new , conwivial , and expressive ! '
Parsing [sent. 19010 len. 42]: The whole of these proceedings were so agreeable to Mr Pecksniff that he stood with his eyes fixed upon the floor and his hands clasping one another alternately , as if a host of penal sentences were being passed upon him .
Parsing [sent. 19011 len. 23]: Not only did his figure appear to have shrunk , but his discomfiture seemed to have extended itself even to his dress .
Parsing [sent. 19012 len. 42]: His clothes seemed to have grown shabbier , his linen to have turned yellow , his hair to have become lank and frowsy ; his very boots looked villanous and dim , as if their gloss had departed with his own .
Parsing [sent. 19013 len. 37]: Feeling , rather than seeing , that the old man now pointed to the door , he raised his eyes , picked up his hat , and thus addressed him : ` Mr Chuzzlewit , sir !
Parsing [sent. 19014 len. 8]: you have partaken of my hospitality . '
Parsing [sent. 19015 len. 10]: ` And paid for it , ' he observed .
Parsing [sent. 19016 len. 4]: ` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 19017 len. 20]: That savours , ' said Mr Pecksniff , taking out his pocket-handkerchief , ` of your old familiar frankness .
Parsing [sent. 19018 len. 6]: You have paid for it .
Parsing [sent. 19019 len. 8]: I was about to make the remark .
Parsing [sent. 19020 len. 7]: You have deceived me , sir .
Parsing [sent. 19021 len. 4]: Thank you again .
Parsing [sent. 19022 len. 6]: I am glad of it .
Parsing [sent. 19023 len. 24]: To see you in the possession of your health and faculties on any terms , is , in itself , a sufficient recompense .
Parsing [sent. 19024 len. 9]: To have been deceived implies a trusting nature .
Parsing [sent. 19025 len. 6]: Mine is a trusting nature .
Parsing [sent. 19026 len. 6]: I am thankful for it .
Parsing [sent. 19027 len. 20]: I would rather have a trusting nature , do you know , sir , than a doubting one ! '
Parsing [sent. 19028 len. 16]: Here Mr Pecksniff , with a sad smile , bowed , and wiped his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 19029 len. 24]: ` There is hardly any person present , Mr Chuzzlewit , ' said Pecksniff , ` by whom I have not been deceived .
Parsing [sent. 19030 len. 9]: I have forgiven those persons on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 19031 len. 15]: That was my duty ; and , of course , I have done it .
Parsing [sent. 19032 len. 39]: Whether it was worthy of you to partake of my hospitality , and to act the part you did act in my house , that , sir , is a question which I leave to your own conscience .
Parsing [sent. 19033 len. 8]: And your conscience does not acquit you .
Parsing [sent. 19034 len. 7]: No , sir , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 19035 len. 39]: Pronouncing these last words in a loud and solemn voice , Mr Pecksniff was not so absolutely lost in his own fervour as to be unmindful of the expediency of getting a little nearer to the door . '
Parsing [sent. 19036 len. 45]: I have been struck this day , ' said Mr Pecksniff , ` with a walking stick -LRB- which I have every reason to believe has knobs upon it -RRB- , on that delicate and exquisite portion of the human anatomy -- the brain .
Parsing [sent. 19037 len. 23]: Several blows have been inflicted , sir , without a walking-stick , upon that tenderer portion of my frame -- my heart .
Parsing [sent. 19038 len. 13]: You have mentioned , sir , my being bankrupt in my purse .
Parsing [sent. 19039 len. 7]: Yes , sir , I am .
Parsing [sent. 19040 len. 41]: By an unfortunate speculation , combined with treachery , I find myself reduced to poverty ; at a time , sir , when the child of my bosom is widowed , and affliction and disgrace are in my family . '
Parsing [sent. 19041 len. 54]: Here Mr Pecksniff wiped his eyes again , and gave himself two or three little knocks upon the breast , as if he were answering two or three other little knocks from within , given by the tinkling hammer of his conscience , to express ` Cheer up , my boy ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 19042 len. 11]: I know the human mind , although I trust it .
Parsing [sent. 19043 len. 5]: That is my weakness .
Parsing [sent. 19044 len. 32]: Do I not know , sir ' -- here he became exceedingly plaintive and was observed to glance towards Tom Pinch -- ` that my misfortunes bring this treatment on me ?
Parsing [sent. 19045 len. 22]: Do I not know , sir , that but for them I never should have heard what I have heard to-day ?
Parsing [sent. 19046 len. 32]: Do I not know that in the silence and the solitude of night , a little voice will whisper in your ear , Mr Chuzzlewit , `` This was not well .
Parsing [sent. 19047 len. 8]: This was not well , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19048 len. 38]: Think of this , sir -LRB- if you will have the goodness -RRB- , remote from the impulses of passion , and apart from the specialities , if I may use that strong remark , of prejudice .
Parsing [sent. 19049 len. 52]: And if you ever contemplate the silent tomb , sir , which you will excuse me for entertaining some doubt of your doing , after the conduct into which you have allowed yourself to be betrayed this day ; if you ever contemplate the silent tomb sir , think of me .
Parsing [sent. 19050 len. 16]: If you find yourself approaching to the silent tomb , sir , think of me .
Parsing [sent. 19051 len. 28]: If you should wish to have anything inscribed upon your silent tomb , sir , let it be , that I -- ah , my remorseful sir !
Parsing [sent. 19052 len. 18]: that I -- the humble individual who has now the honour of reproaching you , forgave you .
Parsing [sent. 19053 len. 18]: That I forgave you when my injuries were fresh , and when my bosom was newly wrung .
Parsing [sent. 19054 len. 24]: It may be bitterness to you to hear it now , sir , but you will live to seek a consolation in it .
Parsing [sent. 19055 len. 14]: May you find a consolation in it when you want it , sir !
Parsing [sent. 19056 len. 4]: Good morning ! '
Parsing [sent. 19057 len. 9]: With this sublime address , Mr Pecksniff departed .
Parsing [sent. 19058 len. 59]: But the effect of his departure was much impaired by his being immediately afterwards run against , and nearly knocked down , by a monstrously excited little man in velveteen shorts and a very tall hat ; who came bursting up the stairs , and straight into the chambers of Mr Chuzzlewit , as if he were deranged .
Parsing [sent. 19059 len. 10]: ` Is there anybody here that knows him ? '
Parsing [sent. 19060 len. 5]: cried the little man .
Parsing [sent. 19061 len. 9]: ` Is there anybody here that knows him ?
Parsing [sent. 19062 len. 14]: Oh , my stars , is there anybody here that knows him ? '
Parsing [sent. 19063 len. 75]: They looked at each other for an explanation ; but nobody knew anything more than that here was an excited little man with a very tall hat on , running in and out of the room as hard as he could go ; making his single pair of bright blue stockings appear at least a dozen ; and constantly repeating in a shrill voice , ` IS there anybody here that knows him ? '
Parsing [sent. 19064 len. 14]: ` If your brains is not turned topjy turjey , Mr Sweedlepipes ! '
Parsing [sent. 19065 len. 19]: exclaimed another voice , ` hold that there nige of yourn , I beg you , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 19066 len. 33]: At the same time Mrs Gamp was seen in the doorway ; out of breath from coming up so many stairs , and panting fearfully ; but dropping curtseys to the last .
Parsing [sent. 19067 len. 105]: ` Excuge the weakness of the man , ' said Mrs Gamp , eyeing Mr Sweedlepipe with great indignation ; ` and well I might expect it , as I should have know 'd , and wishin ' he was drownded in the Thames afore I had brought him here , which not a blessed hour ago he nearly shaved the noge off from the father of as lovely a family as ever , Mr Chuzzlewit , was born three sets of twins , and would have done it , only he see it a-goin ' in the glass , and dodged the rager .
Parsing [sent. 19068 len. 50]: And never , Mr Sweedlepipes , I do assure you , sir , did I so well know what a misfortun it was to be acquainted with you , as now I do , which so I say , sir , and I do n't deceive you ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 19069 len. 29]: I ask your pardon , ladies and gentlemen all , ' cried the little barber , taking off his hat , ` and yours too , Mrs Gamp .
Parsing [sent. 19070 len. 24]: But -- but , ' he added this half laughing and half crying , ` IS there anybody here that knows him ? '
Parsing [sent. 19071 len. 43]: As the barber said these words , a something in top-boots , with its head bandaged up , staggered into the room , and began going round and round and round , apparently under the impression that it was walking straight forward .
Parsing [sent. 19072 len. 6]: ` Look at him ! '
Parsing [sent. 19073 len. 6]: cried the excited little barber .
Parsing [sent. 19074 len. 5]: ` Here he is !
Parsing [sent. 19075 len. 15]: That 'll soon wear off , and then he 'll be all right again .
Parsing [sent. 19076 len. 9]: He 's no more dead than I am .
Parsing [sent. 19077 len. 7]: He 's all alive and hearty .
Parsing [sent. 19078 len. 6]: Aint you , Bailey ? '
Parsing [sent. 19079 len. 11]: ` R -- r -- reether so , Poll ! '
Parsing [sent. 19080 len. 4]: replied that gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 19081 len. 5]: ` Look here ! '
Parsing [sent. 19082 len. 13]: cried the little barber , laughing and crying in the same breath .
Parsing [sent. 19083 len. 10]: ` When I steady him he comes all right .
Parsing [sent. 19084 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 19085 len. 6]: He 's all right now .
Parsing [sent. 19086 len. 25]: Nothing 's the matter with him now , except that he 's a little shook and rather giddy ; is there , Bailey ? '
Parsing [sent. 19087 len. 14]: ` R -- r -- reether shook , Poll -- reether so ! '
Parsing [sent. 19088 len. 4]: said Mr Bailey .
Parsing [sent. 19089 len. 7]: ` What , my lovely Sairey !
Parsing [sent. 19090 len. 5]: There you air ! '
Parsing [sent. 19091 len. 8]: ` What a boy he is ! '
Parsing [sent. 19092 len. 11]: cried the tender-hearted Poll , actually sobbing over him . '
Parsing [sent. 19093 len. 7]: I never see sech a boy !
Parsing [sent. 19094 len. 6]: It 's all his fun .
Parsing [sent. 19095 len. 6]: He 's full of it .
Parsing [sent. 19096 len. 10]: He shall go into the business along with me .
Parsing [sent. 19097 len. 6]: I am determined he shall .
Parsing [sent. 19098 len. 8]: We 'll make it Sweedlepipe and Bailey .
Parsing [sent. 19099 len. 18]: He shall have the sporting branch -LRB- what a one he 'll be for the matches ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 19100 len. 6]: and me the shavin ' .
Parsing [sent. 19101 len. 17]: I 'll make over the birds to him as soon as ever he 's well enough .
Parsing [sent. 19102 len. 13]: He shall have the little bullfinch in the shop , and all .
Parsing [sent. 19103 len. 6]: He 's sech a boy !
Parsing [sent. 19104 len. 24]: I ask your pardon , ladies and gentlemen , but I thought there might be some one here that know 'd him ! '
Parsing [sent. 19105 len. 40]: Mrs Gamp had observed , not without jealousy and scorn , that a favourable impression appeared to exist in behalf of Mr Sweedlepipe and his young friend ; and that she had fallen rather into the background in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 19106 len. 14]: She now struggled to the front , therefore , and stated her business .
Parsing [sent. 19107 len. 153]: ` Which , Mr Chuzzlewit , ' she said , ` is well beknown to Mrs Harris as has one sweet infant -LRB- though she DO not wish it known -RRB- in her own family by the mother 's side , kep in spirits in a bottle ; and that sweet babe she see at Greenwich Fair , a-travelling in company with a pink-eyed lady , Prooshan dwarf , and livin ' skelinton , which judge her feelings when the barrel organ played , and she was showed her own dear sister 's child , the same not bein ' expected from the outside picter , where it was painted quite contrairy in a livin ' state , a many sizes larger , and performing beautiful upon the Arp , which never did that dear child know or do ; since breathe it never did , to speak on in this wale !
Parsing [sent. 19108 len. 46]: And Mrs Harris , Mr Chuzzlewit , has knowed me many year , and can give you information that the lady which is widdered ca n't do better and may do worse , than let me wait upon her , which I hope to do .
Parsing [sent. 19109 len. 12]: Permittin ' the sweet faces as I see afore me . '
Parsing [sent. 19110 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 19111 len. 4]: said Mr Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 19112 len. 6]: ` Is that your business ?
Parsing [sent. 19113 len. 14]: Was this good person paid for the trouble we gave her ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 19114 len. 15]: I paid her , sir , ' returned Mark Tapley ; ` liberal . '
Parsing [sent. 19115 len. 21]: ` The young man 's words is true , ' said Mrs Gamp , ` and thank you kindly . '
Parsing [sent. 19116 len. 17]: ` Then here we will close our acquaintance , Mrs Gamp , ' retorted Mr Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 19117 len. 11]: ` And Mr Sweedlepipe -- is that your name ? '
Parsing [sent. 19118 len. 31]: ` That is my name , sir , ' replied Poll , accepting with a profusion of gratitude , some chinking pieces which the old man slipped into his hand .
Parsing [sent. 19119 len. 29]: ` Mr Sweedlepipe , take as much care of your lady-lodger as you can , and give her a word or two of good advice now and then .
Parsing [sent. 19120 len. 58]: Such , ' said old Martin , looking gravely at the astonished Mrs Gamp , ` as hinting at the expediency of a little less liquor , and a little more humanity , and a little less regard for herself , and a little more regard for her patients , and perhaps a trifle of additional honesty .
Parsing [sent. 19121 len. 38]: Or when Mrs Gamp gets into trouble , Mr Sweedlepipe , it had better not be at a time when I am near enough to the Old Bailey to volunteer myself as a witness to her character .
Parsing [sent. 19122 len. 15]: Endeavour to impress that upon her at your leisure , if you please . '
Parsing [sent. 19123 len. 43]: Mrs Gamp clasped her hands , turned up her eyes until they were quite invisible , threw back her bonnet for the admission of fresh air to her heated brow ; and in the act of saying faintly -- ` Less liquor !
Parsing [sent. 19124 len. 25]: -- Sairey Gamp -- Bottle on the chimney-piece , and let me put my lips to it , when I am so dispoged ! '
Parsing [sent. 19125 len. 45]: -- fell into one of the walking swoons ; in which pitiable state she was conducted forth by Mr Sweedlepipe , who , between his two patients , the swooning Mrs Gamp and the revolving Bailey , had enough to do , poor fellow .
Parsing [sent. 19126 len. 27]: The old man looked about him , with a smile , until his eyes rested on Tom Pinch 's sister ; when he smiled the more .
Parsing [sent. 19127 len. 42]: ` We will all dine here together , ' he said ; ` and as you and Mary have enough to talk of , Martin , you shall keep house for us until the afternoon , with Mr and Mrs Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 19128 len. 12]: I must see your lodgings in the meanwhile , Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 19129 len. 5]: Tom was quite delighted .
Parsing [sent. 19130 len. 4]: So was Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 19131 len. 6]: She would go with them .
Parsing [sent. 19132 len. 12]: ` Thank you , my love , ' said Mr Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 19133 len. 19]: ` But I am afraid I must take Tom a little out of the way , on business .
Parsing [sent. 19134 len. 10]: Suppose you go on first , my dear ? '
Parsing [sent. 19135 len. 10]: Pretty little Ruth was equally delighted to do that .
Parsing [sent. 19136 len. 13]: ` But not alone , ' said Martin , ` not alone .
Parsing [sent. 19137 len. 12]: Mr Westlock , I dare say , will escort you . '
Parsing [sent. 19138 len. 16]: Why , of course he would : what else had Mr Westlock in his mind ?
Parsing [sent. 19139 len. 7]: How dull these old men are !
Parsing [sent. 19140 len. 10]: ` You are sure you have no engagement ? '
Parsing [sent. 19141 len. 3]: he persisted .
Parsing [sent. 19142 len. 2]: Engagement !
Parsing [sent. 19143 len. 8]: As if he could have any engagement !
Parsing [sent. 19144 len. 6]: So they went off arm-in-arm .
Parsing [sent. 19145 len. 36]: When Tom and Mr Chuzzlewit went off arm-in-arm a few minutes after them , the latter was still smiling ; and really , for a gentleman of his habits , in rather a knowing manner .
Parsing [sent. 19146 len. 96]: CHAPTER FIFTY -- THREE WHAT JOHN WESTLOCK SAID TO TOM PINCH 'S SISTER ; WHAT TOM PINCH 'S SISTER SAID TO JOHN WESTLOCK ; WHAT TOM PINCH SAID TO BOTH OF THEM ; AND HOW THEY ALL PASSED THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY Brilliantly the Temple Fountain sparkled in the sun , and laughingly its liquid music played , and merrily the idle drops of water danced and danced , and peeping out in sport among the trees , plunged lightly down to hide themselves , as little Ruth and her companion came toward it .
Parsing [sent. 19147 len. 20]: And why they came toward the Fountain at all is a mystery ; for they had no business there .
Parsing [sent. 19148 len. 7]: It was not in their way .
Parsing [sent. 19149 len. 8]: It was quite out of their way .
Parsing [sent. 19150 len. 29]: They had no more to do with the Fountain , bless you , than they had with -- with Love , or any out-of-the-way thing of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 19151 len. 24]: It was all very well for Tom and his sister to make appointments by the Fountain , but that was quite another affair .
Parsing [sent. 19152 len. 52]: Because , of course , when she had to wait a minute or two , it would have been very awkward for her to have had to wait in any but a tolerably quiet spot ; but that was as quiet a spot , everything considered , as they could choose .
Parsing [sent. 19153 len. 41]: But when she had John Westlock to take care of her , and was going home with her arm in his -LRB- home being in a different direction altogether -RRB- , their coming anywhere near that Fountain was quite extraordinary .
Parsing [sent. 19154 len. 7]: However , there they found themselves .
Parsing [sent. 19155 len. 22]: And another extraordinary part of the matter was , that they seemed to have come there , by a silent understanding .
Parsing [sent. 19156 len. 33]: Yet when they got there , they were a little confused by being there , which was the strangest part of all ; because there is nothing naturally confusing in a Fountain .
Parsing [sent. 19157 len. 5]: We all know that .
Parsing [sent. 19158 len. 8]: What a good old place it was !
Parsing [sent. 19159 len. 3]: John said .
Parsing [sent. 19160 len. 18]: With quite an earnest affection for it ' A pleasant place indeed , ' said little Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 19161 len. 5]: ` So shady ! '
Parsing [sent. 19162 len. 5]: Oh wicked little Ruth !
Parsing [sent. 19163 len. 12]: They came to a stop when John began to praise it .
Parsing [sent. 19164 len. 61]: The day was exquisite ; and stopping at all , it was quite natural -- nothing could be more so -- that they should glance down Garden Court ; because Garden Court ends in the Garden , and the Garden ends in the River , and that glimpse is very bright and fresh and shining on a summer 's day .
Parsing [sent. 19165 len. 14]: Then , oh , little Ruth , why not look boldly at it !
Parsing [sent. 19166 len. 35]: Why fit that tiny , precious , blessed little foot into the cracked corner of an insensible old flagstone in the pavement ; and be so very anxious to adjust it to a nicety !
Parsing [sent. 19167 len. 43]: If the Fiery-faced matron in the crunched bonnet could have seen them as they walked away , how many years ' purchase might Fiery Face have been disposed to take for her situation in Furnival 's Inn as laundress to Mr Westlock !
Parsing [sent. 19168 len. 11]: They went away , but not through London 's streets !
Parsing [sent. 19169 len. 42]: Through some enchanted city , where the pavements were of air ; where all the rough sounds of a stirring town were softened into gentle music ; where everything was happy ; where there was no distance , and no time .
Parsing [sent. 19170 len. 57]: There were two good-tempered burly draymen letting down big butts of beer into a cellar , somewhere ; and when John helped her -- almost lifted her -- the lightest , easiest , neatest thing you ever saw -- across the rope , they said he owed them a good turn for giving him the chance .
Parsing [sent. 19171 len. 3]: Celestial draymen !
Parsing [sent. 19172 len. 65]: Green pastures in the summer tide , deep-littered straw yards in the winter , no start of corn and clover , ever , to that noble horse who WOULD dance on the pavement with a gig behind him , and who frightened her , and made her clasp his arm with both hands -LRB- both hands meeting one upon the another so endearingly ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 19173 len. 54]: , and caused her to implore him to take refuge in the pastry-cook 's , and afterwards to peep out at the door so shrinkingly ; and then , looking at him with those eyes , to ask him was he sure -- now was he sure -- they might go safely on !
Parsing [sent. 19174 len. 8]: Oh for a string of rampant horses !
Parsing [sent. 19175 len. 26]: For a lion , for a bear , for a mad bull , for anything to bring the little hands together on his arm again !
Parsing [sent. 19176 len. 6]: They talked , of course .
Parsing [sent. 19177 len. 40]: They talked of Tom , and all these changes and the attachment Mr Chuzzlewit had conceived for him , and the bright prospects he had in such a friend , and a great deal more to the same purpose .
Parsing [sent. 19178 len. 71]: The more they talked , the more afraid this fluttering little Ruth became of any pause ; and sooner than have a pause she would say the same things over again ; and if she had n't courage or presence of mind enough for that -LRB- to say the truth she very seldom had -RRB- , she was ten thousand times more charming and irresistible than she had been before .
Parsing [sent. 19179 len. 13]: ` Martin will be married very soon now , I suppose ? '
Parsing [sent. 19180 len. 3]: said John .
Parsing [sent. 19181 len. 5]: She supposed he would .
Parsing [sent. 19182 len. 18]: Never did a bewitching little woman suppose anything in such a faint voice as Ruth supposed that .
Parsing [sent. 19183 len. 21]: But seeing that another of those alarming pauses was approaching , she remarked that he would have a beautiful wife .
Parsing [sent. 19184 len. 7]: Did n't Mr Westlock think so ?
Parsing [sent. 19185 len. 15]: ` Ye -- yes , ' said John , ` oh , yes . '
Parsing [sent. 19186 len. 14]: She feared he was rather hard to please , he spoke so coldly .
Parsing [sent. 19187 len. 11]: ` Rather say already pleased , ' said John . '
Parsing [sent. 19188 len. 6]: I have scarcely seen her .
Parsing [sent. 19189 len. 8]: I had no care to see her .
Parsing [sent. 19190 len. 11]: I had no eyes for HER , this morning . '
Parsing [sent. 19191 len. 5]: Oh , good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 19192 len. 9]: It was well they had reached their destination .
Parsing [sent. 19193 len. 8]: She never could have gone any further .
Parsing [sent. 19194 len. 12]: It would have been impossible to walk in such a tremble .
Parsing [sent. 19195 len. 6]: Tom had not come in .
Parsing [sent. 19196 len. 10]: They entered the triangular parlour together , and alone .
Parsing [sent. 19197 len. 13]: Fiery Face , Fiery Face , how many years ' purchase NOW !
Parsing [sent. 19198 len. 13]: She sat down on the little sofa , and untied her bonnet-strings .
Parsing [sent. 19199 len. 18]: He sat down by her side , and very near her ; very , very near her .
Parsing [sent. 19200 len. 23]: Oh rapid , swelling , bursting little heart , you knew that it would come to this , and hoped it would .
Parsing [sent. 19201 len. 7]: Why beat so wildly , heart !
Parsing [sent. 19202 len. 4]: ` Dear Ruth !
Parsing [sent. 19203 len. 3]: Sweet Ruth !
Parsing [sent. 19204 len. 20]: If I had loved you less , I could have told you that I loved you , long ago .
Parsing [sent. 19205 len. 8]: I have loved you from the first .
Parsing [sent. 19206 len. 21]: There never was a creature in the world more truly loved than you , dear Ruth , by me ! '
Parsing [sent. 19207 len. 9]: She clasped her little hands before her face .
Parsing [sent. 19208 len. 21]: The gushing tears of joy , and pride , and hope , and innocent affection , would not be restrained .
Parsing [sent. 19209 len. 12]: Fresh from her full young heart they came to answer him .
Parsing [sent. 19210 len. 5]: ` My dear love !
Parsing [sent. 19211 len. 34]: If this is -- I almost dare to hope it is , now -- not painful or distressing to you , you make me happier than I can tell , or you imagine .
Parsing [sent. 19212 len. 3]: Darling Ruth !
Parsing [sent. 19213 len. 9]: My own good , gentle , winning Ruth !
Parsing [sent. 19214 len. 21]: I hope I know the value of your heart , I hope I know the worth of your angel nature .
Parsing [sent. 19215 len. 34]: Let me try and show you that I do ; and you will make me happier , Ruth -- ' ` Not happier , ' she sobbed , ` than you make me .
Parsing [sent. 19216 len. 14]: No one can be happier , John , than you make me ! '
Parsing [sent. 19217 len. 6]: Fiery Face , provide yourself !
Parsing [sent. 19218 len. 8]: The usual wages or the usual warning .
Parsing [sent. 19219 len. 8]: It 's all over , Fiery Face .
Parsing [sent. 19220 len. 8]: We need n't trouble you any further .
Parsing [sent. 19221 len. 17]: The little hands could meet each other now , without a rampant horse to urge them .
Parsing [sent. 19222 len. 13]: There was no occasion for lions , bears , or mad bulls .
Parsing [sent. 19223 len. 14]: It could all be done , and infinitely better , without their assistance .
Parsing [sent. 19224 len. 14]: No burly drayman or big butts of beer , were wanted for apologies .
Parsing [sent. 19225 len. 7]: No apology at all was wanted .
Parsing [sent. 19226 len. 45]: The soft light touch fell coyly , but quite naturally , upon the lover 's shoulder ; the delicate waist , the drooping head , the blushing cheek , the beautiful eyes , the exquisite mouth itself , were all as natural as possible .
Parsing [sent. 19227 len. 20]: If all the horses in Araby had run away at once , they could n't have improved upon it .
Parsing [sent. 19228 len. 10]: They soon began to talk of Tom again . '
Parsing [sent. 19229 len. 12]: I hope he will be glad to hear of it ! '
Parsing [sent. 19230 len. 7]: said John , with sparkling eyes .
Parsing [sent. 19231 len. 22]: Ruth drew the little hands a little tighter when he said it , and looked up seriously into his face . '
Parsing [sent. 19232 len. 12]: I am never to leave him , AM I , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 19233 len. 6]: I could never leave Tom .
Parsing [sent. 19234 len. 8]: I am sure you know that . '
Parsing [sent. 19235 len. 10]: ` Do you think I would ask you ? '
Parsing [sent. 19236 len. 8]: he returned , with a -- well !
Parsing [sent. 19237 len. 6]: Never mind with what . '
Parsing [sent. 19238 len. 19]: I am sure you never would , ' she answered , the bright tears standing in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 19239 len. 16]: ` And I will swear it , Ruth , my darling , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 19240 len. 3]: Leave Tom !
Parsing [sent. 19241 len. 7]: That would be a strange beginning .
Parsing [sent. 19242 len. 5]: Leave Tom , dear !
Parsing [sent. 19243 len. 36]: If Tom and we be not inseparable , and Tom -LRB- God bless him -RRB- have not all honour and all love in our home , my little wife , may that home never be !
Parsing [sent. 19244 len. 10]: And that 's a strong oath , Ruth . '
Parsing [sent. 19245 len. 9]: Shall it be recorded how she thanked him ?
Parsing [sent. 19246 len. 5]: Yes , it shall .
Parsing [sent. 19247 len. 50]: In all simplicity and innocence and purity of heart , yet with a timid , graceful , half-determined hesitation , she set a little rosy seal upon the vow , whose colour was reflected in her face , and flashed up to the braiding of her dark brown hair .
Parsing [sent. 19248 len. 23]: ` Tom will be so happy , and so proud , and glad , ' she said , clasping her little hands .
Parsing [sent. 19249 len. 5]: ` But so surprised !
Parsing [sent. 19250 len. 13]: I am sure he had never thought of such a thing . '
Parsing [sent. 19251 len. 70]: Of course John asked her immediately -- because you know they were in that foolish state when great allowances must be made -- when SHE had begun to think of such a thing , and this made a little diversion in their talk ; a charming diversion to them , but not so interesting to us ; at the end of which , they came back to Tom again .
Parsing [sent. 19252 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 19253 len. 4]: dear Tom ! '
Parsing [sent. 19254 len. 4]: said Ruth . '
Parsing [sent. 19255 len. 10]: I suppose I ought to tell you everything now .
Parsing [sent. 19256 len. 8]: I should have no secrets from you .
Parsing [sent. 19257 len. 8]: Should I , John , love ? '
Parsing [sent. 19258 len. 30]: It is of no use saying how that preposterous John answered her , because he answered in a manner which is untranslatable on paper though highly satisfactory in itself .
Parsing [sent. 19259 len. 19]: But what he conveyed was , No no no , sweet Ruth ; or something to that effect .
Parsing [sent. 19260 len. 46]: Then she told him Tom 's great secret ; not exactly saying how she had found it out , but leaving him to understand it if he liked ; and John was sadly grieved to hear it , and was full of sympathy and sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 19261 len. 29]: But they would try , he said , only the more , on this account to make him happy , and to beguile him with his favourite pursuits .
Parsing [sent. 19262 len. 105]: And then , in all the confidence of such a time , he told her how he had a capital opportunity of establishing himself in his old profession in the country ; and how he had been thinking , in the event of that happiness coming upon him which had actually come -- there was another slight diversion here -- how he had been thinking that it would afford occupation to Tom , and enable them to live together in the easiest manner , without any sense of dependence on Tom 's part ; and to be as happy as the day was long .
Parsing [sent. 19263 len. 50]: And Ruth receiving this with joy , they went on catering for Tom to that extent that they had already purchased him a select library and built him an organ , on which he was performing with the greatest satisfaction , when they heard him knocking at the door .
Parsing [sent. 19264 len. 33]: Though she longed to tell him what had happened , poor little Ruth was greatly agitated by his arrival ; the more so because she knew that Mr Chuzzlewit was with him .
Parsing [sent. 19265 len. 18]: So she said , all in a tremble : ` What shall I do , dear John !
Parsing [sent. 19266 len. 28]: I ca n't bear that he should hear it from any one but me , and I could not tell him , unless we were alone . '
Parsing [sent. 19267 len. 33]: ` Do , my love , ' said John , ` whatever is natural to you on the impulse of the moment , and I am sure it will be right . '
Parsing [sent. 19268 len. 36]: He had hardly time to say thus much , and Ruth had hardly time to -- just to get a little farther off -- upon the sofa , when Tom and Mr Chuzzlewit came in .
Parsing [sent. 19269 len. 14]: Mr Chuzzlewit came first , and Tom was a few seconds behind him .
Parsing [sent. 19270 len. 25]: Now Ruth had hastily resolved that she would beckon Tom upstairs after a short time , and would tell him in his little bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 19271 len. 41]: But when she saw his dear old face come in , her heart was so touched that she ran into his arms , and laid her head down on his breast and sobbed out , ` Bless me , Tom !
Parsing [sent. 19272 len. 5]: My dearest brother ! '
Parsing [sent. 19273 len. 20]: Tom looked up , in surprise , and saw John Westlock close beside him , holding out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 19274 len. 4]: ` John ! '
Parsing [sent. 19275 len. 3]: cried Tom .
Parsing [sent. 19276 len. 4]: ` John ! '
Parsing [sent. 19277 len. 15]: ` Dear Tom , ' said his friend , ` give me your hand .
Parsing [sent. 19278 len. 7]: We are brothers , Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 19279 len. 22]: Tom wrung it with all his force , embraced his sister fervently , and put her in John Westlock 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 19280 len. 9]: ` Do n't speak to me , John .
Parsing [sent. 19281 len. 7]: Heaven is very good to us .
Parsing [sent. 19282 len. 21]: I -- ' Tom could find no further utterance , but left the room ; and Ruth went after him .
Parsing [sent. 19283 len. 31]: And when they came back , which they did by-and-bye , she looked more beautiful , and Tom more good and true -LRB- if that were possible -RRB- than ever .
Parsing [sent. 19284 len. 39]: And though Tom could not speak upon the subject even now ; being yet too newly glad , he put both his hands in both of John 's with emphasis sufficient for the best speech ever spoken . '
Parsing [sent. 19285 len. 27]: I am glad you chose to-day , ' said Mr Chuzzlewit to John ; with the same knowing smile as when they had left him . '
Parsing [sent. 19286 len. 5]: I thought you would .
Parsing [sent. 19287 len. 11]: I hoped Tom and I lingered behind a discreet time .
Parsing [sent. 19288 len. 25]: It 's so long since I had any practical knowledge of these subjects , that I have been anxious , I assure you . '
Parsing [sent. 19289 len. 29]: ` Your knowledge is still pretty accurate , sir , ' returned John , laughing , ` if it led you to foresee what would happen to-day . '
Parsing [sent. 19290 len. 34]: ` Why , I am not sure , Mr Westlock , ' said the old man , ` that any great spirit of prophecy was needed , after seeing you and Ruth together .
Parsing [sent. 19291 len. 6]: Come hither , pretty one .
Parsing [sent. 19292 len. 22]: See what Tom and I purchased this morning , while you were dealing in exchange with that young merchant there . '
Parsing [sent. 19293 len. 42]: The old man 's way of seating her beside him , and humouring his voice as if she were a child , was whimsical enough , but full of tenderness , and not ill adapted , somehow , to little Ruth .
Parsing [sent. 19294 len. 5]: ` See here ! '
Parsing [sent. 19295 len. 16]: he said , taking a case from his pocket , ` what a beautiful necklace .
Parsing [sent. 19296 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 19297 len. 4]: How it glitters !
Parsing [sent. 19298 len. 14]: Earrings , too , and bracelets , and a zone for your waist .
Parsing [sent. 19299 len. 12]: This set is yours , and Mary has another like it .
Parsing [sent. 19300 len. 9]: Tom could n't understand why I wanted two .
Parsing [sent. 19301 len. 5]: What a short-sighted Tom !
Parsing [sent. 19302 len. 11]: Earrings and bracelets , and a zone for your waist !
Parsing [sent. 19303 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 19304 len. 2]: Beautiful !
Parsing [sent. 19305 len. 8]: Let us see how brave they look .
Parsing [sent. 19306 len. 9]: Ask Mr Westlock to clasp them on . '
Parsing [sent. 19307 len. 26]: It was the prettiest thing to see her holding out her round , white arm ; and John -LRB- oh deep , deep John ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 19308 len. 94]: pretending that the bracelet was very hard to fasten ; it was the prettiest thing to see her girding on the precious little zone , and yet obliged to have assistance because her fingers were in such terrible perplexity ; it was the prettiest thing to see her so confused and bashful , with the smiles and blushes playing brightly on her face , like the sparkling light upon the jewels ; it was the prettiest thing that you would see , in the common experiences of a twelvemonth , rely upon it .
Parsing [sent. 19309 len. 31]: ` The set of jewels and the wearer are so well matched , ' said the old man , ` that I do n't know which becomes the other most .
Parsing [sent. 19310 len. 23]: Mr Westlock could tell me , I have no doubt , but I 'll not ask him , for he is bribed .
Parsing [sent. 19311 len. 27]: Health to wear them , my dear , and happiness to make you forgetful of them , except as a remembrance from a loving friend ! '
Parsing [sent. 19312 len. 27]: He patted her upon the cheek , and said to Tom : ' I must play the part of a father here , Tom , also .
Parsing [sent. 19313 len. 31]: There are not many fathers who marry two such daughters on the same day ; but we will overlook the improbability for the gratification of an old man 's fancy .
Parsing [sent. 19314 len. 33]: I may claim that much indulgence , ' he added , ` for I have gratified few fancies enough in my life tending to the happiness of others , Heaven knows ! '
Parsing [sent. 19315 len. 42]: These various proceedings had occupied so much time , and they fell into such a pleasant conversation now , that it was within a quarter of an hour of the time appointed for dinner before any of them thought about it .
Parsing [sent. 19316 len. 64]: A hackney-coach soon carried them to the Temple , however ; and there they found everything prepared for their reception , Mr Tapley having been furnished with unlimited credentials relative to the ordering of dinner , had so exerted himself for the honour of the party , that a prodigious banquet was served , under the joint direction of himself and his Intended .
Parsing [sent. 19317 len. 79]: Mr Chuzzlewit would have had them of the party , and Martin urgently seconded his wish , but Mark could by no means be persuaded to sit down at table ; observing , that in having the honour of attending to their comforts , he felt himself , indeed , the landlord of the Jolly Tapley , and could almost delude himself into the belief that the entertainment was actually being held under the Jolly Tapley 's roof .
Parsing [sent. 19318 len. 88]: For the better encouragement of himself in this fable , Mr Tapley took it upon him to issue divers general directions to the waiters from the hotel , relative to the disposal of the dishes and so forth ; and as they were usually in direct opposition to all precedent , and were always issued in his most facetious form of thought and speech , they occasioned great merriment among those attendants ; in which Mr Tapley participated , with an infinite enjoyment of his own humour .
Parsing [sent. 19319 len. 83]: He likewise entertained them with short anecdotes of his travels appropriate to the occasion ; and now and then with some comic passage or other between himself and Mrs Lupin ; so that explosive laughs were constantly issuing from the side-board , and from the backs of chairs ; and the head-waiter -LRB- who wore powder , and knee-smalls , and was usually a grave man -RRB- got to be a bright scarlet in the face , and broke his waistcoat-strings audibly .
Parsing [sent. 19320 len. 33]: Young Martin sat at the head of the table , and Tom Pinch at the foot ; and if there were a genial face at that board , it was Tom 's .
Parsing [sent. 19321 len. 8]: They all took their tone from Tom .
Parsing [sent. 19322 len. 19]: Everybody drank to him , everybody looked to him , everybody thought of him , everybody loved him .
Parsing [sent. 19323 len. 22]: If he so much as laid down his knife and fork , somebody put out a hand to shake with him .
Parsing [sent. 19324 len. 53]: Martin and Mary had taken him aside before dinner , and spoken to him so heartily of the time to come , laying such fervent stress upon the trust they had in his completion of their felicity , by his society and closest friendship , that Tom was positively moved to tears .
Parsing [sent. 19325 len. 6]: He could n't bear it .
Parsing [sent. 19326 len. 11]: His heart was full , he said , of happiness .
Parsing [sent. 19327 len. 5]: And so it was .
Parsing [sent. 19328 len. 6]: Tom spoke the honest truth .
Parsing [sent. 19329 len. 3]: It was .
Parsing [sent. 19330 len. 23]: Large as thy heart was , dear Tom Pinch , it had no room that day for anything but happiness and sympathy !
Parsing [sent. 19331 len. 42]: And there was Fips , old Fips of Austin Friars , present at the dinner , and turning out to be the jolliest old dog that ever did violence to his convivial sentiments by shutting himself up in a dark office .
Parsing [sent. 19332 len. 6]: ` Where is he ? '
Parsing [sent. 19333 len. 8]: said Fips , when he came in .
Parsing [sent. 19334 len. 68]: And then he pounced on Tom , and told him that he wanted to relieve himself of all his old constraint ; and in the first place shook him by one hand , and in the second place shook him by the other , and in the third place nudged him in the waistcoat , and in the fourth place said , ` How are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 19335 len. 20]: and in a great many other places did a great many other things to show his friendliness and joy .
Parsing [sent. 19336 len. 44]: And he sang songs , did Fips ; and made speeches , did Fips ; and knocked off his wine pretty handsomely , did Fips ; and in short , he showed himself a perfect Trump , did Fips , in all respects .
Parsing [sent. 19337 len. 3]: But ah !
Parsing [sent. 19338 len. 19]: the happiness of strolling home at night -- obstinate little Ruth , she would n't hear of riding !
Parsing [sent. 19339 len. 15]: -- as they had done on that dear night , from Furnival 's Inn !
Parsing [sent. 19340 len. 19]: The happiness of being able to talk about it , and to confide their happiness to each other !
Parsing [sent. 19341 len. 22]: The happiness of stating all their little plans to Tom , and seeing his bright face grow brighter as they spoke !
Parsing [sent. 19342 len. 30]: When they reached home , Tom left John and his sister in the parlour , and went upstairs into his own room , under pretence of seeking a book .
Parsing [sent. 19343 len. 22]: And Tom actually winked to himself when he got upstairs ; he thought it such a deep thing to have done .
Parsing [sent. 19344 len. 39]: ` They like to be by themselves , of course , ' said Tom ; ` and I came away so naturally , that I have no doubt they are expecting me , every moment , to return .
Parsing [sent. 19345 len. 5]: That 's capital ! '
Parsing [sent. 19346 len. 18]: But he had not sat reading very long , when he heard a tap at his door .
Parsing [sent. 19347 len. 7]: ` May I come in ? '
Parsing [sent. 19348 len. 3]: said John .
Parsing [sent. 19349 len. 6]: ` Oh , surely ! '
Parsing [sent. 19350 len. 3]: Tom replied .
Parsing [sent. 19351 len. 8]: ` Do n't leave us , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 19352 len. 6]: Do n't sit by yourself .
Parsing [sent. 19353 len. 11]: We want to make you merry ; not melancholy . '
Parsing [sent. 19354 len. 14]: ` My dear friend , ' said Tom , with a cheerful smile .
Parsing [sent. 19355 len. 5]: ` Brother , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 19356 len. 3]: Brother . '
Parsing [sent. 19357 len. 39]: ` My dear brother , ' said Tom ; ` there is no danger of my being melancholy , how can I be melancholy , when I know that you and Ruth are so blest in each other !
Parsing [sent. 19358 len. 21]: I think I can find my tongue tonight , John , ' he added , after a moment 's pause .
Parsing [sent. 19359 len. 16]: ` But I never can tell you what unutterable joy this day has given me .
Parsing [sent. 19360 len. 33]: It would be unjust to you to speak of your having chosen a portionless girl , for I feel that you know her worth ; I am sure you know her worth .
Parsing [sent. 19361 len. 15]: Nor will it diminish in your estimation , John , which money might . '
Parsing [sent. 19362 len. 11]: ` Which money would , Tom , ' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 19363 len. 4]: ` Her worth !
Parsing [sent. 19364 len. 13]: Oh , who could see her here , and not love her !
Parsing [sent. 19365 len. 12]: Who could know her , Tom , and not honour her !
Parsing [sent. 19366 len. 19]: Who could ever stand possessed of such a heart as hers , and grow indifferent to the treasure !
Parsing [sent. 19367 len. 26]: Who could feel the rapture that I feel to-day , and love as I love her , Tom , without knowing something of her worth !
Parsing [sent. 19368 len. 4]: Your joy unutterable !
Parsing [sent. 19369 len. 6]: No , no , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 19370 len. 8]: It 's mine , it 's mine .
Parsing [sent. 19371 len. 11]: ` No , no , John , ' said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 19372 len. 10]: ` It 's mine , it 's mine . '
Parsing [sent. 19373 len. 21]: Their friendly contention was brought to a close by little Ruth herself , who came peeping in at the door .
Parsing [sent. 19374 len. 26]: And oh , the look , the glorious , half-proud , half-timid look she gave Tom , when her lover drew her to his side !
Parsing [sent. 19375 len. 18]: As much as to say , ` Yes , indeed , Tom , he will do it .
Parsing [sent. 19376 len. 10]: But then he has a right , you know .
Parsing [sent. 19377 len. 10]: Because I AM fond of him , Tom . '
Parsing [sent. 19378 len. 9]: As to Tom , he was perfectly delighted .
Parsing [sent. 19379 len. 18]: He could have sat and looked at them , just as they were , for hours . '
Parsing [sent. 19380 len. 32]: I have told Tom , love , as we agreed , that we are not going to permit him to run away , and that we can not possibly allow it .
Parsing [sent. 19381 len. 36]: The loss of one person , and such a person as Tom , too , out of our small household of three , is not to be endured ; and so I have told him .
Parsing [sent. 19382 len. 17]: Whether he is considerate , or whether he is only selfish , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 19383 len. 17]: But he need n't be considerate , for he is not the least restraint upon us .
Parsing [sent. 19384 len. 7]: Is he , dearest Ruth ? '
Parsing [sent. 19385 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 19386 len. 13]: He really did not seem to be any particular restraint upon them .
Parsing [sent. 19387 len. 5]: Judging from what ensued .
Parsing [sent. 19388 len. 19]: Was it folly in Tom to be so pleased by their remembrance of him at such a time ?
Parsing [sent. 19389 len. 19]: Was their graceful love a folly , were their dear caresses follies , was their lengthened parting folly ?
Parsing [sent. 19390 len. 53]: Was it folly in him to watch her window from the street , and rate its scantiest gleam of light above all diamonds ; folly in her to breathe his name upon her knees , and pour out her pure heart before that Being from whom such hearts and such affections come ?
Parsing [sent. 19391 len. 13]: If these be follies , then Fiery Face go on and prosper !
Parsing [sent. 19392 len. 10]: If they be not , then Fiery Face avaunt !
Parsing [sent. 19393 len. 24]: But set the crunched bonnet at some other single gentleman , in any case , for one is lost to thee for ever !
Parsing [sent. 19394 len. 10]: CHAPTER FIFTY -- FOUR GIVES THE AUTHOR GREAT CONCERN .
Parsing [sent. 19395 len. 29]: FOR IT IS THE LAST IN THE BOOK Todger 's was in high feather , and mighty preparations for a late breakfast were astir in its commercial bowers .
Parsing [sent. 19396 len. 19]: The blissful morning had arrived when Miss Pecksniff was to be united in holy matrimony , to Augustus .
Parsing [sent. 19397 len. 16]: Miss Pecksniff was in a frame of mind equally becoming to herself and the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 19398 len. 8]: She was full of clemency and conciliation .
Parsing [sent. 19399 len. 23]: She had laid in several caldrons of live coals , and was prepared to heap them on the heads of her enemies .
Parsing [sent. 19400 len. 10]: She bore no spite nor malice in her heart .
Parsing [sent. 19401 len. 4]: Not the least .
Parsing [sent. 19402 len. 31]: Quarrels , Miss Pecksniff said , were dreadful things in families ; and though she never could forgive her dear papa , she was willing to receive her other relations .
Parsing [sent. 19403 len. 11]: They had been separated , she observed , too long .
Parsing [sent. 19404 len. 12]: It was enough to call down a judgment upon the family .
Parsing [sent. 19405 len. 16]: She believed the death of Jonas WAS a judgment on them for their internal dissensions .
Parsing [sent. 19406 len. 21]: And Miss Pecksniff was confirmed in this belief , by the lightness with which the visitation had fallen on herself .
Parsing [sent. 19407 len. 54]: By way of doing sacrifice -- not in triumph ; not , of course , in triumph , but in humiliation of spirit -- this amiable young person wrote , therefore , to her kinswoman of the strong mind , and informed her that her nuptials would take place on such a day .
Parsing [sent. 19408 len. 26]: That she had been much hurt by the unnatural conduct of herself and daughters , and hoped they might not have suffered in their consciences .
Parsing [sent. 19409 len. 40]: That , being desirous to forgive her enemies , and make her peace with the world before entering into the most solemn of covenants with the most devoted of men , she now held out the hand of friendship .
Parsing [sent. 19410 len. 65]: That if the strong-minded women took that hand , in the temper in which it was extended to her , she , Miss Pecksniff , did invite her to be present at the ceremony of her marriage , and did furthermore invite the three red-nosed spinsters , her daughters -LRB- but Miss Pecksniff did not particularize their noses -RRB- , to attend as bridesmaids .
Parsing [sent. 19411 len. 36]: The strong-minded women returned for answer , that herself and daughters were , as regarded their consciences , in the enjoyment of robust health , which she knew Miss Pecksniff would be glad to hear .
Parsing [sent. 19412 len. 54]: That she had received Miss Pecksniff 's note with unalloyed delight , because she never had attached the least importance to the paltry and insignificant jealousies with which herself and circle had been assailed ; otherwise than as she had found them , in the contemplation , a harmless source of innocent mirth .
Parsing [sent. 19413 len. 43]: That she would joyfully attend Miss Pecksniff 's bridal ; and that her three dear daughters would be happy to assist , on so interesting , and SO VERY UNEXPECTED -- which the strong-minded woman underlined -- SO VERY UNEXPECTED an occasion .
Parsing [sent. 19414 len. 68]: On the receipt of this gracious reply , Miss Pecksniff extended her forgiveness and her invitations to Mr and Mrs Spottletoe ; to Mr George Chuzzlewit the bachelor cousin ; to the solitary female who usually had the toothache ; and to the hairy young gentleman with the outline of a face ; surviving remnants of the party that had once assembled in Mr Pecksniff 's parlour .
Parsing [sent. 19415 len. 23]: After which Miss Pecksniff remarked that there was a sweetness in doing our duty , which neutralized the bitter in our cups .
Parsing [sent. 19416 len. 50]: The wedding guests had not yet assembled , and indeed it was so early that Miss Pecksniff herself was in the act of dressing at her leisure , when a carriage stopped near the Monument ; and Mark , dismounting from the rumble , assisted Mr Chuzzlewit to alight .
Parsing [sent. 19417 len. 11]: The carriage remained in waiting ; so did Mr Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 19418 len. 8]: Mr Chuzzlewit betook himself to Todger 's .
Parsing [sent. 19419 len. 29]: He was shown , by the degenerate successor of Mr Bailey , into the dining-parlour ; where -- for his visit was expected -- Mrs Todgers immediately appeared .
Parsing [sent. 19420 len. 16]: ` You are dressed , I see , for the wedding , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 19421 len. 16]: Mrs Todgers , who was greatly flurried by the preparations , replied in the affirmative .
Parsing [sent. 19422 len. 47]: ` It goes against my wishes to have it in progress just now , I assure you , sir , ' said Mrs Todgers ; ` but Miss Pecksniff 's mind was set upon it , and it really is time that Miss Pecksniff was married .
Parsing [sent. 19423 len. 9]: That can not be denied , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 19424 len. 12]: ` No , ' said Mr Chuzzlewit , ` assuredly not .
Parsing [sent. 19425 len. 10]: Her sister takes no part in the proceedings ? '
Parsing [sent. 19426 len. 8]: ` Oh , dear no , sir .
Parsing [sent. 19427 len. 4]: Poor thing ! '
Parsing [sent. 19428 len. 13]: said Mrs Todgers , shaking her head , and dropping her voice .
Parsing [sent. 19429 len. 20]: ` Since she has known the worst , she has never left my room ; the next room . '
Parsing [sent. 19430 len. 9]: ` Is she prepared to see me ? '
Parsing [sent. 19431 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 19432 len. 7]: ` Quite prepared , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 19433 len. 9]: ` Then let us lose no time . '
Parsing [sent. 19434 len. 38]: Mrs Todgers conducted him into the little back chamber commanding the prospect of the cistern ; and there , sadly different from when it had first been her lodging , sat poor Merry , in mourning weeds .
Parsing [sent. 19435 len. 26]: The room looked very dark and sorrowful ; and so did she ; but she had one friend beside her , faithful to the last .
Parsing [sent. 19436 len. 3]: Old Chuffey .
Parsing [sent. 19437 len. 20]: When Mr Chuzzlewit sat down at her side , she took his hand and put it to her lips .
Parsing [sent. 19438 len. 6]: She was in great grief .
Parsing [sent. 19439 len. 19]: He too was agitated ; for he had not seen her since their parting in the churchyard . '
Parsing [sent. 19440 len. 15]: I judged you hastily , ' he said , in a low voice . '
Parsing [sent. 19441 len. 7]: I fear I judged you cruelly .
Parsing [sent. 19442 len. 10]: Let me know that I have your forgiveness . '
Parsing [sent. 19443 len. 27]: She kissed his hand again ; and retaining it in hers , thanked him in a broken voice , for all his kindness to her since .
Parsing [sent. 19444 len. 43]: ` Tom Pinch , ' said Martin , ` has faithfully related to me all that you desired him to convey ; at a time when he deemed it very improbable that he would ever have an opportunity of delivering your message .
Parsing [sent. 19445 len. 35]: Believe me , that if I ever deal again with an ill-advised and unawakened nature , hiding the strength it thinks its weakness , I will have long and merciful consideration for it . '
Parsing [sent. 19446 len. 15]: ` You had for me ; even for me , ' she answered . '
Parsing [sent. 19447 len. 5]: I quite believe it .
Parsing [sent. 19448 len. 35]: I said the words you have repeated , when my distress was very sharp and hard to bear ; I say them now for others ; but I can not urge them for myself .
Parsing [sent. 19449 len. 15]: You spoke to me after you had seen and watched me day by day .
Parsing [sent. 19450 len. 7]: There was great consideration in that .
Parsing [sent. 19451 len. 32]: You might have spoken , perhaps , more kindly ; you might have tried to invite my confidence by greater gentleness ; but the end would have been the same . '
Parsing [sent. 19452 len. 14]: He shook his head in doubt , and not without some inward self-reproach .
Parsing [sent. 19453 len. 28]: ` How can I hope , ' she said , ` that your interposition would have prevailed with me , when I know how obdurate I was !
Parsing [sent. 19454 len. 34]: I never thought at all ; dear Mr Chuzzlewit , I never thought at all ; I had no thought , no heart , no care to find one ; at that time .
Parsing [sent. 19455 len. 8]: It has grown out of my trouble .
Parsing [sent. 19456 len. 8]: I have felt it in my trouble .
Parsing [sent. 19457 len. 45]: I would n't recall my trouble such as it is and has been -- and it is light in comparison with trials which hundreds of good people suffer every day , I know -- I would n't recall it to-morrow , if I could .
Parsing [sent. 19458 len. 22]: It has been my friend , for without it no one could have changed me ; nothing could have changed me .
Parsing [sent. 19459 len. 15]: Do not mistrust me because of these tears ; I can not help them .
Parsing [sent. 19460 len. 10]: I am grateful for it , in my soul .
Parsing [sent. 19461 len. 5]: Indeed I am ! '
Parsing [sent. 19462 len. 6]: ` Indeed she is ! '
Parsing [sent. 19463 len. 5]: said Mrs Todgers . '
Parsing [sent. 19464 len. 7]: I believe it , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 19465 len. 7]: ` And so do I ! '
Parsing [sent. 19466 len. 4]: said Mr Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 19467 len. 10]: ` Now , attend to me , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 19468 len. 101]: Your late husband 's estate , if not wasted by the confession of a large debt to the broken office -LRB- which document , being useless to the runaways , has been sent over to England by them ; not so much for the sake of the creditors as for the gratification of their dislike to him , whom they suppose to be still living -RRB- , will be seized upon by law ; for it is not exempt , as I learn , from the claims of those who have suffered by the fraud in which he was engaged .
Parsing [sent. 19469 len. 17]: Your father 's property was all , or nearly all , embarked in the same transaction .
Parsing [sent. 19470 len. 16]: If there be any left , it will be seized on , in like manner .
Parsing [sent. 19471 len. 8]: There is no home THERE . ' '
Parsing [sent. 19472 len. 24]: I could n't return to him , ' she said , with an instinctive reference to his having forced her marriage on . '
Parsing [sent. 19473 len. 9]: I could not return to him . ' '
Parsing [sent. 19474 len. 19]: I know it , ' Mr Chuzzlewit resumed ; ` and I am here because I know it .
Parsing [sent. 19475 len. 4]: Come with me !
Parsing [sent. 19476 len. 21]: From all who are about me , you are certain -LRB- I have ascertained it -RRB- of a generous welcome .
Parsing [sent. 19477 len. 53]: But until your health is re-established , and you are sufficiently composed to bear that welcome , you shall have your abode in any quiet retreat of your own choosing , near London ; not so far removed but that this kind-hearted lady may still visit you as often as she pleases .
Parsing [sent. 19478 len. 23]: You have suffered much ; but you are young , and have a brighter and a better future stretching out before you .
Parsing [sent. 19479 len. 4]: Come with me .
Parsing [sent. 19480 len. 10]: Your sister is careless of you , I know .
Parsing [sent. 19481 len. 30]: She hurries on and publishes her marriage , in a spirit which -LRB- to say no more of it -RRB- is barely decent , is unsisterly , and bad .
Parsing [sent. 19482 len. 8]: Leave the house before her guests arrive .
Parsing [sent. 19483 len. 7]: She means to give you pain .
Parsing [sent. 19484 len. 11]: Spare her the offence , and come with me ! '
Parsing [sent. 19485 len. 15]: Mrs Todgers , though most unwilling to part with her , added her persuasions .
Parsing [sent. 19486 len. 15]: Even poor old Chuffey -LRB- of course included in the project -RRB- added his .
Parsing [sent. 19487 len. 19]: She hurriedly attired herself , and was ready to depart , when Miss Pecksniff dashed into the room .
Parsing [sent. 19488 len. 16]: Miss Pecksniff dashed in so suddenly , that she was placed in an embarrassing position .
Parsing [sent. 19489 len. 44]: For though she had completed her bridal toilette as to her head , on which she wore a bridal bonnet with orange flowers , she had not completed it as to her skirts , which displayed no choicer decoration than a dimity bedgown .
Parsing [sent. 19490 len. 59]: She had dashed in , in fact , about half-way through , to console her sister , in her affliction , with a sight of the aforesaid bonnet ; and being quite unconscious of the presence of a visitor , until she found Mr Chuzzlewit standing face to face with her , her surprise was an uncomfortable one .
Parsing [sent. 19491 len. 7]: ` So , young lady ! '
Parsing [sent. 19492 len. 11]: said the old man , eyeing her with strong disfavour .
Parsing [sent. 19493 len. 9]: ` You are to be married to-day ! '
Parsing [sent. 19494 len. 13]: ` Yes , sir , ' returned Miss Pecksniff , modestly . '
Parsing [sent. 19495 len. 3]: I am .
Parsing [sent. 19496 len. 13]: I -- my dress is rather -- really , Mrs Todgers ! '
Parsing [sent. 19497 len. 16]: ` Your delicacy , ' said old Martin , ` is troubled , I perceive .
Parsing [sent. 19498 len. 9]: I am not surprised to find it so .
Parsing [sent. 19499 len. 12]: You have chosen the period of your marriage unfortunately . ' '
Parsing [sent. 19500 len. 41]: I beg your pardon , Mr Chuzzlewit , ' retorted Cherry ; very red and angry in a moment ; ` but if you have anything to say on that subject , I must beg to refer you to Augustus .
Parsing [sent. 19501 len. 30]: You will scarcely think it manly , I hope , to force an argument on me , when Augustus is at all times ready to discuss it with you .
Parsing [sent. 19502 len. 58]: I have nothing to do with any deceptions that may have been practiced on my parent , ' said Miss Pecksniff , pointedly ; ` and as I wish to be on good terms with everybody at such a time , I should have been glad if you would have favoured us with your company at breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 19503 len. 24]: But I will not ask you as it is ; seeing that you have been prepossessed and set against me in another quarter .
Parsing [sent. 19504 len. 34]: I hope I have my natural affections for another quarter , and my natural pity for another quarter ; but I can not always submit to be subservient to it , Mr Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 19505 len. 8]: That would be a little too much .
Parsing [sent. 19506 len. 23]: I trust I have more respect for myself , as well as for the man who claims me as his Bride . '
Parsing [sent. 19507 len. 41]: ` Your sister , meeting -- as I think ; not as she says , for she has said nothing about it -- with little consideration from you , is going away with me , ' said Mr Chuzzlewit . '
Parsing [sent. 19508 len. 25]: I am very happy to find that she has some good fortune at last , ' returned Miss Pecksniff , tossing her head . '
Parsing [sent. 19509 len. 8]: I congratulate her , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 19510 len. 27]: I am not surprised that this event should be painful to her -- painful to her -- but I ca n't help that , Mr Chuzzlewit .
Parsing [sent. 19511 len. 7]: It 's not my fault . '
Parsing [sent. 19512 len. 7]: ` Come , Miss Pecksniff ! '
Parsing [sent. 19513 len. 8]: said the old man , quietly . '
Parsing [sent. 19514 len. 11]: I should like to see a better parting between you .
Parsing [sent. 19515 len. 16]: I should like to see a better parting on your side , in such circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 19516 len. 7]: It would make me your friend .
Parsing [sent. 19517 len. 11]: You may want a friend one day or other . '
Parsing [sent. 19518 len. 37]: ` Every relation of life , Mr Chuzzlewit , begging your pardon ; and every friend in life , ' returned Miss Pecksniff , with dignity , ` is now bound up and cemented in Augustus .
Parsing [sent. 19519 len. 15]: So long as Augustus is my own , I can not want a friend .
Parsing [sent. 19520 len. 22]: When you speak of friends , sir , I must beg , once for all , to refer you to Augustus .
Parsing [sent. 19521 len. 28]: That is my impression of the religious ceremony in which I am so soon to take a part at that altar to which Augustus will conduct me .
Parsing [sent. 19522 len. 26]: I bear no malice at any time , much less in a moment of triumph , towards any one ; much less towards my sister .
Parsing [sent. 19523 len. 8]: On the contrary , I congratulate her .
Parsing [sent. 19524 len. 15]: If you did n't hear me say so , I am not to blame .
Parsing [sent. 19525 len. 32]: And as I owe it to Augustus , to be punctual on an occasion when he may naturally be supposed to be -- to be impatient -- really , Mrs Todgers !
Parsing [sent. 19526 len. 13]: -- I must beg your leave , sir , to retire . '
Parsing [sent. 19527 len. 20]: After these words the bridal bonnet disappeared ; with as much state as the dimity bedgown left in it .
Parsing [sent. 19528 len. 17]: Old Martin gave his arm to the younger sister without speaking ; and led her out .
Parsing [sent. 19529 len. 40]: Mrs Todgers , with her holiday garments fluttering in the wind , accompanied them to the carriage , clung round Merry 's neck at parting , and ran back to her own dingy house , crying the whole way .
Parsing [sent. 19530 len. 17]: She had a lean , lank body , Mrs Todgers , but a well-conditioned soul within .
Parsing [sent. 19531 len. 16]: Perhaps the good Samaritan was lean and lank , and found it hard to live .
Parsing [sent. 19532 len. 3]: Who knows !
Parsing [sent. 19533 len. 29]: Mr Chuzzlewit followed her so closely with his eyes , that , until she had shut her own door , they did not encounter Mr Tapley 's face .
Parsing [sent. 19534 len. 6]: ` Why , Mark ! '
Parsing [sent. 19535 len. 17]: he said , as soon as he observed it , ` what 's the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 19536 len. 8]: ` The wonderfulest ewent , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 19537 len. 24]: returned Mark , pumping at his voice in a most laborious manner , and hardly able to articulate with all his efforts . '
Parsing [sent. 19538 len. 7]: A coincidence as never was equalled !
Parsing [sent. 19539 len. 16]: I 'm blessed if here ai n't two old neighbours of ourn , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 19540 len. 5]: ` What neighbours ? '
Parsing [sent. 19541 len. 9]: cried old Martin , looking out of window .
Parsing [sent. 19542 len. 5]: ` Where ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 19543 len. 38]: I was a-walkin ' up and down not five yards from this spot , ' said Mr Tapley , breathless , ` and they come upon me like their own ghosts , as I thought they was !
Parsing [sent. 19544 len. 9]: It 's the wonderfulest ewent that ever happened .
Parsing [sent. 19545 len. 14]: Bring a feather , somebody , and knock me down with it ! '
Parsing [sent. 19546 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ! '
Parsing [sent. 19547 len. 22]: exclaimed old Martin , quite as much excited by the spectacle of Mark 's excitement as that strange person was himself .
Parsing [sent. 19548 len. 6]: ` Neighbours , where ? '
Parsing [sent. 19549 len. 6]: ` Here , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 19550 len. 4]: replied Mr Tapley .
Parsing [sent. 19551 len. 8]: ` Here in the city of London !
Parsing [sent. 19552 len. 6]: Here upon these very stones !
Parsing [sent. 19553 len. 6]: Here they are , sir !
Parsing [sent. 19554 len. 6]: Do n't I know 'em ?
Parsing [sent. 19555 len. 13]: Lord love their welcome faces , do n't I know 'em ! '
Parsing [sent. 19556 len. 32]: With which ejaculations Mr Tapley not only pointed to a decent-looking man and woman standing by , but commenced embracing them alternately , over and over again , in Monument Yard .
Parsing [sent. 19557 len. 5]: ` Neighbours , WHERE ?
Parsing [sent. 19558 len. 17]: old Martin shouted ; almost maddened by his ineffectual efforts to get out at the coach-door .
Parsing [sent. 19559 len. 5]: ` Neighbours in America !
Parsing [sent. 19560 len. 5]: Neighbours in Eden ! '
Parsing [sent. 19561 len. 3]: cried Mark .
Parsing [sent. 19562 len. 16]: ` Neighbours in the swamp , neighbours in the bush , neighbours in the fever .
Parsing [sent. 19563 len. 6]: Did n't she nurse us !
Parsing [sent. 19564 len. 6]: Did n't he help us !
Parsing [sent. 19565 len. 9]: Should n't we both have died without 'em !
Parsing [sent. 19566 len. 16]: Have n't they come a-strugglin ' back , without a single child for their consolation !
Parsing [sent. 19567 len. 8]: And talk to me of neighbours ! '
Parsing [sent. 19568 len. 36]: Away he went again , in a perfectly wild state , hugging them , and skipping round them , and cutting in between them , as if he were performing some frantic and outlandish dance .
Parsing [sent. 19569 len. 55]: Mr Chuzzlewit no sooner gathered who these people were , than he burst open the coach-door somehow or other , and came tumbling out among them ; and as if the lunacy of Mr Tapley were contagious , he immediately began to shake hands too , and exhibit every demonstration of the liveliest joy .
Parsing [sent. 19570 len. 7]: ` Get up , behind ! '
Parsing [sent. 19571 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 19572 len. 7]: ` Get up in the rumble .
Parsing [sent. 19573 len. 5]: Come along with me !
Parsing [sent. 19574 len. 8]: Go you on the box , Mark .
Parsing [sent. 19575 len. 2]: Home !
Parsing [sent. 19576 len. 3]: Home ! '
Parsing [sent. 19577 len. 4]: ` Home ! '
Parsing [sent. 19578 len. 16]: cried Mr Tapley , seizing the old man 's hand in a burst of enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 19579 len. 7]: ` Exactly my opinion , sir .
Parsing [sent. 19580 len. 4]: Home for ever !
Parsing [sent. 19581 len. 12]: Excuse the liberty , sir , I ca n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 19582 len. 6]: Success to the Jolly Tapley !

Parsing [sent. 19586 len. 49]: Home they rolled accordingly , when he had got the old man in again , as fast as they could go ; Mark abating nothing of his fervour by the way , by allowing it to vent itself as unrestrainedly as if he had been on Salisbury Plain .

Parsing [sent. 19589 len. 51]: He wore a white favour in his button-hole , and a bran new extra super double-milled blue saxony dress coat -LRB- that was its description in the bill -RRB- , with a variety of tortuous embellishments about the pockets , invented by the artist to do honour to the day .
Parsing [sent. 19590 len. 14]: The miserable Augustus no longer felt strongly even on the subject of Jinkins .
Parsing [sent. 19591 len. 11]: He had n't strength of mind enough to do it .

Parsing [sent. 19613 len. 3]: cried Spottletoe .
Parsing [sent. 19614 len. 5]: ` He begins well !
Parsing [sent. 19615 len. 11]: Upon my life and honour this young man begins well !
Parsing [sent. 19616 len. 30]: But I should very much like to know how it is that every one who comes into contact with this family is guilty of some gross insult to it .
Parsing [sent. 19617 len. 2]: Death !

Parsing [sent. 19620 len. 28]: The nephew with the outline of a countenance , suggested that perhaps he had ordered a new pair of boots , and they had n't come home .

Parsing [sent. 19623 len. 20]: ` He is bound to come here in his slippers then ; he is bound to come here barefoot .
Parsing [sent. 19624 len. 23]: Do n't offer such a wretched and evasive plea to me on behalf of your friend , as Boots , sir . '

Parsing [sent. 19626 len. 6]: I never saw him . '

Parsing [sent. 19630 len. 22]: The strong-minded woman brought up the rear ; having waited outside until now , for the purpose of spoiling the effect .
Parsing [sent. 19631 len. 9]: ` How do you do , ma'am ! '
Parsing [sent. 19632 len. 13]: said Spottletoe to the strong-minded woman in a tone of defiance . '
Parsing [sent. 19633 len. 10]: I believe you see Mrs Spottletoe , ma'am ? '
Parsing [sent. 19634 len. 24]: The strong-minded woman with an air of great interest in Mrs Spottletoe 's health , regretted that she was not more easily seen .
Parsing [sent. 19635 len. 14]: Nature erring , in that lady 's case , upon the slim side .
Parsing [sent. 19636 len. 22]: ` Mrs Spottletoe is at least more easily seen than the bridegroom , ma'am , ' returned that lady 's husband .
Parsing [sent. 19637 len. 32]: ` That is , unless he has confined his attentions to any particular part or branch of this family , which would be quite in keeping with its usual proceedings . '
Parsing [sent. 19638 len. 15]: ` If you allude to me , sir -- ' the strong-minded woman began .
Parsing [sent. 19639 len. 44]: ` Pray , ' interposed Miss Pecksniff , ` do not allow Augustus , at this awful moment of his life and mine , to be the means of disturbing that harmony which it is ever Augustus 's and my wish to maintain .

Parsing [sent. 19641 len. 5]: He preferred not . '
Parsing [sent. 19642 len. 43]: ` Why , then , I venture to assert , ' cried Mr Spottletoe , ` that the man who aspires to join this family , and `` prefers not '' to be introduced to its members , is an impertinent Puppy .

Parsing [sent. 19645 len. 12]: Her three daughters observed aloud that it was ` Shameful ! '
Parsing [sent. 19646 len. 22]: ` You do not know Augustus , ' said Miss Pecksniff , tearfully , ` indeed you do not know him .
Parsing [sent. 19647 len. 7]: Augustus is all mildness and humility .
Parsing [sent. 19648 len. 17]: Wait till you see Augustus , and I am sure he will conciliate your affections . '
Parsing [sent. 19649 len. 21]: ` The question arises , ' said Spottletoe , folding his arms : ` How long we are to wait .
Parsing [sent. 19650 len. 12]: I am not accustomed to wait ; that 's the fact .
Parsing [sent. 19651 len. 14]: And I want to know how long we are expected to wait . '

Parsing [sent. 19654 len. 9]: I am afraid there must be some mistake .

Parsing [sent. 19656 len. 50]: As such a thing was possible , and the church was close at hand , Mr Jinkins ran off to see , accompanied by Mr George Chuzzlewit the bachelor cousin , who preferred anything to the aggravation of sitting near the breakfast , without being able to eat it .
Parsing [sent. 19657 len. 44]: But they came back with no other tidings than a familiar message from the clerk , importing that if they wanted to be married that morning they had better look sharp , as the curate was n't going to wait there all day .

Parsing [sent. 19659 len. 8]: Good Heavens , what could have happened !

Parsing [sent. 19663 len. 9]: The strong-minded woman administered comfort to Miss Pecksniff .
Parsing [sent. 19664 len. 12]: ` It was a specimen of what she had to expect .
Parsing [sent. 19665 len. 6]: It would do her good .
Parsing [sent. 19666 len. 10]: It would dispel the romance of the affair . '
Parsing [sent. 19667 len. 9]: The red-nosed daughters also administered the kindest comfort .

Parsing [sent. 19670 len. 13]: The wrath of Mr Spottletoe resisted all the entreaties of his wife .
Parsing [sent. 19671 len. 45]: Everybody spoke at once , and Miss Pecksniff , with clasped hands , sought consolation everywhere and found it nowhere , when Jinkins , having met the postman at the door , came back with a letter , which he put into her hand .

Parsing [sent. 19701 len. 8]: But Miss Pecksniff really had fainted away .
Parsing [sent. 19702 len. 50]: The bitterness of her mortification ; the bitterness of having summoned witnesses , and such witnesses , to behold it ; the bitterness of knowing that the strong-minded women and the red-nosed daughters towered triumphant in this hour of their anticipated overthrow ; was too much to be borne .

Parsing [sent. 19711 len. 60]: In the soft strain which ever and again comes stealing back upon the ear , the memory of thine old love may find a voice perhaps ; but it is a pleasant , softened , whispering memory , like that in which we sometimes hold the dead , and does not pain or grieve thee , God be thanked .
Parsing [sent. 19712 len. 60]: Touch the notes lightly , Tom , as lightly as thou wilt , but never will thine hand fall half so lightly on that Instrument as on the head of thine old tyrant brought down very , very low ; and never will it make as hollow a response to any touch of thine , as he does always .
Parsing [sent. 19713 len. 106]: For a drunken , begging , squalid , letter-writing man , called Pecksniff , with a shrewish daughter , haunts thee , Tom ; and when he makes appeals to thee for cash , reminds thee that he built thy fortunes better than his own ; and when he spends it , entertains the alehouse company with tales of thine ingratitude and his munificence towards thee once upon a time ; and then he shows his elbows worn in holes , and puts his soleless shoes up on a bench , and begs his auditors look there , while thou art comfortably housed and clothed .

Parsing [sent. 19717 len. 43]: Thou glidest , now , into a graver air ; an air devoted to old friends and bygone times ; and in thy lingering touch upon the keys , and the rich swelling of the mellow harmony , they rise before thee .

Parsing [sent. 19719 len. 38]: And coming from a garden , Tom , bestrewn with flowers by children 's hands , thy sister , little Ruth , as light of foot and heart as in old days , sits down beside thee .
