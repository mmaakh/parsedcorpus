Parsing [sent. 1 len. 29]: HOME AGAIN and THE ELECT LADY _ -LRB- A Duplex Edition -RRB- _ By George MacDonald THE ELECT LADY CHAPTER I. LANDLORD 'S DAUGHTER AND TENANT 'S SON .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 69]: In a kitchen of moderate size , flagged with slate , humble in its appointments , yet looking scarcely that of a farmhouse -- for there were utensils about it indicating necessities more artificial than usually grow upon a farm -- with the corner of a white deal table between them , sat two young people evidently different in rank , and meeting upon no level of friendship .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 18]: The young woman held in her hand a paper , which seemed the subject of their conversation .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 61]: She was about four - or five-and-twenty , well grown and not ungraceful , with dark hair , dark hazel eyes , and rather large , handsome features , full of intelligence , but a little hard , and not a little regnant -- as such features must be , except after prolonged influence of a heart potent in self-subjugation .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 34]: As to her social expression , it was a mingling of the gentlewoman of education , and the farmer 's daughter supreme over the household and its share in the labor of production .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 55]: As to the young man , it would have required a deeper-seeing eye than falls to the lot of most observers , not to take him for a weaker nature than the young woman ; and the deference he showed her as the superior , would have enhanced the difficulty of a true judgment .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 72]: He was tall and thin , but plainly in fine health ; had a good forehead , and a clear hazel eye , not overlarge or prominent , but full of light ; a firm mouth , with a curious smile ; a sun-burned complexion ; and a habit when perplexed of pinching his upper lip between his finger and thumb , which at the present moment he was unconsciously indulging .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 32]: He was the son of a small farmer -- in what part of Scotland is of little consequence -- and his companion for the moment was the daughter of the laird .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 32]: `` I have glanced over the poem , '' said the lady , `` and it seems to me quite up to the average of what you see in print . ''
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 12]: `` Would that be reason for printing it , ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 8]: asked the man , with amused smile .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 20]: `` It would be for the editor to determine , '' she answered , not perceiving the hinted objection .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 22]: `` You will remember , ma'am , that I never suggested -- indeed I never thought of such a thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 6]: `` I do not forget .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 13]: It was your mother who drew my attention to the verses . ''
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 9]: `` I must speak to my mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 8]: he said , in a meditative way .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 13]: `` You can not object to _ my _ seeing your work !
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 8]: She does not show it to everybody .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 15]: It is most creditable to you , such an employment of your leisure . ''
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 19]: `` The poem was never meant for any eyes but my own -- except my brother 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 18]: `` What was the good of writing it , if no one was to see it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 9]: `` The writing of it , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 9]: `` For the exercise , you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 9]: `` No ; I hardly mean that . ''
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 12]: `` I am afraid then I do not understand you . ''
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 14]: `` Do _ you _ never write anything but what you publish ? ''
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 3]: `` Publish !
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 6]: _ I _ never publish !
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 10]: What made you think of such a thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 12]: `` That you know so much about it , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 21]: `` I know people connected with the papers , and thought it might encourage you to see something in print .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 9]: The newspapers publish so many poems now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 16]: `` I wish it had n't been just that one my mother gave you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 22]: `` For one thing , it is not finished -- as you will see when you read it more carefully . ''
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 29]: `` I did see a line I thought hardly rhythmical , but -- '' `` Excuse me , ma'am ; the want of rhythm there was intentional . ''
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 7]: `` I am sorry for that .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 9]: Intention is the worst possible excuse for wrong !
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 14]: The accent should always be made to fall in the right place . ''
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 17]: `` Beyond a doubt -- but might not the right place alter with the sense ? ''
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 3]: `` Never .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 17]: The rule is strict '' `` Is there no danger of making the verse monotonous ? ''
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 7]: `` Not that I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 26]: `` I have an idea , ma'am , that our great poets owe much of their music to the liberties they take with the rhythm .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 17]: They treat the rule as its masters , and break it when they see fit . ''
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 7]: `` You must be wrong there !
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 35]: But in any case you must not presume to take the liberties of a great poet '' `` It is a poor reward for being a great poet to be allowed to take liberties .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 27]: I should say that , doing their work to the best of their power , they were rewarded with the discovery of higher laws of verse .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 10]: Every one must walk by the light given him .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 48]: By the rules which others have laid down he may learn to walk ; but once his heart is awake to truth , and his ear to measure , melody and harmony , he must walk by the light , and the music God gives him . ''
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 9]: `` That is dangerous doctrine , Andrew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 9]: said the lady , with a superior smile .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 24]: `` But , '' she continued , `` I will mark what faults I see , and point them out to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 16]: `` Thank you , ma'am , but please do not send the verses anywhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 11]: `` I will not , except I find them worthy .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 6]: You need not be afraid .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 15]: For my father 's sake I will have an eye to your reputation . ''
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 23]: `` I am obliged to you , ma'am , '' returned Andrew , but with his curious smile , hard to describe .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 24]: It had in it a wonderful mixing of sweetness and humor , and a something that seemed to sit miles above his amusement .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 13]: A heavenly smile it was , knowing too much to be angry .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 9]: It had in it neither offense nor scorn .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 27]: In respect of his poetry he was shy like a girl , but he showed no rejection of the patronage forced upon him by the lady .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 7]: He rose and stood a moment .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 10]: `` Well , Andrew , what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 13]: `` When will you allow me to call for the verses ? ''
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 10]: `` In the course of a week or so .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 11]: By that time I shall have made up my mind .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 11]: If in doubt , I shall ask my father . ''
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 17]: `` I would n't like the laird to think I spend my time on poetry . ''
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 7]: `` You write poetry , Andrew !
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 13]: A man should not do what he would not have known . ''
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 15]: `` That is true , ma'am ; I only feared an erroneous conclusion . ''
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 8]: `` I will take care of that .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 11]: My father knows that you are a hard-working young man .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 13]: There is not one of his farms in better order than yours .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 15]: Were it otherwise , I should not be so interested in your poetry . ''
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 8]: Andrew wished her less interested in it .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 15]: To have his verses read was like having a finger poked in his eye .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 12]: He had not known that his mother looked at his papers .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 19]: But he showed little sign of his annoyance , bade the lady good-morning , and left the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 16]: Miss Fordyce followed him to the door , and stood for a moment looking out .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 39]: In front of her was a paved court , surrounded with low buildings , between two of which was visible , at the distance of a mile or so , a railway line where it approached a viaduct .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 23]: She heard the sound of a coming train , and who in a country place will not stand to see one pass !
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 3]: CHAPTER II .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 3]: AN ACCIDENT .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 41]: While the two were talking , a long train , part carriages , part trucks , was rattling through a dreary country , where it could never have been were there not regions very different on both sides of it .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 43]: For miles in any direction , nothing but humpy moorland was to be seen , a gathering of low hills , with now and then a higher one , its sides broken by occasional torrents , in poor likeness of a mountain .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 69]: No smoke proclaimed the presence of human dwelling ; but there were spots between the hills where the hand of man had helped the birth of a feeble fertility ; and in front was a small but productive valley , on the edge of which stood the ancient house of Potlurg , with the heath behind it : over a narrow branch of this valley went the viaduct .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 10]: It was a slow train , with few passengers .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 28]: Of these one was looking from his window with a vague , foolish sense of superiority , thinking what a forgotten , scarce created country it seemed .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 31]: He was a well-dressed , good-looking fellow , with a keen but pale-gray eye , and a fine forehead , but a chin such as is held to indicate weakness .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 19]: More than one , however , of the strongest women I have known , were defective in chin .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 18]: The young man was in the only first-class carriage of the train , and alone in it .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 32]: Dressed in a gray suit , he was a little too particular in the smaller points of his attire , and lacked in consequence something of the look of a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 40]: Every now and then he would take off his hard round hat , and pass a white left hand through his short-cut mousey hair , while his right caressed a far longer mustache , in which he seemed interested .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 13]: A certain indescribable heaviness and lack of light characterized his pale face .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 9]: It was a lovely day in early June .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 45]: The air was rather cold , but youth and health care little about temperature on a holiday , with the sun shining , and that sweetest sense -- to such at least as are ordinarily bound by routine -- of having nothing to do .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 35]: To many men and women the greatest trouble is to choose , for self is the hardest of masters to please ; but as yet George Crawford had not been troubled with much choosing .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 17]: A crowded town behind him , the loneliness he looked upon was a pleasure to him .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 50]: Compelled to spend time in it , without the sense of being on the way out of it , his own company would soon have grown irksome to him ; for however much men may be interested in themselves , there are few indeed who are interesting to themselves .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 19]: Those only whose self is aware of a higher presence can escape becoming bores and disgusts to themselves .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 31]: That every man is endlessly greater than what he calls himself , must seem a paradox to the ignorant and dull , but a universe would be impossible without it .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 26]: George had not arrived at the discovery of this fact , and yet was for the present contented both with himself and with his circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 19]: The heather was not in bloom , and the few flowers of the heathy land made no show .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 41]: Brown and darker brown predominated , with here and there a shadow of green ; and , weary of his outlook , George was settling back to his book , when there came a great bang and a tearing sound .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 13]: He started to his feet , and for hours knew nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 32]: A truck had run off the line and turned over ; the carriage in which he was had followed it , and one of the young man 's legs was broken .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 3]: CHAPTER III .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 2]: HELP .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 3]: `` Papa !
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 2]: papa !
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 9]: there is an accident on the line ! ''
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 18]: cried Miss Fordyce , running into her father 's study , where he sat surrounded with books .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 9]: `` I saw it from the door ! ''
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 4]: `` Hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 8]: returned the old man , and listened .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 16]: `` I hear the train going on , '' he said , after a moment .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 18]: `` Part of it is come to grief , I am certain , '' answered his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 7]: `` I saw something fall . ''
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 7]: `` Well , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 9]: `` What _ shall _ we do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 9]: `` What would you have us do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 10]: rejoined her father , without a movement toward rising .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 15]: `` It is too far off for us to be of any use . ''
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 9]: `` We ought to go and see . ''
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 22]: `` I am not fond of such seeing , Alexa , and will not go out of my way for it .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 12]: The misery I can not avoid is enough for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 34]: But Alexa was out of the room , and in a moment more was running , in as straight a line as she could keep , across the heath to the low embankment .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 7]: Andrew caught sight of her running .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 23]: He could not see the line , but convinced that something was the matter , turned and ran in the same direction .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 14]: It was a hard and long run for Alexa , over such ground .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 29]: Troubled at her father 's indifference , she ran the faster -- too fast for thinking , but not too fast for the thoughts that came of themselves .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 7]: What had come to her father ?
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 6]: Their house was the nearest !
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 24]: She could not shut out the conviction that , since succeeding to the property , he had been growing less and less neighborly .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 14]: She had caught up a bottle of brandy , which impeded her running .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 15]: Yet she made good speed , her dress gathered high in the other hand .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 58]: Her long dark hair broken loose and flying in the wind , her assumed dignity forgotten , and only the woman awake , she ran like a deer over the heather , and in little more than a quarter of an hour , though it was a long moor-mile , reached the embankment , flushed and panting .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 15]: Some of the carriages had rolled down , and the rails were a wreck .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 30]: But the engine and half the train had kept on : neither driver nor stoker was hurt , and they were hurrying to fetch help from the next station .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 27]: At the foot of the bank lay George Crawford insensible , with the guard of the train doing what he could to bring him to consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 20]: He was on his back , pale as death , with no motion and scare a sign of life .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 50]: Alexa tried to give him brandy , but she was so exhausted , and her hand shook so , that she had to yield the bottle to the guard , and , hale and strong as she was , could but drag herself a little apart before she fainted .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 34]: In the meantime , as the train approached the station , the driver , who belonged to the neighborhood , saw the doctor , slackened speed , and set his whistle shrieking wildly .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 17]: The doctor set spurs to his horse , and came straight over everything to his side .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 28]: `` You go on , '' he said , having heard what had happened ; `` I shall be there sooner than you could take me . ''
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 17]: He came first upon Andrew trying to make Miss Fordyce swallow a little of the brandy .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 15]: `` There 's but one gentleman hurt , sir , '' said the guard .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 17]: `` The other 's only a young lady that 's run till she 's dropped . ''
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 9]: `` To bring brandy , '' supplemented Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 23]: The doctor recognized Alexa , and wondered what reception her lather would give his patient , for to Potlurg he must go !
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 14]: Suddenly she came to herself , and sat up , gazing wildly around .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 12]: `` Out of breath , Miss Fordyce ; nothing worse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 8]: said the doctor , and she smiled .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 51]: He turned to the young man , and did for him what he could without splints or bandages ; then , with the help of the guard and Andrew , constructed , from pieces of the broken carriages , a sort of litter on which to carry him to Potlurg .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 6]: `` Is he dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 3]: asked Alexa .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 7]: `` Not a bit of it .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 12]: He 's had a bad blow on the head , though .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 12]: We must get him somewhere as fast as we can ! ''
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 7]: `` Do you know him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 4]: `` Not I .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 9]: But we must take him to your house .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 12]: I do n't know what else to do with him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 12]: `` What else should you want to do with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 11]: `` I was afraid it might bother the laird . ''
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 11]: `` You scarcely know my father , Doctor Pratt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 18]: `` It would bother most people to have a wounded man quartered on them for weeks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 4]: returned the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 4]: `` Poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 6]: A good-looking fellow too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 53]: A countryman who had been in the next carriage , but had escaped almost unhurt , offering his service , Andrew and he took up the litter gently , and set out walking with care , the doctor on one side , leading his horse , and Miss Fordyce on the other .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 29]: It was a strange building to which , after no small anxiety , they drew near ; nor did it look the less strange the nearer they came .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 42]: It was unsheltered by a single tree ; and but for a low wall and iron rail on one side , inclosing what had been a garden , but was now a grass-plot , it rose straight out of the heather .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 16]: From this plot the ground sloped to the valley , and was under careful cultivation .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 31]: The entrance to it was closed with a gate of wrought iron , of good workmanship , but so wasted with rust that it seemed on the point of vanishing .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 33]: Here at one time had been the way into the house ; but no door , and scarce a window , was now to be seen on this side of the building .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 28]: It was very old , and consisted of three gables , a great half-round between two of them , and a low tower with a conical roof .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 20]: Crawford had begun to recover consciousness , but when he came to himself he was received by acute pain .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 13]: The least attempt to move was torture , and again he fainted .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 3]: CHAPTER IV .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 3]: THE LAIRD .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 27]: Conducted by the lady , they passed round the house to the court , and across the court to a door in one of the gables .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 32]: It was a low , narrow door , but large enough for the man that stood there -- a little man , with colorless face , and quiet , abstracted look .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 16]: His eyes were cold and keen , his features small , delicate , and regular .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 64]: He had an erect little back , and was dressed in a long-tailed coat , looking not much of a laird , and less of a farmer , as he stood framed in the gray stone wall , in which odd little windows , dotted here and there at all heights and distances , revealed a wonderful arrangement of floors and rooms inside .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 7]: `` Good-morning , Mr. Fordyce ! ''
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 4]: said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 14]: `` This is a bad business , but it might have been worse !
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 8]: Not a soul injured but one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 11]: `` Souls do n't commonly get injured by accident ! ''
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 14]: returned the laird , with a cold smile that was far from discourteous .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 8]: `` Stick to the body , doctor !
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 6]: There you know something ! ''
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 9]: `` It 's a truth , laird ! ''
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 12]: answered the doctor -- but added to himself -- `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 12]: it 's awful to hear the truth from some mouths ! ''
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 11]: The laird spoke no word of objection or of welcome .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 41]: They carried the poor fellow into the house , following its mistress to a room , where , with the help of her one domestic , and instructed by the doctor , she soon had a bed prepared for him .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 36]: Then away rode the doctor at full speed to fetch the appliances necessary , leaving the laird standing by the bed , with a look of mild dissatisfaction , but not a whisper of opposition .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 33]: It was the guest-chamber to which George Crawford had been carried , a room far more comfortable than a stranger might , from the aspect of the house , have believed possible .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 57]: Everything in it was old-fashioned , and , having been dismantled , it was not in apple-pie order ; but it was rapidly and silently restored to its humble ideal ; and when the doctor , after an incredibly brief absence , returned with his assistant , he seemed both surprised and pleased at the change .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 24]: `` He must have some one to sit up with him , Miss Fordyce , '' he said , when all was done .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 9]: `` I will myself , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 17]: `` But you must give me exact directions , for I have done no nursing . ''
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 20]: `` If you will walk a little way with me , I will tell you all you need know .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 25]: He will sleep now , I think -- at least till you get back : I shall not keep you beyond a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 16]: It is not a very awkward fracture , '' he continued , as they went .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 8]: `` It might have been much worse !
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 10]: We shall have him about in a few weeks .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 14]: But he will want the greatest care while the bones are uniting . ''
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 39]: The laird turned from the bed , and went to his study , where he walked up and down , lost and old and pale , the very Bibliad of the room with its ancient volumes all around .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 33]: Whatever his eyes fell upon , he turned from , as if he had no longer any pleasure in it , and presently stole back to the room where the sufferer lay .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 48]: On tiptoe , with a caution suggestive of a wild beast asleep , he crept to the bed , looked down on his unwelcome guest with an expression of sympathy crossed with dislike , and shook his head slowly and solemnly , like one injured but forgiving .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 10]: His eye fell on the young man 's pocket-book .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 20]: It had fallen from his coat as they undressed him , and was on a table by the bedside .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 9]: He caught it up just ere Alexa reentered .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 8]: `` How is he , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 11]: `` He is fast asleep , '' answered the laid .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 15]: `` How long does the doctor think he will have to be here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 11]: `` I did not ask him , '' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 13]: `` That was an oversight , my child , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 15]: `` It is of consequence we should know the moment of his removal . ''
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 9]: `` We shall know it in good time .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 15]: The doctor called it an affair of weeks -- or months -- I forget .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 9]: But you shall not be troubled , father .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 7]: I will attend to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 10]: `` But I _ am _ troubled , Alexa !
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 11]: You do not know how little money I have ! ''
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 20]: Again he retired -- slowly , shut his door , locked it , and began to search the pocket-book .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 13]: He found certain banknotes , and made a discovery concerning its owner .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 27]: With the help of her old woman , and noiselessly , while Crawford lay in a half slumber , Alexa continued making the chamber more comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 86]: Chintz curtains veiled the windows , which , for all their narrowness , had admitted too much light ; and an old carpet deadened the sound of footsteps on the creaking boards -- for the bones of a house do not grow silent with age ; a fire burned in the antique grate , and was a soul to the chamber , which was chilly , looking to the north , with walls so thick that it took half the summer to warm them through .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 41]: Old Meg , moving to and fro , kept shaking her head like her master , as if she also were in the secret of some house-misery ; but she was only indulging the funereal temperament of an ancient woman .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 44]: As Alexa ran through the heather in the morning , she looked not altogether unlike a peasant ; her shoes were strong , her dress was short ; but now she came and went in a soft-colored gown , neither ill-made nor unbecoming .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 38]: She did not seem to belong to what is called society , but she looked dignified , at times almost stately , with an expression of superiority , not strong enough to make her handsome face unpleasing .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 20]: It resembled her father 's , but , for a woman 's , was cast in a larger mold .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 5]: The day crept on .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 5]: The invalid was feverish .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 12]: His nurse obeyed the doctor minutely , to a single drop .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 22]: She had her tea brought her , but when the supper hour arrived went to join her father in the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 3]: CHAPTER V .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 3]: AFTER SUPPER .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 7]: They always eat in the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 20]: Strange to say , there was no dining-room in the house , though there was a sweetly old-fashioned drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 29]: The servant was with the sufferer , but Alexa was too much in the sick-room , notwithstanding , to know that she was eating her porridge and milk .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 28]: The laird partook but sparingly , on the ground that the fare tended to fatness , which affliction of age he congratulated himself on having hitherto escaped .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 21]: They eat in silence , but not a glance of her father that might indicate a want escaped the daughter .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 35]: When the meal was ended , and the old man had given thanks , Alexa put on the table a big black Bible , which her father took with solemn face and reverent gesture .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 62]: In the course of his nightly reading of the New Testament , he had come to the twelfth chapter of St. Luke , with the Lord 's parable of the rich man whose soul they required of him : he read it beautifully , with an expression that seemed to indicate a sense of the Lord 's meaning what He said .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 25]: `` We will omit the psalm this evening -- for the sake of the sufferer , '' he said , having ended the chapter .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 11]: `` The Lord will have mercy and not sacrifice . ''
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 12]: They rose from their chairs and knelt on the stone floor .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 48]: The old man prayed with much tone and expression , and I think meant all he said , though none of it seemed to spring from fresh need or new thankfulness , for he used only the old stock phrases , which flowed freely from his lips .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 46]: He dwelt much on the merits of the Saviour ; he humbled himself as the chief of sinners , whom it must be a satisfaction to God to cut off , but a greater satisfaction to spare for the sake of one whom he loved .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 19]: Plainly the man counted it a most important thing to stand well with Him who had created him .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 33]: When they rose , Alexa looked formally solemn , but the wan face of her father shone : the Psyche , if not the Ego , had prayed -- and felt comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 29]: He sat down , and looked fixedly , as if into eternity , but perhaps it was into vacancy ; they are much the same to most people .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 23]: `` Come into the study for a moment , Lexy , if you please , '' he said , rising at length .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 26]: His politeness to his daughter , and indeed to all that came near him , was one of the most notable points in his behavior .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 37]: Alexa followed the black , slender , erect little figure up the stair , which consisted of about a dozen steps , filling the entrance from wall to wall , a width of some twelve feet .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 31]: Between it and the outer door there was but room for the door of the kitchen on the one hand , and that of a small closet on the other .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 42]: At the top was a wide space , a sort of irregular hall , more like an out-of-door court , paved with large flat stones into which projected the other side of the rounded mass , bordered by the grassy inclosure .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 24]: The laird turned to the right , and through a door into a room which had but one small window hidden by bookcases .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 20]: Naturally it smelled musty , of old books and decayed bindings , an odor not unpleasant to some nostrils .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 31]: He closed the door behind him , placed a chair for his daughter , and set himself in another by a deal table , upon which were books and papers .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 10]: `` This is a sore trial , Alexa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 6]: he said with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 14]: `` It is indeed , father -- for the poor young man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 3]: she returned .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 23]: `` True ; but it would be selfish indeed to regard the greatness of his suffering as rendering our trial the less .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 14]: It is to us a more serious matter than you seem to think .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 21]: It will cost much more than , in the present state of my finances , I can afford to pay .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 22]: You little think -- '' `` But , father , '' interrupted Alexa , `` how could we help it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 9]: `` He might have been carried elsewhere ! ''
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 6]: `` With me standing there !
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 5]: Surely not , father !
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 9]: Even Andrew Ingram offered to receive him . ''
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 10]: `` Why did he not take him then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 9]: `` The doctor would n't hear of it .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 10]: And I would n't hear of it either . ''
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 7]: `` It was ill-considered , Lexy .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 11]: But what 's done is done -- though , alas !
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 5]: not paid for . ''
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 13]: `` We must take the luck as it comes , father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 18]: `` Alexa , '' rejoined the laird with solemnity , `` you ought never to mention luck .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 6]: There is no such thing .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 26]: It was either for the young man 's sins , or to prevent worse , or for necessary discipline , that the train was overturned .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 9]: The cause is known to _ Him _ .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 28]: All are in His hands -- and we must beware of attempting to take any out of His hands , for it can not be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 17]: `` Then , father , if there be no chance , our part was ordered too .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 29]: So there is the young man in our spare room , and we must receive our share of the trouble as from the hand of the Lord . ''
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 6]: `` Certainly , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 9]: it was the expense I was thinking of .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 20]: I was only lamenting -- bear me witness , I was not opposing -- the will of the Lord .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 8]: A man 's natural feelings remain . ''
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 19]: `` If the thing is not to be helped , let us think no more about it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 9]: `` It is the expense , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 14]: Will you not let your mind rest for a moment upon the fact ?
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 11]: I am doing my utmost to impress it upon you .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 21]: For other expenses there is always something to show ; for this there will be nothing , positively nothing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 9]: `` Not the mended leg , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 18]: `` The money will vanish , I tell you , as a tale that is told . ''
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 11]: `` It is our life that vanishes that way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 6]: `` The simile suits either .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 25]: So long as we do not use the words of Scripture irreverently , there is no harm in making a different application of them .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 25]: There is no irreverence here : next to the grace of God , money is the thing hardest to get and hardest to keep .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 21]: If we are not wise with it , the grace -- I mean money -- will not go far . ''
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 12]: `` Not so far as the next world , anyhow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 8]: said Alexa , as if to herself .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 7]: `` How dare you , child !
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 26]: The Redeemer tells us to make friends of the mammon of unrighteousness , that when we die it may receive us into everlasting habitations ! ''
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 25]: `` I read the passage this morning , father : it is _ they _ , not _ it _ , will receive you .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 30]: And I have heard that it ought to be translated , ` make friends _ with _ , or _ by means of _ the mammon of unrighteousness . ''
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 7]: `` I will reconsider the passage .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 11]: We must not lightly change even the translated word ! ''
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 23]: The laird had never thought that it might be of consequence to him one day to have friends in the other world .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 20]: Neither had he reflected that the Lord did not regard the obligation of gratitude as ceasing with this life .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 27]: Alexa had reason to fear that her father made a friend _ of _ , and never a friend _ with _ the mammon of unrighteousness .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 50]: At the same time the half-penny he put in the plate every Sunday must go a long way if it was not estimated , like that of the poor widow , according to the amount he possessed , but according to the difficulty he found in parting with it .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 41]: `` After weeks , perhaps months of nursing and food and doctor 's stuff , '' resumed the laird , `` he will walk away , and we shall see not a plack of the money he carries with him .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 13]: The visible will become the invisible , the present the absent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 18]: `` The little it will cost you , father -- '' `` Hold there , my child !
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 29]: If you call any cost little , I will not hear a word more : we should be but running a race from different points to different goals !
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 8]: It will cost -- that is enough !
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 27]: How much it will cost _ me _ , you can not calculate , for you do not know what money stands for in my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 10]: There are things before which money is insignificant ! ''
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 7]: `` Those dreary old books ! ''
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 26]: said Alexa to herself , casting a glance on the shelves that filled the room from floor to ceiling , and from wall to wall .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 35]: `` What I was going to say , father , '' she returned , `` was , that I have a little money of my own , and this affair shall cost you nothing .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 5]: Leave me to contrive .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 16]: Would you tell him his friends must pay his board , or take him away ?
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 16]: It would be a nice anecdote in the annals of the Fordyces of Potlurg ! ''
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 11]: `` At the same time , what more natural ? ''
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 4]: rejoined her father .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 11]: `` His friends must in any case be applied to !
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 11]: I learn from his pocket-book -- '' `` Father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 6]: `` Content yourself , Alexa .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 13]: I have a right to know whom I receive under my roof .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 17]: Besides , have I not learned thereby that the youth is a sort of connection ! ''
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 10]: `` You do n't mean it , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 6]: `` I do mean it .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 9]: His mother and yours were first cousins . ''
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 14]: `` That is not a connection ; it 's a close kinship ! ''
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 5]: `` Is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 6]: said the laird , dryly .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 23]: `` Anyhow , '' pursued Alexa , `` I give you my word you shall hear nothing more of the expense . ''
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 18]: She bade her father good-night , and returning to the bedside of her patient , released Meg .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 3]: CHAPTER VI .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 4]: ABOUT THE LAIRD .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 38]: Thomas Fordyce was a sucker from the root of a very old family tree , born in poverty , and , with great pinching of father and mother , brothers and sisters , educated for the Church .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 48]: But from pleasure in scholarship , from archaeological tastes , a passion for the arcana of history , and a love of literature , strong , although not of the highest kind , he had settled down as a school-master , and in his calling had excelled .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 18]: By all who knew him he was regarded as an accomplished , amiable , and worthy man .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 48]: When his years were verging on the undefined close of middle age he saw the lives between him and the family property , one by one wither at the touch of death , until at last there was no one but himself and his daughter to succeed .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 40]: He was at the time the head of a flourishing school in a large manufacturing town ; and it was not without some regret , though with more pleasure , that he yielded his profession and retired to Potlurg .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 31]: Greatly dwindled as he found the property , and much and long as it had been mismanaged , it was yet of considerable value , and worth a wise care .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 36]: The result of the labor he spent upon it was such that it had now for years yielded him , if not a large rental , one far larger at least than his daughter imagined .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 24]: But the sinking of the school-master in the laird seemed to work ill for the man , and good only for the land .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 34]: I say _ seemed _ , because what we call degeneracy is often but the unveiling of what was there all the time ; and the evil we could become , we are .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 41]: If I have in me the tyrant or the miser , there he is , and such am I -- as surely as if the tyrant or the miser were even now visible to the wondering dislike of my neighbors .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 62]: I do not say the characteristic is so strong , or would be so hard to change as by the revealing development it must become ; but it is there , alive , as an egg is alive ; and by no means inoperative like a mere germ , but exercising real though occult influence on the rest of my character .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 37]: Therefore , except the growing vitality be in process of killing these ova of death , it is for the good of the man that they should be so far developed as to show their existence .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 22]: If the man do not then starve and slay them they will drag him to the judgment-seat of a fiery indignation .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 58]: For the laird , nature could ill replace the human influences that had surrounded the school-master ; while enlargement both of means and leisure enabled him to develop by indulgence a passion for a peculiar kind of possession , which , however refined in its objects , was yet but a branch of the worship of Mammon .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 24]: It suits the enemy just as well , I presume , that a man should give his soul for coins as for money .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 35]: In consequence he was growing more and more withdrawn , ever filling less the part of a man -- which is to be a hiding-place from the wind , a covert from the tempest .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 14]: He was more and more for himself , and thereby losing his life .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 50]: Dearly as he loved his daughter , he was , by slow fallings away , growing ever less of a companion , less of a comfort , less of a necessity to her , and requiring less and less of her for the good or ease of his existence .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 11]: We wrong those near us in being independent of them .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 10]: God himself would not be happy without His Son .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 20]: We ought to lean on each other , giving and receiving -- not as weaklings , but as lovers .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 8]: Love is strength as well as need .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 19]: Alexa was more able to live alone than most women ; therefore it was the worse for her .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 25]: Too satisfied with herself , too little uneasy when alone , she did not know that then she was not in good enough company .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 27]: She was what most would call a strong nature , nor knew what weaknesses belong to , and grow out of , such strength as hers .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 52]: The remoter scions of a family tree are not seldom those who make most account of it ; the school-master 's daughter knew more about the Fordyces of Potlurg , and cared more for their traditions , than any who of later years had reaped its advantages or shared its honors .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 32]: Interest in the channel down which one has slid into the world is reasonable , and may be elevating ; with Alexa it passed beyond good , and wrought for evil .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 35]: Proud of a family with a history , and occasionally noted in the annals of the country , she regarded herself as the superior of all with whom she had hitherto come into relation .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 42]: To the poor , to whom she was invariably and essentially kind , she was less condescending than to such as came nearer her own imagined standing ; she was constantly aware that she belonged to the elect of the land !
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 18]: Society took its revenge ; the rich trades-people looked down upon her as the school-master 's daughter .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 13]: Against their arrogance her indignation buttressed her lineal with her mental superiority .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 12]: At the last the pride of family is a personal arrogance .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 15]: And now at length she was in her natural position as heiress of Potlurg !
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 22]: She was religious -- if one may be called religious who felt no immediate relation to the source of her being .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 42]: She felt bound to defend , so far as she honestly could , the doctrines concerning God and His ways transmitted by the elders of her people ; to this much , and little more , her religion toward God amounted .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 14]: But she had a strong sense of obligation to do what was right .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 28]: Her father gave her so little money to spend that she had to be very careful with her housekeeping , and they lived in the humblest way .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 52]: For her person she troubled him as little as she could , believing him , from the half statements and hints he gave , and his general carriage toward life , not a little oppressed by lack of money , nor suspecting his necessities created and his difficulties induced by himself .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 41]: In this regard it had come to be understood between them that the produce of the poultry-yard was Alexa 's own ; and to some little store she had thus gathered she mainly trusted for the requirements of her invalid .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 34]: To this her father could not object , though he did not like it ; he felt what was hers to be his more than he felt what was his to be hers .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 66]: Alexa had not learned to place value on money beyond its use , but she was not therefore free from the service of Mammon ; she looked to it as to a power essential , not derived ; she did not see it as God 's creation , but merely as an existence , thus making of a creature of God the mammon of unrighteousness .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 17]: She did not , however , cling to it , but was ready to spend it .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 34]: At the same time , had George Crawford looked less handsome or less of a gentleman , she would not have been so ready to devote the contents of her little secret drawer .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 14]: The discovery of her relationship to the young man waked a new feeling .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 74]: She had never had a brother , never known a cousin , and had avoided the approach of such young men as , of inferior position in her eyes , had sought to be friendly with her ; here was one thrown helpless on her care , with necessities enough to fill the gap between his real relation to her , and that of the brother after whom she had sighed in vain !
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 37]: It was a new and delightful sensation to have a family claim on a young man -- a claim , the material advantage of which was all on his side , the devotion all on hers .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 12]: She was invaded by a flood of tenderness toward the man .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 16]: Was he not her cousin , a gentleman , and helpless as any new-born child ?
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 15]: Nothing should be wanting that a strong woman could do for a powerless man .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 3]: CHAPTER VII .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 3]: THE COUSINS .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 24]: George Crawford was in excellent health when the accident occurred , and so when he began to recover , his restoration was rapid .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 30]: The process , however , was still long enough to compel the cousins to know more of each other than twelve months of ordinary circumstance would have made possible .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 69]: George , feeling neither the need , nor , therefore , the joy of the new relationship so much as Alexa , disappointed her by the coolness of his response to her communication of the fact ; and as they were both formal , that is , less careful as to the reasonable than as to the conventional , they were not very ready to fall in love .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 22]: Such people may learn all about each other , and not come near enough for love to be possible between them .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 21]: Some people approximate at once , and at once decline to love , remaining friends the rest of their lives .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 22]: Others love at once ; and some take a whole married life to come near enough , and at last love .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 22]: But the reactions of need and ministration can hardly fail to breed tenderness , and disclose the best points of character .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 20]: The cousins were both handsome , and -- which was of more consequence -- each thought the other handsome .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 47]: They found their religious opinions closely coincident -- nor any wonder , for they had gone for years to the same church every Sunday , had been regularly pumped upon from the same reservoir , and had drunk the same arguments concerning things true and untrue .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 45]: George found that Alexa had plenty of brains , a cultivated judgment , and some knowledge of literature ; that there was no branch of science with which she had not some little acquaintance , in which she did not take some small interest .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 58]: Her father 's teaching was beyond any he could have procured for her , and what he taught she had learned ; for she had a love of knowing , a tendency to growth , a capacity for seizing real points , though as yet perceiving next to nothing of their relation to human life and hope .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 33]: She believed herself a judge of verse , but in truth her knowledge of poetry was limited to its outer forms , of which she had made good studies with her father .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 39]: She had learned the _ how _ before the _ what _ , knew the body before the soul -- could tell good binding but not bad leather -- in a word , knew verse but not poetry .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 40]: She understood nothing of music , but George did not miss that ; he was more sorry she did not know French -- not for the sake of its literature , but because of showing herself an educated woman .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 14]: Diligent in business , not fervent in spirit , she was never idle .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 11]: But there are other ways than idleness of wasting time .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 42]: Alexa was continually `` improving herself , '' but it was a big phrase for a small matter ; she had not learned that to do the will of God is the _ only _ way to improve one 's self .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 23]: She would have scorned the narrowness of any one who told her so , not understanding what the will of God means .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 26]: She found that her guest and cousin was a man of some position , and wondered that her father should never have mentioned the relationship .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 47]: The fact was that , in a time of poverty , the school-master had made to George 's father the absurd request of a small loan without security , and the banker had behaved as a rich relation and a banker was pretty sure to behave .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 34]: George occupied a place of trust in the bank , and , though not yet admitted to a full knowledge of its more important transactions , hoped soon to be made a partner .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 26]: When his father came to Potlurg to see him the laird declined to appear , and the banker contented himself thereafter with Alexa 's bulletins .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 3]: CHAPTER VIII .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 5]: GEORGE AND THE LAIRD .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 33]: Alexa 's money was nearly exhausted , and most of her chickens had been devoured by the flourishing convalescent , but not yet would the doctor allow him to return to business .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 22]: One night the electric condition of the atmosphere made it heavy , sultry and unrefreshing , and George could not sleep .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 49]: There came a terrible burst of thunder ; then a bannered spear of vividest lightning seemed to lap the house in its flashing folds , and the simultaneous thunder was mingled with the sound , as it seemed , of the fall of some part of the building .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 8]: George sat up in bed and listened .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 4]: All was still .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 16]: He must rise and see what had happened , and whether any one was hurt .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 20]: He might meet Alexa , and a talk with her would be a pleasant episode in his sleepless night .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 17]: He got into his dressing-gown , and taking his stick , walked softly from the room .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 11]: His door opened immediately on the top of the stair .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 15]: He stood and listened , but was aware of no sequel to the noise .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 19]: Another flash came , and lighted up the space around him , with its walls of many angles .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 42]: When the darkness was returned and the dazzling gone , and while the thunder yet bellowed , he caught the glimmer of a light under the door of the study , and made his way toward it over the worn slabs .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 9]: He knocked , but there was no answer .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 17]: He pushed the door , and saw that the light came from behind a projecting book-case .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 10]: He hesitated a moment , and glanced about him .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 8]: A little clinking sound came from somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 15]: He stole nearer the source of the light ; a thief might be there .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 9]: He peeped round the end of the book-case .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 14]: With his back to him the laird was kneeling before an open chest .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 16]: He had just counted a few pieces of gold , and was putting them away .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 19]: He turned over his shoulder a face deathly pale , and his eyes for a moment stared blank .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 8]: Then with a shivering smile he rose .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 17]: He had a thin-worn dressing-gown over his night-shirt , and looked a thread of a man .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 9]: `` You take me for a miser ? ''
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 11]: he said , trembling , and stood expecting an answer .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 10]: Crawford was bewildered : what business had he there ?
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 10]: `` I am _ not _ a miser ! ''
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 4]: resumed the laird .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 13]: `` A man may count his money without being a miser ! ''
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 26]: He stood and stared , still trembling , at his guest , either too much startled or too gentle to find fault with his intrusion .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 12]: `` I beg your pardon , laird , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 15]: `` I knocked , but receiving no answer , feared something was wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 15]: `` But why are you out of bed -- and you an invalid ? ''
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 4]: returned Mr. Fordyce .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 17]: `` I heard a heavy fall , and feared the lightning had done some damage . ''
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 26]: `` We shall see about that in the morning , and in the meantime you had better go to bed , '' said the laird .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 7]: They turned together toward the door .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 14]: `` What a multitude of books , you have , Mr. Fordyce ! ''
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 3]: remarked George .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 15]: `` I had not a notion of such a library in the county ! ''
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 17]: `` I have been a lover of books all my life , '' returned the laird .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 9]: `` And they gather , they gather ! ''
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 3]: he added .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 10]: `` Your love draws them , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 14]: `` The storm is over , I think , '' said the laird .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 32]: He did not tell his guest that there was scarcely a book on those shelves not sought after by book-buyers -- not one that was not worth money in the book-market .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 34]: Here and there the dulled gold of a fine antique binding returned the gleam of the candle , but any gathering of old law or worthless divinity would have looked much the same .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 13]: `` I should like to glance over them , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 12]: `` There must be some valuable volumes among so many ! ''
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 3]: `` Rubbish !
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 3]: rubbish ! ''
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 14]: rejoined the old man , testily , almost hustling him from the room .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 12]: `` I am ashamed to hear it called a library . ''
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 19]: It seemed to Crawford , as again he lay awake in his bed , altogether a strange incident .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 44]: A man may count his money when he pleases , but not the less must it seem odd that he should do so in the middle of the night , and with such a storm flashing and roaring around him , apparently unheeded .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 27]: The next morning he got his cousin to talk about her father , but drew from her nothing to cast light on what he had seen .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 3]: CHAPTER IX .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 4]: IN THE GARDEN .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 21]: Of the garden which had been the pride of many owners of the place , only a small portion remained .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 30]: It was strangely antique , haunted with a beauty both old and wild , the sort of garden for the children of heaven to play in when men sleep .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 60]: In a little arbor constructed by an old man who had seen the garden grow less and less through successive generations , a tent of honeysuckle in a cloak of sweet pease , sat George and Alexa , two highly respectable young people , Scots of Scotland , like Jews of Judaea , well satisfied of their own worthiness .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 12]: How they found their talk interesting , I can scarce think .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 32]: I should have expected them to be driven by very dullness to love-making ; but the one was too prudent to initiate it , the other too staid to entice it .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 42]: Yet , people on the borders of love being on the borders of poetry , they had got talking about a certain new poem , concerning which George , having read several notices of it , had an opinion to give .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 25]: `` You should tell my father about it , George , '' said Alexa ; `` he is the best judge I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 24]: She did not understand that it was a little more than the grammar of poetry the school-master had ever given himself to understand .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 15]: His best criticism was to show phrase calling to phrase across gulfs of speech .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 29]: The little iron gate , whose hinges were almost gone with rust , creaked and gnarred as it slowly opened to admit the approach of a young countryman .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 45]: He advanced with the long , slow , heavy step suggestive of nailed shoes ; but his hazel eye had an outlook like that of an eagle from its eyrie , and seemed to dominate his being , originating rather than directing its motions .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 55]: He had a russet-colored face , much freckled ; hair so dark red as to be almost brown ; a large , well-shaped nose ; a strong chin ; and a mouth of sweetness whose smile was peculiarly its own , having in it at once the mystery and the revelation of Andrew Ingram .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 34]: He took off his bonnet as he drew near , and held it as low as his knee , while with something of the air of an old-fashioned courtier , he stood waiting .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 26]: His clothes , all but his coat , which was of some blue stuff , and his Sunday one , were of a large-ribbed corduroy .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 7]: For a moment no one spoke .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 15]: He colored a little , but kept silent , his eyes on the lady .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 6]: `` Good-morning , Andrew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 5]: she said at length .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 15]: `` There was something , I forget what , you were to call about !
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 7]: Remind me -- will you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 16]: `` I did not come before , ma'am , because I knew you were occupied .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 10]: And even now it does not greatly matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 6]: `` Oh , I remember !
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 4]: -- the poem !
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 23]: I am very sorry , but I had so much to think of that it went quite out of my mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 23]: An expression half amused , half shy , without trace of mortification , for an instant shadowed the young man 's face .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 14]: `` I wish you would let me have the lines again , ma'am !
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 9]: Indeed I should be obliged to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 11]: `` Well , I confess they might first be improved !
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 25]: I read them one evening to my father , and he agreed with me that two or three of them were not quite rhythmical .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 17]: But he said it was a fair attempt , and for a working-man very creditable . ''
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 43]: What Andrew was thinking , it would have been hard to gather from his smile ; but I believe it was that , if he had himself read the verses aloud , the laird would have found no fault with their rhythm .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 15]: His carriage seemed more that of a patient , respectful amusement than anything else .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 33]: Alexa rose , but resumed her seat , saying : `` As the poem is a religious one , there can be no harm in handing it you on Sunday after church !
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 18]: -- that is , '' she added , meaningly , `` if you will be there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 16]: `` Give it to Dawtie , if you please , ma'am , '' replied Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 11]: rebuked Miss Fordyce , in a tone almost of rebuke .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 25]: `` I seldom go to church , ma'am , '' said Andrew , reddening a little , but losing no sweetness from his smile .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 6]: `` I understand as much !
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 5]: It is very wrong !
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 8]: _ Why _ do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 4]: Andrew was silent .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 21]: `` I wish you to tell me , '' persisted Alexa , with a peremptoriness which came of the school-master .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 13]: She had known him too as a pupil of her father 's !
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 30]: `` If you will have it , ma'am , I not only learn nothing from Mr. Smith , but I think much that he says is not true . ''
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 13]: `` Still you ought to go for the sake of example . ''
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 11]: `` Do wrong to make other people follow my example ?
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 9]: Can that be to do right ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 8]: _ Wrong _ to go to church !
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 7]: What _ do _ you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 8]: Wrong to pray with your fellow-men ? ''
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 40]: `` Perhaps the hour may come , ma'am , when I shall be able to pray with my fellow-men , even though the words they use seem addressed to a tyrant , not to the Father of Jesus Christ .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 7]: But at present I can not .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 36]: I might endure to hear Mr. Smith say evil things concerning God , but the evil things he says to God make me quite unable to pray , and I feel like a hypocrite ! ''
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 27]: `` Whatever you may think of Mr. Smith 's doctrines , it is presumptuous to set yourself up as too good to go to church . ''
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 9]: `` I most bear the reproach , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 17]: I can not consent to be a hypocrite in order to avoid being called one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 17]: Either Miss Fordyce had no answer to this , or did not choose to give any .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 26]: She was not troubled that Andrew would not go to church , but offended at the unhesitating decision with which he set her counsel aside .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 33]: Andrew made her a respectful bow , turned away , put on his bonnet , which he had held in his hand all the time , and passed through the garden gate .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 7]: `` Who is the fellow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 11]: asked George , partaking sympathetically of his companion 's annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 20]: `` He is Andrew Ingram , the son of a small farmer , one of my father 's tenants .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 12]: He and his brother work with their father on the farm .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 6]: They are quite respectable people .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 10]: Andrew is conceited , but has his good points .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 13]: He imagines himself a poet , and indeed his work has merit .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 17]: The worst of him is that he sets up for being better than other people . ''
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 10]: `` Not an unusual fault with the self-educated ! ''
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 21]: `` He does go on educating himself , I believe , but he had a good start to begin with .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 10]: My father took much pains with him at school .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 27]: He helped to carry you here after the accident -- and would have taken you to his father 's if I would have let him . ''
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 9]: George cast on her a look of gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 11]: `` Thank you for keeping me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 14]: `` But I wish I had taken some notice of his kindness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 5]: CHAPTER X. ANDREW INGRAM .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 24]: Of the persons in my narrative , Andrew Ingram is the simplest , therefore the hardest to be understood by an ordinary reader .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 14]: I must take up his history from a certain point in his childhood .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 23]: One summer evening , he and his brother Sandy were playing together on a knoll in one of their father 's fields .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 12]: Andrew was ten years old , and Sandy a year younger .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 19]: The two quarreled , and the spirit of ancestral borderers waking in them , they fell to blows .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 44]: The younger was the stronger for his years , and they were punching each other with relentless vigor , when suddenly they heard a voice , and stopping their fight , saw before them an humble-looking man with a pack on his back .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 26]: He was a peddler known in the neighborhood , and noted for his honesty and his silence , but the boys had never seen him .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 45]: They stood abashed before him , dazed with the blows they had received , and not a little ashamed ; for they were well brought up , their mother being an honest disciplinarian , and their father never interfering with what she judged right .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 40]: The sun was near the setting , and shone with level rays full on the peddler ; but when they thought of him afterward , they seemed to remember more light in his face than that of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 12]: Their conscience bore him witness , and his look awed them .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 17]: Involuntarily they turned from him , seeking refuge with each other : his eyes shone so !
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 11]: they said ; but immediately they turned to him again .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 67]: Sandy knew the pictures in the `` Pilgrim 's Progress , '' and Andrew had read it through more than once : when they saw the man had a book in his hand , open , and heard him , standing there in the sun , begin to read from it , they thought it must be Christian , waiting for Evangelist to come to him .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 59]: It is impossible to say how much is fact and how much imagination in what children recollect ; the one must almost always supplement the other ; but they were quite sure that the words he read were these : `` And lo , I am with you always , even to the end of the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 40]: The next thing they remembered was their walking slowly down the hill in the red light , and all at once waking up to the fact that the man was gone , they did not know when or where .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 19]: But their arms were round each other 's necks , and they were full of a strange awe .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 10]: Then Andrew saw something red on Sandy 's face .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 6]: `` Eh , Sandy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 9]: he cried , `` it 's bluid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 5]: and burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 10]: It was his own blood , not Sandy 's !
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 22]: -- the discovery of which fact relieved Andrew , and did not so greatly discompose Sandy , who was less sensitive .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 11]: They began at length to speculate on what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 28]: One thing was clear : it was because they were fighting that the man had come ; but it was not so clear who the man was .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 13]: He could not be Christian , because Christian went over the river !
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 16]: Andrew suggested it might have been Evangelist , for he seemed to be always about .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 28]: Sandy added , as his contribution to the idea , that he might have picked up Christian 's bundle and been carrying it home to his wife .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 59]: They came , however , to the conclusion , by no ratiocination , I think , but by a conviction which the idea itself brought with it , that the stranger was the Lord himself , and that the pack on His back was their sins , which He was carrying away to throw out of the world .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 19]: `` Eh , wasna it fearfu ' He should come by jist when we was fechtin ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 3]: said Sandy .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 5]: `` Eh , na !
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 7]: it was a fine thing that !
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 8]: We micht hae been at it yet !
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 5]: But we winna noo !
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 8]: -- will we ever , Sandy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 8]: `` Na , that we winna ! ''
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 20]: `` For , '' continued Andrew , `` He said ` Lo , I am with you always ! '
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 21]: And suppose He werena , we daurna be that ahint His back we would na be afore His face ! ''
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 14]: `` Do you railly think it _ was _ Him , Andrew ? ''
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 59]: `` Weel , '' replied Andrew , `` gien the deevil be goin ' aboot like a roarin ' lion , seekin ' whom he may devoor , as father says , it 's no likely _ He _ would na be goin ' aboot as weel , seekin ' to haud him aff o ' 's ! ''
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 4]: `` Ay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 3]: said Sandy .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 17]: `` And noo , '' said the elder , `` what are we to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 53]: For Andrew , whom both father and mother judged the dreamiest of mortals , was in reality the most practical being in the whole parish -- so practical that by and by people mocked him for a poet and a heretic , because he did the things which they said they believed .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 16]: Most unpractical must every man appear who genuinely believes in the things that are unseen .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 35]: The man called practical by the men of this world is he who busies himself building his house on the sand , while he does not even bespeak a lodging in the inevitable beyond .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 8]: `` What are we to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 3]: said Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 26]: `` If the Lord is going about like that , looking after us , we 've surely got something to do looking after _ Him !
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 48]: _ '' There was no help in Sandy ; and it was well that , with the reticence of children , neither thought of laying the case before their parents ; the traditions of the elders would have ill agreed with the doctrine they were now under !
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 28]: Suddenly it came into Andrew 's mind that the book they read at _ worship _ to which he had never listened , told all about Jesus .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 42]: He began at the beginning , and grew so interested in the stories that he forgot why he had begun to read it One day , however , as he was telling Sandy about Jacob -- `` What a shame ! ''
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 23]: said Sandy ; and Andrew 's mind suddenly opened to the fact that he had got nothing yet out of the book .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 18]: He threw it from him , echoing Sandy 's words , `` What 's a shame ! ''
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 46]: -- not of Jacob 's behavior , but of the Bible 's , which had all this time told them nothing about the man that was going up and down the world , gathering up their sins , and carrying them away in His pack !
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 23]: But it dawned upon him that it was the New Testament that told about Jesus Christ , and they turned to that .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 42]: Here also I say it was well they asked no advice , for they would probably have been directed to the Epistle to the Romans , with explanations yet more foreign to the heart of Paul than false to his Greek .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 31]: They began to read the story of Jesus as told by his friend Matthew , and when they had ended it , went on to the gospel according to Mark .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 27]: But they had not read far when Sandy cried out : `` Eh , Andrew , it 's a ' the same thing ower again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 10]: `` No a ` thegither , '' answered Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 10]: `` We 'll gang on , and see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 84]: Andrew came to the conclusion that it was so far the same that he would rather go back and read the other again , for the sake of some particular things he wanted to make sure about So the second time they read St. Matthew , and came to these words : `` If two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask , it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven . ''
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 10]: `` There 's twa o ' 's here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 8]: cried Andrew , laying down the book .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 8]: `` Lat 's try ` t ! ''
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 5]: `` Try what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 3]: said Sandy .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 7]: His brother read the passage again .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 13]: `` Lat the twa o ' 's speir Him for something ! ''
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 3]: concluded Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 8]: `` What wull ' t be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 25]: `` I won ` er if it means only ance , or may be three times , like ` The Three Wishes ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 23]: suggested Sandy , who , like most Christians , would rather have a talk about it than do what he was told .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 16]: `` We _ might _ ask for what would not be good for us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 3]: returned Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 8]: `` And make fools of ourselves ! ''
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 13]: assented Sandy , with `` The Three Wishes '' in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 12]: `` Do you think He would give it us then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 7]: `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 35]: `` But , '' pursued Andrew , `` if we were so foolish as that old man and woman , it would be better to find it out , and begin to grow wise !
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 35]: -- I 'll tell you what we 'll do : we 'll make it our first wish to know what 's best to ask for ; and then we can go on asking ! ''
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 9]: `` Yes , yes ; let us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 13]: `` I fancy we 'll have as many wishes as we like !
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 9]: Doon upo ' yer knees , Sandy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 4]: They knelt together .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 18]: I fear there are not a few to say , `` How ill-instructed the poor children were !
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 11]: -- actually mingling the gospel and the fairy tales ! ''
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 53]: `` Happy children , '' say I , `` who could blunder into the very heart of the will of God concerning them , and _ do _ the thing at once that the Lord taught them , using the common sense which God had given and the fairy tale nourished ! ''
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 18]: The Lord of the promise is the Lord of all true parables and all good fairy tales .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 17]: Andrew prayed : `` Oh , Lord , tell Sandy and me what to ask for .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 5]: We 're unanimous . ''
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 7]: They got up from their knees .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 13]: They had said what they had to say : why say more !
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 5]: They felt rather dull .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 5]: Nothing came to them .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 13]: The prayer was prayed , and they could not make the answer !
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 8]: There was no use in reading more !
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 65]: They put the Bible away in a rough box where they kept it among rose-leaves -- ignorant priests of the lovely mystery of Him who was with them always -- and without a word went each his own way , not happy , for were they not leaving Him under the elder-tree , lonely and shadowy , where it was their custom to meet !
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 22]: Alas for those who must go to church to find Him , or who can not pray unless in their closet !
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 29]: They wandered about disconsolate , at school and at home , the rest of the day -- at least Andrew did ; Sandy had Andrew to lean upon !
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 20]: Andrew had Him who was with them always , but He seemed at the other end of the world .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 12]: They had prayed , and there was no more of it !
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 32]: In the evening , while yet it was light , Andrew went alone to the elder-tree , took the Bible from its humble shrine , and began turning over its leaves .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 21]: `` And why call ye me , Lord , Lord , and do not the things which I say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 9]: He read , and sunk deep in thought .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 12]: This is the way his thoughts went : `` What things ?
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 6]: What had He been saying ?
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 18]: Let me look and see what He says , that I may begin to do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 15]: He read all the chapter , and found it full of _ tellings _ .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 26]: When he read it before he had not thought of doing one of the things He said , for as plainly as He told him !
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 13]: He had not once thought He had any concern in the matter !
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 5]: `` I see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 17]: he said ; `` we must begin at once to do what He tells us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 7]: He ran to find his brother .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 7]: `` I 've got it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 10]: he cried : `` I 've got it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 15]: `` What we 've got to do '' `` And what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 8]: `` Just what He tells us . ''
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 24]: `` We were doing that , '' said Sandy , `` when we prayed Him to tell us what to pray for ! ''
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 5]: `` So we were !
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 5]: That 's grand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 13]: `` Then have n't we got to pray for anything more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 18]: `` We 'll soon find out ; but first we must look for something to do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 15]: They began at once to search for things the Lord told them to do .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 30]: And of all they found , the plainest and easiest was : `` Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek , turn to him the other also . ''
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 5]: This needed no explanation !
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 12]: it was as clear as the day to both of them !
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 39]: The very next morning the school-master , who , though of a gentle disposition , was irritable , taking Andrew for the offender in a certain breach of discipline , gave him a smart box on the ear .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 18]: Andrew , as readily as if it had been instinctively , turned to him the other cheek .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 45]: An angry man is an evil interpreter of holy things , and Mr. Fordyce took the action for one of rudest mockery , nor thought of the higher master therein mocked if it were mockery : he struck the offender a yet smarter blow .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 40]: Andrew stood for a minute like one dazed ; but the red on his face was not that of anger ; he was perplexed as to whether he ought now to turn the former cheek again to the striker .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 12]: Uncertain , he turned away , and went to his work .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 28]: Stops a reader here to say : `` But do you really mean to tell us we ought to take the words literally as Andrew did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 21]: I answer : `` When you have earned the right to understand , you will not need to ask me .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 25]: To explain what the Lord means to one who is not obedient , is the work of no man who knows his work . ''
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 44]: It is but fair to say for the school-master that , when he found he had mistaken , he tried to make up to the boy for it -- not by confessing himself wrong -- who could expect that of only a school-master ?
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 10]: -- but by being kinder to him than before .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 29]: Through this he came to like him , and would teach him things out of the usual way -- such as how to make different kinds of verse .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 10]: By and by Andrew and Sandy had a quarrel .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 12]: Suddenly Andrew came to himself , and cried : `` Sandy !
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 2]: Sandy !
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 8]: He says we 're to agree ! ''
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 5]: `` Does He ? ''
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 21]: `` He says we 're to love one another , and we canna do that if we dinna agree ! ''
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 5]: There came a pause .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 13]: `` Perhaps after all you were in the right , Sandy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 3]: said Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 31]: `` I was just going to say that ; when I think about it , perhaps I was n't so much in the right as I thought I was ! ''
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 21]: `` It ca n't matter much which was in the right , when we were both in the wrong ! ''
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 3]: said Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 42]: `` Let 's ask Him to keep us from caring which is in the right , and make us both try to be in the right We do n't often differ about what we are to ask for , Sandy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 8]: `` No , we do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 13]: `` It 's me to take care of you , Sandy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 12]: `` And me to take care of you , Andrew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 8]: Here was the nucleus of a church !
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 8]: -- two stones laid on the foundation-stone .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 7]: `` Luik here , Sandy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 21]: said Andrew ; `` we maun hae anither , an ' syne there 'll be four o ' 's ! ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 6]: `` How 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 3]: asked Sandy .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 13]: `` I won ` er ` at we never noticed it afore !
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 29]: Here 's what He says : ` For where two or three are gathered together in My name , there am I in the midst of them . '
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 18]: In that way , wharever He micht be walkin ' aboot , we could aye get Him !
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 38]: He likes twa , an ' His Father ` ill hear the ` greed prayer , but He likes three better -- an ' that stan 's to rizzon , for three maun be better 'n twa !
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 37]: First ane maun lo'e Him ; an ' syne twa can lo'e Him better , because ilk ane is helpit by the ither , an ' lo'es Him the mair that He lo'es the ither ane !
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 36]: An ' syne comes the third , and there 's mair an ' mair throwin ' o ' lichts , and there 's the Lord himsel ' i ' the mids ' o ' them !
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 10]: Three maks a better mids ' than twa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 17]: Sandy could not follow the reasoning quite , but he had his own way of understanding .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 17]: `` It 's jist like the story o ' Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego ! ''
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 15]: `` There was three o ' them , an ' sae He made four !
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 18]: Eh , jist think o ' Him bein ' wi ' 's His verra sel ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 19]: Here now was a church indeed : the idea of a third was the very principle of growth !
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 41]: They would meet together and say : `` Oh , Father of Jesus Christ , help us to be good like Jesus ; '' and then Jesus himself would make one of them , and worship the Father with them !
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 18]: The next thing , as a matter of course , was to look about for a third .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 4]: `` Dawtie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 5]: cried both at once .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 27]: Dawtie was the child of a cotter pair , who had an acre or two of their father 's farm , and helped him with it .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 42]: Her real name has not reached me ; _ Dawtie _ means _ darling _ , and is a common term of endearment -- derived , Jamieson suggests , from the Gaelic _ dalt _ , signifying _ a foster-child _ .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 30]: Dawtie was a dark-haired , laughing little darling , with shy , merry manners , and the whitest teeth , full of fun , but solemn in an instant .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 46]: Her small feet were bare and black -- except on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings -- but full of expression , and perhaps really cleaner , from their familiarity with the sweet all-cleansing air , than such as hide the day-long in socks and shoes .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 9]: Dawtie 's specialty was love of the creatures .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 21]: She had an undoubting conviction that every one of them with which she came in contact understood and loved her .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 12]: She was the champion of the oppressed , without knowing it .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 28]: Every individual necessity stood on its own merits , and came to her fresh and sole , as if she had forgotten all that went before it .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 67]: Like some boys she had her pockets as well as her hands at the service of live things ; but unlike any boy , she had in her love no admixture of natural history ; it was not interest in animals with her , but an individual love to the individual animal , whatever it might be , that presented itself to the love-power in her .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 13]: It may seem strange that there should be three such children together .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 49]: But their fathers and mothers had for generations been poor -- which was a great advantage , as may be seen in the world by him who has eyes to see , and heard in the parable of the rich man by him who has ears to hear .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 29]: Also they were God-fearing , which was a far greater advantage , and made them honorable ; for they would have scorned things that most Christians will do .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 30]: Dawtie 's father had a rarely keen instinct for what is mean , and that not in the way of abhorrence in others , but of avoidance in himself .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 39]: To shades and _ nuances _ of selfishness , which men of high repute and comfortable conscience would neither be surprised to find in their neighbors nor annoyed to find in themselves , he would give no quarter .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 61]: Along with Andrew 's father , he had , in childhood and youth , been under the influence of a simple-hearted pastor , whom the wise and prudent laughed at as one who could not take care of himself , incapable of seeing that , like his master , he laid down his life that he might take it again .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 18]: He left God to look after him , that he might be free to look after God .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 48]: Little Dawtie had learned her catechism , but , thank God , had never thought about it or attempted to understand it -- good negative preparation for becoming , in a few years more , able to understand the New Testament with the heart of a babe .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 34]: The brothers had not long to search before they came upon her , where she sat on the ground at the door of the turf-built cottage , feeding a chicken with oatmeal paste .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 10]: `` What are you doin ' , Dawtie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 3]: they asked .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 25]: `` I 'm tryin ' , '' she answered , without looking up , `` to haud the life i ' the chuckie . ''
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 11]: `` What 's the matter wi ' ` t ? ''
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 11]: `` Naething but the want o ' a mither . ''
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 11]: `` Is the mither o ' ' t deid ? ''
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 43]: `` Na , she 's alive eneuch , but she has ower mony bairns to hap them a ' ; her wings winna cower them , and she drives this ane awa ' , and winna lat it come near her . ''
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 7]: `` Sic a cruel mither ! ''
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 9]: `` Na , she 's no ' cruel .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 11]: She only wants to gar ' t come to me !
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 7]: She kenned I would tak it .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 10]: Na , na ; Flappy 's a guid mither !
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 13]: I ken her weel ; she 's ane o ' our ain !
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 22]: She kens me , or she would hae keepit the puir thing , and done her best wi ' her . ''
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 41]: `` I ken somebody , '' said Andrew , `` that would fain spread oot wings , like a great big hen , ower a ' the bairns , you an ' me an ' a ' , Dawtie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 7]: `` That 's my mither ! ''
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 12]: cried Dawtie , looking up , and showing her white teeth .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 12]: `` Na , it 's a man , '' said Sandy .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 9]: `` It 's my father , than ! ''
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 7]: `` Na , it 's no .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 8]: Would ye like to see Him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 10]: `` Na , I 'm no carin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 14]: `` Sandy and me 's gaein ' to see Him some day . ''
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 8]: `` I 'll gang wi ' ye .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 9]: But I maun tak ' my chuckie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 25]: She looked down where she had set the little bird on the ground ; it had hobbled away and she could not see it !
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 22]: `` Eh , '' she cried , starting up , `` ye made me forget my chuckie wi ' yer questions !
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 9]: It 's mither ` ill peck it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 19]: She darted off , and forsook the tale of the Son of Man to look after her chicken .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 10]: But presently she returned with it in her hands .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 21]: `` Tell awa ' , '' she said , resuming her seat `` What do they ca ' Him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 13]: `` They ca ' Him the Father o ' Jesus Christ . ''
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 12]: `` I 'll gang wi ' ye , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 28]: So the church was increased by a whole half , and the fraction of a chicken -- type of the groaning creation , waiting for the sonship .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 8]: The three gathered to read and pray .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 17]: And almost always there was some creature with them in the arms or hands of Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 36]: And if the Lord was not there , too , then are we Christians most miserable , for we see a glory beyond all that man could dream , and it is but a dream !
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 3]: Whose dream ?
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 15]: They went on at other times with the usual employments and games of children .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 42]: But there was this difference between them and most grown Christians , that when anything roused thought or question they at once referred it to the word of Jesus , and having discovered His will , made haste to do it .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 86]: It naturally followed that , seeing He gives the spirit to them that obey Him , they grew rapidly in the modes of their Master , learning to look at things as He looked at them , to think of them as He thought of them , to value what He valued , and despise what He despised -- all in simplest order of divine development , in uttermost accord with highest reason , the whole turning on the primary and continuous effort to obey .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 14]: It was long before they came to have any regular time of meeting .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 10]: Andrew always took the initiative in assembling the church .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 7]: When he called they came together .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 23]: Then he would read from the story , and communicate any discovery he had made concerning what Jesus would have them do .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 28]: Next , they would consult and settle what they should ask for , and one of them , generally Andrew , but sometimes Sandy , would pray .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 14]: They made no formal utterance , but simply asked for what they needed .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 40]: Here are some specimens of their petitions : `` Oh , Lord , Sandy canna for the life o ' ` im un ` erstan ' the rule o ' three ; please , Lord , help him . ''
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 37]: `` Oh , Lord , I dinna ken onything I want the day ; please gi'e us what we need , an ' what ye want us to hae , wi'oot our askin ' it . ''
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 51]: `` Lord , help us ; we 're ill-natnr 'd -LRB- _ bad-tempered _ -RRB- the day ; an ' ye wadna hae us that '' `` Lord , Dawtie 's mither has a sair heid -LRB- _ headache _ -RRB- ; mak her better , gien ye please . ''
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 20]: When their prayers were ended Andrew would say : `` Sandy , have you found anything He says ? ''
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 11]: and there-upon , if he had , Sandy would speak .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 23]: Dawtie never said a word , but sat and listened with her big eyes , generally stroking some creature in her lap .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 15]: Surely the part of every superior is to help the life in the lower !
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 31]: Once the question arose , in their assembly of three and a bird , whose leg Dawtie had put in splints , what became of the creatures when they died .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 38]: They concluded that the sparrow that God cared for must be worth caring for ; and they could not believe He had made it to last only such a little while as its life in this world .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 35]: Thereupon they agreed to ask the Lord that , when they died , they might have again a certain dog , an ugly little white mongrel , of which they had been very fond .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 24]: All their days thereafter they were , I believe , more or less consciously , looking forward to the fulfillment of this petition .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 30]: For their hope strengthened with the growth of their ideal ; and when they had to give up any belief it was to take a better in its place .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 35]: They yielded at length the notion that the peddler was Jesus Christ , but they never ceased to believe that He was God 's messenger , or that the Lord was with them always .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 106]: They would not insist that He was walking about on the earth , but to the end of their days they cherished the uncertain hope that they might , even without knowing it , look upon the face of the Lord in that of some stranger passing in the street , or mingling in a crowd , or seated in a church ; for they knew that all the shapes of man belong to Him , and that , after He rose from the dead there were several occasions on which He did not at first look like Himself to those to whom He appeared .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 85]: The child-like , the essential , the divine notion of serving , with their every-day will and being , the will of the living One , who lived for them that they might live , as once He had died for them that they might die , ripened in them to a Christianity that saw God everywhere , saw that everything had to be done as God would have it done , and that nothing but injustice had to be forsaken to please Him .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 49]: They were under no influence of what has been so well called _ other-worldliness _ , for they saw this world as much God 's as that , saw that its work has to be done divinely , that it is the beginning of the world to come .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 32]: It was to them all one world , with God in it , all in all ; therefore the best work for the other world was the work of this world .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 24]: Such was the boyhood of that Andrew Ingram whom Miss Fordyce now reproved for not setting the good example of going to church .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 24]: The common sense of the children rapidly developed , for there is no teacher like obedience , and no obstruction like its postponement .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 47]: When in after years their mothers came at length to understand that obedience had been so long the foundation of their life , it explained to them many things that had seemed strange , and brought them to reproach themselves that they should have seemed strange .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 24]: It ought not to be overlooked that the whole thing was wrought in the children without directed influence of kindred or any neighbor .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 4]: They imitated none .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 23]: The galvanism of imitation is not the life of the spirit ; the use of form where love is not is killing .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 52]: And if any one is desirous of spreading the truth let him apply himself , like these children , to the doing of it ; not obeying the truth , he is doubly a liar pretending to teach it ; if he obeys it already , let him obey it more .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 7]: It is life that awakes life .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 14]: All form of persuasion is empty except in vital association with regnant obedience .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 8]: Talking and not doing is dry rot .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 41]: Cottage children are sometimes more fastidious about their food than children that have a greater variety ; they have a more delicate perception and discrimination in the simple dishes on which they thrive ; much choice , though little refusal .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 36]: Andrew had a great dislike to lumps in his porridge ; and one day the mother having been less careful than usual in cooking it , he made a wry face at the first spoonful .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 17]: `` Andrew , '' said Sandy , `` take no thought for what ye eat . ''
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 14]: It was a wrong interpretation , but a righteous use of the word .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 14]: Happy the soul that mistakes the letter only to get at the spirit !
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 20]: Andrew 's face smoothed itself , began to clear up , and broke at last into a sunny smile .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 16]: He said nothing , but eat his full share of the porridge without a frown .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 23]: This was practical religion ; and if any one judge it not worth telling , I count his philosophy worthless beside it .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 23]: Such a doer knows more than such a reader will ever know , except he take precisely the same way to learn .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 18]: The children of God do what He would have them do , and are taught of Him .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 35]: A report at length reached the pastor , now an old man , of ripe heart and true insight , that certain children in his parish `` played at the Lord 's Supper . ''
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 10]: He was shocked , and went to their parents .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 7]: They knew nothing of the matter .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 16]: The three children were sought , and the pastor had a private interview with them .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 15]: From it he reappeared with a solemn , pale face , and silent tongue .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 9]: They asked him the result of his inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 27]: He answered that he was not prepared to interfere : as he was talking with them , the warning came that there were necks and mill-stones .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 26]: The next Sunday he preached a sermon from the text , `` Out of the month of babes and sucklings Thou hast perfected praise . ''
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 14]: The fathers and mothers made inquisition , and found no desire to conceal .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 9]: Wisely or not , they forbade the observance .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 37]: It cost Andrew much thought whether he was justified in obeying them ; but he saw that right and wrong in itself was not concerned , and that the Lord would have them obey their parents .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 30]: It was necessary to tell so much of the previous history of Andrew , lest what remains to be told should perhaps be unintelligible or seem incredible without it .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 19]: A character like his can not be formed in a day ; it must early begin to grow .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 39]: The bond thus bound between the children , altering in form as they grew , was never severed ; nor was the lower creation ever cut off from its share in the petitions of any one of them .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 19]: When they ceased to assemble as a community , they continued to act on the same live principles .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 25]: Gladly as their parents would have sent them to college , Andrew and Sandy had to leave school only to work on the farm .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 13]: But they carried their studies on from the point they had reached .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 15]: When they could not get further without help , they sought and found it .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 38]: For a year or two they went in the winter to an evening school ; but it took so much time to go and come that they found they could make more progress by working at home .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 17]: What help they sought went a long way , and what they learned , they knew .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 43]: When the day 's work was over , and the evening meal , they went to the room their own hands had made convenient for study as well as sleep , and there resumed the labor they had dropped the night before .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 18]: Together they read Greek and mathematics , but Andrew worked mainly in literature , Sandy in mechanics .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 16]: On Saturdays , Sandy generally wrought at some model , while Andrew read to him .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 17]: On Sundays , they always , for an hour or two , read the Bible together .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 39]: The brothers were not a little amused with Miss Fordyce 's patronage of Andrew ; but they had now been too long endeavoring to bring into subjection the sense of personal importance , to take offense at it .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 23]: Dawtie had gone into service , and they seldom saw her except when she came home for a day at the term .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 15]: She was a grown woman now , but the same loving child as before .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 19]: She counted the brothers her superiors , just as they counted the laird and his daughter their superiors .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 17]: But whereas Alexa claimed the homage , Dawtie yielded where was no thought of claiming it .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 8]: The brothers regarded her as their sister .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 25]: That she was poorer than they , only made them the more watchful over her , and if possible the more respectful to her .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 17]: So she had a rich return for her care of the chickens and kittens and puppies .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 3]: CHAPTER XI .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 4]: GEORGE AND ANDREW .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 48]: George went home the next day ; and the following week sent Andrew a note , explaining that when he saw him he did not know his obligation to him , and expressing the hope that , when next in town , he would call upon him .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 11]: This was hardly well , being condescension to a superior .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 20]: Perhaps the worst evil in the sense of social superiority is the vile fancy that it alters human relation .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 28]: George did not feel bound to make the same acknowledgment of obligation to one in humble position as to one in the same golden rank with himself !
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 20]: It says ill for social distinction , if , for its preservation , such an immoral difference be essential .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 11]: But Andrew was not one to dwell upon his rights .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 74]: He thought it friendly of Mr. Crawford to ask him to call ; therefore , although he had little desire to make his acquaintance , and grudged the loss of time , to no man so precious as to him who has a pursuit in addition to a calling , Andrew , far stronger in courtesy than the man who invited him , took the first Saturday afternoon to go and see him .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 43]: Mr. Crawford the elder lived in some style , and his door was opened by a servant whose blatant adornment filled Andrew with friendly pity : no man would submit to be dressed like that , he judged , except from necessity .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 13]: The reflection sprung from no foolish and degrading contempt for household service .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 98]: It is true Andrew thought no labor so manly as that in the earth , out of which grows everything that makes the loveliness or use of Nature ; for by it he came in contact with the primaries of human life , and was God 's fellow laborer , a helper in the work of the universe , knowing the ways of it and living in them ; but not the less would he have done any service , and that cheerfully , which his own need or that of others might have required of him .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 24]: The colors of a parrot , however , were not fit for a son of man , and hence his look of sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 59]: His regard was met only by a glance of plain contempt , as the lackey , moved by the same spirit as his master , left him standing in the hall -- to return presently , and show him into the library -- a room of mahogany , red morocco , and yellow calf , where George sat .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 9]: He rose , and shook hands with him .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 15]: `` I am glad to see you , Mr. Ingram , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 18]: `` When I wrote I had but just learned how much I was indebted to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 21]: `` I understand what you must mean , '' returned Andrew , `` but it was scarce worth alluding to .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 11]: Miss Fordyce had the better claim to serve you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 19]: `` You call it nothing to carry a man of my size over a mile of heather ! ''
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 36]: `` I had help , '' answered Andrew ; `` and but for the broken leg , '' he added , with a laugh , `` I could have carried you well enough alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 19]: There came a pause , for George did not know what next to do with the farmer fellow .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 9]: So the latter spoke again , being unembarrassed .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 10]: `` You have a grand library , Mr. Crawford !
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 11]: It must be fine to sit among so many books !
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 27]: It 's just like a wine-merchant 's cellars -- only here you can open and drink , and leave the bottles as full as before ! ''
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 9]: `` A good simile , Mr. Ingram ! ''
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 3]: replied George .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 19]: `` You must come and dine with me , and we 'll open another sort of bottle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 9]: `` You must excuse me there , sir !
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 11]: I have no time for that sort of bottle . ''
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 10]: `` I understand you read a great deal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 8]: `` Weather permitting , '' returned Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 19]: `` I should have thought if anything was independent of the weather , it must be reading ! ''
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 9]: `` Not a farmer 's reading , sir .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 19]: To him the weather is the Word of God , telling him whether to work or read . ''
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 4]: George was silent .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 10]: To him the Word of God was the Bible !
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 13]: `` But you must read a great deal yourself , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 10]: resumed Andrew , casting a glance round the room .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 9]: `` The books are my father 's ! ''
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 3]: said George .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 31]: He did not mention that his own reading came all in the library-cart , except when he wanted some special information ; for George was `` a practical man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 28]: He read his Bible to prepare for his class in the Sunday-school , and his Shakespeare when he was going to see one of his plays acted .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 15]: He would make the best of both worlds by paying due attention to both !
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 7]: He was religious , but liberal .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 20]: His father was a banker , an elder of the kirk , well reputed in and beyond his circle .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 12]: He gave to many charities , and largely to educational schemes .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 22]: His religion was to hold by the traditions of the elders , and keep himself respectable in the eyes of money-dealers .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 26]: He went to church regularly , and always asked God 's blessing on his food , as if it were a kind of general sauce .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 20]: He never prayed God to make him love his neighbor , or help him to be an honest man .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 26]: He `` had worship '' every morning , no doubt ; but only a Nonentity like his God could care for such prayers as his .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 28]: George rejected his father 's theology as false in logic and cruel in character : George knew just enough of God to be guilty of neglecting Him .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 34]: `` When I am out all day , I can do with less reading ; for then I have the ` book of knowledge fair , ' '' said Andrew , quoting Milton .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 29]: `` It does not take _ all _ one 's attention to drive a straight furrow or keep the harrow on the edge of the last bout ! ''
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 17]: `` You do n't mean you can read your Bible as you hold the plow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 3]: said George .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 11]: `` No , sir , '' answered Andrew , amused .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 16]: `` A body could not well manage a book between the stilts of the plow .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 18]: The Bible will keep till you get home ; a little of it goes a long way .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 19]: But Paul counted the book of creation enough to make the heathen to blame for not minding it .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 16]: Never a wind wakes of a sudden , but it talks to me about God .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 20]: And is not the sunlight the same that came out of the body of Jesus at His transfiguration ? ''
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 17]: `` You seem to have some rather peculiar ideas of your own , Mr. Ingram ! ''
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 5]: `` Perhaps , sir !
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 23]: For a man to have no ideas of his own , is much the same as to have no ideas at all .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 29]: A man can not have the ideas of another man , any more than he can have another man 's soul , or another man 's body ! ''
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 7]: `` That is dangerous doctrine . ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 11]: `` Perhaps we are not talking about the same thing !
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 16]: I mean by _ ideas _ , what a man orders his life by . ''
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 8]: `` Your ideas may be wrong ! ''
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 8]: `` The All-wise is my judge . ''
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 14]: `` So much the worse , if you are in the wrong ! ''
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 17]: `` It is the only good , whether I be in the right or the wrong .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 7]: Would I have my mistakes overlooked ?
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 13]: What judge would I desire but the Judge of all the earth !
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 6]: Shall He not do right ?
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 9]: And will He not set me right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 9]: `` That is a most dangerous confidence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 11]: `` It would be if there were any other judge .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 19]: But it will be neither the Church nor the world that will sit on the great white throne .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 16]: He who sits there will not ask : ` Did you go to church ? '
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 11]: or ` Did you believe in this or that ? '
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 12]: but ' Did you do what I told you ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 13]: `` And what will you say to that , Mr. Ingram ? ''
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 12]: `` I will say : ` Lord , Thou knowest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 7]: The answer checked George a little .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 15]: `` Suppose He should say you did not , what would you answer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 17]: `` I would say : ` Lord , send me where I may learn . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 27]: `` And if He should say : ` That is what I sent you into the world for , and you have not done it ! '
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 7]: what would you say then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 8]: `` I should hold my peace . ''
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 10]: `` You do what He tells you then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 5]: `` I try . ''
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 17]: `` Does He not say : ` Forsake not the assembling of yourselves together ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 6]: `` No , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 4]: `` No ? ''
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 14]: `` Somebody says something like it in the Epistle to the Hebrews . ''
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 9]: `` And is n't that the same ? ''
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 14]: `` The Man who wrote it would be indignant at your saying so !
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 14]: Tell me , Mr. Crawford , what makes a gathering a Church ? ''
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 18]: `` It would take me some time to arrange my ideas before I could answer you . ''
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 16]: `` Is it not the presence of Christ that makes an assembly a Church ? ''
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 26]: `` Does He not say that where two or three are met in His name , there is He in the midst of them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 40]: `` Then thus far I will justify myself to you , that , if I do not go to what you call _ church _ , I yet often make one of a company met in His name . ''
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 13]: `` He does not limit the company to two or three . ''
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 4]: `` Assuredly not .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 26]: But if I find I get more help and strength with a certain few , why should I go with a multitude to get less ?
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 10]: Will you draw another line than the Master 's ?
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 18]: Why should it be more sacred to worship with five hundred or five thousand than with three ?
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 17]: If He is in the midst of them , they can not be wrong gathered ! ''
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 16]: `` It _ looks _ as if you thought yourselves better than everybody else ! ''
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 20]: `` If it were so , then certainly He would not be _ one _ of the gathering ! ''
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 16]: `` How are you to know that He is in the midst of you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 13]: `` If we are not keeping His commandments , He is not .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 16]: But His presence can not be _ proved _ ; it can only be known .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 28]: If He meets us , it is not necessary to the joy of His presence that we should be able to prove that He does meet us !
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 26]: If a man has the company of the Lord , he will care little whether another does or does not believe that he has . ''
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 11]: `` Your way is against the peace of the Church !
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 5]: It fosters division . ''
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 12]: `` Did the Lord come to send peace on the earth ?
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 26]: My way , as you call it , would make division , but division between those who call themselves His and those who are His .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 9]: It would bring together those that love Him .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 14]: Company would merge with company that they might look on the Lord together .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 50]: I do n't believe Jesus cares much for what is called the visible Church ; but He cares with His very Godhead for those that do as He tells them ; they are His Father 's friends ; they are His elect by whom He will save the world .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 31]: It is by those who obey , and by their obedience , that He will save those who do not obey , that is , will bring them to obey .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 13]: It is one by one the world will pass to His side .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 8]: There is no saving in the lump .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 19]: If a thousand be converted at once , it is every single lonely man that is converted . ''
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 11]: `` You would make a slow process of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 10]: `` If slow , yet faster than any other .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 7]: All God 's processes are slow .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 15]: How many years has the world existed , do you imagine , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 9]: Geologists say hundreds and hundreds of thousands . ''
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 11]: `` And how many is it since Christ came ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 6]: `` Toward two thousand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 11]: `` Then we are but in the morning of Christianity !
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 6]: There is plenty of time .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 7]: The day is before us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 8]: `` Dangerous doctrine for the sinner ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 3]: `` Why ?
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 26]: Time is plentiful for his misery , if he will not repent ; plentiful for the mercy of God that would lead him to repentance .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 16]: There is plenty of time for labor and hope ; none for indifference and delay .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 9]: God _ will _ have his creatures good .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 7]: They can not escape Him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 15]: `` Then a man may put off repentance as long as he pleases ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 26]: `` Certainly he may -- at least as long as he can -- but it is a fearful thing to try issues with God . ''
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 10]: `` I can hardly say I understand you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 27]: `` Mr. Crawford , you have questioned me in the way of kindly anxiety and reproof ; that has given me the right to question you .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 17]: Tell me , do you admit we are bound to do what our Lord requires ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 4]: `` Of course .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 9]: How could any Christian man do otherwise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 18]: `` Yet a man may say : ` Lord , Lord , ' and be cast out !
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 26]: It is one thing to say we are bound to do what the Lord tells us , and another to do what He tells us !
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 40]: He says : ` Seek ye _ first _ the kingdom of God and His righteousness : ' Mr. Crawford , are you seeking the kingdom of God _ first _ , or are you seeking money first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 13]: `` We are sent into the world to make our living . ''
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 35]: `` Sent into the world , we have to seek our living ; we are not sent into the world to seek our living , but to seek the kingdom and righteousness of God .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 14]: And to seek a living is very different from seeking a fortune ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 24]: `` If you , Mr. Ingram , had a little wholesome ambition , you would be less given to judging your neighbors . ''
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 78]: Andrew held his peace , and George concluded he had had the best of the argument -- which was all he wanted ; of the truth concerned he did not see enough to care about it Andrew , perceiving no good was to be done , was willing to appear defeated ; he did not value any victory but the victory of the truth , and George was not yet capable of being conquered by the truth .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 9]: resumed he , `` we must avoid personalities .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 25]: There are certain things all respectable people have agreed to regard as right : he is a presumptuous man who refuses to regard them .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 8]: Reflect on it , Mr. Ingram . ''
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 28]: The curious smile hovered about the lip of the plow-man ; when things to say did not come to him , he went nowhere to fetch them .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 31]: Almost in childhood he had learned that , when one is required to meet the lie , words are given him ; when they are not , silence is better .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 25]: A man who does not love the truth , but disputes for victory , is the swine before whom pearls must not be cast .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 19]: Andrew 's smile meant that it had been a waste of his time to call upon Mr. Crawford .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 16]: But he did not blame himself , for he had come out of pure friendliness .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 13]: He would have risen at once , but feared to seem offended .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 30]: Crawford , therefore , with the rudeness of a superior , himself rose , saying : `` Is there anything I can do for you , Mr. Ingram ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 24]: `` The only thing one man can do for another is to be at one with him , '' answered Andrew , rising .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 8]: `` Ah , you are a socialist !
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 6]: That accounts for much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 3]: said George .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 32]: `` Tell me this , '' returned Andrew , looking him in the eyes : `` Did Jesus ever ask of His Father anything His Father would not give Him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 15]: `` Not that I remember , '' answered George , fearing a theological trap .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 45]: `` He said once : ' I pray for them which shall believe in Me , that they all may be one , as Thou Father art in Me , and I in Thee , that they also many be one in us ! '
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 65]: No man can be one with another , who is not one with Christ '' As he left the house , a carriage drove up , in which was Mr. Crawford the elder , home from a meeting of directors , at which a dividend had been agreed upon -- to be paid from the capital , in preparation for another issue of shares .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 7]: Andrew walked home a little bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 61]: `` How is it , '' he said to himself , `` that so many who would be terrified at the idea of not being Christians , and are horrified at any man who does not believe there is a God , are yet absolutely indifferent to what their Lord tells them to do if they would be His disciples ?
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 12]: But may not I be in like case without knowing it ?
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 8]: Do I meet God in my geometry ?
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 16]: When I so much enjoy my Euclid , is it always God geometrizing to me ?
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 23]: Do I feel talking with God every time I dwell upon any fact of his world of lines and circles and angles ?
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 29]: Is it God with me , every time that the joy of life , of a wind or a sky or a lovely phrase , flashes through me ?
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 45]: Oh , my God , '' he broke out in speechless prayer as he walked -- and those that passed said to themselves he was mad ; how , in such a world , could any but a madman wear a face of joy !
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 17]: `` Oh , my God , Thou art all in all , and I have everything !
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 9]: The world is mine because it is Thine !
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 39]: I thank Thee , my God , that Thou hast lifted me up to see whence I came , to know to whom I belong , to know who is my Father , and makes me His heir !
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 21]: I am Thine , infinitely more than mine own ; and Thou art mine as Thou art Christ 's ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 15]: He knew his Father in the same way that Jesus Christ knows His Father .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 17]: He was at home in the universe , neither lonely , nor out-of-doors , nor afraid .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 3]: CHAPTER XII .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 3]: THE CRAWFORDS .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 24]: Through strong striving to secure his life , Mr. Crawford lost it -- both in God 's sense of loss and his own .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 24]: He narrowly escaped being put in prison , died instead , and was put into God 's prison to pay the uttermost farthing .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 24]: But he had been such a good Christian that his fellow-Christians mourned over his failure and his death , not over his dishonesty !
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 27]: For did they not know that if , by more dishonesty , he could have managed to recover his footing , he would have paid everything ?
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 64]: One injunction only he obeyed -- he provided for his own ; of all the widows concerned in his bank , his widow alone was secured from want ; and she , like a dutiful wife , took care that his righteous intention should be righteously carried out ; not a penny would she give up to the paupers her husband had made .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 20]: The downfall of the house of cards took place a few months after George 's return to its business .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 27]: Not initiated to the mysteries of his father 's transactions , ignorant of what had long been threatening , it was a terrible blow to him .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 25]: But he was a man of action , and at once looked to America ; at home he could not hold up his head .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 42]: He had often been to Potlurg , and had been advancing in intimacy with Alexa ; but he would not show himself there until he could appear as a man of decision -- until he was on the point of departure .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 22]: She would be the more willing to believe his innocence of complicity in the deceptions that had led to his ruin !
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 14]: He would thus also manifest self-denial and avoid the charge of interested motives !
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 15]: he could not face the suspicion of being a suitor with nothing to offer !
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 16]: George had always taken the grand rôle -- that of superior , benefactor , bestower .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 6]: He was powerful in condescension !
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 16]: Not , therefore , until the night before he sailed did he go to Potlurg .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 9]: Alexa received him with a shade of displeasure .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 18]: `` I am going away , '' he said , abruptly , the moment they were seated .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 18]: Her heart gave a painful throb in her throat , but she did not lose her self-possession .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 7]: `` Where are you going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 9]: `` To New York , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 14]: `` I have got a situation there -- in a not unimportant house .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 13]: _ There _ at least I am taken for an honest man .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 8]: From your heaven I have fallen . ''
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 17]: `` No one falls from any heaven but has himself to blame , '' rejoined Alexa .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 8]: `` Where have I been to blame ?
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 9]: I was not in my father 's confidence .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 14]: I knew nothing , positively nothing , of what was going on . ''
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 12]: `` Why then did you not come to see me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 17]: `` A man who is neither beggar nor thief is not willing to look either . ''
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 15]: `` You would have come if you had trusted me , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 14]: `` You must pardon pride in a ruined man , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 20]: `` Now that I am starting to-morrow , I do not feel the same dread of being misunderstood ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 10]: `` It was not kind of you , George .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 18]: Knowing yourself fit to be trusted , why did you not think me capable of trusting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 5]: `` But , Alexa !
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 8]: -- a man 's own father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 16]: For a moment he showed signs of an emotion he had seldom had to repress .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 9]: `` I beg your pardon , George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 3]: cried Alexa .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 8]: `` I am both stupid and selfish !
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 8]: Are you really going so far ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 4]: Her voice trembled .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 18]: `` I am -- but to return , I hope , in a very different position ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 22]: `` You would have me understand -- '' `` That I shall then be able to hold up my head . ''
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 11]: `` Why should an innocent man ever do otherwise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 14]: `` He can not help seeing himself in other people 's thoughts ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 18]: `` If we are in the right ought we to mind what people think of us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 3]: said Alexa .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 4]: `` Perhaps not .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 13]: But I will make them think of me as I choose . ''
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 7]: `` By compelling their respect . ''
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 9]: `` You mean to make a fortune ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 10]: `` Then it will be the fortune they respect !
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 8]: You will not be more worthy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 6]: `` I shall not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 8]: `` Is such respect worth having ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 6]: `` Not in itself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 5]: `` In what then ?
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 8]: Why lay yourself out for it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 19]: `` Believe me , Alexa , even the real respect of such people would be worthless to me .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 11]: I only want to bring them to their marrow-bones ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 27]: The truth was , Alexa prized social position so dearly that she did not relish his regarding it as a thing at the command of money .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 21]: Let George be as rich as a Jew or an American , Alexa would never regard him as her equal !
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 10]: George worshiped money ; Alexa worshiped birth and land .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 31]: Our own way of being wrong is all right in our own eyes ; our neighbor 's way of being wrong is offensive to all that is good in us .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 30]: We are anxious therefore , kindly anxious , to pull the mote out of his eye , never thinking of the big beam in the way of the operation .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 15]: Jesus labored to show us that our immediate business is to be right ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 11]: Until we are , even our righteous indignation is waste .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 12]: While he spoke , George 's eyes were on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 35]: His grand resolve did not give his innocence strength to look in the face of the woman he loved ; he felt , without knowing why , that she was not satisfied with him .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 13]: Of the paltriness of his ambition , he had no inward hint .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 19]: The high resolves of a puny nature must be a laughter to the angels -- the bad ones .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 29]: `` If a man has no ambition , '' he resumed , feeling after her objection , `` how is he to fulfill the end of his being !
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 7]: No sluggard ever made his mark !
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 16]: How would the world advance but for the men who have to make their fortunes !
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 24]: If a man find his father has not made money for him , what is he to do but make it for himself ?
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 11]: You would not have me all my life a clerk !
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 17]: If I had but known , I should by this time have been well ahead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 12]: Alexa had nothing to answer ; it all sounded very reasonable !
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 15]: Were not Scots boys everywhere taught it was the business of life to rise ?
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 17]: In whatever position they were , was it not their part to get out of it ?
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 19]: She did not see that it is in the kingdom of heaven only we are bound to rise .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 40]: We are born into the world not to rise in the kingdom of Satan , but out of it And the only way to rise in the kingdom of heaven is to do the work given us to do .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 26]: Whatever be intended for us , this is the only way to it We have not to promote ourselves , but to do our work .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 15]: It is the master of the feast who says : `` Go up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 20]: If a man go up of himself , he will find he has mistaken the head of the table .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 16]: More talk followed , but neither cast any light ; neither saw the true question .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 5]: George took his leave .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 11]: Alexa said she would be glad to hear from him .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 37]: Alexa did not like the form of George 's ambition -- to gain money , and so compel the respect of persons he did not himself respect But was she clear of the money disease herself ?
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 14]: Would she have married a poor man , to go on as hitherto ?
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 37]: Would she not have been ashamed to have George know how she had supplied his needs while he lay in the house -- that it was with the poor gains of her poultry-yard she fed him ?
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 30]: Did it improve her moral position toward money that she regarded commerce with contempt -- a rudiment of the time when nobles treated merchants as a cottager his bees ?
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 17]: George 's situation was a subordinate one in a house of large dealings in Wall Street .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIII .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 2]: DAWTIE .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 14]: Is not the Church supposed to be made up of God 's elect ?
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 74]: and yet most of my readers find it hard to believe there should be three persons , so related , who agreed to ask of God , and to ask neither riches nor love , but that God should take His own way with them , that the Father should work His will in them , that He would teach them what He wanted of them , and help them to do it !
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 18]: The Church is God 's elect , and yet you can not believe in three holy children !
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 17]: Do you say : `` Because they are represented as beginning to obey so young ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 57]: `` Then , '' I answer , `` there can be no principle , only an occasional and arbitrary exercise of spiritual power , in the perfecting of praise out of the mouth of babes and sucklings , or in the preference of them to the wise and prudent as the recipients of divine revelation . ''
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 10]: Dawtie never said much , but tried the more .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 53]: With heartiness she accepted what conclusions the brothers came to , so far as she understood them -- and what was practical she understood as well as they ; for she had in her heart the spirit of that Son of Man who chose a child to represent Him and His Father .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 41]: As to what they heard at church , their minds were so set on doing what they found in the Gospel , that it passed over them without even rousing their intellect , and so vanished without doing any hurt .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 25]: Tuned to the truth by obedience , no falsehood they heard from the pulpit partisans of God could make a chord vibrate in response .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 24]: Dawtie indeed heard nothing but the good that was mingled with the falsehood , and shone like a lantern through a thick fog .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 24]: She was little more than a child when , to the trouble of her parents , she had to go out to service .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 21]: Every half year she came home for a day or so , and neither feared nor found any relation altered .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 21]: At length after several closely following changes , occasioned by no fault of hers , she was without a place .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 49]: Miss Fordyce heard of it , and proposed to her parents that , until she found another , she should help Meg , who was growing old and rather blind : she would thus , she said , go on learning , and not be idling at home .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 61]: Dawtie 's mother was not a little amused at the idea of any one idling in her house , not to say Dawtie , whom idleness would have tried harder than any amount of work ; but , if only that Miss Fordyce might see what sort of girl Dawtie was , she judged it right to accept her offer .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 25]: She had not been at Potlurg a week before Meg began to complain that she did not leave work enough to keep her warm .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 37]: No doubt it gave her time for her book , but her eyes were not so good as they used to be , and she was apt to fall asleep over it , and catch cold !
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 48]: But when her mistress proposed to send her away , she would not hear of it So Alexa , who had begun to take an interest in her , set her to do things she had hitherto done herself , and began to teach her other things .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 22]: Before three months were over , she was a necessity in the house , and to part with Dawtie seemed impossible .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 29]: A place about that time turning up , Alexa at once offered her wages , and so Dawtie became an integral portion of the laird 's modest household .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 57]: The laird himself at length began to trust her as he had never trusted servant , for he taught her to dust his precious books , which hitherto he had done himself , but of late had shrunk from , finding not a few of them worse than Pandora-boxes , liberating asthma at the merest unclosing .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 31]: Dawtie was now a grown woman , bright , gentle , playful , with loving eyes , and a constant overflow of tenderness upon any creature that could receive it .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 46]: She had small but decided and regular features , whose prevailing expression was confidence -- not in herself , for she was scarce conscious of herself even in the act of denying herself -- but in the person upon whom her trusting eyes were turned .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 26]: She was in the world to help -- with no political economy beyond the idea that for help and nothing else did any one exist .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 51]: To be as the sun and the rain and the wind , as the flowers that lived for her and not for themselves , as the river that flowed , and the heather that bloomed lovely on the bare moor in the autumn , such was her notion of being .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 17]: That she had to take care of herself was a falsehood that never entered her brain .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 27]: To do what she ought , and not do what she ought not , was enough on her part , and God would do the rest !
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 19]: I will not say she reasoned thus ; to herself she was scarce a conscious object at all .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 11]: Both bodily and spiritually she was in the finest health .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 54]: If illness came , she would perhaps then discover a self with which she had to fight -- I can not tell ; but my impression is , that she had so long done the true thing , that illness would only develop unconscious victory , perfecting the devotion of her simple righteousness .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 33]: It is because we are selfish , with that worst selfishness which is incapable of recognizing itself , not to say its own loathsomeness , that we have to be made ill .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 21]: That they may leave the last remnants of their selfishness , are the saints themselves over-taken by age and death .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 42]: Suffering does not cause the vile thing in us -- that was there all the time ; it comes to develop in us the knowledge of its presence , that it may be war to the knife between us and it .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 16]: It was no wonder that Dawtie grew more and more of a favorite at Potlurg .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 26]: She did not read much , but would learn by heart anything that pleased her , and then go saying or singing it to herself .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 18]: She had the voice of a lark , and her song prevented many a search for her .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 29]: Against that `` rain of melody , '' not the pride of the laird , or the orderliness of the ex-school-master ever put up the umbrella of rebuke .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 61]: Her singing was so true , came so clear from the fountain of joy , and so plainly from no desire to be heard , that it gave no annoyance ; while such was her sympathy , that , although she had never get suffered , you would , to hear her sing `` My Nannie 's awa ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 18]: have thought her in truth mourning an absent lover , and familiar with every pang of heart-privation .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 38]: Her cleanliness , clean even of its own show , was a heavenly purity ; while so gently was all her spiriting done , that the very idea of fuss died in the presence of her labor .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 43]: To the self-centered such a person soon becomes a nobody ; the more dependent they are upon her unfailing ministration , the less they think of her ; but they have another way of regarding such in `` the high countries . ''
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 19]: Hardly any knew her real name ; she was known but by her pet name _ Dawtie _ .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 32]: Alexa , who wondered at times that she could not interest her in things she made her read , little knew how superior the girl 's choice was to her own !
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 30]: Not knowing much of literature , what she liked was always of the best in its kind , and nothing without some best element could interest her at all .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 41]: But she was not left either to her `` own sweet will '' or to the prejudices of her well-meaning mistress ; however long the intervals that parted them , Andrew continued to influence her reading as from the first .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 20]: A word now and a word then , with the books he lent or gave her , was sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 38]: That Andrew liked this or that , was enough to make Dawtie set herself to find in it what Andrew liked , and it was thus she became acquainted with most of what she learned by heart .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 78]: Above two years before the time to which I have now brought my narrative , Sandy had given up farming , to pursue the development of certain inventions of his which had met the approval of a man of means who , unable himself to devise , could yet understand a device : he saw that there was use , and consequently money in them , and wisely put it in Sandy 's power to perfect them .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 34]: He was in consequence but little at home , and when Dawtie went to see her parents , as she could much oftener now , Andrew and she generally met without a third .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 20]: However many weeks might have passed , they always met as if they had parted only the night before .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 9]: There was neither shyness nor forwardness in Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 48]: Perhaps a livelier rose might tinge her sweet round cheek when she saw Andrew ; perhaps a brighter spark shone in the pupil of Andrew 's eye ; but they met as calmly as two prophets in the secret of the universe , neither anxious nor eager .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 17]: The old relation between them was the more potent that it made so little outward show .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 10]: `` Have you anything for me , Andrew ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 60]: Dawtie would say , in the strong dialect which her sweet voice made so pleasant to those that loved her ; whereupon Andrew , perhaps without immediate answer more than a smile , would turn into his room , and reappear with what he had got ready for her to `` chew upon '' till they should meet again .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 41]: Milton 's sonnet , for instance , to the `` virgin wise and pure , '' had long served her aspiration ; equally wise and pure , Dawtie could understand it as well as she for whom it was written .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 21]: To see the delight she took in it , would have been a joy to any loving student of humanity .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 22]: It had cost her more effort to learn than almost any song , and perhaps therefore it was the more precious .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 62]: Andrew seldom gave her a book to learn from ; in general he copied , in his clearest handwriting , whatever poem or paragraph he thought fit for Dawtie ; and when they met , she would not unfrequently , if there was time , repeat unasked what she had learned , and be rewarded with his unfailing look of satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 125]: There was a secret between them -- a secret proclaimed on the house-tops , a secret hidden , the most precious of pearls , in their hearts -- that the earth is the Lord 's and the fullness thereof ; that its work is the work of the Lord , whether the sowing of the field , the milking of the cow , the giving to the poor , the spending of wages , the reading of the Bible ; that God is all in all , and every throb of gladness His gift ; that their life came fresh every moment from His heart ; that what was lacking to them would arrive the very moment He had got them ready for it .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 32]: They were God 's little ones in God 's world -- none the less their own that they did not desire to swallow it , or thrust it in their pockets .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 28]: Among poverty-stricken Christians , consumed with care to keep a hold of the world and save their souls , they were as two children of the house .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 26]: By living in the presence of the living One , they had become themselves His presence -- dim lanterns through which His light shone steady .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 5]: Who obeys , shines .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIV .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 4]: SANDY AND GEORGE .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 60]: Sandy had found it expedient to go to America , and had now been there a twelvemonth ; he had devised a machine of the value of which not even his patron could be convinced -- that is , he could not see the prospect of its making money fast enough to constitute it a _ good thing _ .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 47]: Sandy regarded it as a discovery , a revelation for the uplifting of a certain down-trodden portion of the community ; and therefore , having saved a little money , had resolved to make it known in the States , where insight into probabilities is fresher .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 63]: And now Andrew had a letter from him in which he mentioned that he had come across Mr. Crawford , already of high repute in Wall Street ; that he had been kind to him , and having learned his object in visiting the country , and the approximate risk in bringing out his invention , had taken the thing into consideration .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 52]: But the next mail brought another letter to the effect that , having learned the nature of the business done by Mr. Crawford , he found himself unable to distinguish between it and gambling , or worse ; it seemed to him a vortex whose very emptiness drew money into it .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 17]: He had therefore drawn back , and declined to put the thing in Crawford 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 19]: This letter Andrew gave Dawtie to read , that she might see that Sandy remained a true man .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 24]: He had never been anxious on the point , but was very glad that ignorance had not drawn him into an evil connection .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 12]: Dawtie took the letter with her to read at her leisure .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 34]: Unable , however , to understand something Sandy said concerning Mr. Crawford 's business , she asked a question or two of her mistress , which led to questions on Alexa 's part .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 16]: Finding what was the subject of Sandy 's letter , she wished to see it .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 11]: Dawtie asked leave of Andrew , and gave it her .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 13]: Alexa was both distressed and indignant becoming at once George 's partisan .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 29]: Her distress diminished and her indignation increased as she reflected on the _ airt _ whence the unfavorable report reached her ; the brothers were such peculiar men !
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 26]: She recalled the strange things she had heard of their childhood ; doubtless the judgment was formed on an overstrained and quixotic idea of honesty !
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 22]: Besides , there had always been a strong socialistic tendency in them , which explained how Sandy could malign his benefactor !
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 8]: George was incapable of doing anything dishonorable !
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 8]: She would not trouble herself about it .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 12]: But she would like to know how Andrew regarded the matter .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 12]: She asked him therefore what he thought of Sandy 's procedure .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 34]: Andrew replied that he did not know much about business ; but that the only safety must lie in having nothing to do with what was doubtful ; therefore Sandy had done right .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 15]: Alexa said it was too bad of him to condemn where he confessed ignorance .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 27]: Andrew replied : `` Ma'am , if Mr. Crawford is wrong he is condemned ; if he is right my private doubt can not hurt him .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 16]: Sandy must act by his own doubt , not by Mr. Crawford 's confidence . ''
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 31]: Alexa grew more distressed , for she began to recall things George had said which at the time she had not liked , but which she had succeeded in forgetting .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 20]: If he had indeed gone astray , she hoped he would forget her ; she could do without him !
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 13]: But the judgment of such a man as Sandy could settle nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 20]: Of humble origin and childish simplicity , he could not see the thing as a man of experience must .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 7]: George might be all right notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 32]: At the same time there was his father -- whose reputation remained under a thick cloud , whose failed character rather than his ill-success had driven George to the other continent .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 11]: Breed must go for something in a question of probabilities .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 16]: It was the first time Alexa 's thoughts had been turned into such a channel .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 28]: She clung to the poor comfort that something must have passed at the interview so kindly sought by George to set the quixotical young farmer against him .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 11]: She would not utter his name to Andrew ever again !
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 14]: She was right in thinking that George cherished a sincere affection for her .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 14]: It was one of the spurs which drove him too eagerly after money .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 28]: I doubt if any man starts with a developed love of money for its own sake -- except indeed he be born of generations of mammon worshipers .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 53]: George had gone into speculation with the object of retrieving the position in which he had supposed himself born , and in the hope of winning the hand of his cousin -- thinking too much of himself to offer what would not in the eyes of the world be worth her acceptance .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 32]: When he stepped on the inclined plane of dishonesty he believed himself only engaging in `` legitimate speculation ; '' but he was at once affected by the atmosphere about him .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 76]: Wrapped in the breath of admiration and adulation surrounding men who cared for _ nothing _ but money-making , men who were not merely dishonest , but the very serpents of dishonesty , against whom pickpockets will `` stick off '' as angels of light ; constantly under the softly persuasive influence of low morals and extravagant appreciation of cunning , he came by rapid degrees to think less and less of right and wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 100]: At first he called the doings of the place dishonest ; then he called them sharp practice ; then he called them a little shady ; then , close sailing ; then he said this or that transaction was deuced clever ; then , the man was more rogue than fool ; then he laughed at the success of a vile trick ; then he touched the pitch , and thinking all the time it was but with one finger , was presently besmeared all over -- as was natural , for he who will touch is already smeared .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 21]: While Alexa was fighting his battles with herself he had thrown down his arms in the only battle worth fighting .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 44]: When he wrote to her , which he did regularly , he said no more about business than that his prospects were encouraging ; how much his reticence may have had to do with a sense of her disapproval I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 3]: CHAPTER XV .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 4]: MOTHER AND DAUGHTER .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 29]: One lovely summer evening Dawtie , with a bundle in her hand , looked from the top of a grassy knoll down on her parents ' turf cottage .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 58]: The sun was setting behind her , and she looked as if she had stepped from it as it touched the ground on which she stood , rosy with the rosiness of the sun , but with a light in her countenance which came from a higher source , from the same nest as the sun himself .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 19]: She paused but a moment , ran down the hill , and found her mother making the porridge .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 32]: Mother and daughter neither embraced , nor kissed , nor even shook hands , but their faces glowed with delight , and words of joy and warmest welcome flowed between them .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 14]: `` But ye haena lost yer place , hae ye , hinny ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 4]: said the mother .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 26]: `` No , mother ; there 's no fear o ' that , as lang 's the laird or Miss Lexy 's to the fore .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 46]: They tret me -- I winna say like ane o ' themsel 's , but as if they would hae likit me for ane o ' themsel 's , gien it had pleased the Lord to sen ' me their way instead o ' yours .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 11]: They 're that guid to me ye canna think ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 10]: `` Then what 's broucht ye the day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 7]: `` I beggit for a play-day .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 9]: I wantit to see An ` rew . ''
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 5]: `` Eh , lass !
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 6]: I 'm feart for ye !
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 8]: Ye maunna set yer hert sae hie !
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 34]: An ` rew 's the best o ' men , but a lass canna hae a man til hersel ' jist 'cause he 's the best man i ' the warl ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 10]: `` What mean ye by that , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 8]: said Dawtie , looking a little scared .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 25]: `` Am I no ' to lo'e An ` rew , 'cause he 's ` maist as guid 's the Lord wad hae him ?
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 10]: Wad ye hae me hate him for ` t ?
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 25]: Has na he taught me to lo'e God -- to lo'e Him better nor father , mither , An ` rew , or onybody ?
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 9]: I _ wull _ lo'e An ` rew !
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 8]: What can ye mean , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 35]: `` What I mean , Dawtie , is , that ye mamma think because ye lo'e him ye maun hae him ; ye maunna think ye canna du wantin ' An ` rew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 19]: `` It 's true , mother , I kenna what I should do wantin ' An ` rew !
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 23]: Is na he aye shovin ' the door o ' the kingdom a wee wider to lat me see in the better ?
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 13]: It 's little ferly -LRB- _ marvel _ -RRB- I lo'e him !
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 17]: But as to wantin ` him for my ain man , as ye hae my father !
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 20]: -- mother , I wad be ashamet o ' mysel ' to think o ' ony sic a thing !
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 12]: -- clean affrontit wi ' mysel ' I wad be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 7]: `` Weel , weel , bairn !
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 16]: Ye was aye a wise like lass , an ' I maun lippen til ye !
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 7]: Only luik to yer hert . ''
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 25]: `` As for no ' lo'ein ' him , mither -- me that canna luik at a blin ' kittlin ' ohn lo'ed it !
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 5]: -- lo , mither !
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 18]: God made me sae , an didna mean me no ' to lo'e An ` rew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 4]: `` Andrew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 22]: she repeated , as if the word meant the perfection of earth 's worthiest rendering the idea of appropriation too absurd .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 9]: Silence followed , but the mother was brooding .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 16]: `` Ye maun bethink ye , lass , hoo far he 's abune ye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 5]: she said at length .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 54]: As the son of the farmer on whose land her husband was a cotter , Andrew seemed to her what the laird seemed to old John Ingram , and what the earl seemed to the laird , though the laird 's family was ancient when the earl 's had not been heard of .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 10]: But Dawtie understood Andrew better than did her mother .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 23]: `` You and me sees him far abune , mother , but Andrew himsel ' never thinks o ' nae sic things .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 16]: He 's sae used to luikin ' up , he 's forgotten to luik doon .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 19]: He bauds his lan ' frae a higher than the laird , or the yerl himsel ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 5]: The mother was silent .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 61]: She was faithful and true , but , fed on the dried fish of logic and system and Roman legalism , she could not follow the simplicities of her daughter 's religion , who trusted neither in notions about him , nor even in what he had done , but in the live Christ himself whom she loved and obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 65]: `` If Andrew wanted to marry me , '' Dawtie went on , jealous for the divine liberty of her teacher , `` which never cam intil 's heid -- na , no ance -- the same bein ' ta'en up wi ' far ither things , it wouldna be because I was but a cotter lass that he wouldna tak his ain gait !
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 17]: But the morn 's the Sabbath day , and we 'll hae a walk thegither . ''
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 20]: `` I dinna a ` thegither like thae walks upo ' the Sabbath day , '' said the mother .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 16]: `` Jesus walkit on the Sabbath the same as ony ither day , mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 12]: `` Weel , but He kenned what He was aboot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 8]: `` And sae do I , mother !
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 6]: I ken His wull ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 18]: `` He had aye something on han ' fit to be dune o ' the Sabbath ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 10]: `` And so hae I the day , mother .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 64]: If I was to du onything no fit i ' this His warl ' , luikin ' oot o ' the e ` en He gae me , wi ' the han 's an ' feet He gae me , I wad jist deserve to be nippit oot at ance , or sent intil the ooter mirk -LRB- _ darkness _ -RRB- ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 13]: `` There 's a mony maun fare ill then , lass ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 10]: `` I 'm sayin ' only for mysel ' .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 14]: I ken nane sae to blame as I would be mysel ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 17]: `` Is na that makin ' yersel ' oot better nor ither fowk , lass ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 62]: `` Gien I said I thoucht onything worth doin ' but the wull o ' God , I wad be a leear ; gien I say man or woman has naething ither to do i ' this warl ' or the neist , I say it believin ' ilkane o ' them maun come til ' t at the lang last .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 26]: Feow sees ' t yet , but the time 's comin ' when ilkabody will be as sure o ' ' t as I am .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 28]: What won ` er is ' t that I say ` t , wi ' Jesus tellin ' me the same frae mornin ' to nicht ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 20]: `` Lass , lass , I fear me , ye 'll gang oot o ' yer min ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 15]: `` It 'll be intil the mind o ' Christ , then , mother !
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 9]: I dinna care for my ain min ' .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 15]: I hae nane o ' my ain , an ' will stick to His .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 17]: Gien I dinna mak His mine , and stick til ` t , I 'm lost !
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 28]: Noo , mother , I 'll set the things , and run ower to the hoose , and lat An ` rew ken I 'm here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 7]: `` As ye wull , lass !
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 6]: ye ' r ayont me !
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 20]: I s ' say naething anent a willfu ' woman , for ye 've been aye a guid dochter .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 16]: I trust I hae risen to houp the Lord winna be disappointit in ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 39]: Dawtie found Andrew in the stable , suppering his horses , told him she had something to talk to him about , and asked if he would let her go with him in his walk the next day .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 29]: Andrew was delighted to see her , but he did not say so ; and she was back before her mother had taken the milk from the press .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 16]: In a few minutes her father appeared , and welcomed her with a sober joy .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 25]: As they eat their supper , he could not keep his eyes off her , she sat looking so well and nice and trim .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 15]: He was a good-looking , work-worn man , his hands absolutely horny with labor .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 43]: But inside many such horny husks are ripening beautiful kingdom hands , for the time when `` dear welcome Death '' will loose and let us go from the grave-clothes of the body that bind some of us even hand and foot .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 24]: Rugged father and withered mother were beautiful in the eyes of Dawtie , and she and God saw them better than any other .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 12]: Good , endless good was on the way to them all !
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 15]: It was so pleasant to be waiting for the best of all good things .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVI .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 4]: ANDREW AND DAWTIE .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 29]: Dawtie slept in peace and happy dreams till the next morning , when she was up almost with the sun , and out in his low clear light .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 19]: For the sun was strong again ; the red labor and weariness were gone from his shining face .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 21]: Everything about her seemed to know God , or at least to have had a moment 's gaze upon Him .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 12]: How else could everything look so content , hopeful and happy .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 23]: It is the man who will not fall in with the Father 's bliss to whom the world seems soulless and dull .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 20]: Dawtie was at peace because she desired nothing but what she knew He was best pleased to give her .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 26]: Even had she cherished for Andrew the kind of love her mother feared , her Lord 's will would have been her comfort and strength .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 16]: If any one say : `` Then she could not know what love is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 45]: I answer : `` That person does not know what the better love is that lifts the being into such a serene air that it can fast from many things and yet be blessed beyond what any other granted desire could make it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 100]: The scent of the sweet-pease growing against the turf wall entered Dawtie 's soul like a breath from the fields of heaven , where the children made merry with the angels , the merriest of playfellows , and the winds and waters , and all the living things , and all the things half alive , all the flowers and all the creatures , were at their sportive call ; where the little ones had babies to play with , and did not hurt them , and where dolls were neither loved nor missed , being never thought of .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 16]: Suchlike were the girl 's imaginings as her thoughts went straying , inventing , discovering .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 21]: She did not fear the Father would be angry with her for being His child , and playing at creation .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 24]: Who , indeed , but one that in loving heart can _ make _ , can rightly love the making of the Maker !
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 103]: When they had had their breakfast , and the old people were ready for church -- where they would listen a little , sleep a little , sing heartily , and hear nothing to wake hunger , joy or aspiration , Dawtie put a piece of oat-cake in her pocket , and went to join Andrew where they had made their tryst and where she found him waiting -- at his length in a bush of heather , with Henry Vaughan 's `` Silex Scintillans , '' drawing from it `` bright shoots of everlastingness '' for his Sabbath day 's delight .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 65]: He read one or two of the poems to Dawtie , who was pleased but not astonished -- she was never astonished at anything ; she had nothing in her to make anything beautiful by contrast ; her mind was of beauty itself , and anything beautiful was to her but in the order and law of things -- what was to be expected .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 25]: Nothing struck her because of its rarity ; the rare was at home in her country , and she was at home with it .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 49]: When , for instance , he read : `` Father of lights , what sunny seeds , '' she took it up at once and understood it , felt that the good man had said the thing that was to be said , and loved him for it .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 26]: She was not surprised to hear that the prayer was more than two hundred years old ; were there not millions of years in front ?
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 31]: why should it be wonderful that a few years behind men should have thought and felt as she did , and been able to say it as she never could !
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 16]: Had she not always loved the little cocks , and watched them learning to crow ?
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 36]: `` But , An ` rew , '' she said at length , `` I want to tell ye something that 's troublin ' me ; then ye can learn me what ye like . ''
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 14]: `` Tell on , Dawtie , '' said Andrew ; and she began .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 12]: `` Ae nicht aboot a fornight ago , I couldna sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 47]: I drave a ' the sheep I could gether i ' my brain , ower ae stile efter anither , but the sleep stack to the woo ' o ' them , an ' ilk ane took o ' ' t awa ' wi ' him .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 25]: I wadna hae tried , but that I had to be up ear ' , and I was feared I wad sleep in . ''
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 36]: For the sake of my more polished readers -- I do not say more _ refined _ , for polish and refinement may be worlds apart -- I will give the rest in modern English .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 45]: `` So I got up , and thought to sweep and dust the hall and the stairs ; then if , when I lay down again , I should sleep too long , there would be a part of the day 's work done !
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 44]: You know , Andrew , what the house is like ; at the top of the stair that begins directly you enter the house , there is a big irregular place , bigger than the floor of your barn , laid with flags .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 33]: It is just as if all the different parts of the house had been built at different times round about it , and then it was itself roofed in by an after-thought .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 10]: That 's what we call _ the hall _ .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 45]: The spare room opens on the left at the top of the stair , and to the right , across the hall , beyond the swell of the short thick tower you see the half of outside , is the door of the study .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 25]: It is all round with books -- some of them , mistress says , worth their weight in gold , they are so scarce .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 9]: But the master trusts me to dust them .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 28]: He used to do it himself ; but now that he is getting old , he does not like the trouble , and it makes him asthmatic .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 32]: He says books more need dusting than anything else , but are in more danger of being hurt by it , and it makes him nervous to see me touch them .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 28]: I have known him stand an hour watching me while I dusted , looking all the time as if he had just taken a dose of medicine .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 28]: So I often do a few books at a time , as I can , when he is not in the way to be worried with it .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 15]: But he always knows where I have been with my duster and long-haired brush .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 29]: And now it came across me that I had better dust some books first of all , as it was a good chance , he being sound asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 20]: So I lighted my lamp , went straight to the study , and began where I last left off .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 33]: `` As I was dusting , one of the books I came to looked so new and different from the rest that I opened it to see what it was like inside .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 41]: It was full of pictures of mugs , and gold and silver jugs and cups -- some of them plain and some colored ; and one of the colored ones was so beautiful that I stood and looked at it .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 43]: It was a gold cup , I suppose , for it was yellow ; and all round the edge , and on the sides , it was set with stones , like the stones in mistress 's rings , only much bigger .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 18]: They were blue and red and green and yellow , and more colors than I can remember .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 15]: The book said it was made by somebody , but I forget his name .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 6]: It was a long name .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 26]: The first part of it began with a _ B _ , and the second with a _ C _ , I remember that much .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 15]: It was like _ Benjamin _ , but it was n't _ Benjamin _ .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 28]: I put it back in its place , thinking I would ask the master whether there really were such beautiful things , and took down the next .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 89]: Now whether that had been passed over between two batches I do n't know , but it was so dusty that before I would touch another I gave the duster a shake , and the wind of it blew the lamp out I took it up to take it to the kitchen and kindle it again , when , to my astonishment , I saw a light under the door of a press which was always locked , and where master said he kept his most precious books .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 5]: ` How strange ! '
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 12]: I thought ; ' a light inside a locked cupboard ! '
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 53]: Then I remembered how in one place where I had been there was , in a room over the stable , a press whose door had no fastening except a bolt on the inside , which set me thinking , and some terrible things came to me that made me remember it .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 21]: So now I said to myself : ` There 's some one in there , after master 's books ! '
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 32]: It was not a likely thing , but the night is the time for fancies , and in the night you do n't know what is likely and what is not .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 18]: One thing , however , was clear -- I ought to find out what the light meant .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 35]: Fearful things darted one after the other through my head as I went to the door , but there was one thing I dared not do , and that was to leave it unopened .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 21]: So I opened it as softly as I could , in terror lest the thief should hear my heart beating .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 12]: When I could peep in what do you think I saw ?
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 7]: I could not believe my eyes !
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 7]: There was a great big room !
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 75]: I rubbed my eyes , and stared ; and rubbed them again and stared -- thinking to rub it away ; but there it was , a big odd-shaped room , part of it with round sides , and in the middle of the room a table , and on the table a lamp , burning as I had never seen lamp burn , and master at the table with his back to me .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 19]: I was so astonished I forgot that I had no business there , and ought to go away .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 10]: I stood like an idiot , mazed and lost .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 48]: And you will not wonder when I tell you that the laird was holding up to the light , between his two hands , the very cup I had been looking at in the book , the stones of it flashing all the colors of the rainbow .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 18]: I should think it a dream , if I did not _ know _ it was not .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 50]: I do not believe I made any noise , for I could not move , but he started up with a cry to God to preserve him , set the cup on the table , threw something over it , caught up a wicked-looking knife , and turned round .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 16]: His face was like that of a corpse , and I could see him tremble .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 13]: I stood steady ; it was no time then to turn away .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 37]: I supposed he expected to see a robber , and would be glad when he discovered it was only me ; but when he did his fear changed to anger , and he came at me .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 15]: His eyes were flaming , and he looked as if he would kill me .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 17]: I was not frightened -- poor old man , I was able for him any day !
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 9]: -- but I was afraid of hurting him .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 32]: So I closed the door quickly , and went softly to my own room , where I stood a long time in the dark , listening , but heard nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 9]: What am I to do , Andrew ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 12]: `` I do n't know that you have to do anything .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 19]: You have one thing not to do , that is -- tell anybody what you have seen . ''
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 18]: `` I was forced to tell _ you _ because I did not know what to do .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 9]: It makes me _ so _ sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 8]: `` It was no fault of yours .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 18]: You acted to the best of your knowledge , and could not help what came of it .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 6]: Perhaps nothing more will come .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 17]: Leave the thing alone , and if he say anything tell him how it happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 18]: `` But , Andrew , I do n't think you see what it is that troubles me .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 9]: I am afraid my master is a miser .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 16]: The mistress and he take their meals , like poor people , in the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 9]: That must be the dining-room of the house !
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 26]: -- and though my eyes were tethered to the flashing cup , I could not help seeing it was full of strange and beautiful things .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 26]: Among them , I knew , by pictures I had seen , the armor of knights , when they fought on their horses ' backs .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 11]: Before people had money they must have misered other things .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 12]: Some girls miser their clothes , and never go decent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 16]: `` Suppose him a miser , '' said Andrew , `` what could you do ?
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 8]: How are you to help it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 9]: `` That 's what I want to know .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 15]: I love my master , and there must be a way to help it .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 37]: It was terrible to see him , in the middle of the night , gazing at that cup as if he had found the most precious thing that can ever have existed on the earth . ''
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 6]: `` What was that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 3]: asked Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 7]: He delighted in Dawtie 's talk .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 18]: It was like an angel 's , he said , both in its ignorance and its wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 9]: `` You ca n't have forgotten , Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 5]: It 's impossible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 3]: she answered .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 8]: `` I heard you say yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 3]: Andrew smiled .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 8]: `` I know , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 5]: `` Poor man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 16]: resumed Dawtie ; `` he looked at the cup as you might at that manuscript !
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 10]: His soul was at it , feasting upon it !
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 7]: Now was n't that miserly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 7]: `` It was like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 22]: `` And I love my master , '' repeated Dawtie , thus putting afresh the question what she was to do .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 10]: `` Why do you love him , Dawtie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 3]: asked Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 9]: `` Because I 'm set to love him .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 19]: Besides , we 're told to love our enemies -- then surely we 're to love our friends .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 9]: He has always been a friend to me .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 17]: He never said a hard word to me , even when I was handling his books .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 6]: He trusts me with them !
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 13]: I ca n't help loving him -- a good deal , Andrew !
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 11]: And it 's what I 've got to do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 11]: `` There 's not a doubt about it , Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 14]: You 've got to love him , and you do love him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 10]: `` But there 's more than that , Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 26]: To hear the laird talk you would think he cared more for the Bible than for the whole world -- not to say gold cups .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 21]: He talks of the merits of the Saviour , that you would think he loved Him with all his heart .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 37]: But I can not get it out of my mind , ever since I saw that look on his face , that he loves that cup -- that it 's his graven image -- his idol !
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 28]: How else should he get up in the middle of the night to -- to -- to -- well , it was just like worshiping it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 14]: `` You 're afraid then that he 's a hypocrite , Dawtie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 29]: `` No ; I dare n't think that -- if it were only for fear I should stop loving him -- and that would be as bad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 9]: `` As bad as what , Dawtie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 37]: `` I do n't always know what I 'm going to say , '' answered Dawtie , a little embarrassed , `` and then when I 've said it I have to look what it means .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 22]: But is n't it as bad not to love a human being as it would be to love a thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 8]: `` Perhaps worse , '' said Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 7]: `` Something must be done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 4]: she went on .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 9]: `` He ca n't be left like that !
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 28]: But if he has any love to his Master , how is it that the love of that Master does not cast out the love of Mammon ?
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 7]: I ca n't understand it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 10]: `` You have asked a hard question , Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 21]: But a cure may be going on , and take a thousand years or ages to work it out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 11]: `` What if it should n't be begun yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 7]: `` That would be terrible . ''
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 10]: `` What then am I to do , Andrew ?
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 10]: You always say we must _ do _ something !
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 14]: You say there is no faith but what _ does _ something ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 18]: `` The apostle James said so , a few years before I was born , Dawtie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 12]: `` Do n't make fun of me -- please , Andrew !
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 24]: I like it , but I ca n't bear it to-day , my head is so full of the poor old laird ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 8]: `` Make fun of you , Dawtie !
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 2]: Never !
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 12]: But I do n't know yet how to answer you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 14]: `` Well , then , what _ am _ I to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 3]: persisted Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 13]: `` Wait , of course , till you know what to do .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 22]: When you do n't know what to do , do n't do anything -- only keep asking the Thinker for wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 17]: And until you know , do n't let the laird see that you know anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 7]: With this answer Dawtie was content .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 11]: Business was over , and they turned to go home .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVII .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 5]: DAWTIE AND THE CUP .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 9]: The old man had a noteworthy mental fabric .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 66]: Believing himself a true lover of literature , and especially of poetry , he would lecture for ten minutes on the right mode of reading a verse in Hilton or Dante ; but as to Satan or Beatrice , would pin his faith to the majority of the commentators : Milton 's Satan was too noble , and Beatrice was no woman , but Theology .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 36]: He was discriminative to a degree altogether admirable as to the brightness or wrongness of a proposition with regard to conduct , but owed his respectability to good impulses without any effort of the will .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 21]: He was almost as orthodox as Paul before his conversion , lacking only the heart and the courage to persecute .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 24]: Whatever the eternal wisdom saw in him , the thing most present to his own consciousness was the love of rare historic relics .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 37]: And this love was so mingled in warp and woof , that he did not know whether a thing was more precious to him for its rarity , its money value , or its historico-reliquary interest .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 42]: All the time he was a school-master , he saved every possible half-penny to buy books , not because of their worth or human interest , but because of their literary interest , or the scarcity of the book or edition .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 45]: In the holidays he would go about questing for the prey that his soul loved , hunting after precious things ; but not even the precious things of the everlasting hills would be precious to him until they had received the stamp of curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 18]: His life consisted in a continual search for something new that was known as known of old .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 119]: It had hardly yet occurred to him that he must one day leave his things and exist without them , no longer to brood over them , take them in his hands , turn , and stroke , and admire them ; yet , strange to say , he would at times anxiously seek to satisfy himself that he was safe for a better world , as he _ called _ it -- to feel certain , that is , that his faith was of the sort he supposed intended by Paul -- not that he had himself gathered anything from the apostle , but all from the traditions of his church concerning the teaching of the apostle .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 93]: He was anxious , I say , as to his safety for the world to come , and yet , while his dearest joy lay treasured in that hidden room , he never thought of the hour when he must leave it all , and go houseless and pocketless , empty-handed if not armless , in the wide , closetless space , hearing ever in the winds and the rain and the sound of the sea-waves , the one question -- `` Whose shall those things be which thou hast provided ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 41]: Like the rich man to whom God said the words , he had gathered much goods for many years -- hundreds and hundreds of things , every one of which he knew , and every one of which he loved .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 61]: A new scratch on the bright steel of one of his suits of armor was a scratch on his heart ; the moth and the rust troubled him sore , for he could not keep them away ; and where his treasure was , there was his heart , devoured by the same moth , consumed by the same rust .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 43]: He had much suffering from his possessions -- was more exposed to misery than the miser of gold , for the hoarded coin of the latter may indeed be stolen , but he fears neither moth nor rust nor scratch nor decay .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 12]: The laird cherished his things as no mother her little ones .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 42]: Nearly sixty years he had been gathering them , and their money-worth was great , but he had no idea of its amount , for he could not have endured the exposure and handling of them which a valuation must involve .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 41]: His love for his books had somewhat declined in the growth of his love for things , and now , by degrees not very slow , his love for his things was graduating itself after what he supposed their money-value .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 21]: His soul not only clave to the dust but was going deeper and deeper in the dust as it wallowed .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 35]: All day long he was living in the past and growing old in it -- it is one thing to grow old in the past , and another to grow old in the present !
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 58]: As he took his walk about his farms , or sat at his meals , or held a mild , soulless conversation with his daughter , his heart was growing old , not healthily in the present , which is to ripen , but unwholesomely in the past , which is to consume with a dry rot .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 48]: While he read the Bible at prayers , trying hard to banish worldly things from his mind , his thoughts were not in the story or the argument he read , but hovering , like a bird over its nest , about the darlings of his heart .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 46]: Yea , even while he prayed , his soul , instead of casting off the clay of the world , was loaded and dragged down with all the still-moldering , slow-changing things that lined the walls and filled the drawers and cabinets of his treasure-chamber .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 72]: It was a place of whose existence not even his daughter knew ; for before ever she entered the house , he had taken with him a mason from the town , and built up the entrance to it from the hall , ever afterward keeping the other door of it that opened from his study carefully locked , and leaving it to be regarded as the door of a closet .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 46]: It was as terrible as Dawtie felt it , that a live human soul should thus haunt the sepulcher of the past , and love the lifeless , turning a room hitherto devoted to hospitality and mirthful intercourse into the temple of his selfish idolatry .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 17]: It was as one of the rooms carved for the dead in the Beban El Malook .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 17]: Sure , if left to himself , the ghost that loved it would haunt the place !
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 8]: But he could not surely be permitted !
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 19]: for it might postpone a thousand years his discovery of the emptiness of a universe of such treasures .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 37]: Now he was moldering into the world of spirits in the heart of an avalanche of the dust of ages , dust material from his hoards , dust moral and spiritual from his withering soul itself .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 27]: The next day he was ill , which , common as is illness to humanity , was strange , for it had never befallen him before .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 8]: He was unable to leave his bed .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 25]: But he never said a word to his daughter , who alone waited on him , as to what had happened in the night .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 62]: He had passed it sleepless , and without the possibility of a dream on which to fall back ; yet , when morning came , he was in much doubt whether what he had seen -- the face , namely , of Dawtie , peeping in at the door -- was a reality , or but a vision of the night .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 32]: For when he opened the door which she had closed , all was dark , and not the slightest sound reached his quick ear from the swift foot of her retreat .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 39]: He turned the key twice , and pushed two bolts , eager to regard the vision as a providential rebuke of his carelessness in leaving the door on the latch -- for the first time , he imagined .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 17]: Then he tottered back to his chair , and sunk on it in a cold sweat .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 49]: For , although the confidence grew , that what he had seen was but a false creation Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain , it was far from comfortable to feel that he could no longer depend upon his brain to tell him only the thing that was true .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 29]: What if he were going out of his mind , on the way to encounter a succession of visions -- without reality , but possessed of its power !
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 21]: What if they should be such whose terror would compel him to disclose what most he desired to keep covered ?
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 31]: How fearful to be no more his own master , but at the beck and call of a disordered brain , a maniac king in a _ cosmos acosmos _ !
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 35]: Better it had been Dawtie , and she had seen in his hands Benvenuto Cellini 's chalice made for Pope Clement the Seventh to drink therefrom the holy wine -- worth thousands of pounds !
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 6]: Perhaps she had seen it !
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 7]: No , surely she had not !
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 10]: He must be careful not to make her suspect !
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 8]: He would watch her and say nothing !
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 41]: But Dawtie , conscious of no wrong , and full of love to the old man , showed an untroubled face when next she met him ; and he made up his mind that he would rather have her ignorant .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 31]: Thenceforward , naturally though childishly , he was even friendlier to her than before : it was so great a relief to find that he had not to fear her !
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 34]: The next time Dawtie was dusting the books , she felt strongly drawn to look again at the picture of the cup : it seemed now to hold in it a human life !
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 29]: She took down the book , and began where she stood to read what it said about the chalice , referring as she read from letterpress to drawing .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 45]: It was taken from an illumination in a missal , where the cup was known to have been copied ; and it rendered the description in the letterpress unnecessary except in regard to the stones and _ dessins repoussés _ on the hidden side .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 38]: She quickly learned the names of the gems , that she might see how many were in the high-priest 's breast-plate and the gates of the new Jerusalem , then proceeded to the history of the chalice .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 49]: She read that it had come into the possession of Cardinal York , the brother of Charles Edward Stuart , and had been by him intrusted to his sister-in-law , the Duchess of Albany , from whose house it disappeared , some said stolen , others said sold .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 45]: It came next to the historic surface in the possession of a certain earl whose love of curiosities was well known ; but from his collection again it vanished , this time beyond a doubt stolen , and probably years before it was missed .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 23]: A new train of thought was presently in motion in the mind of the girl : _ The beautiful cup was stolen !
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 9]: it was not where it ought to be !
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 6]: it was not at home !
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 9]: it was a captive , a slave _ !
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 19]: She lowered the book , half closed , with a finger between the leaves , and stood thinking .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 22]: She did not for a moment believe her master had stolen it , though the fear did flash through her mind .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 25]: It had been stolen and sold , and he had bought it at length of some one whose possession of it was nowise suspicious !
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 25]: But he must know now that it had been stolen , for here , with the cup , was the book which said so !
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 25]: That would be nothing if the rightful owner were not known , but he was known , and the thing ought to be his !
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 58]: The laird might not be bound , she was not sure , to restore it at his own loss , for when he bought it he was not aware that it was stolen ; but he was bound to restore it at the price he had paid for it , if the former owner would give it !
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 5]: This was bare justice !
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 3]: mere righteousness !
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 21]: No theft could make the owner not the rightful owner , though other claims upon the thing might come in !
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 11]: One ought not to be enriched by another 's misfortune !
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 35]: Dawtie was sure that a noble of the kingdom of heaven would not wait for the money , but would with delight send the cup where it ought to have been all the time !
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 58]: She knew better , however , than require magnificence in any shape from the poor wizened soul of her master -- a man who knew all about everything , and whom yet she could not but fear to _ be _ nothing : as Dawtie had learned to understand life , the laird did not yet exist .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 20]: But he well knew right from wrong , therefore the discovery she just made affected her duty toward him !
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 26]: It might be impossible to make impression on the miserliness of a miser , but upon the honesty in a miser it might be possible !
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 6]: The goblet was not his !
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 35]: But the love of things dulls the conscience , and he might not be able , having bought and paid for it , to see that the thing was not therefore _ his _ !
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 8]: he might defend himself from seeing it !
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 13]: To Dawtie , this made the horror of his condition the darker .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 19]: She was one of God 's babes , who can not help seeing the true state of things .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 63]: Logic was to her but the smoke that rose from the burning truth ; she saw what is altogether above and beyond logic -- the right thing , whose meanest servant , the hewer of its wood , not the drawer of its water , the merest scullion and sweeper away of lies from the pavement of its courts , is logic .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 30]: With a sigh she woke to the knowledge that she was not doing her work , and rousing herself , was about to put the book on its shelf .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 20]: But , her finger being still in the place , she would have one more glance at the picture !
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 35]: To her dismay she saw that she had made a mark on the plate , and of the enormity of making a dirty mark on a book her master had made her well aware .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 6]: She was in great distress .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 6]: What was to be done ?
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 13]: She did not once think of putting it away and saying nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 26]: To have reasoned that her master would never know , would have been an argument , pressing and imperative , for informing him at once .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 26]: She had done him an injury , and the injury must be confessed and lamented ; it was all that was left to be done !
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 6]: `` Sic a mischance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 37]: she said , then bethought herself that there was no such thing as mischance , when immediately it flashed upon her that here was the door open for the doing of what was required of her .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 54]: She was bound to confess the wrong , and that would lead in the disclosure of what she knew , rendering it comparatively easy to use some remonstrance with the laird , whom in her mind 's eye she saw like a beggar man tottering down a steep road to a sudden precipice .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 15]: Her duty was now so plain that she felt no desire to consult Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 48]: She was not one to ask an opinion for the sake of talking opinion ; she went to Andrew only when she wanted light to do the right thing ; when the light was around her , she knew how to walk , and troubled no one .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 16]: At once she laid down book and duster , and went to find the laird .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 44]: But he had slipped away to the town , to have a rummage in a certain little shop in a back street , which he had not rummaged for a long time enough , he thought , to have let something come in .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 21]: It was no relief to Dawtie : the thing would be all the day before her instead of behind her !
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 20]: It burned within her , not like a sin , but like what it was , a confession unconfessed .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 21]: Little wrong as she had done , Dawtie was yet familiar with the lovely potency of confession to annihilate it .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 24]: She knew it was the turning from wrong that killed it , that confession gave the _ coup de grâce _ to offense .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 20]: Still she dreaded not a little the displeasure of her master , and yet she dreaded more his distress .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 26]: She prepared the laird 's supper with a strange mingling of hope and anxiety : she feared having to go to bed without telling him .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 25]: But he came at last , almost merry , with a brown paper parcel under his arm , over which he was very careful .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 34]: Poor man , he little knew there waited him at the moment a demand from the eternal justice almost as terrible as : `` This night they require thy soul of thee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 10]: -- -LRB- What a _ they _ is that !
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 7]: Who are _ they _ ? -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 19]: -- The torture of the moral rack was ready for him at the hands of his innocent house-maid !
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 20]: In no way can one torture another more than by waking conscience against love , passion , or pride .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 96]: He laid his little parcel carefully on the supper-table , said rather a shorter grace than usual , began to eat his porridge , praised it as very good , spoke of his journey and whom he had seen , and was more talkative than his wont He informed Alexa , almost with jubilation , that he had at length found an old book he had been long on the watch for -- a book that treated , in ancient broad Scots , of the laws of verse , in full , even exhaustive manner .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 7]: He pulled it from his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 15]: `` It is worth at least ten times what I gave for it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 25]: Dawtie wondered whether there ought not to have been some division of the difference ; but she was aware of no call to speak .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 8]: One thing was enough for one night !
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 4]: Then came prayers .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 19]: The old man read how David deceived the Philistines , telling them a falsehood as to his raids .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 33]: He read the narrative with a solemnity of tone that would have graced the most righteous action : was it not the deed of a man according to God 's own heart ?
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 9]: -- how could it be other than right !
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 18]: Casuist ten times a week , he made no question of the righteousness of David 's wickedness !
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 32]: Then he prayed , giving thanks for the mercy that had surrounded them all the day , shielding them from the danger and death which lurked for them in every corner .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 10]: What would he say when death did get him ?
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 3]: Dawtie thought .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 6]: Would he thank God then ?
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 25]: And would he see , when she spoke to him , that God wanted to deliver him from a worse danger than any out-of-doors ?
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 22]: Would he see that it was from much mercy he was made more uncomfortable than perhaps ever in his life before ?
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 14]: At length his offering was completed -- how far accepted who can tell !
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 22]: He was God 's , and He who gave him being would be his Father to the full possibility of God .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 21]: They rose from their knees ; the laird took up his parcel and book ; his daughter went with him .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVIII .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 5]: DAWTIE AND THE LAIRD .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 34]: As soon as Dawtie heard her mistress 's door close , she followed her master to the study , and arrived just as the door of the hidden room was shut behind him .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 9]: There was not a moment to be lost !
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 11]: She went straight to it , and knocked rather loud .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 4]: No answer came .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 4]: She knocked again .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 6]: Still there was no answer .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 35]: She knocked a third time , and after a little fumbling with the lock , the door opened a chink , and a ghastly face , bedewed with drops of terror , peeped through .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 36]: She was standing a little back , and the eyes did not at once find the object they sought ; then suddenly they lighted on her , and the laird shook from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 8]: `` What is it , Dawtie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 8]: he faltered out in a broken voice .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 23]: `` Please , sir , '' answered Dawtie , `` I have something to confess : would ye hearken to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 7]: `` No , no , Dawtie !
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 10]: I am sure you have nothing to confess ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 28]: returned the old man , eager to send her away , and to prevent her from seeing the importance of the room whose entrance she had discovered .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 36]: `` Or , '' he went on , finding she did not move , `` if you have done anything , Dawtie , that you ought not to have done , confess it to God .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 16]: It is to Him you must confess , not to a poor mortal like me !
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 20]: For my part , if it lies to me , I forgive you , and there is an end !
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 8]: Go to your bed , Dawtie . ''
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 8]: `` Please , sir , I canna .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 30]: Gien ye winna hear til me , I 'll sit doon at the door o ' this room , and sit till -- '' `` What room , Dawtie ?
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 6]: Call you this a room ?
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 18]: It 's a wee bit closet where I say my prayers before I go to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 51]: But as he spoke his blood ran cold within him , for he had uttered a deliberate lie -- two lies in one breath : the bit closet was the largest room in the house , and he had never prayed a prayer in it since first he entered it !
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 30]: He was unspeakably distressed at what he had done , for he had always cherished the idea that he was one who would not lie to save his life .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 22]: And now in his old age he had lied who when a boy had honor enough to keep him from lying !
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 17]: Worst of all , now that he had lied , he must hold to the lie !
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 8]: He _ dared _ not confess it !
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 6]: He stood sick and trembling .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 29]: `` I 'll wait , sir , '' said Dawtie , distressed at his suffering , and more distressed that he could lie who never forgot his prayers !
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 14]: Alas , he was further down the wrong road than she had supposed !
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 34]: Ashamed for his sake , and also for her own , to look him in the face -- for did he not imagine she believed him , while she knew that he lied ?
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 8]: -- she turned her back on him .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 16]: He caught at his advantage , glided out , and closed the door behind him .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 12]: When Dawtie again turned , she saw him in her power .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 14]: Her trial was come ; she had to speak for life or death !
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 31]: But she remembered that the Lord told His disciples to take no care how they should speak ; for when the time came it would be given them to speak .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 15]: So she began by simply laying down the thing that was in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 28]: `` Sir , '' she said , `` I am very sorry , but this morning I made a dirty mark in one of your books ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 19]: Her words alarmed him a little , and made him forget for the instant his more important fears .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 18]: But he took care to be gentle with her ; it would not do to offend her !
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 20]: for was she not aware that where they stood was a door by which he went in and out ?
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 9]: `` You make me uneasy , Dawtie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 6]: `` What book was it ?
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 6]: Let me see it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 7]: `` I will , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 24]: She turned to take it down , but the laird followed her , saying : `` Point it out to me , Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 6]: I will get it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 4]: She did so .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 6]: It opened at the plate .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 7]: `` There is the mark ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 7]: `` I am right sorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 6]: `` So am I ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 4]: returned the laird .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 40]: `` But , '' he added , willing she should feel his clemency , and knowing the book was not a rare one , `` it is a book still , and you will be more careful another time !
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 25]: For you must remember , Dawtie , that you do n't come into this room to read the books , but to dust them .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 15]: You can go to bed now with an easy mind , I hope ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 28]: Dawtie was so touched by the kindness and forbearance of her master that the tears rose in her eyes , and she felt strengthened for her task .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 10]: What would she not have encountered for his deliverance !
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 24]: `` Please , sir , '' she said , `` let me show you a thing you never perhaps happened to read ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 48]: And taking the book from his hand -- he was too much astonished to retain it -- she turned over the engraving , and showed him the passage which stated that the cup had disappeared from the possession of its owner , and had certainly been stolen .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 32]: Finding he said not a word , she ventured to lift her eyes to his , and saw again the corpse-like face that had looked through the chink of the door .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 7]: `` What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 3]: he stammered .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 7]: `` I do not understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 18]: His lips trembled : was it possible he had had to do with the stealing of it ?
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 53]: The truth was this : he had learned the existence of the cup from this very book ; and had never rested until , after a search of more than ten years , he at length found it in the hands of a poor man who dared not offer it for sale .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 27]: Once in his possession , the thought of giving it up , or of letting the owner redeem it , had never even occurred to him .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 54]: Yet the treasure made him rejoice with a trembling which all his casuistry would have found it hard to explain ; for he would not confess to himself its real cause -- namely , that his God-born essence was uneasy with a vague knowledge that it lay in the bosom of a thief .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 32]: `` Do n't you think , sir , '' said Dawtie , `` that whoever has that cup ought to send it back to the place it was stolen from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 22]: Had the old man been a developed hypocrite , he would have replied at once : `` He certainly ought . ''
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 31]: But by word of mouth to condemn himself would have been to acknowledge to himself that he ought to send the cup home , and this he dared not do .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 15]: Men who will not do as they know , make strange confusion in themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 19]: The worst rancor in the vessel of peace is the consciousness of wrong in a not all-unrighteous soul .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 28]: The laird was false to his own self , but to confess himself false would be to initiate a change which would render life worthless to him !
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 45]: What would all his fine things be without their heart of preciousness , the one jewel that now was nowhere in the world but in his house , in the secret chamber of his treasures , which would be a rifled case without it !
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 34]: As is natural to one who will not do right , he began to argue the moral question , treating it as a point of casuistry that troubled the mind of the girl .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 10]: `` I do n't know that , Dawtie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 50]: `` It is not likely that the person that has the cup , whoever he may be -- that is , if the cup be still in existence -- is the same who stole it ; and it would hardly be justice to punish the innocent for the guilty ?
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 27]: -- as would be the case , if , supposing I had bought the cup , I had to lose the money I paid for it .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 19]: Should the man who had not taken care of his cup have his fault condoned at my expense ?
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 55]: Did he not deserve , the many might say , to be so punished , placing huge temptation in the path of the needy , to the loss of their precious souls , and letting a priceless thing go loose in the world , to work ruin to whoever might innocently buy it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 22]: His logic did not serve to show him the falsehood of his reasoning , for his heart was in the lie .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 22]: `` Ought I or he , '' he went on , `` to be punished because he kept the thing ill ?
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 9]: And how far would the quixotic obligation descend ?
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 16]: A score of righteous men may by this time have bought and sold the cup !
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 34]: -- is it some demon-talisman , that the last must meet the penalty , when the original owner , or some descendant of the man who lost it , chooses to claim it ?
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 17]: For anything we know , he may himself have pocketed the price of the rumored theft !
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 11]: Can you not see it would be a flagrant injustice ?
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 13]: -- fit indeed to put an end to all buying and selling !
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 7]: It would annihilate transfer of property !
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 17]: Possession would mean only strength to keep , and the world would fall into confusion . ''
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 48]: `` It would be hard , I grant , '' confessed Dawtie ; `` but the man who has it ought at least to give the head of the family in which it had been the chance of buying it back at the price it cost him .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 19]: If he could not buy it back -- then the thing would have to be thought over . ''
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 15]: `` I confess I do n't see the thing , '' returned the laird .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 14]: `` But the question needs not keep you out of bed , Dawtie !
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 16]: It is not often a girl in your position takes an interest in the abstract !
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 40]: Besides , '' he resumed , another argument occurring to him , `` a thing of such historical value and interest ought to be where it was cared for , not where it was in danger every moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 22]: `` There might be something in that , '' allowed Dawtie , `` if it were where everybody could see it .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 17]: But where is the good if it be but for the eyes of one man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 17]: The eyes she meant fixed themselves upon her till their gaze grew to a stony stare .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 10]: She _ must _ know that he had it !
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 6]: Or did she only suspect ?
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 6]: He must not commit himself !
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 12]: He must set a watch on the door of his lips !
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 10]: What an uncomfortable girl to have in the house !
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 6]: Oh , those self-righteous Ingrams !
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 5]: What mischief they did !
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 19]: His impulse was to dart into his treasure-cave , lock himself in , and hug the radiant chalice .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 4]: He dared not .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 15]: He must endure instead the fastidious conscience and probing tongue of an intrusive maid-servant !
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 54]: `` But , '' he rejoined , with an attempt at a smile , `` if the pleasure the one man took in it should , as is easy to imagine , exceed immeasurably the aggergate pleasure of the thousands that would look upon it and pass it by -- what then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 36]: `` The man would enjoy it the more that many saw it -- except he loved it for greed , when he would be rejoicing in iniquity , for the cup would not be his .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 15]: And anyhow , he could not take it with him when he died ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 17]: The face of the miser grew grayer ; his lip trembled ; but he said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 7]: He was beginning to hate Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 5]: She was an enemy !
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 8]: She sought his discomfiture , his misery !
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 59]: He had read strange things in certain old books , and half believed some of them : what if Dawtie was one of those evil powers that haunt a man in pleasant shape , learn the secrets of his heart , and gain influence over him that they may tempt him to yield his soul to the enemy !
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 7]: She was set on ruining him !
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 10]: Certainly she knew that cup was in his possession !
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 4]: He must temporize !
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 8]: He must _ seem _ to listen !
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 26]: But as soon as fit reason could be found , such as would neither compromise him nor offend her , she must be sent away !
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 26]: And of all things , she must not gain the means of proving what she now perhaps only suspected , and was seeking assurance of !
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 4]: He stood thinking .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 43]: It was but for a moment ; for the very next words from the lips of the girl that was to him little more than a house-broom , set him face to face with reality -- the one terror of the unreal .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 62]: `` Eh , maister , sir , '' said Dawtie , with the tears in her eyes , and now at last breaking down in her English , `` dinna ye _ ken _ ` at ye _ hae _ to gie the man ` at aucht that gowden bicker , the chance o ' buyin ' ' t back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 4]: The laird shivered .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 12]: He dared not say : `` How do you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 11]: for he dared not hear the thing proved to him .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 12]: If she did know , he would not front her proof !
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 12]: He would not have her even suppose it an acknowledged fact !
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 26]: `` If I had the cup , '' he began -- but she interrupted him : it was time they should have done with lying !
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 11]: `` Ye ken ye hae the cup , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 18]: `` And I ken tu , for I saw ' t i ' yer han 's ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 8]: `` You shameless , prying hussy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 34]: he began , in a rage at last -- but the eager , tearful earnestness of her face made him bethink himself : it would not do to make an enemy of her !
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 27]: `` Tell me , Dawtie , '' he said , with sudden change of tone , `` how it was you came to see it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 20]: She told him all -- how and when ; and he knew that he had seen her see him .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 9]: He managed to give a poor little laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 11]: `` All is not gold that glitters , Dawtie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 50]: `` The cup you saw was not the one in the book , but an imitation of it -- mere gilded tin and colored glass -- copied from the picture , as near as they could make it -- just to see better what it must have been like .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 15]: Why , my good girl , that cup would be worth thousands of pounds !
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 14]: So go to bed , and do n't trouble yourself about gold cups .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 13]: It is not likely any of them will come our way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 11]: Simple as Dawtie was , she did not believe him .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 16]: But she saw no good to be done by disputing what he ought to know .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 15]: `` It wasna aboot the gold cup I was troublin ' mysel ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 5]: she said , hesitatingly .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 7]: `` You are right there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 13]: he replied , with another deathly laugh , `` it was not !
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 19]: But you have been troubling me about nothing half the night , and I am shivering with cold !
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 12]: We really must , both of us , go to bed !
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 7]: What would your mistress say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 30]: `` No , '' persisted Dawtie , `` it wasna aboot the cup , gowd or no gowd ; it was and is aboot my maister I 'm troubled !
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 9]: I 'm terrible feart for ye , sir !
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 11]: Ye 're a worshiper o ' Mammon , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 10]: The laird laughed , for the danger was over !
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 9]: -- to Dawtie 's deep dismay he laughed !
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 24]: `` My poor girl , '' he said , `` you take an innocent love of curious things for the worship of Mammon !
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 6]: Do n't imagine me jesting .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 33]: How could you believe an old man like me , an elder of the kirk , a dispenser of her sacred things , guilty of the awful crime of Mammon worship ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 25]: He imagined her ignorantly associating the idea of some idolatrous ritual with what to him was but a phrase -- the worship of Mammon .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 28]: `` Do you not remember , '' he continued , `` the words of Christ , that a man _ can not _ serve God and Mammon ?
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 32]: If I be a Christian , as you will hardly doubt , it follows that I am not a worshiper of Mammon , for the two can not go together . ''
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 10]: `` But that 's just the question , sir !
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 19]: A man who worships God , worships Him with his whole heart and soul and strength and mind .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 37]: If he wakes at night , it is to worship God ; if he is glad in his heart , it is because God is , and one day he shall behold His face in brightness .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 53]: If a man worships God , he loves Him so that no love can come between him and God ; if the earth were removed , and the mountains cast into the midst of the sea , it would be all one to him , for God would be all the same .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 8]: Is it not so , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 18]: `` You are a good girl , Dawtie , and I approve of every word you say .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 28]: It would more than savor of presumption to profess that I loved God up to the point you speak of ; but I deserve to love Him .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 23]: Doubtless a man ought to love God so , and we are all sinners just because we do not love God so .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 7]: But we have the atonement ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 24]: `` But , sir , '' answered Dawtie , the silent tears running down her face , `` I love God that way !
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 11]: I do n't care a dust for anything without Him !
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 29]: When I go to bed , I do n't care if I never wake again in this world ; I shall be where He would have me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 6]: `` You presume , Dawtie !
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 7]: I fear me much you presume !
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 9]: What if that should be in hell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 11]: `` If it be , it will be the best .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 8]: It will be to set me right .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 9]: Oh , sir , He is so good !
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 19]: Tell me one thing , sir : when you die -- '' `` Tut , tut , lass !
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 8]: we 're not come to that yet !
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 11]: There 's no occasion to think about that yet awhile !
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 11]: We 're in the hands of a reconciled God . ''
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 31]: `` What I want to know , '' pursued Dawtie , `` is how you will feel , how you will get on when you have n't got anything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 7]: `` Not got anything , girl !
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 6]: Are you losing your senses ?
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 8]: Of course we shall want nothing then !
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 11]: I shall have to talk to the doctor about you !
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 17]: We shall have you killing us in our beds to know how we like it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 11]: He laughed ; but it was a rather scared laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 36]: `` What I mean , '' she persisted , `` is -- when you have no body , and no hands to take hold of your cap , what will you do without it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 12]: `` What if I leave it to you , Dawtie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 17]: returned the laird , with a stupid mixture of joke and avarice in his cold eye .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 37]: `` Please , sir , I did n't say what you would do with it , but what would you do without it when it will neither come out of your heart nor into your hands !
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 14]: It must be misery to a miser to _ have _ nothing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 7]: `` A miser , hussy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 14]: `` A lover of things , more than a lover of God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 12]: `` Well , perhaps you have the better of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 44]: he said , after a cowed pause ; for he perceived there was no compromise possible with Dawtie : she knew perfectly what she meant ; and he could neither escape her logic , nor change her determination , whatever that might be .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 8]: `` I dare say you are right !
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 13]: I will think what ought to be done about that cup ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 11]: He stopped , self amazed : he had committed himself !
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 9]: -- as much as confessed the cup genuine !
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 16]: But Dawtie had not been deceived , and had not been thinking about the cup .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 73]: Only it was plain that , if he would consent to part with it for its money-worth , that would be a grand beginning toward the renouncing of dead _ things _ altogether , toward the turning to the living One the love that now gathered , clinging and haunting , about gold cups and graved armor , and suchlike vapors and vanishings , that pass with the sunsets and the snows .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 40]: She fell on her knees , and , in the spirit of a child and of the apostle of the Gentiles , cried , laying her little red hands together and uplifting them to her master in purest entreaty .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 26]: `` Oh , laird , laird , ye 've been gude and kin ' to me , and I lo'e ye , the Lord kens !
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 57]: I pray ye for Christ 's sake be reconciled to God , for ye hae been servin ' Mammon and no Him , and ye hae jist said we canna serve the twa , and what ` ill come o ' ' t God only can tell , but it _ maun _ be misery ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 4]: Words failed her .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 15]: She rose , and left the room , with her apron to her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 25]: The laird stood a moment or two like one lost , then went hurriedly into his `` closet , '' and shut the door .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 29]: Whether he went on his knees to God as did Dawtie to Him , or began again to gloat over his Cellini goblet , I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 15]: Dawtie cried herself to sleep , and came down in the morning very pale .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 23]: Her duty had left her exhausted , and with a kind of nausea toward all the ornaments and books in the house .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 11]: A cock crew loud under the window of the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 13]: She dropped on her knees , said `` Father of lights ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 13]: not a word beside , rose and began to rouse the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 32]: When breakfast-time came , and the laird appeared , he looked much as usual , only a little weary , which his daughter set down to his journey the day before .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 23]: He revived , however , as soon as he had succeeded in satisfying himself that Alexa knew nothing of what had passed .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 43]: How staid , discreet , and compact of common sense Alexa seemed to him beside Dawtie , whose want of education left her mind a waste swamp for the vagaries of whatever will-o ' - the-wisp an overstrained religious fantasy might generate !
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 31]: But however much the laird might look the same as before , he could never , knowing that Dawtie knew what she knew , be again as he had been .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 27]: `` You 'll do a few of the books to-day , wo n't you , Dawtie , '' he said , `` when you have time ?
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 9]: I never thought I should trust any one !
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 15]: I would sooner have old Meg shave me than let her dust an Elzevir !
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 3]: ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 14]: Dawtie was glad that at least he left the door open between them .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 18]: She said she would do a little dusting in the afternoon , and would be very careful .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 31]: Then the laird rose and went out , and Dawtie perceived , with a shoot of compassion mingled with mild remorse , that he had left his breakfast almost untasted .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 28]: But after that , so far from ever beginning any sort of conversation with her , he seemed uncomfortable the moment they happened to be alone together .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 55]: If he caught her eye , he would say -- hurriedly , and as if acknowledging a secret between them , `` By and by , Dawtie ; '' or , `` I 'm thinking about the business , Dawtie ; '' or , `` I 'm making up my mind , Dawtie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 5]: and so leave her .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 18]: On one occasion he said , `` Perhaps you will be surprised some day , Dawtie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 16]: On her part Dawtie never felt that she had anything more to say to him .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 27]: She feared at times that she had done him evil rather than good by pressing upon him a duty she had not persuaded him to perform .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 42]: She spoke of this fear to Andrew , but he answered decisively : `` If you believed you ought to speak to him , and have discovered in yourself no wrong motive , you must not trouble yourself about the result .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 9]: That may be a thousand years off yet .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 21]: You may have sent him into a hotter purgatory , and at the same time made it shorter for him .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 10]: We know nothing but that God is righteous . ''
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 11]: Dawtie was comforted , and things went on as before .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 25]: Where people know their work and do it , life has few blank spaces for ennui , and they are seldom to be pitied .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 23]: Where people have not yet found their work , they may be more to be pitied than those that beg their bread .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 24]: When a man knows his work and will not do it , pity him more than one who is to be hanged to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIX .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 4]: ANDREW AND ALEXA .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 39]: Andrew had occasion to call on the laird to pay his father 's rent , and Alexa , who had not seen him for some time , thought him improved both in carriage and speech , and wondered .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 30]: She did not take into account his intercourse with God , as with highest human minds , and his constant wakefulness to carry into action what things he learned .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 34]: Thus trained in noblest fashions of freedom , it was small wonder that his bearing and manners , the natural outcome and expression of his habits of being , should grow in liberty .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 10]: There was in them the change only of development .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 27]: By the side of such education as this , dealing with reality and inborn dignity , what mattered any amount of ignorance as to social custom !
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 43]: Society may judge its own ; this man was not of it , and as much surpassed its most accomplished pupils in all the essentials of breeding , as the apostle Paul was a better gentleman than Mr. Nash or Mr. Brummel .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 11]: The training may be slow , but it is perfect .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 12]: To him who has yielded self , all things are possible .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 7]: Andrew was aware of no difference .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 11]: He seemed to himself the same as when a boy .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 24]: Alexa had not again alluded to his brother 's letter concerning George Crawford , fearing he might say what she would find unpleasant .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 32]: But now she wanted to get a definite opinion from him in regard to certain modes of money-making , which had naturally of late occupied a good deal of her thought .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 17]: `` What is your notion concerning money-lending -- I mean at interest , Mr. Ingram ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 17]: `` I hear it is objected to nowadays by some that set up for teachers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 19]: `` It is by no means the first time in the world 's history , '' answered Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 15]: `` I want to know what you think of it , Mr. Ingram ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 24]: `` I know little , '' replied Andrew , `` of any matter with which I have not had to deal practically . ''
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 22]: `` But ought not one to have his ideas ready for the time when we will have to deal practically ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 3]: said Alexa .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 32]: `` Mine would be pretty sure to be wrong , '' answered Andrew ; `` and there is no time to spend in gathering wrong ideas and then changing them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 15]: `` On the contrary , they would be less warped by personal interest . ''
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 18]: `` Could circumstances arise in which it would not be my first interest to be honest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 3]: said Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 14]: `` Would not my judgment be quickened by the compulsion and the danger ?
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 20]: In no danger myself , might I not judge too leniently of things from which I should myself recoil ?
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 42]: Selfishly smoother with regard to others , because less anxious about their honesty than my own , might I not yield them what , were I in the case , I should see at once I dared not allow to myself ?
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 26]: I can perceive no use in making up my mind how to act in circumstances in which I am not -- probably will never be .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 37]: I have enough to occupy me where I find myself , and should certainly be oftener in doubt how to act , if I had bothered my brains how to think in circumstances foreign to me .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 30]: In such thinking , duty is of necessity a comparatively feeble factor , being only duty imagined , not live duty , and the result is the more questionable .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 37]: The Lord instructed His apostles not to be anxious what they should say when they were brought before rulers and kings : I will leave the question of duty alone until action is demanded of me .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 27]: In the meantime I will do the duty now required of me , which is the only preparation for the duty that is to come . ''
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 70]: Although Alexa had not begun to understand Andrew , she had sense enough and righteousness enough to feel that he was somehow ahead of her , and that it was not likely he and George Crawford would be of one mind in the matter that occupied her , so different were their ways of looking at things -- so different indeed the things themselves they thought worth looking at .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 24]: She was silent for a moment , then said : `` You can at least tell me what you think of gambling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 19]: `` I think it is the meanest mode of gaining or losing money a man could find . ''
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 8]: `` Why do you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 18]: `` Because he desires only to gain , and can gain only by his neighbor 's loss .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 15]: One of the two must be the worse for his transaction with the other .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 11]: Each _ must _ wish ill to his neighbor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 11]: `` But the risk was agreed upon between them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 8]: `` True -- but in what hope ?
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 22]: Was it not , on the part of each , that he would be the gainer and the other the loser ?
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 14]: There is no common cause , nothing but pure opposition of interest . ''
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 17]: `` Are there not many things in which one must gain and the other lose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 37]: `` There are many things in which one gains and the other loses ; but if it is essential to any transaction that only one side shall gain , the thing is not of God . ''
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 11]: `` What do you think of trading in stocks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 16]: `` I do not know enough about it to have a right to speak . ''
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 8]: `` You can give your impression ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 12]: `` I will not give what I do not value . ''
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 25]: `` Suppose , then , you heard of a man who had made his money so , how would you behave to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 9]: `` I would not seek his acquaintance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 7]: `` If he sought yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 14]: `` It would be time to ask how he had made his money .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 8]: Then it would be my business . ''
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 9]: `` What would make it your business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 7]: `` That he sought my acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 26]: It would then be necessary to know something about him , and the readiest question would be -- how he had made his money ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 7]: Alexa was silent for some time .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 10]: `` Do you think God cares about everything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 5]: she said at length .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 13]: `` Everything , '' answered Andrew , and she said no more .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 8]: Andrew avoided the discussion of moral questions .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 16]: He regarded the thing as _ vermiculate _ , and ready to corrupt the obedience .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 28]: `` When you have a thing to do , '' he would say , `` you will do it right in proportion to your love of right .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 41]: But do the right , and you will love the right ; for by doing it you will see it in a measure as it is , and no one can see the truth as it is without loving it .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 36]: The more you _ talk _ about what is right , or even about the doing of it , the more you are in danger of exemplifying how loosely theory may be allied to practice .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 8]: Talk without action saps the very will .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 19]: Something you have to do is waiting undone all the time , and getting more and more undone .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 10]: The only refuge is _ to do _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 34]: To know the thing he ought to do was a matter of import , to do the thing he knew he ought to do was a matter of life and death to Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 29]: He never allowed even a cognate question to force itself upon him until he had attended to the thing that demanded doing : it was merest common sense !
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 27]: Alexa had in a manner got over her uneasiness at the report of how George was making his money , and their correspondence was not interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 64]: But something , perhaps a movement from the world of spirit coming like the wind , had given her one of those motions to betterment , which , however occasioned , are the throb of the divine pulse in our life , the call of the Father , the pull of home , and the guide thither to such as will obey them .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 22]: She had in consequence again become doubtful about Crawford , and as to whether she was right in corresponding with him .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 32]: This led to her talk with Andrew , which , while it made her think less of his intellect , influenced her in a way she neither understood nor even recognized .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 28]: There are two ways in which one nature may influence another for betterment -- the one by strengthening the will , the other by heightening the ideal .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 18]: Andrew , without even her suspicion of the fact , wrought in the latter way upon Alexa .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 5]: She grew more uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 12]: George was coming home : how was she to receive him ?
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 28]: Nowise bound , they were on terms of intimacy : was she to encourage the procession of that intimacy , or to ward attempt at nearer approach ?
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 3]: CHAPTER XX .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 4]: GEORGE AND ANDREW .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 11]: George returned , and made an early appearance at Potlurg .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 7]: Dawtie met him in the court .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 12]: She did not know him , but involuntarily shrunk from him .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 3]: He frowned .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 38]: There was a natural repugnance between them ; the one was simple , the other double ; the one was pure , the other selfish ; the one loved her neighbor , the other preyed upon his .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 13]: George was a little louder , and his manners were more studied .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 5]: Alexa felt him overblown .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 7]: He was floridly at his ease .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 22]: What little `` atmosphere '' there had been about him was gone , and its place taken by a colored fog .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 17]: His dress was unobjectionable , and yet attracted notice ; perhaps it was only too considered .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 9]: Alexa was disappointed , and a little relieved .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 13]: He looked older , yet not more manly -- and rather fat .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 24]: He had more of the confidence women dislike to see a man without , than was quite pleasant even to the confident Alexa .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 33]: His speech was not a little infected with the nasality -- as easy to catch as hard to get rid of -- which I presume the Puritans carried from England to America .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 13]: On the whole , George was less interesting than Alexa had expected .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 23]: He came to her as if he would embrace her , but an instinctive movement on her part sufficed to check him .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 18]: She threw an additional heartiness into her welcome , and kept him at arm 's - length .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 18]: She felt as if she had lost an old friend , and not gained a new one .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 18]: He made himself very agreeable , but that he made himself so , made him less so .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 20]: There was more than these changes at work in her ; there was still the underlying doubt concerning him .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 48]: Although not yet a live soul , she had strong if vague ideas about right and wrong ; and although she sought many things a good deal more than righteousness , I do not see what temptation would at once have turned her from its known paths .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 32]: At the same time I do not see what she had yet , more than hundreds of thousands of well-meaning women , to secure her from slow decay and final ruin .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 32]: They laughed and talked together very _ like _ the way they used , but `` every like is not the same , '' and they knew there was a difference .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 18]: George was stung by the sense of it -- too much to show that he was vexed .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 39]: He laid himself out to be the more pleasing , as if determined to make her feel what he was worth -- as the man , namely , whom he imagined himself , and valued himself on being .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 39]: It is an argument for God , to see what fools those make of themselves who , believing there is a God , do not believe _ in _ Him -- children who do not know the Father .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 11]: Such make up the mass of church and chapel goers .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 21]: Let an earthquake or the small-pox break loose among them , and they will show what sort their religion is .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 59]: George had got rid of the folly of believing in the existence of a God , either interested in human affairs or careless of them , and naturally found himself more comfortable in consequence ; for he never had believed _ in _ God , and it is awkward to believe and not believe at the same moment .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 49]: What he had called his _ beliefs _ were as worthy of the name as those of most people , but whether he was better or worse without them hardly interests me , and my philanthropy will scarce serve to make me glad that he was more comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 34]: As they talked , old times came up , and they drew a little nearer , until at last a gentle spring of rose-colored interest began a feeble flow in Alexa 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 37]: When George took his leave , which he did soon , with the wisdom of one who feared to bore , she went with him to the court , where the gardener was holding his horse .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 20]: Beside them stood Andrew , talking to the old man , and admiring the beautiful animal in his charge .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 18]: `` The life of the Creator has run free through every channel up to this creature ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 8]: he was saying as they came near .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 5]: `` What rot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 25]: said George to himself , but to Alexa he said : `` Here 's my old friend , the farmer , I declare ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 14]: then to Andrew : `` How do you do , Mr. Ingram ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 20]: George never forgot a man 's name , and went in consequence for a better fellow than he was .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 13]: One may remember for reasons that have little to do with good-fellowship .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 9]: He spoke as if they were old friends .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 12]: `` You seem to like the look of the beast ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 15]: he said : `` you ought to know what 's what in horses ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 16]: `` He is one of the finest horses I ever saw , '' answered Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 10]: `` The man who owns him is fortunate . ''
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 10]: `` He ought to be a good one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 3]: said George .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 13]: `` I gave a hundred and fifty guineas for him yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 19]: Andrew could not help vaguely reflecting what kind of money had bought him , if Sandy was right .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 7]: Alexa was pleased to see Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 7]: He made her feel more comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 9]: His presence seemed to protect her a little .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 29]: `` May I ask you , Mr. Ingram , '' she said , `` to repeat what you were saying about the horse as we came up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 41]: `` I was saying , '' answered Andrew , `` that , to any one who understands a horse it is clear that the power of God must have flowed unobstructed through many generations to fashion such a perfection . ''
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 10]: you indorse the development theory -- do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 3]: said George .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 11]: `` I should hardly have expected that of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 28]: `` I do not think it has anything to do with what I said ; no one disputes that this horse comes of many generations of horses .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 27]: The development theory , if I understand aright , concerns itself with how his first ancestor in his own kind came to be a horse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 22]: `` And about that there can be no doubt in the mind of any one who believes in the Bible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 3]: said George .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 34]: `` God makes beautiful horses , '' returned Andrew ; `` whether He takes the one way or the other to make them , I am sure He takes the right way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 15]: `` You imply it is of little consequence what you believe about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 13]: `` If I had to make them it would be of consequence .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 25]: But what I think of consequence to us is -- that He makes them , not out of nothing , but out of Himself .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 37]: Why should my poor notion of God 's _ how _ be of importance , so long as , when I see a horse like yours , Mr. Crawford , I say , God be praised ?
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 36]: It is of eternal importance to love the animal , and see in him the beauty of the Lord ; it is of none to fancy I know which way God took to make him .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 62]: Not having in me the power or the stuff to make a horse , I can not know how God made the horse ; I can know him to be beautiful '' `` But , '' said George , `` the first horse was a very common-looking domestic animal , which they kept to eat -- nothing like this one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 22]: `` Then you think God made the first horse , and after that the horses made themselves , '' said Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 11]: Alexa laughed ; George said nothing ; Andrew went on .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 109]: `` But , '' he said , `` if we have come up from the lower animals , through a million of kinds , perhaps -- against which theory I have nothing to urge -- then I am more than prepared to believe that the man who does not do the part of a man will have to go down again , through all the stages of his being , to a position beyond the lowest forms of the powers he has misused , and there begin to rise once more , haunted perhaps with dim hints of the world of humanity left so far above him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 3]: `` Bah !
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 7]: What 's the use of bothering !
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 3]: Rubbish ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 7]: cried George , with rude jollity .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 17]: `` You know as well as I do , Mr. Ingram , it 's all bosh !
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 36]: Things will go on as they 're doing , and as they have been doing , till now from all eternity -- so far as we know , and that 's enough for us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 16]: `` They will not go on so for long in our sight , Mr. Crawford .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 12]: The worms will have a word to say with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 4]: Alexa turned away .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 24]: `` You 've not given up preaching and taken to the practical yet , Mr. Ingram , I see , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 3]: Andrew laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 15]: `` I flatter myself I have not ceased to be practical , Mr. Crawford .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 40]: You are busy with what you see , and I am busy as well with what I do n't see ; but all the time I believe my farm is in as good a state as your books . ''
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 23]: George gave a start , and stole a look at the young farmer , but was satisfied he `` meant nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 31]: The self-seeker will walk into the very abyss protesting himself a practical man , and counting him unpractical who will not with him `` jump the life to come . ''
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 12]: Himself , he neither measures the width nor questions his muscle .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXI .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 5]: WHAT IS IT WORTH ?
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 36]: Andrew , with all his hard work , harder since Sandy went , continued able to write , for he neither sought company nor drank strong drink , and was the sport of no passion .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 27]: From threatened inroad he appealed to Him who created to lift His child above the torrent , and make impulse the slave of conscience and manhood .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 11]: There were no demons riding the whirlwinds of his soul .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 27]: It is not wonderful then that he should be able to write a book , or that the book should be of genuine and original worth .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 33]: It had the fortune to be `` favorably '' reviewed , scarce one of those who reviewed it understanding it , while all of them seemed to themselves to understand it perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 29]: I mention the thing because , had the book not been thus reviewed , Alexa would not have bought a copy , or been able to admire it .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 56]: The review she read was in a paper whose editor would not have admitted it had he suspected the drift which the reviewer had failed to see ; and the passages quoted appealed to Alexa in virtue , partly , of her not seeing half they involved , or anything whatever of the said drift .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 45]: But because he had got a book published , and because she approved of certain lines , phrases and passages in it ; but chiefly because it had been praised by more than one influential paper , Andrew rose immensely in Alexa 's opinion .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 55]: Although he was the son of a tenant , was even a laborer on his farm , and had covered a birth no higher than that of Jesus Christ with the gown of no university , she began , against her own sense of what was fit , to look up to the plow-man .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 17]: The plow-man was not aware of this , and would have been careless had he been .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 39]: He respected his landlord 's daughter , not ever questioned her superiority as a lady where he made no claim to being a gentleman , but he recognized in her no power either to help or to hurt .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 28]: When they next met , Alexa was no longer indifferent to his presence , and even made a movement in the direction of being agreeable to him .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 91]: She dropped in a measure , without knowing she had ever used it , her patronizing carriage , but had the assurance to compliment him not merely on the poem he had written , but on the way it had been received ; she could not have credited , had he told her , that he was as indifferent to the praise or blame of what is called the public , as if that public were indeed -- what it is most like -- a boy just learning to read .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 20]: Yet it is the consent of such a public that makes the very essence of what is called fame .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 44]: How should a man care for it who knows that he is on his way to join his peers , to be a child with the great ones of the earth , the lovers of the truth , the Doers of the Will .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 40]: What to him will be the wind of the world he has left behind , a wind that can not arouse the dead , that can only blow about the grave-clothes of the dead as they bury their dead .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 38]: `` Live , Dawtie , '' said Andrew to the girl , `` and ane day ye 'll hae yer hert 's desire ; for ` Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 40]: Andrew was neither annoyed nor gratified with the compliments Alexa paid him , for she did not know the informing power of the book -- what he cared for in it -- the thing that made him write it .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 39]: But her gentleness and kindness did please him ; he was glad to feel a little at home with her , glad to draw a little nearer to one who had never been other than good to him .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 14]: And then was she not more than kind , even loving to Dawtie ?
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 39]: `` So , Andrew , you are a poet at last , '' she said , holding out her hand to him , which Andrew received in a palm that wrote the better verse that it was horny .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 14]: `` Please to remember I was the first that found you out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 3]: she added .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 12]: `` I think it was my mother , '' answered Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 15]: `` And I would have helped you if you would have let me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 27]: `` It is not well , ma'am , to push the bird off because he ca n't sit safe on the edge of the nest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 20]: `` Perhaps you are right A failure then would have stood in the way of your coming fame . ''
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 20]: `` Oh , for that , ma'am , believe me , I do not care a short straw . ''
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 9]: `` What do you not care for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 5]: `` For fame . ''
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 7]: `` That is wrong , Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 12]: We ought to care what our neighbors think of us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 23]: `` My neighbors did not set me to do the work , and I did not seek their praise in doing it .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 13]: Their friendship I prize dearly -- more than tongue can tell . ''
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 22]: `` You can not surely be so conceited , Andrew , as to think nobody capable of judging your work . ''
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 7]: `` Far from it , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 18]: But you were speaking of fame , and that does not come from any wise judgment . ''
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 15]: `` Then what do you write for , if you care nothing for fame ?
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 11]: I thought that was what all poets wrote for . ''
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 16]: `` So the world thinks ; and those that do sometimes have their reward . ''
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 10]: `` Tell me then what you write for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 16]: `` I write because I want to tell something that makes me glad and strong .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 13]: I want to say it , and so try to say it .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 27]: Things come to me in gleams and flashes , sometimes in words themselves , and I want to weave them into a melodious , harmonious whole .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 17]: I was once at an oratorio , and that taught me the shape of a poem .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 86]: In a pause of the music , I seemed all at once to see Handel 's heavy countenance looking out of his great wig , as he sat putting together his notes , ordering about in his mind , and fixing in their places with his pen , his drums , and pipes , and fiddles , and roaring bass , and flageolets , and hautboys -- all to open the door for the thing that was plaguing him with the confusion of its beauty .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 51]: For I suppose even Handel did not hear it all clear and plain at first , but had to build his orchestra into a mental organ for his mind to let itself out by , through the many music holes , lest it should burst with its repressed harmonic delights .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 33]: He must have felt an agonized need to set the haunting angels of sound in obedient order and range , responsive to the soul of the thing , its one ruling idea !
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 30]: I saw him with his white rapt face , looking like a prophet of the living God sent to speak out of the heart of the mystery of truth !
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 37]: I saw him as he sat staring at the paper before him , scratched all over as with the fury of a holy anger at his own impotence , and his soul communed with heavenliest harmonies !
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 18]: Ma'am , will any man persuade me that Handel at such a moment was athirst for fame ?
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 28]: or that the desire to please a house full or world full of such as heard his oratorios , gave him the power to write his music ?
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 4]: No , ma'am !
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 28]: he was filled , not with the longing for sympathy , and not even with the good desire to give delight , but with the music itself .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 56]: It was crying in him to get out , and he heard it crying , and could not rest till he had let it out ; and every note that dropped from his pen was a chip struck from the granite wall between the song-birds in their prison-nest , and the air of their liberty .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 7]: Creation is God 's self-wrought freedom .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 26]: No , ma'am , I do not despise my fellows , but neither do I prize the judgment of more than a few of them .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 12]: I prize and love themselves , but not their opinion . ''
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 10]: Alexa was silent , and Andrew took his leave .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 7]: She sat still for awhile thinking .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 25]: If she did not understand , at least she remembered Andrew 's face as he talked : could presumption make his face shine so ?
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 8]: could presumption make him so forget himself ?
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXII .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 6]: THE GAMBLER AND THE COLLECTOR .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 6]: Things went swimmingly with George .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 21]: He had weathered a crisis , and was now full of confidence , as well as the show of it .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 19]: That he held himself a man who could do what he pleased , was plain to every one .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 24]: His prosperity leaned upon that of certain princes of the power of money in America : gleaning after them he found his fortune .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 12]: But he did not find much increase of favor with Alexa .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 8]: Her spiritual tastes were growing more refined .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 21]: There was something about the man , and that not new , which she could no longer contemplate without dissatisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 45]: It cost her tears at night to think that , although her lover had degenerated , he had remained true to her , for she saw plainly that it was only lack of encouragement that prevented him from asking her to be his wife .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 20]: She must _ appear _ changeable , but this was not the man she had been ready to love !
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 16]: the plant had put forth a flower that was not in sequence with the leaf .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 24]: The cause of his appearing different might lie in herself , but in any case he was not the gentleman she had thought !
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 35]: Had she loved him , she would have stood by him bravely , but now she could not help recalling the disgrace of the father , and shrunk from sharing it with the son .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 14]: Would it be any wonder if the son himself proved less than honorable ?
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 27]: She would have broken with him quite but for one thing : he had become intimate with her father , and the laird enjoyed his company .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 20]: George had a large straggling acquaintance with things , and could readily appear to know more than he did .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 25]: He was , besides , that most agreeable person to a man with a hobby , a good listener -- when he saw reason .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 75]: He made himself so pleasant that the laird was not only always glad to see him , but would often ask him to stay to supper , when he would fish up from the wine-cellar he had inherited a bottle with a history and a character , and the two would pass the evening together , Alexa trying not to wish him away , for was not her poor old father happy with him !
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 69]: Though without much pleasure of his own in such things , George , moved by the reflection of the laird 's interest , even began to _ collect _ a little , mainly in the hope of picking up what might gratify the laird ; nor , if he came upon a thing he _ must _ covet , would hesitate to spend on it a good sum .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 30]: Naturally the old man grew to regard him as a son of the best sort , one who would do anything to please his father and indulge his tastes .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 31]: It may seem surprising that such a man as George should have remained so true ; but he had a bull-dog tenacity of purpose , as indeed his money-making indicated .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 24]: Then there was good in him to the measure of admiring a woman like Alexa , though not of admiring a far better .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 67]: He saw himself in danger of losing her ; concluded influences at work to the frustration of his own ; surmised that she doubted the character of his business ; feared the clownish farmer-poet might have dazzled with his new reputation her womanly judgment ; and felt himself called upon to make good his position against any and every prejudice she might have conceived against him !
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 5]: He would yield nothing !
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 16]: If he was foiled he was foiled , but it should not be his fault !
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 22]: His own phrase was , that he would not throw up the sponge so long as he could come up grinning .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 80]: He had occasional twinges of discomfort , for his conscience , although seared indeed , was not seared as with the hottest iron , seeing he had never looked straight at any truth : it would ease those twinges , he vaguely imagined , so to satisfy a good woman like Alexa , that she made common cause with him , accepting not merely himself , but the money of which he had at such times a slight loathing .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 29]: Then Alexa was handsome -- he thought her _ very _ handsome , and , true to Mammon , he would gladly be true also to something better .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 20]: There _ might be _ another camp , and it would be well to have friends in that too !
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 11]: So unlike Andrew , how could he but dislike him !
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 8]: and his dislike jealousy fostered into hatred .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 23]: Cowed before him , like Macbeth before Banquo , because he was an honest man , how could he but hate him !
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 44]: He called him , and thought him a canting , sneaking fellow -- which he was , if canting consist in giving God His own , and sneaking consist in fearing no man -- in fearing nothing , indeed , but doing wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 14]: How could George consent even to the far-off existence of such a man !
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 10]: The laird also had taken a dislike to him .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 18]: From the night when Dawtie made her appeal , he had not known an hour 's peace .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 38]: It was not that it had waked his conscience , though it had made it sleep a little less soundly ; it was only that he feared she might take further action in regard to the cup .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 50]: She seemed to him to be taking part with the owner of the cup against him ; he could not see that she was taking part with himself against the devil ; that it was not the cup she was anxious about , but the life of her master .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 14]: What if she should acquaint the earl 's lawyer with all she knew !
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 8]: He would be dragged into public daylight !
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 12]: He could not pretend ignorance concerning the identity of the chalice !
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 26]: that would be to be no antiquarian , while Dawtie would bear witness that he had in his possession a book telling all about it !
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 12]: But the girl would never of herself have turned against him !
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 24]: It was all that fellow Ingram , with his overstrained and absurd notions as to what God required of His poor sinful creatures !
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 8]: He did not believe in the atonement !
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 16]: He did not believe that Christ had given satisfaction to the Father for our sins !
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 17]: He demanded in the name of religion more than any properly educated and authorized minister would !
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 13]: and in his meddlesomeness had worried Dawtie into doing as she did !
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 18]: The girl was a good and modest girl , and would never of herself have so acted !
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 22]: Andrew was righteous overmuch , therefore eaten up with self-conceit , and the notion of pleasing God more than other men !
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 19]: He cherished old grudges against him , and would be delighted to bring his old school-master to shame !
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 26]: He was not a bad boy at school ; he had always liked him ; the change in him witnessed to the peril of extremes !
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 17]: Here they had led to spiritual pride , which was the worst of all the sins !
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 15]: The favorite of heaven could have no respect for the opinion of his betters !
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 17]: The man was bent on returning evil for all the good he had done the boy !
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 10]: It was a happy thing young Crawford understood him !
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 14]: He would be his friend , and defeat the machinations of his enemy !
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 17]: If only the fellow 's lease were out , that he might get rid of him !
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 26]: Moved by George 's sympathy with his tastes , he drew nearer and nearer to disclosing the possession which was the pride of his life .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 34]: The enjoyment , of connoisseur or collector rests much on the glory of possession -- of having what another has not , or , better still , what no other can possibly have .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 81]: From what he had long ago seen on the night of the storm , and now from the way the old man hinted , and talked , and broke off ; also from the uneasiness he sometimes manifested , George had guessed that there was something over whose possession he gloated , but for whose presence among his treasures he could not comfortably account He therefore set himself , without asking a single question , to make the laird unbosom .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 13]: A hold on the father would be a hold on the daughter !
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 44]: One day , in a pawnbroker 's shop , he lighted upon a rarity indeed , which might or might not have a history attributed to it , but was in itself more than interesting for the beauty of both material and workmanship .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 25]: The sum asked for it was large , but with the chance of pleasing the laird , it seemed to George but a trifle .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 18]: It was also , he judged , of intrinsic value to a great part of the price .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 30]: Had he been then aware of the passion of the old man for jewels in especial , he would have been yet more eager to secure it for him .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 34]: It was a watch , not very small , and by no means thin -- a repeater , whose bell was dulled by the stones of the mine in which it lay buried .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 16]: The case was one mass of gems of considerable size , and of every color .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 34]: Ruby , sapphire , and emerald were judiciously parted by diamonds of utmost purity , while yellow diamonds took the golden place for which the topaz had not been counted of sufficient value .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 19]: They were all crusted together as close as they could lie , the setting of them hardly showing .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 30]: The face was of fine opals , across which moved the two larger hands radiant with rubies , while the second-hand flitted flashing around , covered with tiny diamonds .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 16]: The numerals were in sapphires , within a bordering ring of emeralds and black pearls .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 10]: The jewel was a splendor of color and light .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 26]: George , without preface , took it from his pocket , held it a moment in the sunlight , and handed it to the laird .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 5]: He glowered at it .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 13]: He saw an angel from heaven in a thing compact of earth-chips !
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 50]: As near as any _ thing _ can be loved of a live soul , the laird loved a fine stone ; what in it he loved most , the color , the light , the shape , the value , the mystery , he could not have told !
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 11]: -- and here was a jewel of many fine stones !
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 10]: With both hands he pressed it to his bosom .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 32]: Then he looked at it in the sun , then went into the shadow of the house , for they were in the open air , and looked at it again .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 19]: Suddenly he thrust it into his pocket , and hurried , followed by George , to his study .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 22]: There he closed the shutters , lighted a lamp , and gazed at the marvel , turning it in all directions .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 18]: At length he laid it on the table , and sunk with a sigh into a chair .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 26]: George understood the sigh , and dug its source deeper by telling him , as he had heard it , the story of the jewel .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 13]: `` It may be true , '' he said as he ended .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 13]: `` I remember seeing some time ago a description of the toy .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 11]: I think I could lay my hand on it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 14]: `` Would you mind leaving it with me till you come again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 4]: faltered the laird .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 27]: He knew he could not buy it : he had not the money ; but he would gladly dally with the notion of being its possessor .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 30]: To part with it , the moment after having held it in his hand and gloated over it for the first time , would be too keen a pain !
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 12]: It was unreasonable to have to part with it at all !
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 9]: He _ ought _ to be its owner !
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 14]: Who could be such an owner to a thing like that as he !
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 12]: It was a wrong to him that it was not his !
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 18]: Next to his cup , it was the most precious thing he had ever wished to possess !
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 14]: -- a thing for a man to take to the grave with him !
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 15]: Was there no way of carrying _ any _ treasure to the other world ?
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 21]: He would have sold of his land to secure the miracle , but , alas , it was all entailed !
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 28]: For a moment the Cellini chalice seemed of less account , and he felt ready to throw open the window of his treasure-room and pitch everything out .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 29]: The demon of _ having _ is as imperious and as capricious as that of drink , and there is no refuge from it but with the Father .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 10]: `` This kind goeth not out by prayer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 14]: The poor slave uttered , not a sigh now , but a groan .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 40]: `` You 'll tell the man , '' he said , thinking George had borrowed the thing to show him , `` that I did not even ask the price : I know I can not buy it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 9]: `` Perhaps he would give you credit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 7]: suggested George , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 9]: I will have nothing to do with credit !
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 12]: I should not be able to call it my own ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 8]: -- Money-honesty was strong in the laird .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 54]: `` But , '' he continued , `` do try and persuade him to let me have it for a day or two -- that I may get its beauty by heart , and think of it all the days , and dream of it all the nights of my life after ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 13]: `` There will be no difficulty about that , '' answered George .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 18]: `` The owner will be delighted to let you keep it as long as you wish ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 8]: `` I would it were so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 6]: `` It is so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 26]: `` You do n't mean to say , George , that that queen of jewels is yours , and you will lend it me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 21]: `` The thing is mine , but I will not lend it -- not even to you , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 6]: `` I do n't wonder !
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 6]: -- I do n't wonder !
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 7]: But it is a great disappointment !
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 23]: I was beginning to hope I -- I -- might have the loan of it for a week or two even ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 11]: `` You should indeed if the thing were mine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 18]: said George , playing him ; `` but -- '' `` Oh , I beg your pardon !
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 9]: I thought you said it was yours ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 16]: `` So it was when I brought it , but it is mine no longer .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 4]: It is yours .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 9]: I purchased it for you this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 6]: The old man was speechless .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 15]: He rose , and seizing George by both hands , stood staring at him .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 13]: Something very like tears gathered within the reddened rims of his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 27]: He had grown paler and feebler of late , ever in vain devising to secure possession of the cup -- possession moral as well as legal .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 16]: But this entrancing gift brought with it strength and hope in regard to the chalice !
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 10]: `` To him that hath shall be given ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 6]: quoted the Mammon within him .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 4]: `` George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 17]: he said , with a moan of ecstasy , `` you are my good angel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 5]: and sat down exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 19]: The watch was the key to his `` closet , '' as he persisted in calling his treasury .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 118]: In old times not a few houses in Scotland held a certain tiny room , built for the head of the family , to be his closet for prayer : it was , I believe , with the notion of such a room in his head , that the laird had called his museum his closet ; and he was more right than he meant to be ; for in that chamber he did his truest worship -- truest as to the love in it , falsest as to its object ; for there he worshiped the god vilest bred of all the gods , bred namely of man 's distrust in the Life of the universe .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 29]: And now here also were two met together to worship ; for from this time the laird , disclosing his secret , made George free of his sanctuary .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 15]: George was by this time able to take a genuine interest in the collection .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 35]: But he was much amused , sometimes annoyed , with the behavior of the laird in his closet : he was more nervous and touchy over his things than a she-bear over her cubs .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 44]: Of all dangers to his darlings he thought a woman the worst , and had therefore seized with avidity the chance of making that room a hidden one , the possibility of which he had spied almost the moment he first entered it .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 37]: He became , if possible , fonder of his things than ever , and flattered himself he had found in George a fellow-worshiper : George 's exaggerated or pretended appreciation enhanced his sense of their value .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 6]: CHAPTER XXIII ON THE MOOR .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 32]: Alexa had a strong shaggy pony , which she rode the oftener that George came so often ; taking care to be well gone before he arrived on his beautiful horse .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 23]: One lovely summer evening she had been across the moor a long way , and was returning as the sun went down .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 38]: A glory of red molten gold was shining in her face , so that she could see nothing in front of her , and was a little startled by a voice greeting her with a respectful good-evening .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 17]: The same moment she was alongside of the speaker in the blinding veil of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 16]: It was Andrew walking home from a village on the other side of the moor .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 9]: She drew rein , and they went together .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 11]: `` What has come to you , Mr. Ingram ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 15]: she said ; `` I hear you were at church last Sunday evening ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 10]: `` Why should I not be , ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 3]: asked Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 15]: `` For the reason that you are not in the way of going . ''
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 24]: `` There might be good reason for going once , or for going many times , and yet not for going always ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 8]: `` We wo n't begin with quarreling !
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 10]: There are things we shall not agree about ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 15]: `` Yes ; one or two -- for a time , I believe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 3]: returned Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 11]: `` What did you think of Mr. Rackstraw 's sermon ?
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 12]: I suppose you went to hear _ him _ . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 10]: `` Yes , ma'am -- at least partly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 16]: `` Will you tell me first whether you were satisfied with Mr. Rackstraw 's teaching ?
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 7]: I know you were there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 7]: `` I was quite satisfied . ''
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 14]: `` Then I do n't see reason for saying anything about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 16]: `` If I am wrong , you ought to try to set me right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 18]: `` The prophet Elisha would have done no good by throwing his salt into the running stream .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 13]: He cast it , you will remember , into the spring ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 8]: `` I do not understand you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 15]: `` There is no use in persuading a person to change an opinion . ''
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 14]: `` Because the man is neither the better nor the worse for it .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 40]: If you had told me you were distressed to hear a man in authority speak as Mr. Rackstraw spoke concerning a being you loved , I would have tried to comfort you by pointing out how false it was .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 25]: But if you are content to hear God so represented , why should I seek to convince you of what is valueless to you ?
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 13]: Why offer you to drink what your heart is not thirsting after ?
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 21]: Would you love God more because you found He was not what you were quite satisfied He should be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 11]: `` Do tell me more plainly what you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 6]: `` You must excuse me .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 7]: I have said all I will .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 9]: I can not reason in defense of God .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 22]: It seems blasphemy to argue that His nature is not such as no honorable man could love in another man . ''
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 9]: `` But if the Bible says so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 13]: `` If the Bible said so , the Bible would be false .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 9]: But the Bible does not say so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 13]: `` How is it then that it seems to say so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 16]: `` Because you were taught falsely about Him before you desired to know Him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 10]: `` But I am capable of judging now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 4]: Andrew was silent .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 6]: `` Am I not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 3]: insisted Alexa .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 9]: `` Do you desire to know God ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 3]: said Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 9]: `` I think I do know Him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 9]: `` And you think those things true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 15]: `` Then we are where we were , and I say no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 7]: `` You are not polite . ''
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 7]: `` I can not help it .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 13]: I must let you alone to believe about God what you can .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 14]: You will not be blamed for not believing what you can not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 18]: `` Do you mean that God never punishes any one for what He can not help ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 4]: `` Assuredly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 8]: `` How do you prove that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 9]: `` I will not attempt to prove it .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 46]: If you are content to think He does , if it do not trouble you that your God should be unjust , go on thinking so until you are made miserable by it , then I will pour out my heart to deliver you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 23]: She was struck , not with any truth in what he said , but with the evident truthfulness of the man himself .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 24]: Right or wrong , there was that about him -- a certain radiance of conviction -- which certainly was not about Mr. Rackstraw .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 49]: `` The things that can be shaken , '' said Andrew , as if thinking with himself , `` may last for a time , but they will at length be shaken to pieces , that the things which can not be shaken may show what they are .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 15]: Whatever we call religion will vanish when we see God face to face . ''
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 11]: For awhile they went brushing through the heather in silence .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 12]: `` May I ask you one question , Mr. Ingram ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 3]: said Alexa .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 5]: `` Surely , ma'am !
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 7]: Ask me anything you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 8]: `` And you will answer me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 13]: `` If I am at liberty to answer you I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 10]: `` What do you mean by being at liberty ?
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 7]: Are you under any vow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 9]: `` I am under the law of love .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 9]: I am bound to do nothing to hurt .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 14]: An answer that would do you no good I will not give . ''
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 15]: `` How do you know what will or will not do me good ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 10]: `` I must use what judgment I have . ''
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 18]: `` Is it true , then , that you believe God gives you whatever you ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 16]: `` I have never asked anything of Him that He did not give me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 14]: `` Would you mind telling me anything you have asked of Him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 23]: `` I have never yet required to ask anything not included in the prayer , ` Thy will be done . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 12]: `` That will be done without your praying for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 23]: `` Pardon me ; I do not believe it will be done , to all eternity , without my praying for it .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 12]: Where first am I accountable that His will should be done ?
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 6]: Is it not in myself ?
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 14]: How is His will to be done in me without my willing it ?
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 11]: Does He not want me to love what He loves ?
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 6]: -- to be like Himself ?
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 13]: -- to do His will with the glad effort of my will ?
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 11]: -- in a word , to will what He wills ?
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 18]: And when I find I can not , what am I to do but pray for help ?
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 9]: I pray , and He helps me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 9]: `` There is nothing strange in that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 12]: `` Surely not It seems to me the simplest common sense .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 31]: It is my business , the business of every man , that God 's will be done by his obedience to that will , the moment he knows it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 16]: `` I fancy you are not so different from other people as you think yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 9]: But they say you want to die . ''
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 9]: `` I want nothing but what God wants .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 5]: I desire righteousness . ''
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 10]: `` Then you accept the righteousness of Christ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 4]: `` Accept it !
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 6]: I long for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 12]: `` You know that it is not what I mean ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 14]: `` I seek first the kingdom of God and God 's righteousness . ''
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 6]: `` You avoid my question .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 13]: Do you accept the righteousness of Christ instead of your own ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 14]: `` I have no righteousness of my own to put it instead of .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 18]: The only righteousness there is is God 's , and He will make me righteous like Himself .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 26]: He is not content that His one Son only should be righteous ; He wants all His children to be righteous as He is righteous .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 13]: The thing is plain ; I will not argue about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 10]: `` You do not believe in the atonement . ''
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 7]: `` I believe in Jesus Christ .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 5]: He is the atonement .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 19]: What strength God has given me I will spend in knowing Him and doing what He tells me .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 17]: To interpret His plans before we know Himself is to mistake both Him and His plans .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 30]: I know this , that he has given His life for what multitudes who call themselves by His name would not rise from their seats to share in . ''
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 11]: `` You think me incapable of understanding the gospel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 29]: `` I think if you did understand the gospel of Christ you would be incapable of believing the things about His Father that you say you do believe .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 9]: But I will not say a word more .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 26]: When you are able to see the truth , you will see it ; and when you desire the truth you will be able . ''
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 8]: Alexa touched her pony with her whip .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 18]: But by and by she pulled him up , and made him walk till Andrew overtook her .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 26]: The sun was by this time far out of sight , the glow of the west was over , and twilight lay upon the world .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 9]: Its ethereal dimness had sunk into her soul .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 12]: `` Does the gloaming make you sad , Mr. Ingram ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 26]: `` It makes me very quiet , '' he answered -- `` as if all my people were asleep , and waiting for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 11]: `` Do you mean as if they were all dead ?
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 10]: How can you talk of it so quietly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 10]: `` Because I do not believe in death . ''
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 9]: `` What _ do _ you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 7]: `` I am a Christian ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 34]: `` I hope you are , Mr. Ingram , though , to be honest with you , some things make me doubt it Perhaps you would say I am not a Christian . ''
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 15]: `` It is enough that God knows whether you are a Christian or not .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 12]: Why should I say you are or you are not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 17]: `` But I want to know what you meant when you said you were a Christian .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 13]: How should that make you indifferent to the death of your friends ?
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 14]: Death is a dreadful thing , look at it how you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 18]: `` The Lord says , ` He that liveth and believeth in Me shall never die . '
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 63]: If my friends are not dead , but living and waiting for me , why should I wait for them in a fierce , stormy night , or a black frost , instead of the calm of such a sleeping day as this -- a day with the son hid , Shakespeare calls it '' `` How you do mix up things !
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 6]: Shakespeare and Jesus Christ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 20]: `` God mixed them first , and will mix them a good deal more yet , '' said Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 32]: But for the smile which would hover like a heavenly Psyche about his mouth , his way of answering would sometimes have seemed curt to those who did not understand him .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 49]: Instead of holding aloof in his superiority , however , as some thought he did when he would not answer , or answered abruptly , Andrew 's soul would be hovering , watching and hoping for a chance of lighting , and giving of the best he had .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 29]: He was like a great bird changing parts with a child -- the child afraid of the bird , and the bird enticing the child to be friends .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 30]: He had learned that if he poured out his treasure recklessly it might be received with dishonor , and but choke the way of the chariot of approaching truth .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 18]: `` Perhaps you will say next there is no such thing as suffering , '' resumed Alexa .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 17]: `` No ; the Lord said that in the world His friends should have tribulation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 14]: `` What tribulation have you , who are so specially His friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 82]: `` Not much yet It is a little , however , sometimes , to know such strong , and beautiful , and happy-making things , and all the time my people , my beloved humans , born of my Father in heaven , with the same heart for joy and sorrow , will not listen and be comforted , I think that was what made our Lord sorriest of all '' `` Mr. Ingram , I have no patience with you .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 19]: How dare you liken your trouble to that of our Lord -- making yourself equal with Him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 22]: `` Is it making myself equal with Him to say that I understand a little how He felt toward His fellow-men ?
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 20]: I am always trying to understand Him ; would it be a wonder if I did sometimes a little ?
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 15]: How is a man to do as He did , without understanding Him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 10]: `` Are you going to work miracles next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 12]: `` Jesus was always doing what God wanted Him to do .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 12]: That was what He came for , not to work miracles .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 24]: He could have worked a great many more if He had pleased , but He did no more than God wanted of Him .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 39]: Am I not to try to do the will of God , because He who died that I might , always succeeded however hard it was , and I am always failing and having to try again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 14]: `` And you think you will come to it in this life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 33]: `` I never think about that ; I only think about doing His will now -- not about doing it then -- that is , to-morrow or next day or next world .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 29]: I know only one life -- the life that is hid with Christ in God ; and that is the life by which I live here and now .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 11]: I do not make schemes of life ; I live .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 29]: Life will teach me God 's plans ; I will take no trouble about them ; I will only obey , and receive the bliss He sends me .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 19]: And of all things I will not make theories of God 's plans for other people to accept .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 28]: I will only do my best to destroy such theories as I find coming between some poor glooming heart , and the sun shining in his strength .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 30]: Those who love the shade of lies , let them walk in it until the shiver of the eternal cold drive them to seek the face of Jesus Christ .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 23]: To appeal to their intellect would be but to drive them the deeper into the shade to justify their being in it .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 24]: And if by argument you did persuade them out of it , they would but run into a deeper and worse darkness . ''
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 7]: `` How could that be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 31]: `` They would at once think that , by an intellectual stride they had advanced in the spiritual life , whereas they would be neither the better nor the worse .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 25]: I know a man , once among the foremost in denouncing the old theology , who is now no better than a swindler . ''
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 13]: `` You mean -- '' `` No one you know , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 12]: His intellectual freedom seems only to have served his spiritual subjugation .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 26]: Right opinion , except it spring from obedience to the truth , is but so much rubbish on the golden floor of the temple . ''
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 59]: The peace of the night and its luminous earnestness were gleaming on Andrew 's face , and Alexa , glancing up as he ceased , felt again the inroad of a sense of something in the man that was not in the other men she knew -- the spiritual shadow of a dweller in regions beyond her ken .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 12]: The man was before her , yet out of her sight !
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 126]: The whole thing was too simple for her , only a child could understand it Instead of listening to the elders and priests to learn how to save his soul , he cast away all care of himself , left that to God , and gave himself to do the will of Him from whose heart he came , even as the eternal Life , the Son of God , required of him ; in the mighty hope of becoming one mind , heart , soul , one eternal being , with Him , with the Father , with every good man , with the universe which was his inheritance -- walking in the world as Enoch walked with God , held by his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 60]: This is what man was and is meant to be , what man must become ; thither the wheels of time are roaring ; thither work all the silent potencies of the eternal world ; and they that will not awake and arise from the dead must be flung from their graves by the throes of a shivering world .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 11]: When he had done speaking Andrew stood and looked up .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 11]: A few stars were looking down through the limpid air .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 4]: Alexa rode on .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 57]: Andrew let her go , and walked after her alone , sure that her mind must one day open to the eternal fact that God is all in all , the perfect friend of His children ; yea , that He would cease to be God sooner than fail His child in his battle with death .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIV .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 3]: THE WOOER .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 45]: Alexa kept hoping that George would be satisfied she was not inclined toward him as she had been ; and that , instead of bringing the matter to open issue , he would continue to come and go as the friend of her father .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 25]: But George came to the conclusion that he ought to remain in doubt no longer , and one afternoon followed her into the garden .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 33]: She had gone there with a certain half-scientific , half-religious book in her hand , from which she was storing her mind with arguments against what she supposed the opinions of Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 16]: She had , however , little hope of his condescending to front them with counter-argument .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 37]: His voice returned ever to the ear of her mind in words like these : `` If you are content to think so , you are in no condition to receive what I have to communicate .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 13]: Why should I press water on a soul that is not thirsty ?
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 40]: Let us wait for the drought of the desert , when life is a low fever , and the heart is dry ; when the earth is like iron , and the heavens above it are as brass . ''
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 10]: She started at the sound of George 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 6]: `` What lovely weather ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 19]: Even lovers betake themselves to the weather as a medium -- the side of nature which all understand .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 18]: It was a good , old-fashioned , hot , heavy summer afternoon , one ill-chosen for love-making .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 4]: `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 31]: answered Alexa , with a point of interrogation subaudible , and held her book so that be might feel it on the point of being lifted again to eager eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 9]: But he was not more sensitive than sentimental .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 10]: `` Please put your book down for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 15]: I have not of late asked too much of your attention , Alexa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 10]: `` You have been very kind , George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 3]: she answered .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 11]: `` Kind is not asking much of your attention ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 28]: `` Yea -- that , and giving my father so much of yours , '' `` I certainly have seen more of him than of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 9]: returned George , hoping her words meant reproach .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 16]: `` But he has always been kind to me , and pleased to see me !
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 9]: You have not given me much encouragement ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 35]: To begin love-making with complaint is not wise , and George felt that he had got into the wrong track ; but Alexa took care that he should not get out of it easily .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 18]: Not being simple , he always settled the best course to pursue , and often went wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 18]: The man who cares only for what is true and right is saved much thinking and planning .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 11]: He generally sees but one way of doing a thing !
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 12]: `` I am glad to hear you say so , George !
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 7]: You have not mistaken me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 16]: `` You were not so sharp with me when I went away , Alexa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 10]: `` No ; then you were going away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 16]: `` Should you not show a fellow some kindness when he is come back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 14]: `` Not when he does not seem content with having come back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 7]: `` I do not understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 6]: But Alexa gave no explanation .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 16]: `` You would be kind to me again if I were going away again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 4]: `` Perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 15]: `` That is , if you were sure I was not coming back . ''
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 10]: `` I did not _ say _ so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 10]: `` I ca n't make it out , Alexa !
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 15]: I used to think there could never be any misunderstanding between you and me !
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 23]: But something has crept in between us , and for the life of me I do not know what it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 31]: `` There is one thing for which I am more obliged to you than I can tell , George -- that you did not say anything before you went . ''
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 16]: `` I am awfully sorry for it now ; but I thought you understood ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 20]: `` I did ; and I am very glad , for I should have repented it long ago ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 11]: This was hardly logical , but George seemed to understand .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 6]: `` You are cruel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 17]: `` I should have made it the business of my life that you never did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 34]: Yet George knew of things he dared not tell that had taken place almost as soon as he was relieved from the sustaining and restraining human pressure in which he had grown up !
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 11]: `` I am certain I should , '' persisted Alexa .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 8]: `` Why are you so certain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 14]: `` Because I am so glad now to think I am free . ''
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 10]: `` Some one has been maligning me , Alexa !
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 14]: It is very hard not to know where the stab comes from ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 13]: `` The testimony against you is from your own lips , George .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 19]: I heard you talking to my father , and was aware of a tone I did not like .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 16]: I listened more attentively , and became convinced that your ways of thinking had deteriorated .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 16]: There seemed not a remnant left of the honor I then thought characterized you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 22]: `` Why , certainly , as an honest man , I can not talk religion like your friend the farmer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 14]: `` Do you mean that Andrew Ingram is not an honest man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 7]: rejoined Alexa , with some heat .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 11]: `` I mean that I am an honest man . ''
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 8]: `` I am doubtful of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 13]: `` I can tell the quarter whence that doubt was blown ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 12]: `` It would be of greater consequence to blow it away !
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 12]: George Crawford , do you believe yourself an honest man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 8]: `` As men go , yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 9]: `` But not as men go , George ?
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 18]: As you would like to appear to the world when hearts are as open as faces ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 4]: He was silent .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 47]: `` Would the way you have made your money stand the scrutiny of -- '' She had Andrew in her mind , and was on the point of saying '' _ Jesus Christ _ , '' but felt she had no right , and hesitated . ''
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 7]: -- Of our friend Andrew ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 8]: supplemented George , with a spiteful laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 20]: `` The only honest mode of making money he knows is the strain of his muscles -- the farmer-way !
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 16]: He would n't keep up his corn for a better market -- not he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 29]: `` It so happens that I know he would not ; for he and my father had a dispute on that very point , and I heard them .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 15]: He said poor people were not to go hungry that he might get rich .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 19]: He was not sent into the world to make money , he said , but to grow corn .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 36]: The corn was grown , and he could get enough for it now to live by , and had no right , and no desire to get more -- and would not keep it up !
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 24]: The land was God 's , not his , and the poor were God 's children , and had their rights from him !
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 10]: He was sent to grow corn for them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 12]: `` And what did your father say to that wisdom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 6]: `` That is no matter .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 9]: Nor do I profess to understand Mr. Ingram .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 28]: I only know , '' added Alexa , with a little laugh , `` that he is consistent , for he has puzzled me all my life .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 20]: I can , however , see a certain nobility in him that sets him apart from other men ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 14]: `` And I can see that when I left I was needlessly modest !
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 10]: I thought _ my _ position too humble ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 10]: `` What am I to understand by that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 8]: `` What you think I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 11]: `` I wish you a good-afternoon , Mr. Crawford ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 6]: Alexa rose and left him .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 6]: George had indeed grown coarser !
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 42]: He turned where he stood with his hands in his pockets , and looked after her ; then smiled to himself a nasty smile , and said : `` At least I have made her angry , and that 's something !
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 10]: What has a fellow like that to give her ?
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 4]: Poet , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 4]: What 's that !
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 8]: He 's not even the rustic gentleman !
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 5]: He 's downright vulgar !
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 7]: -- a clod-hopper born and bred !
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 23]: But the lease , I understand , will soon be out , and Potlurg will never let _ him _ have it !
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 8]: _ I _ will see to that !
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 7]: The laird hates the canting scoundrel !
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 11]: I would rather pay him double the rent myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 13]: His behavior now did not put Andrew 's manners in the shade !
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 84]: Though he never said a word to flatter Alexa , spoke often in a way she did not at all like , persistently refused to enter into argument with her when most she desired it , yet his every tone , every movement toward her was full of respect And however she strove against the idea , she felt him her superior , and had indeed begun to wish that she had never shown herself at a disadvantage by the assumption of superiority .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 15]: It would be pleasant to know that it pained him to disapprove of her !
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 33]: For she began to feel that , as she disapproved of George , and could not like him , so the young farmer disapproved of her , and could not like her .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 11]: It was a new and by no means agreeable thought .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 15]: Andrew delighted in beautiful things : he did not see anything beautiful in her !
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 31]: Alexa was not conceited , but she knew she was handsome , and knew also that Andrew would never feel one heart-throb more because of any such beauty as hers .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 20]: Had he not as good as told her she was one of the dead who would not come alive !
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 13]: It would be something to be loved by a man like that !
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 31]: But Alexa was too maidenly to think of making any man love her -- and even if he loved her she could not marry a man in Andrew 's position !
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 40]: She might stretch a point or two were the lack but a point or two , but there was no stretching points to the marrying of a peasant , without education , who worked on his father 's farm !
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 5]: The thing was ridiculous !
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 7]: -- of course she knew that !
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 13]: -- the very idea too absurd to pass through her idlest thoughts !
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 9]: But she was not going to marry George !
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 5]: That was well settled !
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 11]: In a year or two he would be quite fat !
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 10]: And he always had his hands in his pockets !
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 12]: There was something about him _ not _ like a gentleman !
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 8]: He suggested an auctioneer or a cheap-jack !
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 10]: She took her pony and went for a ride .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 10]: When she came back , the pony looked elf-ridden .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 15]: But George had no intention of forsaking the house -- yet , at least .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 59]: He was bent on humbling his cousin , therefore continued his relations with her father , while he hurried on , as fast as consisted with good masonry , the building of a house on a small estate he had bought in the neighborhood , intending it to be such as must be an enticement to any lady .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 27]: So long had he regarded everything through the veil of money , that he could not think of Alexa even without thinking of Mammon as well .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 50]: By this time also he was so much infected with the old man 's passion for things curious and valuable , that the idea of one day calling the laird 's wonderful collection his own , had a real part in his desire to become his daughter 's husband .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 11]: He _ would not _ accept her dismissal as final !
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXV .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 6]: THE HEART OF THE HEART .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 19]: The laird had been poorly for some weeks , and Alexa began to fear that he was failing .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 29]: Nothing more had passed between him and Dawtie , but he knew that anxious eyes were often watching him , and the thought worried him not a little .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 21]: If he would but take a start , thought Dawtie , and not lose all the good of this life !
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 39]: It was too late for him to rise very high ; he could not now be a saint , but he might at least set a foot on the eternal stair that leads to the fullness of bliss !
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 33]: He would have a sore fight with all those imps of things , before he ceased to love that which was not lovely , and to covet that which was not good !
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 21]: But the man gained a precious benefit from this world , who but began to repent before he left it !
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 18]: If only the laird would start up the hill before his body got quite to the bottom !
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 44]: Was there any way to approach him again with her petition that he would be good to himself , good to God , good to the universe , that he would love what was worth loving , and cast away what was not ?
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 10]: She had no light , and could do nothing !
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 14]: Suddenly the old man failed quite -- apparently from no cause but weakness .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 24]: The unease of his mind , the haunting of the dread thought of having to part with the chalice , had induced it .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 31]: He was in his closet one night late into the morning , and the next day did not get up to breakfast He wanted a little rest , he said .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 8]: In a day he would be well !
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 13]: But the hour to rise again , much anticipated , never came .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 19]: He seemed very troubled at times , and very desirous of getting up , but never was able .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 10]: It became necessary to sit with him at night .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 21]: In fits of delirium he would make fierce endeavor to rise , insisting that he must go to his study .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 14]: His closet he never mentioned : even in dreams was his secrecy dominant .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 17]: Dawtie , who had her share in nursing him , kept hoping her opportunity would come .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 11]: He did not seem to cherish any resentment against her .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 18]: His illness would protect him , he thought , from further intrusion of her conscience upon his !
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 12]: She must know better than irritate a sick man with overofficiousness !
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 7]: Everybody could not be a saint !
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 14]: It was enough to be a Christian like other good and salvable Christians !
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 22]: It was enough for him if through the merits of his Saviour he gained admission to the heavenly kingdom at last !
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 43]: He never thought now , once in , he could bear to stay in ; never thought how heaven could be to him other than the dullest place in the universe of God , more wearisome than the kingdom of darkness itself !
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 37]: And all the time the young woman with the savior-heart was watching by his bedside , ready to speak ; but the Spirit gave her no utterance , and her silence soothed his fear of her .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 9]: One night he was more restless than usual .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 22]: Waking from his troubled slumber , he called her -- in the tone of one who had something important to communicate .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 25]: `` Dawtie , '' he said , with feeble voice but glittering eye , `` there is no one I can trust like you .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 13]: I have been thinking of what you said that night ever since .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 11]: Go to my closet and bring me the cup . ''
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 46]: Dawtie held a moment 's debate whether it would be right ; but she reflected that it made little difference whether the object of his passion was in his hand or in his chest , while it was all the same deep in his heart .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 39]: Then his words seemed to imply that he wanted to take his farewell of it ; and to refuse his request might only fan the evil love , and turn him from the good motion in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 13]: She said : `` Yes , sir , '' and stood waiting .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 5]: He did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 14]: `` I do not know where to find it , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 17]: `` I am going to tell you , '' he replied , but seemed to hesitate .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 14]: `` I will not touch a single thing beside , '' said Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 21]: He believed her , and at once proceeded : `` Take my bunch of keys from the hook behind me .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 9]: There is the key of the closet door !
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 37]: -- and there , the key of all the bunch that looks the commonest , but is in reality the most cunningly devised , is the key of the cabinet in which I keep it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 63]: Then he told her where , behind a little book-case , which moved from the wall on hinges , she would find the cabinet , and in what part of it the cup , wrapped in a piece of silk that had once been a sleeve , worn by _ Mme. de Genlis _ -- which did not make Dawtie much wiser .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 39]: She went , found the chalice , and brought it where the laird lay straining his ears , and waiting for it as a man at the point of death might await the sacramental cup from absolving priest .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 44]: His hands trembled as he took it ; for they were the hands of a lover -- strange as that love was , which not merely looked for no return , but desired to give neither pleasure nor good to the thing loved !
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 16]: It was no love of the merely dead , but a love of the unliving !
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 73]: He pressed the thing to his bosom ; then , as if rebuked by the presence of Dawtie , put it a little from him , and began to pore over every stone , every _ repoussé _ figure between , and every engraved ornament around the gems , each of which he knew , by shape , order , quality of color , better than ever face of wife or child .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 23]: But soon his hands sunk on the counterpane of silk patchwork , and he lay still , grasping tight the precious thing .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 18]: He woke with a start and a cry , to find it safe in both his hands .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 4]: `` Ugh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 14]: he said ; `` I thought some one had me by the throat !
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 17]: You did n't try to take the cup from me -- did you , Dawtie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 38]: `` No , sir , '' answered Dawtie ; `` I would not care to take it out of your hand , but I _ should _ be glad to take it out of your heart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 11]: `` If they would only bury it with me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 8]: he murmured , heedless of her words .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 5]: `` Oh , sir !
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 11]: Would you have it burning your heart to all eternity ?
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 15]: Give it up , sir , and take the treasure thief never stole . ''
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 7]: `` Yes , Dawtie , yes !
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 7]: That is the true treasure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 14]: `` And to get it we must sell all that we have ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 11]: `` He gives and withholds as He sees fit . ''
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 40]: `` Then , when you go down into the blackness , longing for the cup you will never see more , you will complain of God that he would not give you strength to fling it from you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 5]: He hugged the chalice .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 7]: `` Fling it from me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 5]: he cried , fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 14]: `` Girl , who are you to torment me before my time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 24]: `` Tell me , sir , '' persisted Dawtie , `` why does the apostle cry , ` Awake thou that sleepest ! '
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 7]: if they could n't move ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 11]: `` No one _ can _ move without God . ''
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 40]: `` Therefore , seeing every one can move , it must be God giving him the power to do what he requires of him ; and we are fearfully to blame not using the strength God gives us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 11]: `` I can not bear the strain of thinking ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 4]: gasped the laird .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 11]: `` Then give up thinking , and do the thing !
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 8]: Shall I take it for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 9]: She put out her hand as she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 3]: no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 8]: he cried , grasping the cup tighter .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 7]: `` You shall not touch it !
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 8]: You would give it to the earl !
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 4]: I know you !
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 7]: Saints hate what is beautiful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 19]: `` I like better to look at things in my Father 's hand than in my own ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 15]: `` You want to see my cup -- it _ is _ my cup !
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 13]: -- in the hands of that spendthrift fool , Lord Borland ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 14]: `` It is in the Father 's hand , whoever has it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 18]: `` Hold your tongue , Dawtie , or I will cry out and wake the house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 19]: `` They will think you out of your mind , and come and take the cup from you !
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 15]: Do let me put it away ; then you will go to sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 13]: `` I will not ; I can not trust you with it !
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 8]: You have destroyed my confidence in you !
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 24]: I _ may _ fall asleep , but if your hand come within a foot of the cup , it will wake me !
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 5]: I know it will !
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 19]: I shall sleep with my heart in the cup , and the least touch will wake me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 16]: `` I wish you would let Andrew Ingram come and see you , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 9]: `` What 's the matter with _ him ?
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 23]: _ '' `` Nothing 's the matter with him , sir ; but he helps everybody to do what is right . ''
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 4]: `` Conceited rascal !
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 14]: Do you take me for a maniac that you talk such foolery ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 31]: His look was so wild , his old blue faded eyes gleamed with such a light of mingled fear and determination , that Dawtie was almost sorry she had spoken .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 15]: With trembling hands he drew the cup within the bed-clothes , and lay still .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 12]: If the morning would but come , and bring George Crawford !
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 26]: _ He _ would restore the cup to its place , or hide it where he should know it safe and not far from him !
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 14]: Dawtie sat motionless , and the old man fell into another feverish doze .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 14]: She dared not stir lest he should start away to defend his idol .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 11]: She sat like an image , moving only her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 9]: `` What are you about , Dawtie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 5]: he said at length .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 13]: `` You are after some mischief , you are so quiet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 29]: `` I was telling God how good you would be if he could get you to give up your odds and ends , and take Him instead . ''
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 15]: `` How dared you say such a thing , sitting there by my side !
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 28]: Are _ you _ to say to _ Him _ that any sinner would be good , if He would only do so and so with him !
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 12]: Tremble , girl , at the vengeance of the Almighty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 24]: `` We are told to make prayers and intercessions for all men , and I was saying what I could for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 14]: The laird was silent , and the rest of the night passed quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 19]: His first words in the morning were : `` Go and tell your mistress I want her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 14]: When his daughter came , he told her to send for George Crawford .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 13]: He was worse , he said , and wanted to see him .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 15]: Alexa thought it best to send Dawtie with the message by the next train .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 25]: Dawtie did not relish the mission , for she had no faith in Crawford , and did not like his influence on her master .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 41]: Not the less when she reached his hotel , she insisted on seeing him and giving her message in person ; which done , she made haste for the first train back : they could not do well without her !
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 13]: When she arrived , there was Mr. Crawford already on the platform !
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 32]: She set out as fast as she could , but she had not got further than half-way when he overtook her in a fly , and insisted she should get in .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVI .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 5]: GEORGE CRAWFORD AND DAWTIE .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 10]: `` What is the matter with your master ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 7]: `` God knows , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 10]: `` What is the use of telling me that ?
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 13]: I want you to tell me what _ you _ know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 10]: `` I do n't know anything , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 8]: `` What do you think then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 16]: `` I should think old age had something to do with it , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 12]: `` Likely enough , but you know more than that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 17]: `` I should n't wonder , sir , if he were troubled in his mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 8]: `` What makes you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 10]: `` It is reasonable to think so , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 30]: He knows he must die before long , and it is dreadful to leave everything you care for , and go where there is nothing you care for ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 14]: `` How do you know there is nothing he would care for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 16]: `` What is there , sir , he would be likely to care for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 6]: `` There is his wife .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 22]: He was fond of her , I suppose , and you pious people fancy you will see each other again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 25]: `` The thought of seeing her would give him little comfort , I am afraid , in parting with the things he has here .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 13]: He believes a little somehow -- I ca n't understand how . ''
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 7]: `` What does he believe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 22]: `` He believes a little -- he is not sure -- that what a man soweth he shall also reap . ''
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 14]: `` How do you know what he is or is not sure off ?
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 12]: It ca n't be a matter of interest to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 15]: `` Those that come of one Father must have interest in one another . ''
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 17]: `` How am I to tell we come of one Father -- as you call Him ?
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 12]: I like to have a thing proved before I believe it .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 28]: I know neither where I came from , nor where I am going ; how then can I know that we come from the same father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 14]: `` I do n't know how you 're to know it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 11]: I take it for granted , and find it good .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 11]: But there is one thing I am sure of . ''
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 6]: `` What is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 27]: `` That if you were my master 's friend you would not rest till you got him to do what was right before he died . ''
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 10]: `` I will not be father-confessor to any man .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 8]: I have enough to do with myself .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 21]: A good worthy old man like the laird must know better than any other what he ought to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 11]: `` There is no doubt of that , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 8]: `` What do you want then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 8]: `` To get him to do it .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 11]: That he knows , is what makes it so miserable .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 12]: If he did not know he would not be to blame .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 25]: He knows what it is and wo n't do it , and that makes him wretched -- as it ought , thank God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 7]: `` You 're a nice Christian .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 8]: Thanking God for making a man miserable .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 3]: Well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' answered Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 5]: George thought a little .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 11]: `` What would you have me persuade him to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 15]: he asked , for he might hear something it would be useful to know .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 15]: But Dawtie had no right and no inclination to tell him what she knew .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 22]: `` I only wish you would persuade him to do what he knows he ought to do , '' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVII .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 3]: THE WATCH .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 19]: George stayed with the laird a good while , and held a long , broken talk with him .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 6]: When he went Alexa came .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 7]: She thought her father seemed happier .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 9]: George had put the cup away for him .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 7]: Alexa sat with him that night .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 19]: She knew nothing of such a precious thing being in the house -- in the room with them .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 41]: In the middle of the night , as she was arranging his pillows , the laird drew from under the bed-clothes , and held up to her , flashing in the light of the one candle , the jeweled watch .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 3]: She stared .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 12]: The old man was pleased at her surprise and evident admiration .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 8]: She held out her hand for it .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 5]: He gave it her .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 19]: `` That watch , '' he said , `` is believed to have belonged to Ninon de l'Enclos .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 11]: It _ may _ , but I doubt it myself .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 24]: It is well known she never took presents from her admirers , and she was too poor to have bought such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 19]: Mme. de Maintenon , however , or some one of her lady-friends , might have given it her .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 23]: It will be yours one day -- that is , if you marry the man I should like you to marry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 10]: `` Dear father , do not talk of marrying .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 18]: I have enough with you , '' cried Alexa , and felt as if she hated George .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 15]: `` Unfortunately , you can not have me always , '' returned her father .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 20]: `` I will say nothing more now , but I desire you to consider what I have said . ''
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 8]: Alexa put the watch in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 27]: `` I trust you do not suppose , '' she said , `` that a house full of things like that would make any difference . ''
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 7]: He looked up at her sharply .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 9]: A house full -- what did she know ?
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 9]: It silenced him , and he lay thinking .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 14]: Surely the delight of lovely things must be in every woman 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 11]: Was not the passion , developed or undeveloped , universal ?
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 13]: Could a child of his _ not _ care for such things ?
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 17]: `` Ah , '' he said to himself , `` she takes after her mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 11]: A wall seemed to rise between him and his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 2]: alas !
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 16]: the things he loved and must one day yield would not be cherished by her .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 12]: No tender regard would hover around them when he was gone .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 9]: She would be no protecting divinity to them .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 4]: God in heaven !
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 14]: she might -- she would -- he was sure she would sell them .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 40]: It seems the sole possible comfort of avarice , as it passes empty and hungry into the empty regions -- that the things it can no more see with eyes or handle with hands will yet be together somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 22]: Hence the rich leave to the rich , avoiding the man who most needs , or would best use their money .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 41]: Is there a lurking notion in the man of much goods , I wonder , that , in the still watches of the night , when men sleep , he will return to look on what he leaves behind him ?
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 29]: Does he forget the torture of seeing it at the command , in the enjoyment of another -- his will concerning this thing or that but a mockery ?
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 30]: Does he know that he who then holds them will not be able to conceive of their having been or ever being another 's as now they are his ?
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 41]: As Alexa sat in the dim light by her brooding father she loathed the shining thing he had again drawn under the bed-clothes -- shrunk from it as from a manacle the devil had tried to slip on her wrist .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 14]: The judicial assumption of society suddenly appeared in the emptiness of its arrogance .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 9]: Marriage for the sake of _ things _ .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 26]: Was she not a live soul , made for better than that She was ashamed of the innocent pleasure the glittering toy had given her .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 15]: The laird cast now and then a glance at her face , and sighed .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 25]: He gathered from it the conviction that she would be a cruel step-mother to his children , her mercy that of a loveless non-collector .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 5]: It should not be .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 9]: He would do better for them than that .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 22]: He loved his daughter , but needed not therefore sacrifice his last hopes where the sacrifice would meet with no acceptance .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 19]: House and land should be hers , but not his jewels ; not the contents of his closet .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVIII .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 3]: THE WILL .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 19]: George came again to see him the next day , and had again a long conference with him .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 59]: The laird told him that he had fully resolved to leave everything to his daughter , personal as well as real , on the one condition that she should marry her cousin ; if she would not , then the contents of his closet , with his library , and certain articles specified , should pass to Crawford .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 37]: `` And you must take care , '' he said , `` if my death should come suddenly , that anything valuable in this room be carried into the closet before it is sealed up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 29]: Shrinking as he did from the idea of death , the old man was yet able , in the interest of his possessions , to talk of it !
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 40]: It was as if he thought the sole consolation that , in the loss of their owner , his things could have , was the continuance of their intercourse with each other in the heaven of his Mammon-besotted imagination .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 24]: George responded heartily , showing a gratitude more genuine than fine : every virtue partakes of the ground in which it is grown .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 41]: He assured the laird that , valuable as was in itself his contingent gift , which no man could appreciate more than he , it would be far more valuable to him if it sealed his adoption as his son-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 18]: He would rather owe the possession of the wonderful collection to the daughter than to the father !
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 28]: In either case the precious property would be held as for him , each thing as carefully tended as by the laird 's own eye and hand !
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 68]: Whether it would at the moment have comforted the dying man to be assured , as George might have him , that there would be nothing left of him to grieve at the loss of his idols -- nothing left of him but a memory , to last so long as George and Alexa and one or two more should remain unburied , I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 11]: It was in any case a dreary outlook for him .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 45]: Hope and faith and almost love had been sucked from his life by `` the hindering knot-grass '' which had spread its white bloodless roots in all directions through soul and heart and mind , exhausting and choking in them everything of divinest origin .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 32]: The weeds in George 's heart were of another kind , and better nor worse in themselves ; the misery was that neither of them was endeavoring to root them out .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 23]: The thief who is trying to be better is ages ahead of the most honorable man who is making no such effort .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 16]: The one is alive ; the other is dead and on the way to corruption .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 34]: They treated themselves to a gaze together on the cup and the watch ; then George went to give directions to the laird 's lawyer for the drawing up of his new will .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 20]: The next day it was brought , read , signed by the laird , and his signature duly witnessed .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 12]: Dawtie being on the spot was made one of the witnesses .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 60]: The laird trembled lest her fanaticism should break out in appeal to the lawyer concerning the cup ; he could not understand that the cup was nothing to her ; that she did not imagine herself a setter right of wrongs , but knew herself her neighbor 's keeper , one that had to deliver his soul from death !
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 44]: Had the cup come into her possession , she would have sent it back to the owner , but it was not worth her care that the Earl of Borland should cast his eyes when he would upon a jewel in a cabinet !
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 10]: Dawtie was very white as he signed his name .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 34]: Where the others saw but a legal ceremony , she feared her loved master was assigning his soul to the devil , as she had read of Dr. Faustus in the old ballad .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 35]: He was gliding away into the dark , and no one to whom he had done a good turn with the Mammon of unrighteousness , was waiting to receive him into an everlasting habitation !
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 70]: She had and she needed no special cause to love her master , any more than to love the chickens and the calves ; she loved because something that could be loved was there present to her ; but he had always spoken kindly to her , and been pleased with her endeavor to serve him ; and now he was going where she could do nothing for him !
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 22]: -- except pray , as her heart and Andrew had taught her , knowing that `` all live unto _ Him !
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 5]: _ '' But alas !
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 14]: what were prayers where the man would not take the things prayed for !
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 19]: Nevertheless all things _ were _ possible with God , and she _ would _ pray for him !
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 37]: It was also with white face , and it was with trembling hand that she signed her own name , for she felt as if giving him a push down the icy slope into the abyss .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 38]: But when the thing was done , the old man went quietly to sleep , and dreamed of a radiant jewel , glorious as he had never seen jewel , ever within yet ever eluding his grasp .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIX .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 3]: THE SANGREAL .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 14]: The next day he seemed better , and Alexa began to hope again .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 32]: But in the afternoon his pulse began to sink , and when Crawford came he could welcome him only with a smile and a vain effort to put out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 6]: George bent down to him .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 14]: The others , at a sign from his eyes , left the room .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 10]: `` I ca n't find it , George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 3]: he whispered .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 14]: `` I put it away for you last night , you remember ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 3]: answered George .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 9]: `` Oh , no , you did n't !
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 10]: I had it in my hand a minute ago !
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 12]: But I fell into a doze , and it is gone !
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 5]: George , get it !
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 13]: -- get it for me , or I shall go mad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 7]: George went and brought it him .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 4]: `` Thank you !
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 3]: thank you !
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 4]: Now I remember !
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 15]: I thought I was in hell , and they took it from me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 9]: `` Do n't you be afraid , sir !
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 7]: Fall asleep when you feel inclined .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 10]: I will keep my eye on the cup . ''
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 8]: `` You will not go away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 20]: `` No ; I will stay as long as you like ; there is nothing to take me away .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 23]: If I had thought you would be worse , I would not have gone last night '' `` I 'm not worse !
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 7]: What put that in your head ?
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 8]: Do n't you hear me speaking better ?
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 17]: I 've thought about it , George , and am convinced the cup is a talisman !
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 10]: I am better all the time I hold it !
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 21]: It was because I let you put it away that I was worse last night -- for no other reason .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 19]: If it were not a talisman , how else could it have so nestled itself into my heart !
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 15]: I feel better , always , the moment I take it in my hand !
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 10]: There is something more than common about that chalice !
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 12]: George , what if it should be the Holy Grail ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 16]: He said it with bated breath , and a great white awe upon his countenance .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 12]: His eyes were shining ; his breath came and went fast .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 10]: Slowly his aged cheeks flushed with two bright spots .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 12]: He looked as if the joy of his life was come .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 11]: `` What if it should be the Holy Grail ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 13]: he repeated , and fell asleep with the words on his lips .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 10]: As the evening deepened into night , he woke .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 6]: Crawford was sitting beside him .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 7]: A change had come over him .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 27]: He stared at George as if he could not make him out , closed his eyes , opened them , stared , and again closed them .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 11]: He seemed to think he was there for no good .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 10]: `` Would you like me to call Alexa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 3]: said George .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 8]: `` Call Dawtie ; call Dawtie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 3]: he replied .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 8]: George rose to go and call her .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 6]: `` Beware of her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 14]: said the laird , with glazy eyes , `` Beware of Dawtie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 3]: asked George .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 9]: `` Beware of her , '' he repeated .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 11]: `` If she can get the cup , she will !
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 12]: She would take it from me now , if she dared !
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 6]: She will steal it yet !
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 7]: Call Dawtie ; call Dawtie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 14]: Alexa was in the drawing-room , on the other side of the hall .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 11]: George went and told her that her father wanted Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 26]: `` I will find her , '' she said , and rose , but turned and asked : `` How does he seem now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 8]: `` Rather worse , '' George answered .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 13]: `` Are you going to be with him through the night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 19]: `` I am ; he insists on my staying with him , '' replied George , almost apologetically .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 14]: `` Then , '' she returned , `` you must have some supper .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 11]: We will go down , and send up Dawtie . ''
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 7]: He followed her to the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 11]: Dawtie was not there , but her mistress found her .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 24]: When she entered her master 's room , he lay motionless , `` and white with the whiteness of what is dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 10]: She got brandy , and made him swallow some .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 14]: As soon as he recovered a little , he began to talk wildly .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 6]: `` Oh , Agnes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 9]: he cried , `` do not leave me .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 7]: I 'm not a bad man !
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 8]: I 'm not what Dawtie calls me .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 20]: I believe in the atonement ; I put no trust in myself ; my righteousness is as filthy rags .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 5]: Take me with you .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 8]: I _ will _ go with you .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 15]: Slip that under your white robe -- washed in the blood of the Lamb .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 12]: That will hide it -- with the rest of my sins !
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 10]: The unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 15]: Take it ; take it ; I should be lost in heaven without it !
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 28]: I ca n't see what I 've got on , but it must be the robe of His righteousness , for I have none of my own !
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 7]: What should I be without it !
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 7]: It 's all I 've got !
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 30]: I could n't bring away a single thing besides -- and it 's so cold to have but one thing on -- I mean one thing in your hands !
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 10]: Do you say they will make me sell it ?
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 10]: That would be worse than coming without it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 7]: He was talking to his wife !
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 10]: -- persuading her to smuggle the cup into heaven !
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 19]: Dawtie went on her knees behind the curtain , and began to pray for him all she could .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 16]: But something seemed stopping her , and making her prayer come only from her lips .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 16]: `` Ah , '' said the voice of her master , `` I thought so !
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 14]: How could I go up , and you praying against me like that !
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 11]: Cup or no cup , the thing was impossible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 45]: Dawtie opened her eyes -- and there he was , holding back the curtain and looking round the edge of it with a face of eagerness , effort , and hate , as of one struggling to go , and unable to break away .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 6]: She rose to her feet .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 7]: `` You are a fiend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 10]: `` I _ will _ go with Agnes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 13]: He gave a cry , and ceased , and all was still .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 13]: They heard the cry in the kitchen , and came running up .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 13]: They found Dawtie bending over her master , with a scared face .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 19]: He seemed to have struck her , for one cheek was marked with red streaks across its whiteness .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 4]: `` The Grail !
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 5]: the Holy Grail ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 5]: `` I found it !
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 6]: I was bringing it home !
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 6]: She took it from me !
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 15]: She wants it to -- '' His jaw fell , and he was dead .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 7]: Alexa threw herself beside the body .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 14]: George would have raised her , but she resisted , and lay motionless .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 27]: He stood then behind her , watching an opportunity to get the cup from under the bed-clothes , that he might put it in the closet .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 20]: He ordered Dawtie to fetch water for her mistress ; but Alexa told her she did not want any .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 22]: Once and again George tried to raise her , and get his hand under the bed-clothes to feel for the cup .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 7]: `` He is not dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 8]: cried Alexa ; `` he moved ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 9]: `` Get some brandy , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 12]: She rose , and went to the table for the brandy .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 18]: George , with the pretense of feeling the dead man 's heart , threw back the clothes .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 6]: He could find no cup .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 6]: It had got further down !
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 4]: He would wait !
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 20]: Alexa lifted her father 's head on her arm , but it was plain that brandy could not help .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 16]: She went and sat on a chair away from the bed , hopeless and exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 28]: George lifted the clothes from the foot of the bed , then from the further side , and then from the nearer , without attracting her attention .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 8]: The cup was nowhere to be seen !
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 15]: He put his hand under the body , but the cup was not there !
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 16]: He had to leave the room that Dawtie and Meg might prepare it for burial .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 6]: Alexa went to her chamber .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 28]: A moment after , George returned , called Meg to the door , and said : `` There must be a brass cup in the bed somewhere !
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 7]: I brought it to amuse him .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 10]: He was fond of odd things , you know !
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 25]: If you should find it -- '' `` I will take care of it , '' answered Meg , and turned from him curtly .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 21]: George felt he had not a friend in the house , and that he must leave things as they were !
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 30]: The door of the closet was locked , and he could not go again to the death-chamber to take the laird 's keys from the head of the bed !
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 11]: He knew that the two women would not let him .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 10]: It had been an oversight not to secure them !
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 17]: He was glad the watch was safe : that he had put in the closet before !
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 11]: -- but it mattered little when the cup was missing !
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 23]: He went to the stable , got out his horse , and rode home in the still gray of a midsummer night .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 11]: The stillness and the night seemed thinking to each other .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 19]: George had little imagination , but what he had woke in him now as he rode slowly along .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 23]: Step by step the old man seemed following him , on silent church-yard feet , through the eerie whiteness of the night .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 22]: There was neither cloud nor moon , only stars above and around , and a great cold crack in the north-east .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 16]: He was crying after him , in a voice he could not make him hear !
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 14]: Was he not straggling to warn him not to come into like condemnation ?
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 11]: The voice seemed trying to say , `` I know !
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 4]: I know now !
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 10]: I would not believe , but I know now !
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 10]: Give back the cup ; give it back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 14]: George did not allow to himself that there was `` anything '' there .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 16]: It was but a vague movement in that commonplace , unmysterious region , his mind !
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 16]: He heard nothing , positively nothing , with his ears -- therefore there was nothing !
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 30]: It was indeed somehow as if one were saying the words , but in reality they came only as a thought rising , continually rising , in his mind !
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 15]: It was but a thought-sound , and no speech : `` I know now !
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 4]: I know now !
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 10]: Give it back ; give the cup back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 50]: He did not ask himself how the thought came ; he cast it away as only that insignificant thing , a thought -- cast it away none the less that he found himself answering it -- `` I ca n't give it back ; I ca n't find it !
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 6]: Where did you put it ?
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 9]: You must have taken it with you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 5]: `` What rubbish ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 17]: he said to himself ten times , waking up ; `` of course Dawtie took it !
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 13]: Did n't the poor old fellow warn me to beware of her !
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 21]: Nobody but her was in the room when we ran in , and found him at the point of death !
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 6]: Where did you put it ?
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 6]: I ca n't find it !
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 8]: I ca n't give it back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 12]: He went over in his mind all that had taken place .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 22]: The laird had the cup when he left him to call Dawtie ; and when they came , it was nowhere !
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 33]: He was convinced the girl had secured it -- in obedience , doubtless , to the instruction of her director , ambitious to do justice , and curry favor by restoring it !
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 11]: But he could do nothing till the will was read !
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 9]: Was it possible Lexy had put it away ?
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 9]: No ; she had not had the opportunity !
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXX .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 6]: GEORGE AND THE GOLDEN GOBLET .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 31]: With slow-pacing shadows , the hot hours crept athwart the heath , and the house , and the dead , and carried the living with them in their invisible current .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 16]: There is no tide in time ; it is a steady current , not returning .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 12]: Happy they whom it bears inward to the center of things !
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 17]: Alas , for those whom it carries outward to `` the flaming walls of creation ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 77]: The poor old laird who , with all his refinement , all his education , all his interest in philology , prosody , history , and _ reliquial _ humanity , had become the slave of a goblet , had left it behind him , had faced the empty universe empty-handed , and vanished with a shadow-goblet in his heart ; the eyes that gloated over the gems had gone to help the grass to grow .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 67]: But the will of the dead remained to trouble for a time the living , for it put his daughter in a painful predicament : until Crawford 's property was removed from the house , it would give him constant opportunity of prosecuting the suit which Aleza had reason to think he intended to resume , and the thought of which had become to her insupportable .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 38]: Great was her astonishment when she learned to what the door in the study led , and what a multitude of curious and valuable things were there of whose presence in the house she had never dreamed .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 46]: She would gladly have had them for herself ; and it pained her to the heart to think of the disappointment of the poor ghost when he saw , if he could see , his treasured hoard emptied out of its hidden and safe abode .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 48]: For , even if George should magnanimously protest that he did not care for the things enough to claim them , and beg that they might remain where they were , she could not grant his request , for it would be to accept them from him .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 40]: Had her father left them to her , she would have kept them as carefully as even he could desire -- with this difference only , that she would not have shut them up from giving pleasure to others .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 51]: She was growing to care more about the truth -- gradually coming to see that much she had taken for a more liberal creed , was but the same falsehoods in weaker forms , less repulsive only to a mind indifferent to the paramount claims of God on His child .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 31]: She saw something of the falseness and folly of attempting to recommend religion as not so difficult , so exclusive , so full of prohibition as our ancestors believed it .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 53]: She saw that , although Andrew might regard some things as freely given which others thought God forbade , yet he insisted on what was infinitely higher and more than the abandonment of everything pleasant -- the abnegation , namely , of the very self , and the reception of God instead .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 21]: She had hitherto been , with all her supposed progress , only a recipient of the traditions of the elders !
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 11]: There must be a deeper something -- the real religion !
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 22]: She did not yet see that the will of God lay in another direction altogether than the heartiest reception of dogma !
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 25]: -- that God was too great and too generous to care about anything except righteousness , and only wanted us to be good children !
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 27]: -- that even honesty was but the path toward righteousness , a condition so pure that honesty itself would never more be an object of thought !
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 23]: She pondered much about her father , and would find herself praying for him , careless of what she had been taught .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 10]: She could not blind herself to what she knew .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 30]: He had not been a bad man , as men count badness , but could she in common sense think him a glorified saint , shining in white robes ?
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 7]: The polite , kind old man !
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 4]: her own father !
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 15]: -- could she , on the other hand , believe him in flames forever ?
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 27]: If so , what a religion was that which required her to believe it , and at the same time to rejoice in the Lord always !
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 19]: She longed for something positive to believe , something into accordance with which she might work her feelings .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 13]: She was still on the outlook for definite intellectual formulae to hold .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 65]: Her intercourse with Andrew had as yet failed to open her eyes to the fact that the faith required of us is faith in a person , and not in the truest of statements concerning anything , even concerning him ; or to the fact , that faith in the living One , the very essence of it , consists in obedience to Him .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 33]: A man can obey before he is sure , and except he obey the command he knows to be right , wherever it may come from , he will never be sure .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 12]: To find the truth , man or woman must be true .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 9]: But she much desired another talk with Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 41]: Persuading himself that Alexa 's former feeling toward him must in her trouble reassert itself , and confident that he would find her loath to part with her father 's wonderful collection , George waited the effect of the will .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 86]: After the reading of it he had gone away directly , that his presence might not add to the irritation which he concluded , not without reason , it must , even in the midst of her sorrow , cause in her ; but at the end of a week he wrote , saying that he felt it his duty , if only in gratitude to his friend , to inform himself as to the attention the valuable things he had left him might require .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 33]: He assured Alexa that he had done nothing to influence her father in the matter , and much regretted the awkward position in which his will had placed both her and him .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 33]: At the same time it was not unnatural that he should wish such precious objects to be possessed by one who would care for them as he had himself cared for them .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 17]: He hoped , therefore , that she would allow him access to her father 's rooms .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 52]: He would not , she might rest assured , intrude himself upon her sorrow , though he would be compelled to ask her before long whether he might hope that her father 's wish would have any influence in reviving the favor which had once been the joy of his life .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 30]: Alexa saw that if she consented to see him he would take it as a permission to press his claim , and the idea was not to be borne .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 23]: She wrote him therefore a stiff letter , telling him the house was at his service , but he must excuse herself .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 9]: The next morning brought him early to Potlurg .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 12]: The cause of his haste was his uneasiness about the chalice .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 17]: Old Meg opened the door to him , and he followed her straight into the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 10]: Alexa was there , and far from expecting him .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 26]: But , annoyed at his appearance as she was , she found his manner and behavior less unpleasant than at any time since his return .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 35]: He was gentle and self-restrained , assuming no familiarity beyond that of a distant relative , and gave the impression of having come against his will , and only from a sense of duty .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 9]: `` Did you not have my note ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 15]: He had hoped , he said , to save her the trouble of writing .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 15]: She handed him her father 's bunch of keys , and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 20]: George went to the laird 's closet , and having spent an hour in it , again sought Alexa .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 8]: The wonderful watch was in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 35]: `` I feel the more pleasure , Alexa , '' he said , `` in begging you to accept this trinket , that it was the last addition to your dear father 's collection .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 19]: I had myself the good fortune to please him with it a few days before his death . ''
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 12]: `` No , thank you , George , '' returned Alexa .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 21]: `` It is a beautiful thing -- my father showed it me -- but I can not take it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 17]: `` It was more of you than him I thought when I purchased it , Alexa .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 11]: You know why I could not offer it you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 8]: `` The same reason exists now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 20]: `` I am sorry to have to force myself on your attention , but -- '' `` Dawtie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 3]: cried Alexa .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 4]: Dawtie came running .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 7]: `` Wait a minute , Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 12]: I will speak to you presently , '' said her mistress .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 3]: George rose .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 16]: He had laid the watch on the table , and seemed to have forgotten it .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 12]: `` Please take the watch with you , '' said Alexa .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 9]: `` Certainly , if you wish it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 3]: he answered .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 13]: `` And my father 's keys , too , '' she added .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 14]: `` Will you not be kind enough to take charge of them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 12]: `` I would rather not be accountable for anything under them .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 9]: No ; you must take the keys . ''
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 30]: `` I can not help regretting , '' said George , `` that your honored father should have thought fit to lay this burden of possession upon me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 5]: Alexa made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 20]: `` I comforted myself with the hope that you would feel them as much your own as ever ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 11]: he resumed , in a tone of disappointment and dejection .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 19]: `` I did not know of their existence before I knew they were never to be mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 6]: `` Never , Alexa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 4]: `` Never . ''
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 30]: George walked to the door , but there turned , and said : `` By the way , you know that cup your father was so fond of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 11]: `` Not that gold cup , set with stones ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 20]: `` I saw something in his hands once , in bed , that might have been a cup . ''
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 22]: `` It is a thing of great value -- of pure gold , and every stone in it a gem . ''
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 7]: returned Alexa , with marked indifference .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 25]: `` Yes ; it was the work of the famous Benvenuto Cellini , made for Pope Clement the Seventh , for his own communion-chalice .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 9]: Your father priced it at three thousand pounds .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 34]: In his last moments , when his mind was wandering , he fancied it the Holy Grail He had it in the bed with him when he died ; that I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 7]: `` And it is missing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 12]: `` Perhaps Dawtie could tell us what has become of it .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 10]: She was with the laird at the last . ''
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 28]: Dawtie , who had stood aside to let him pass to the open door , looked up with a flash in her eyes , but said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 10]: `` Have you seen the cup , Dawtie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 4]: asked her mistress .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 6]: `` No , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 7]: `` Do you know it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 7]: `` Very well , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 13]: `` Then you do n't know what has become of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 12]: `` No , ma'am ; I know nothing about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 10]: `` Take care , Dawtie , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 14]: `` This is a matter that will have to be searched into . ''
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 11]: `` When did you last see it , Dawtie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 3]: inquired Alexa .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 10]: `` The very day my master died , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 21]: He was looking at it , but when he saw I saw him he took it inside the bed-clothes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 10]: `` And you have not seen it since ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 6]: `` No , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 11]: `` And you do not know where it is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 3]: said George .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 5]: How should I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 7]: `` You never touched it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 24]: `` I can not say that , sir ; I brought it him from his closet ; he sent me for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 12]: `` What do you think may have become of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 9]: `` I do n't know , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 20]: `` Would you allow me to make a thorough search in the place where it was last seen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 8]: asked George , turning to his cousin .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 5]: `` By all means .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 11]: Dawtie , go and help Mr. Crawford to look . ''
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 11]: `` Please , ma'am , it ca n't be there .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 12]: We 've had the carpet up , and the floor scrubbed .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 19]: There 's not a hole or a corner we have n't been into -- and that yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 10]: `` We must find it , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 9]: `` It must be in the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 10]: `` It must , sir , '' said Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 27]: But George more than doubted it `` I do believe , '' he said , `` the laird would rather have lost his whole collection . ''
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 11]: `` Indeed , sir , I think he would . ''
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 11]: `` Then you have talked to him about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 20]: `` Yes , I have , sir , '' answered Dawtie , sorry she had brought out the question .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 11]: `` And you know the worth of the thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 27]: `` Yes , sir ; that is , I do n't know how much it was worth , but I should say pounds and pounds . ''
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 16]: `` Then , Dawtie , I must ask you again , _ where is it ?
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 11]: _ '' `` I know nothing about it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 6]: I wish I did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 9]: `` Why do you wish you did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 30]: `` Because -- '' began Dawtie , and stopped short ; she shrunk from impugning the honesty of the dead man -- and in the presence of his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 13]: `` It looks a little fishy , do n't it , Dawtie ?
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 6]: Why not speak straight out ?
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 12]: Perhaps you would not mind searching Meg 's trunk for me .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 16]: She may have taken it for a bit of old brass , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 15]: `` I will answer for my servants , Mr. Crawford , '' said Alexa .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 12]: `` I will not have old Meg 's box searched . ''
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 15]: `` It is desirable to get rid of any suspicion , '' replied George .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 9]: `` I have none , '' returned Alexa .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 30]: George was silent `` I will ask Meg , if you like , sir , '' said Dawtie ; `` but I am sure it will be no use .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 16]: A servant in this house soon learns not to go by the look of things .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 15]: We do n't treat anything here as if we knew all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 10]: `` When did you see the goblet first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 3]: persisted George .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 5]: `` Goblet , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 11]: I thought you were speaking of the gold cup . ''
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 11]: By _ goblet _ Dawtie understood a small iron pot .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 27]: `` Goblet , or cup , or chalice -- whatever you like to call it -- I ask how you came to know about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 9]: `` I know very little about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 13]: `` It is plain you know more than you care to tell .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 15]: If you will not answer me you will have to answer a magistrate . ''
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 17]: `` Then I will answer a magistrate , '' said Dawtie , beginning to grow angry .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 9]: `` You had better answer me , Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 7]: It will be easier for you .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 9]: What do you know about the cup ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 19]: `` I know it was not master 's , and is not yours -- really and truly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 13]: `` What can have put such a lie in your head ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 17]: `` If it be a lie , sir , it is told in plain print . ''
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 8]: But Dawtie judged it time to stop .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 17]: She bethought herself that she would not have said so much had she not been angry .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 35]: `` Sir , '' she answered , `` you have been asking me questions all this time , and I have been answering them ; it is your turn to answer me one . ''
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 7]: `` If I see proper . ''
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 14]: `` Did my old master tell you the history of that cup ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 11]: `` I do not choose to answer the question . ''
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 7]: `` Very well , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 7]: Dawtie turned to leave the room .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 3]: `` Stop !
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 3]: stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 15]: cried Crawford ; `` I have not done with you yet , my girl .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 21]: You have not told me what you meant when you said the cup did not belong to the laird . ''
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 14]: `` I do not choose to answer the question , '' said Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 11]: `` Then you shall answer it to a magistrate . ''
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 13]: `` I will , sir , '' she replied , and stood .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 5]: Crawford left the room .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 7]: He rode home in a rage .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 38]: Dawtie went about her work with a bright spot on each cheek , indignant at the man 's rudeness , but praying God to take her heart in His hand , and cool the fever of it .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 27]: The words rose in her mind : `` It must needs be that offenses come , but woe onto that man by whom they come . ''
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 61]: She was at once filled with pity for the man who could side with the wrong , and want everything his own way , for , sooner or later , confusion must be his portion ; the Lord had said : `` There is nothing covered that shall not be revealed , neither hid that shall not be known . ''
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 25]: `` He needs to be shamed , '' she said , `` but he is thy child ; care for him , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 22]: George felt that he had not borne a dignified part , and knew that his last chance with Alexa was gone .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 15]: Then he too felt the situation unendurable , and set about removing his property .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 27]: He wrote to Alexa that he could no longer doubt it her wish to be rid of the collection , and able to use the room .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 34]: It was desirable also , he said , that a thorough search should be made in those rooms before he placed the matter of the missing cup in the hands of the magistrates .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 20]: Dawtie 's last words had sufficed to remove any lingering doubt as to what had become of the chalice .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 53]: It did not occur to him that one so anxious to do the justice of restoration would hardly be capable of telling lies , of defiling her soul that a bit of property might be recovered ; he took it for granted that she meant to be liberally rewarded by the earl .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 95]: George would have ill understood the distinction Dawtie made -- that the body of the cup _ might _ belong to him , but the soul of the cup _ did _ belong to another ; or her assertion that where the soul was there the body ought to be ; or her argument that He who had the soul had the right to ransom the body -- a reasoning possible to a child-like nature only ; she had pondered to find the true law of the case , and this was her conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 18]: George suspected , and grew convinced that Alexa was a party to the abstraction of the cup .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 27]: She had , he said , begun to share in the extravagant notions of a group of pietists whose leader was that detestable fellow , Ingram .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 13]: Alexa was attached to Dawtie , and Dawtie was one of them .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 10]: He believed Alexa would do anything to spite him .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 19]: To bring trouble on Dawtie would be to punish her mistress , and the pious farmer , too .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXI .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 3]: THE PROSECUTION .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 70]: As soon as Crawford had his things away from Potlurg , satisfied the cup was nowhere among them , he made a statement of the case to a magistrate he knew ; and so represented it , as the outcome of the hypocrisy of pietism , that the magistrate , hating everything called fanatical , at once granted him a warrant to apprehend Dawtie on the charge of theft .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 6]: It was a terrible shock .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 6]: Alexa cried out with indignation .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 13]: Dawtie turned white and then red , but uttered never a word .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 18]: `` Dawtie , '' said her mistress , `` tell me what you know about the cup .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 12]: You do know something that you have not told me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 18]: `` I do , ma'am , but I will not tell it except I am forced . ''
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 12]: `` That you are going to be , my poor girl !
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 21]: I am very sorry , for I am perfectly sure you have done nothing you know to be wrong ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 15]: `` I have done nothing you or anybody would think wrong , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 16]: She put on her Sunday frock , and went down to go with the policeman .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 16]: To her joy she found her mistress at the door , ready to accompany her .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 16]: They had two miles or more to walk , but that was nothing to either .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 43]: Questioned by the magistrate , not unkindly , for her mistress was there , Dawtie told everything -- how first she came upon the likeness and history of the cup , and then saw the cup itself in her master 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 49]: Crawford told how the laird had warned him against Dawtie , giving him to understand that she had been seized with a passion for the goblet such that she would peril her soul to possess it , and that he dared not let her know where it was .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 94]: `` Sir , '' said Dawtie , `` he could na hae distrusted me like that , for he gae me his keys , and sent me to fetch the cup when he was ower ill to gang till ` t. '' `` If that be true , your worship , '' said Crawford , `` it does not affect the fact that the cup was in the hands of the old man when I left him and she went to him , and from that moment it has not been seen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 12]: `` Did he have it when you went to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 4]: asked the magistrate .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 9]: `` I didna see ` t , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 14]: He was in a kind o ' faint when I got up . ''
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 43]: Crawford said that , hearing a cry , he ran up again , and found the old man at the point of death , with just strength to cry out before he died , that Dawtie had taken the cup from him .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 35]: Dawtie was leaning over him , but he had not imagined the accusation more than the delirious fancy of a dying man , till it appeared that the cup was not to be found .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 10]: The magistrate made out Dawtie 's commitment for trial .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 43]: He remarked that she might have been misled by a false notion of duty : he had been informed that she belonged to a sect claiming the right to think for themselves on the profoundest mysteries -- and here was the result !
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 26]: There was not a man in Scotland less capable of knowing what any woman was thinking , or more incapable of doubting his own insight .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 63]: Doubtless , he went on , she had superstitiously regarded the cup as exercising a Satanic influence on the mind of her master ; but even if she confessed it now , he must make an example of one whose fanaticism would set wrong right after the notions of an illiterate sect , and not according to the laws of the land .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 12]: He just send the case to be tried by a jury !
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 24]: If she convinced the twelve men composing that jury , of the innocence she protested , she would then be a free woman .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 32]: Dawtie stood very white all the time he was speaking , and her lips every now and then quivered as if she were going to cry , but she did not .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 19]: Alexa offered bail , but his worship would not accept it : his righteous soul was too indignant .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 44]: She went to Dawtie and kissed her , and together they followed the policeman to the door , where Dawtie was to get into a spring-cart with him , and be driven to the county town , there to lie waiting the assizes .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 17]: The bad news had spread so fast that as they came out , up came Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 13]: At sight of him Dawtie gently laughed , like a pleased child .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 34]: The policeman , who , like many present , had been prejudiced by her looks in her favor , dropped behind , and she walked between her mistress and Andrew to the cart .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 4]: `` Dawtie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 3]: said Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 5]: `` Oh , Andrew !
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 6]: has God forgotten me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 6]: she returned , stopping short .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 21]: `` For God to forget , '' answered Andrew , `` would be not to be God any longer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 14]: `` But here I am on my road til a prison , Andrew !
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 13]: I didna think He would hae latten them do ` t ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 29]: `` A bairn micht jist as weel say , whan its nurse lays ' t intil its cradle , and says : ` Noo , lie still ! '
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 16]: ` Mammy , I didna think ye would hae latten her do ` t ! '
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 28]: He 's a ' aboot ye and in ye , Dawtie , and this is come to ye jist to lat ye ken ` at He is .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 13]: He raised ye up jist to spen ' His glory upo ' !
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 14]: I say , Dawtie , did Jesus Christ deserve what He got ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 7]: `` No ae bit , Andrew !
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 10]: What for should ye speir sic a thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 11]: `` Then do ye think God hae forgotten Him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 12]: `` May be He thoucht it jist for a minute ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 20]: `` Well , ye hae thoucht jist for a minute , and ye maun think it nae mair . ''
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 25]: `` But God couldna forget _ Him _ , An ` rew : He got it a ' for doin ' His will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 44]: `` Evil may come upon as from other causes than doing the will of God ; but from whatever cause it comes , the thing we have to see to is , that through it all we do the will of God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 12]: `` What 's His will noo , An ` rew ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 7]: `` That ye tak it quaietly .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 14]: Shall not the Father do wi ' His ain child what He will !
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 19]: Can He no shift it frae the tae airm to the tither , but the bairn maun girn ?
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 6]: He has ye , Dawtie !
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 7]: It 's a ' richt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 14]: `` Though He slay me , yet will I trust in Him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 3]: said Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 5]: She raised her head .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 36]: The color had come back to her face ; her lips had ceased to tremble ; she stepped on steadily to where , a few yards from the door , the spring-cart was waiting her .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 20]: She bade her mistress good-bye , then turned to Andrew and said : `` Good-bye , An ` rew !
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 6]: I am not afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 13]: `` I am going with you , Dawtie , '' said Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 12]: `` No , sir , you ca n't do that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 16]: said the policeman ; `` at least you ca n't go in the trap ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 8]: `` No , no , Andrew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 3]: cried Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 7]: `` I would rather go alone .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 6]: I am quite happy now .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 10]: God will do with me as He pleases ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 20]: `` I am going with you , '' said Alexa , `` if the policeman will let me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 7]: `` Oh , yes , ma'am !
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 5]: A lady 's different !
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 15]: -- I 've got to account for the prisoner you see , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 14]: `` I do n't think you should , ma'am , '' said Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 8]: `` It 's a long way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 12]: `` I am going , '' returned her mistress , decisively .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 8]: `` God bless you , ma'am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 3]: said Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 9]: Alexa had heard what he said to Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 8]: A new light had broken upon her .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 10]: `` God is like that , is He ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 5]: she said to herself .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 13]: `` You can go close up to Him whenever you like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXII .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 5]: A TALK AT POTLURG .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 10]: It would be three weeks before the assizes came .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 24]: The house of Potlurg was searched by the police from garret to cellar , but in vain ; the cup was not found .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 32]: As soon as they gave up searching , Alexa had the old door of the laird 's closet , discernible enough on the inside , reopened , and the room cleaned .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 13]: Almost unfurnished as it was , she made of it her sitting-parlor .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 48]: But often her work or her book would lie on her lap , and she would find herself praying for the dear father for whom she could do nothing else now , but for whom she might have done so much , had she been like Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 11]: Her servant had cared for her father more than she !
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 38]: As she sat there one morning alone , brooding a little , thinking a little , reading a little , and praying through it all , Meg appeared , and said Maister Andrew wanted to see her .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 21]: He had called more than once to inquire after Dawtie , but had not before asked to see her mistress .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 6]: Alexa felt herself unaccountably agitated .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 17]: When he walked into the room , however , she was able to receive him quietly .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 14]: He came , he said , to ask when she had seen Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 23]: He would have gone himself to see her , but his father was ailing , and he had double work to do .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 11]: Besides , she did not seem willing to see him !
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 31]: Alexa told him she had been with her the day before , and had found her a little pale , and , she feared , rather troubled in her mind .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 17]: She said she would trust God to the last , but confessed herself assailed by doubts .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 27]: `` I said to her , '' continued Alexa , '' ` Be sure , Dawtie , God will make your innocence known one day ! '
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 27]: She answered : ` Of course , ma'am , there is nothing hidden that shall not be known ; but I am not impatient about that .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 11]: The Jews to this day think Jesus an impostor ! '
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 23]: ` But surely , ' said I , ` you care that people should understand you are no thief , Dawtie ! '
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 23]: ` Yes , I do , ' she answered ; ` all I say is , that is does not trouble me .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 17]: I want only to be downright sure that God is looking after me all the time .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 16]: I am willing to sit in prison till I die , if He pleases . '
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 8]: ` God ca n't please that ! '
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 23]: ` If He does not care to take me out , I do not care to go out , ' said Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 25]: ` It 's not that I 'm good ; it 's only that I do n't care for anything He does n't care for .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 22]: What would it be that all men acquitted me , if God did not trouble Himself about His children ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 26]: `` You see , ma'am , it comes to this , '' said Andrew : `` it is God Dawtie cares about , not herself !
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 11]: If God is all right , Dawtie is all right .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 26]: The _ if _ sometimes takes one shape , sometimes another , but the fear is the same -- and the very fear is faith .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 59]: Sometimes the fear is that there may be no God , and that you might call a fear for herself ; but when Dawtie fears lest God should not be caring for her , that is a fear for God ; for if God did not care for His creature , He would be no true God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 8]: `` Then He could not exist ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 14]: `` True ; and so you are back on the other fear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 13]: `` What would you have said to her , Mr. Ingram ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 43]: `` I would have reminded her that Jesus was perfectly content with His Father ; that He knew what was coming on Himself , and never doubted Him -- just gloried that His Father was what He knew Him to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 4]: `` I see !
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 17]: But what did you mean when you said that Dawtie 's very fear was faith ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 39]: `` Think , ma'am : people that only care to be saved , that is , not to be punished for their sins , are anxious only about themselves , not about God and His glory at all .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 17]: They talk about the glory of God , but they make it consist in pure selfishness !
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 25]: According to them , He seeks everything for Himself ; which is dead against the truth of God , a diabolic slander of God .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 32]: It does not trouble them to believe such things about God ; they do not even desire that God should not be like that ; they only want to escape Him .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 32]: They dare not say God will not do this or that , however clear it be that it would not be fair ; they are in terror of contradicting the Bible .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 42]: They make more of the Bible than of God , and so fail to find the truth of the Bible , and accept things concerning God which are not in the Bible , and are the greatest of insults to Him !
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 26]: Dawtie never thinks about saving her soul ; she has no fear about her soul ; she is only anxious about God and His glory .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 22]: How the doubts come , God knows ; but if she did not love God , they would not be there .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 34]: Jesus says God will speedily avenge His elect -- those that cry day and night to Him -- which I take to mean that He will soon save them from all such miseries .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 14]: Free Dawtie from unsureness about God , and she has no fear left .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 24]: All is well , in the prison or on the throne of God , if He only be what she thinks He is .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 39]: If any one say that doubt can not coexist with faith , I answer , it can with love , and love is the greater of the two , yea , is the very heart of faith itself .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 12]: God 's children are not yet God 's men and women .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 39]: The God that many people believe in , claiming to be _ the _ religious because they believe in Him , is a God not worth believing in , a God that ought not to be believed in .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 30]: The life given by such a God would be a life not worth living , even if He made His votaries as happy as they would choose to be .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 15]: A God like that could not make a woman like Dawtie anxious about Him !
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 20]: If God be not each as Jesus , what good would the proving of her innocence be to Dawtie !
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 15]: A mighty thing indeed that the world should confess she was not a thief !
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 55]: But to know that there is a perfect God , one for us to love with all the power of love of which we feel we are capable , is worth going out of existence for ; while to know that God himself , must make every throb of consciousness a divine ecstasy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 14]: Andrew 's heart was full , and out of its fullness he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 17]: Never before had he been able in the presence of Alexa to speak as he felt .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 12]: Never before had he had any impulse to speak as now .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 24]: As soon would he have gone to sow seed on a bare rock , as words of spirit and life in her ears !
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 12]: `` I am beginning to understand you , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 6]: `` Will you forgive me ?
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 8]: I have been very self-confident and conceited !
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 19]: What a mercy things are not as I thought they were -- thought they ought to be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 19]: `` And the glory of the Lord shall cover the earth as the waters cover the sea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 3]: said Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 34]: `` And men 's hearts shall be full of bliss , because they have found their Father , and He is what He is , and they are going home to Him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 3]: He rose .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 15]: `` You will come and see me again soon -- will you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 15]: `` As often as you please , ma'am ; I am your servant . ''
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 6]: `` Then come to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 26]: He went on the morrow , and the next day , and the day after -- almost every day while Dawtie was waiting her trial .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 26]: Almost every morning Alexa went by train to see Dawtie ; and the news she brought , Andrew would carry to the girl 's parents .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 28]: Dawtie continued unwilling to see Andrew : he had had trouble enough with her already , she said ; but Andrew could not quite understand her refusal .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIII .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 4]: A GREAT OFFERING .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 14]: Two days before the assizes , Andrew was with Alexa in her parlor .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 28]: It was a cool autumn evening , and she proposed they should go on the heath , which came close up to the back of the house .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 55]: When they reached the top of the hill , a cold wind was blowing , and Andrew , full of care for old and young , man and woman , made Alexa draw her shawl closer about her throat , where , with his rough , plow-man hands , he pinned it for her .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 56]: She saw , felt , and noted his hands ; a pitying admiration , of which only the pity was foolish , woke in her ; and ere she knew , she was looking up in his face with such a light in her eyes that Andrew found himself embarrassed , and let his fall .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 59]: Moved by that sense of class-superiority which has no place in the kingdom of heaven , she attributed his modesty to self-depreciation , and the conviction rose in her , which has often risen in such as she , that there is a magnanimity demanding the sacrifice , not merely of conventional dignity , but of conventional propriety .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 49]: She felt that a great lady , to be more than great , must stoop ; that it was her part to make the approach which , between equals , was the part of the man ; the patroness _ must _ do what the woman might not .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 28]: This man was worthy of any woman ; and he should not , because of the humility that dared not presume , fail of what he deserved !
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 30]: `` Andrew , '' she said , `` I am going to do an unusual thing , but you are not like other men , and will not misunderstand !
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 21]: I know you now -- know you as far above other men as the clouds are above this heath ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 10]: `` Oh , no , no , ma'am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 3]: protested Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 16]: `` Hear me out , Andrew , '' she interrupted -- then paused a little .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 21]: `` Tell me , '' she resumed , `` ought we not to love best the best we know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 6]: `` Surely , ma'am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 14]: he answered , uncomfortable , but not anticipating what was on the way .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 10]: `` Andrew , you are the best I know !
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 5]: I have said it !
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 19]: I do not care what the world thinks ; you are more to me than all the worlds !
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 11]: If you will take me , I am yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 20]: She looked him in the face with the feeling that she had done a brave and a right thing .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 5]: Andrew stood stock-still . ''
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 7]: _ Me _ , ma'am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 14]: he gasped , and grew pale -- then red as a foggy sun .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 9]: But he made scarcely a moment 's pause .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 13]: `` It 's a God-like thing you have done , ma'am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 11]: `` But I can not make the return it deserves .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 10]: From the heart of my heart I thank you .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 7]: I can say no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 4]: His voice trembled .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 6]: She heard a stifled sob .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 9]: He had turned away to conceal his emotion .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 9]: And now came greatness indeed to the front .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 21]: Instead of drawing herself up with the bitter pride of a woman whose best is scorned , Alexa behaved divinely .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 22]: She went close to Andrew , laid her hand on his arm , and said : `` Forgive me , Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 5]: I made a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 8]: I had no right to make it .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 14]: Do not be grieved , I beg ; you are nowise to blame .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 6]: Let us continue friends ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 7]: `` Thank you , ma'am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 17]: said Andrew , in a tone of deepest gratitude ; and neither said a word more .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 10]: They walked side by side back to the house .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 23]: Said Alexa to herself : `` I have at least been refused by a man worthy of the honor I did him !
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 10]: I made no mistake in _ him _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 9]: When they reached the door , she stopped .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 23]: Andrew took off his hat , and said , holding it in his hand as he spoke : `` Good-night , ma'am !
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 13]: You _ will _ send for me if you want me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 4]: `` I will .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 3]: Good-night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 14]: said Alexa , and went in with a strange weight on her heart .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 29]: Shut in her room , she wept sorely , but not bitterly ; and the next day old Meg , at least , saw no change in her .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 14]: Said Andrew to himself : `` I will be her servant always . ''
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 7]: He was humbled , not uplifted .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIV .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 3]: ANOTHER OFFERING .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 20]: The next evening , that before the trial , Andrew presented himself at the prison , and was admitted .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 21]: Dawtie came to meet him , held out her hand , and said : `` Thank you , Andrew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 8]: `` How are you , Dawtie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 7]: `` Well enough , Andrew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 9]: `` God is with us , Dawtie . ''
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 8]: `` Are you sure , Andrew ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 37]: `` Dawtie , I can not see God 's eyes looking at me , but I am ready to do what He wants me to do , and so I feel He is with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 13]: `` Oh , Andrew , I wish I could be sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 11]: `` Let us take the risk together , Dawtie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 7]: `` What risk , Andrew ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 39]: `` The risk that makes you not sure , Dawtie -- the risk that is at once the worst and the least -- the risk that our hope should be in vain , and there is no God .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 32]: But , Dawtie , there is that in my heart that cries Christ _ did _ die , and _ did _ rise again , and God is doing His best .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 8]: His perfect love is our perfect safety .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 15]: It is hard upon Him that His own children will not trust Him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 9]: `` If He would but show Himself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 30]: `` The sight of Him now would make us believe in Him without knowing Him ; and what kind of faith would that be for Him or for us !
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 13]: We should be bad children , taking Him for a weak parent !
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 7]: We must _ know _ Him !
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 13]: When we do , there will be no fear , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 6]: We shall run straight home !
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 8]: Dawtie , shall we go together ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 7]: `` Yes , surely , Andrew !
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 5]: God knows I try .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 13]: I 'm ready to do whatever you tell me , Andrew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 5]: `` No , Dawtie !
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 16]: You must never do what I tell you , except you think it right . ''
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 7]: `` Yes , I know that .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 11]: But I am sure I should think it right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 16]: `` We 've been of one mind for a long time now , Dawtie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 16]: `` Sin ' lang afore I had ony min ' o ' my ain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 8]: responded Dawtie , turning to her vernacular .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 13]: `` Then let us be of one heart too , Dawtie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 21]: She was so accustomed to hear Andrew speak in figures , that sometimes she looked through and beyond his words .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 12]: She did so now , and seeing nothing , stood perplexed .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 7]: `` Winna ye , Dawtie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 8]: said Andrew , holding out his hands .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 15]: `` I dinna freely un ` erstan ' ye , An ` rew . ''
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 11]: `` Ye h ` avenly idiot , '' cried Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 13]: `` Wull ye be my wife , or wull ye no ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 26]: Dawtie threw her shapely arms above her head -- straight up , her head fell back , and she seemed to gaze into the unseen .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 24]: Then she gave a gasp , her arms dropped to her sides , and she would have fallen had not Andrew taken her .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 3]: `` Andrew !
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 3]: Andrew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 10]: she sighed , and was still in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 7]: `` Winna ye , Dawtie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 3]: he whispered .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 11]: `` Wait , '' she murmured ; `` wait . ''
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 8]: `` I winna wait , Dawtie . ''
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 13]: `` Wait till ye hear what they 'll say the morn . ''
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 10]: `` Dawtie , I 'm ashamed o ' ye .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 14]: What care I , an ' what daur ye care what they say .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 9]: Are ye no the Lord 's clean yowie ?
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 24]: Gien ye care for what ony man thinks o ' ye but the Lord himsel ' , ye 're no a ' His .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 49]: Gien ye care for what I think o ' ye , ither-like nor what He thinks , ye 're no sae His as I maun hae ye afore we pairt company -- which , please God , ` ill be on the ither side o ' eternity . ''
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 30]: `` But , An ` rew , it winna do to say o ' yer father 's son ` at he took his wife frae the jail . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 9]: ` Deed they s ' say naething ither !
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 6]: What ither cam I for ?
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 26]: Would ye hae me ashamed o ' ane o ' God 's elec ' -- a lady o ' the Lord 's ain coort ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 20]: `` Eh , but I 'm feart it 's a ' the compassion o ' yer hert , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 12]: Ye wad fain mak ' up to me for the disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 9]: Ye could weel do wantin ' me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 57]: `` I winna say , '' returned Andrew , `` that I couldna live wantin ' ye , for that wad be to say I wasna worth offerin ' ye , and it would be to deny Him ` at made you and me for ane anither , but I wad have a some sair time !
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 19]: I 'll jist speak to the minister to be ready the minute the Lord opens yer prison-door . ''
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 18]: The same moment in came the governor with his wife ; they were much interested in Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 23]: `` Sir , and ma'am , '' said Andrew , `` will you please witness that this woman is my wife ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 15]: `` It 's Maister Andrew Ingram o ' the Knowe , '' said Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 9]: `` He wants me to merry him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 17]: `` I want her to go before the court as my wife , '' said Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 14]: `` She would have me wait till the jury said this or that .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 7]: The jury give me my wife .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 9]: As if I did n't know her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 19]: `` You wo n't have him , I see , '' said Mrs. Innes , turning to Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 5]: `` Hae him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 19]: cried Dawtie , `` I wad hae him gien there war but the heid o ' him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 29]: `` Then you are husband and wife , '' said the governor ; `` only you should have the thing done properly by the minister -- afterward . ''
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 13]: `` I 'll see to that , sir , '' answered Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 23]: `` Come , wife , '' said the governor , `` we must let them have a few minutes alone together . ''
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 22]: `` There , '' said Andrew , when the door closed , `` ye 're my wife , noo , Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 21]: Lat them acquit ye or condemn ye , it 's you an ' me , noo , whatever come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 23]: Dawtie broke into a flood of tears -- an experience all but new to her -- and found it did her good .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 40]: She smiled as she wiped her eyes , and said : `` Weel , An ` rew , gien the Lord hasna appeart in His ain likeness to deliver me , He 's done the next best thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 16]: `` Dawtie , '' answered Andrew , `` the Lord never does the next best .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 15]: The thing He does is always better than the thing He does not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 25]: `` Lat me think , an ' I 'll try to un ` erstan ' , '' said Dawtie , but Andrew went on .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 38]: `` The best thing , whan a body 's no ready for ` t , would be the warst to gie him -- or ony gait no the thing for the Father o ' lichts to gie .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 13]: Shortbreid micht be waur for a half hungert bairn nor a stane .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 38]: But the minute it 's fit we should look upo ' the face o ' the Son o ' Man , oor ain God-born brither , we 'll see him , Dawtie ; we 'll see him .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 9]: Hert canna think what it 'll be like .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 22]: And noo , Dawtie , wull ye tell me what for ye wouldna lat me come and see ye afore ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 41]: `` I wull , An ` rew ; I was nae suner left to mysel ' i ' the prison than I faun ' mysel ' thinkin ' aboot _ you _ -- you first , and no the Lord .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 12]: I said to mysel ' , ` This is awfu ' .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 21]: I 'm leanin ' upo ' An ` rew , and no upo ' the First and the Last . '
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 36]: I saw that that was to brak awa ' frae Him that was nearest me , and trust ane that was farther awa ' -- which wasna i ' the holy rizzon o ' things .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 28]: Sae I said to mysel ' I would meet my fate wi ' the Lord alane , and wouldna hae you come ` atween Him and me .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 11]: Noo ye hae ` t , An ` rew . ''
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 15]: Andrew took her in his arms and said : `` Thank ye , Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 15]: Eh , but I _ am _ content And she thought she hadna faith .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 4]: Good-night , Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 18]: Ye maun gane to yer bed , an ' grow stoot in hert for the morn . ''
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXV .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 4]: AFTER THE VERDICT .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 18]: Through the governor of the jail Andrew obtained permission to stand near the prisoner at the trial .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 37]: The counsel for the prosecution did all he could , and the counsel for the defense not much -- at least Dawtie 's friends thought so -- and the judge summed up with the greatest impartiality .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 39]: Dawtie 's simplicity and calmness , her confidence devoid of self-assertion , had its influence on the jury , and they gave the uncomfortable verdict of '' _ Not Proven _ , '' so that Dawtie was discharged .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 10]: Alexa had a carriage ready to take her home .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 25]: As Dawtie went to it she whispered to her husband : `` Ye hae to tak me wantin ' a character , Andrew . ''
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 21]: `` Jesus went home without a character , and was well received , '' said Andrew , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 13]: `` You 'll be over to-night to see the old folk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 15]: `` Yes , Andrew ; I 'm sure the mistress will let me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 21]: `` Do n't say a word to her of our marriage , except she has heard , and mentions it .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 7]: I want to tell her myself .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 20]: You will find me at the croft when you come , and I will go back with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 19]: In the evening Dawtie came , and brought the message that her mistress would like to see him .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 11]: When he entered the room Alexa rose to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 4]: He stopped short .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 19]: `` I thank you , ma'am , '' he said , `` for your great kindness to Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 7]: We were married in the prison .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 7]: She is my wife now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 3]: `` Married !
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 4]: Your wife ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 11]: echoed Alexa , flushing , and drawing back a step .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 26]: `` I had loved her long , ma'am ; and when trouble came her the time came for me to stand by her side . ''
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 18]: `` You had not spoken to her then -- till -- '' `` Not till last night .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 18]: I said before the governor of the prison and Mrs. Innes that we were husband and wife .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 18]: If you please , ma'am , we shall have the proper ceremony as soon as possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 20]: `` I wish I had known , '' said Alexa -- almost to herself , with a troubled smile .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 12]: `` I wish you had , ma'am , '' responded Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 10]: She raised her face with a look of confidence .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 10]: `` Will you please to forget , Andrew ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 6]: Nobility had carried the day .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 13]: She had not one mean thought either of him or the girl .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 25]: `` To forget is not in man 's power , ma'am ; but I shall never think a thought you would wish unthought . ''
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 8]: She held out her hand to him .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 5]: They were friends forever .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 9]: `` Will you be married here , Andrew ?
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 11]: The house is at your service , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 17]: `` Do n't you think it ought to be at her father 's , ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 14]: `` You are right , '' said Alexa ; and she sat down .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 13]: Andrew stood in silence , for he saw she was meditating something .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 10]: At length she raised her head , and spoke .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 19]: `` You have been compelled to take the step sooner than you intended -- have you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 6]: `` Yes , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 17]: `` Then you can hardly be so well prepared as you would like to be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 6]: `` We shall manage . ''
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 13]: `` It will hardly be convenient for your mother , I fear !
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 12]: You have nowhere else to take her -- have you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 12]: `` No , ma'am ; but my mother loves us both .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 24]: And , '' he added , simply , `` where there 's room for me , there 's room for her now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 15]: `` Would you mind if I asked you how your parents take it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 7]: `` They do n't say much .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 24]: You see , ma'am , we are all proud until we learn that we have one Master , and we all are brethren .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 37]: But they will soon get over it '' When I see a man lifting up those that are beneath him , not pulling down those that are above him , I will believe in his communism .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 20]: Those who most resent being looked down upon , are in general the readiest to look down upon others .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 16]: It is not principle , it is not truth , it is themselves they regard .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 11]: Of all false divinities , Self is the most illogical .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 28]: `` If God had been the mighty monarch they represent Him , '' continued Andrew , `` He would never have let us come near Him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 15]: `` Did you hear Mr. Rackstraw 's sermon on the condescension of God ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 3]: asked Alexa .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 8]: `` The condescension of God , ma'am !
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 6]: There is no such thing .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 16]: God never condescended , with one Jove-like nod , all his mighty , eternal life !
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 21]: God condescend to His children -- their spirits born of His spirit , their hearts the children of His heart !
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 4]: No , ma'am !
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 14]: there never was a falser , uglier word in any lying sermon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 8]: His eyes flashed and his face shone .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 11]: Alexa thought she had never seen him look so grand .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 5]: `` I see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 3]: she answered .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 12]: `` I will never use the word about God again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 7]: `` Thank you , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 8]: `` Why should you thank me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 14]: `` I beg your pardon ; I had no right to thank you .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 36]: But I am so tried with the wicked things said about God by people who think they are speaking to His pleasure and not in his despite , that I am apt to talk foolishly .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 24]: I do n't wonder at God 's patience with the wicked , but I do wonder at His patience with the pious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 8]: `` They do n't know better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 15]: `` How are they to know better while they are so sure about everything !
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 25]: I would infinitely rather believe in no God at all , than in such a God as they would have me believe in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 28]: `` Oh , but Andrew , I had not a glimmer of what you meant -- of what you really objected to , or what you loved !
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 18]: Now , I can not even recall what it was I did not like in your teaching .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 38]: I think it was that , instead of listening to know what you meant , I was always thinking how to oppose you , or trying to find out by what name you were to be called .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 22]: One time I thought you were an Arminian , another time a Socinian , then a Swedenborgian , then an Arian !
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 22]: I read a history of the sects of the middle ages , just to see where I could set you down .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 30]: I told people you did not believe this , and did not believe that , when I knew neither what you believed , nor what you did not believe .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 13]: I thought I did , but it was all mistake and imagination .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 19]: When you would not discuss things with me , I thought you were afraid of losing the argument .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 28]: Now I see that , instead of disputing about opinions , I should have been saying : ` God be merciful to me a sinner ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 6]: `` God be praised ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 3]: said Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 9]: `` Ma'am , you are a free woman !
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 18]: The Father has called you , and you have said : ` Here I am . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 13]: `` I hope so , Andrew , thanks to God by you !
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 10]: But I am forgetting what I wanted to say !
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 22]: Would it not be better -- after you are married , I mean -- to let Dawtie stay with me awhile ?
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 21]: -- I will promise you not to work her too hard , '' she added , with a little laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 6]: `` I see , ma'am !
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 6]: It is just like you !
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 12]: You want people to know that you believe in her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 18]: `` Yes ; but I want also to do what I can to keep such good tenants .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 23]: Therefore I must add a room or two to your house , that there may be good accommodation for you all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 8]: `` You make thanks impossible , ma'am !
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 8]: I will speak to Dawtie about it .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 11]: I know she will be glad not to leave you !
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 11]: I will take care not to trouble the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 11]: `` You shall do just as Dawtie and you please .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 12]: Where Dawtie is , there will be room for you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 9]: Already Alexa 's pain had grown quite bearable .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 5]: Dawtie needed no persuading .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 23]: She was so rich in the possession of Andrew that she could go a hundred years without seeing him , she said .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 19]: It was only that he would come and see her , instead of her going to see him !
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 12]: In ten days they were married at her father 's cottage .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 22]: Her father and mother then accompanied her and Andrew to the Knowe , to dine with Andrew 's father and mother .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 16]: In the evening the new pair went out for a walk in the old fields .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 15]: `` It _ seems _ , Dawtie , as if God was here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 3]: said Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 9]: `` I would fain see him , Andrew !
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 12]: I would rather _ you _ went out than God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 9]: `` Suppose he was nowhere , Dawtie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 22]: `` If God werena in _ you _ , ye wadna be what ye are to yer ignorant Dawtie , Andrew !
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 13]: She needs her Father in h ` aven sairer nor her Andrew !
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 18]: But I 'm sayin ' things sae true ` at it 's jist silly to say them !
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 27]: Eh , it 's like h ` aven itsel ' to be oot o ' that prison , an ' walkin ' aboot wi ' you !
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 8]: God has gien me a ' thing !
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 11]: -- jist _ a ' thing _ , Andrew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 14]: `` God was wi ' ye i ' the prison , Dawtie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 3]: `` Ay !
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 12]: But I like better to be wi ' Him here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 16]: `` An ' ye may be sure He likes better to ha'e ye here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 3]: rejoined Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXVI .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 4]: AGAIN THE GOBLET .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 17]: The next day Alexa set Dawtie to search the house yet again for the missing goblet .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 7]: `` It must be somewhere ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 18]: `` We are beset with an absolute contradiction : the thing ca n't be in the house !
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 9]: and it must be in the house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 24]: `` If we do find it , '' returned Dawtie , `` folk 'll say them ` at could hide could weel seek !
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 12]: I s ' luik naegait wantin ' you , mem ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 26]: The study was bare of books , and the empty shelves gave no hint of concealment They stood in its dreariness looking vaguely round them .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 42]: `` Did it ever come to ye , mem , '' said Dawtie , `` that a minute or twa passed between Mr. Crawford comin ' doon the stair wi ' you , and me gaein ' up to the maister ?
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 76]: When I gaed intil the room , he lay pantin ' i ' the bed ; but as I broodit upo ' ilka thing alane i ' the prison , he cam afore me , there i ' the bed , as gien he had gotten oot o ' ` t , and hidden awa ' the cup , and was jist gotten intil ' t again , the same moment I cam in . ''
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 9]: `` Dying people will do strange things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 4]: rejoined her mistress .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 11]: `` But it brings us no nearer the cup ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 13]: `` The surer we are , the better we 'll seek ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 3]: said Dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 17]: They began , and went over the room thoroughly -- looking everywhere they could think of .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 46]: They had all but given it up to go on elsewhere , when Dawtie , standing again in the middle and looking about in a sort of unconscious hopelessness , found her eyes on the mantel-shelf , and went and laid her hand upon it .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 20]: It was of wood , and she fancied it a little loose , but she could not move it .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 13]: `` When Andrew comes we 'll get him to examine it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 3]: said Alexa .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 16]: He came in the evening , and Alexa told him what they had been doing .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 19]: She begged him to get tools , and see whether there was not a space under the mantel-shelf .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 62]: But Andrew , accustomed to ponder contrivances with Sandy , would have a good look at it first He came presently upon a clever little spring , pressing which he could lift the shelf : there under it , sure enough , in rich response to the candle he held , flashed the gems of the curiously wrought chalice of gold !
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 17]: Alexa gave a cry , Andrew drew a deep breath , Dawtie laughed like a child .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 33]: How they gazed on it , passed it from one to the other , pored over the gems , and over the raised work that inclosed them , I need not tell .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 13]: They began to talk about what was to be done with it .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 10]: `` We will send it to the earl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 3]: said Alexa .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 19]: `` No , '' said Andrew ; `` that would be to make ourselves judges in the case !
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 25]: Your father must have paid money for it ; he gave it to Mr. Crawford , and Mr. Crawford must not be robbed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 6]: `` Stop , Andrew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 3]: said Alexa .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 27]: `` Everything in the next room was left to my cousin , with the library in this ; whatever else was left him was individually described .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 14]: The cup was not in the next room , and was not mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 14]: Providence has left us to do with it as we may judge right .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 16]: I think it ought to be taken to Borland Hall -- and by Dawtie . ''
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 10]: She will mention that your father bought it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 11]: `` I will not take a shilling for it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 20]: `` Is not that because you are not quite sure you have the right to dispose of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 21]: `` I would not take the price of it if my father had left the cup expressly to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 18]: `` Had he done so , you would have a right to what he paid for it .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 17]: To give the earl the choice of securing it , would be a service rendered him .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 18]: If he were too poor to buy it , the thing would have to be considered . ''
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 10]: `` Nothing could make me touch money for it .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 18]: George would never doubt we had concealed it in order to trick him out of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 9]: `` He will think so all the same .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 19]: It will satisfy him , and not a few beside , that Dawtie ought to have been convicted .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 16]: The thing is certainly Mr. Crawford 's -- that is , his as not yours .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 29]: Your father undoubtedly meant him to have the cup ; and God would not have you , even to serve the right , take advantage of an accident .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 49]: Whatever ought to be done with the cup , Mr. Crawford ought to do it ; it is his business to do right in regard to it ; and whatever advantage may be gained by doing right , Mr. Crawford ought to have the chance of gaining it .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 27]: Would you deprive him of the opportunity , to which at least he has a right , of doing justice , and delivering his soul ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 21]: `` You would have us tell the earl that his cup is found , but Mr. Crawford claims it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 3]: said Alexa .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 29]: `` Andrew would have us take it to Mr. Crawford , '' said Dawtie , `` and tell him that the earl has a claim to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 44]: `` Tell him also , '' said Andrew , `` where it was found , showing he has no _ legal _ right to it ; and tell him he has no more moral right to it than the laird could give him .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 65]: Tell him , ma'am , '' continued Andrew , `` that you expect him to take it to the earl , that he may buy it if he will ; and say that if , after a fortnight , you find it is not in the earl 's possession , you will yourself ascertain from him whether the offer has been made him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 10]: `` That is just right , '' said Alexa .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 7]: And so the thing was done .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 19]: The cup is now in the earl 's collection , and without any further interference on her part .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 68]: A few days after she and Dawtie carried the cup to Crawford , a parcel arrived at Potlurg , containing a beautiful silver case , and inside the case the jeweled watch -- with a letter from George , begging Alexa to accept his present , and assuring her of his conviction that the moment he annoyed her with any further petition , she would return it .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 28]: He expressed his regret that he had brought such suffering upon Dawtie , and said he was ready to make whatever amends her husband might think fit .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 9]: Alexa accepted the watch , and wore it .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 11]: She thought her father would like her to do so .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXVII .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 5]: THE HOUR BEFORE DAWN .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 9]: The friendship of the three was never broken .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 54]: I will not say that , as she lay awake in the dark , the eyes of Alexa never renewed the tears of that autumn night on which she turned her back upon the pride of self , but her tears were never those of bitterness , of self-scorn , or of self-pity .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 22]: `` If I am to be pitied , '' she would say to herself , `` let the Lord pity me !
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 11]: I am not ashamed , and will not be sorry .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 13]: I have nothing to resent ; no one has wronged me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 6]: Andrew died in middle age .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 24]: His wife said the Master wanted him for something nobody else could do , or He would not have taken him from her .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 12]: She wept and took comfort , for she lived in expectation .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 56]: One night when she and Alexa were sitting together at Potlurg , about a month after his burial , speaking of many things with the freedom of a long and tried love , Alexa said , after a pause of some duration : `` Were you not very angry with me then , Dawtie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 6]: `` When , ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 7]: `` When Andrew told you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 7]: `` Told me what , ma'am ?
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 16]: I must be stupid to-night , for I ca n't think what you mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 16]: `` When he told you I wanted him , not knowing he was yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 25]: `` I ken naething o ' what ye 're mintin ' at , mem , '' persisted Dawtie , in a tone of bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 3]: `` Oh !
