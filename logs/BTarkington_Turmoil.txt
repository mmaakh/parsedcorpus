Parsing [sent. 1 len. 9]: THE TURMOIL A NOVEL By Booth Tarkington 1915 .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 3]: To Laurel .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 31]: CHAPTER I There is a midland city in the heart of fair , open country , a dirty and wonderful city nesting dingily in the fog of its own smoke .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 21]: The stranger must feel the dirt before he feels the wonder , for the dirt will be upon him instantly .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 58]: It will be upon him and within him , since he must breathe it , and he may care for no further proof that wealth is here better loved than cleanliness ; but whether he cares or not , the negligently tended streets incessantly press home the point , and so do the flecked and grimy citizens .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 32]: At a breeze he must smother in the whirlpools of dust , and if he should decline at any time to inhale the smoke he has the meager alternative of suicide .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 17]: The smoke is like the bad breath of a giant panting for more and more riches .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 13]: He gets them and pants the fiercer , smelling and swelling prodigiously .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 20]: He has a voice , a hoarse voice , hot and rapacious trained to one tune : `` Wealth !
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 5]: I will get Wealth !
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 5]: I will make Wealth !
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 8]: I will sell Wealth for more Wealth !
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 32]: My house shall be dirty , my garment shall be dirty , and I will foul my neighbor so that he can not be clean -- but I will get Wealth !
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 28]: There shall be no clean thing about me : my wife shall be dirty and my child shall be dirty , but I will get Wealth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 22]: And yet it is not wealth that he is so greedy for : what the giant really wants is hasty riches .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 18]: To get these he squanders wealth upon the four winds , for wealth is in the smoke .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 50]: Not so long ago as a generation , there was no panting giant here , no heaving , grimy city ; there was but a pleasant big town of neighborly people who had understanding of one another , being , on the whole , much of the same type .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 53]: It was a leisurely and kindly place -- `` homelike , '' it was called -- and when the visitor had been taken through the State Asylum for the Insane and made to appreciate the view of the cemetery from a little hill , his host 's duty as Baedeker was done .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 21]: The good burghers were given to jogging comfortably about in phaetons or in surreys for a family drive on Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 23]: No one was very rich ; few were very poor ; the air was clean , and there was time to live .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 63]: But there was a spirit abroad in the land , and it was strong here as elsewhere -- a spirit that had moved in the depths of the American soil and labored there , sweating , till it stirred the surface , rove the mountains , and emerged , tangible and monstrous , the god of all good American hearts -- Bigness .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 8]: And that god wrought the panting giant .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 16]: In the souls of the burghers there had always been the profound longing for size .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 17]: Year by year the longing increased until it became an accumulated force : We must Grow !
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 5]: We must be Big !
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 5]: We must be Bigger !
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 4]: Bigness means Money !
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 14]: And the thing began to happen ; their longing became a mighty Will .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 5]: We must be Bigger !
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 2]: Bigger !
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 2]: Bigger !
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 4]: Get people here !
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 4]: Coax them here !
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 3]: Bribe them !
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 13]: Swindle them into coming , if you must , but get them !
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 5]: Shout them into coming !
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 5]: Deafen them into coming !
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 10]: Any kind of people ; all kinds of people !
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 5]: We must be Bigger !
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 2]: Blow !
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 2]: Boost !
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 2]: Brag !
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 4]: Kill the fault-finder !
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 14]: Scream and bellow to the Most High : Bigness is patriotism and honor !
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 8]: Bigness is love and life and happiness !
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 4]: Bigness is Money !
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 4]: We want Bigness !
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 4]: They got it .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 31]: From all the states the people came ; thinly at first , and slowly , but faster and faster in thicker and thicker swarms as the quick years went by .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 38]: White people came , and black people and brown people and yellow people ; the negroes came from the South by the thousands and thousands , multiplying by other thousands and thousands faster than they could die .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 78]: From the four quarters of the earth the people came , the broken and the unbroken , the tame and the wild -- Germans , Irish , Italians , Hungarians , Scotch , Welsh , English , French , Swiss , Swedes , Norwegians , Greeks , Poles , Russian Jews , Dalmatians , Armenians , Rumanians , Servians , Persians , Syrians , Japanese , Chinese , Turks , and every hybrid that these could propagate .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 26]: And if there were no Eskimos nor Patagonians , what other human strain that earth might furnish failed to swim and bubble in this crucible ?
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 34]: With Bigness came the new machinery and the rush ; the streets began to roar and rattle , the houses to tremble ; the pavements were worn under the tread of hurrying multitudes .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 55]: The old , leisurely , quizzical look of the faces was lost in something harder and warier ; and a cockney type began to emerge discernibly -- a cynical young mongrel barbaric of feature , muscular and cunning ; dressed in good fabrics fashioned apparently in imitation of the sketches drawn by newspaper comedians .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 32]: The female of his kind came with him -- a pale girl , shoddy and a little rouged ; and they communicated in a nasal argot , mainly insolences and elisions .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 53]: Nay , the common speech of the people showed change : in place of the old midland vernacular , irregular but clean , and not unwholesomely drawling , a jerky dialect of coined metaphors began to be heard , held together by GUNNAS and GOTTAS and much fostered by the public journals .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 67]: The city piled itself high in the center , tower on tower for a nucleus , and spread itself out over the plain , mile after mile ; and in its vitals , like benevolent bacilli contending with malevolent in the body of a man , missions and refuges offered what resistance they might to the saloons and all the hells that cities house and shelter .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 44]: Temptation and ruin were ready commodities on the market for purchase by the venturesome ; highwaymen walked the streets at night and sometimes killed ; snatching thieves were busy everywhere in the dusk ; while house-breakers were a common apprehension and frequent reality .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 46]: Life itself was somewhat safer from intentional destruction than it was in medieval Rome during a faction war -- though the Roman murderer was more like to pay for his deed -- but death or mutilation beneath the wheels lay in ambush at every crossing .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 30]: The politicians let the people make all the laws they liked ; it did not matter much , and the taxes went up , which is good for politicians .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 13]: Law-making was a pastime of the people ; nothing pleased them more .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 14]: Singular fermentation of their humor , they even had laws forbidding dangerous speed .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 11]: More marvelous still , they had a law forbidding smoke !
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 12]: They forbade chimneys to smoke and they forbade cigarettes to smoke .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 42]: They made laws for all things and forgot them immediately ; though sometimes they would remember after a while , and hurry to make new laws that the old laws should be enforced -- and then forget both new and old .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 21]: Wherever enforcement threatened Money or Votes -- or wherever it was too much to bother -- it became a joke .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 5]: Influence was the law .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 5]: So the place grew .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 5]: And it grew strong .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 27]: Straightway when he came , each man fell to the same worship : Give me of thyself , O Bigness : Power to get more power !
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 6]: Riches to get more riches !
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 11]: Give me of thy sweat that I may sweat more !
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 22]: Give me Bigness to get more Bigness to myself , O Bigness , for Thine is the Power and the Glory !
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 13]: And there is no end but Bigness , ever and for ever !
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 39]: CHAPTER II The Sheridan Building was the biggest skyscraper ; the Sheridan Trust Company was the biggest of its kind , and Sheridan himself had been the biggest builder and breaker and truster and buster under the smoke .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 96]: He had come from a country cross-roads , at the beginning of the growth , and he had gone up and down in the booms and relapses of that period ; but each time he went down he rebounded a little higher , until finally , after a year of overwork and anxiety -- the latter not decreased by a chance , remote but possible , of recuperation from the former in the penitentiary -- he found himself on top , with solid substance under his feet ; and thereafter `` played it safe . ''
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 21]: But his hunger to get was unabated , for it was in the very bones of him and grew fiercer .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 6]: He was the city incarnate .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 24]: He loved it , calling it God 's country , as he called the smoke Prosperity , breathing the dingy cloud with relish .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 16]: And when soot fell upon his cuff he chuckled ; he could have kissed it .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 5]: `` It 's good !
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 5]: It 's good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 10]: he said , and smacked his lips in gusto .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 16]: `` Good , clean soot ; it 's our life-blood , God bless it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 26]: The smoke was one of his great enthusiasms ; he laughed at a committee of plaintive housewives who called to beg his aid against it .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 21]: `` Smoke 's what brings your husbands ' money home on Saturday night , '' he told them , jovially .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 28]: `` Smoke may hurt your little shrubberies in the front yard some , but it 's the catarrhal climate and the adenoids that starts your chuldern coughing .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 6]: Smoke makes the climate better .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 12]: Smoke means good health : it makes the people wash more .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 12]: They have to wash so much they wash off the microbes .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 43]: You go home and ask your husbands what smoke puts in their pockets out o ' the pay-roll -- and you 'll come around next time to get me to turn out more smoke instead o ' chokin ' it off ! ''
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 40]: It was Narcissism in him to love the city so well ; he saw his reflection in it ; and , like it , he was grimy , big , careless , rich , strong , and unquenchably optimistic .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 21]: From the deepest of his inside all the way out he believed it was the finest city in the world .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 7]: `` Finest '' was his word .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 56]: He thought of it as his city as he thought of his family as his family ; and just as profoundly believed his city to be the finest city in the world , so did he believe his family to be -- in spite of his son Bibbs -- the finest family in the world .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 14]: As a matter of fact , he knew nothing worth knowing about either .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 28]: Bibbs Sheridan was a musing sort of boy , poor in health , and considered the failure -- the `` odd one '' -- of the family .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 41]: Born during that most dangerous and anxious of the early years , when the mother fretted and the father took his chance , he was an ill-nourished baby , and grew meagerly , only lengthwise , through a feeble childhood .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 72]: At his christening he was committed for life to `` Bibbs '' mainly through lack of imagination on his mother 's part , for though it was her maiden name , she had no strong affection for it ; but it was `` her turn '' to name the baby , and , as she explained later , she `` could n't think of anything else she liked AT ALL ! ''
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 30]: She offered this explanation one day when the sickly boy was nine and after a long fit of brooding had demanded some reason for his name 's being Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 49]: He requested then with unwonted vehemence to be allowed to exchange names with his older brother , Roscoe Conkling Sheridan , or with the oldest , James Sheridan , Junior , and upon being refused went down into the cellar and remained there the rest of that day .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 31]: And the cook , descending toward dusk , reported that he had vanished ; but a search revealed that he was in the coal-pile , completely covered and still burrowing .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 26]: Removed by force and carried upstairs , he maintained a cryptic demeanor , refusing to utter a syllable of explanation , even under the lash .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 45]: This obvious thing was wholly a mystery to both parents ; the mother was nonplussed , failed to trace and connect ; and the father regarded his son as a stubborn and mysterious fool , an impression not effaced as the years went by .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 73]: At twenty-two , Bibbs was physically no more than the outer scaffolding of a man , waiting for the building to begin inside -- a long-shanked , long-faced , rickety youth , sallow and hollow and haggard , dark-haired and dark-eyed , with a peculiar expression of countenance ; indeed , at first sight of Bibbs Sheridan a stranger might well be solicitous , for he seemed upon the point of tears .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 57]: But to a slightly longer gaze , not grief , but mirth , was revealed as his emotion ; while a more searching scrutiny was proportionately more puzzling -- he seemed about to burst out crying or to burst out laughing , one or the other , inevitably , but it was impossible to decide which .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 17]: And Bibbs never , on any occasion of his life , either laughed aloud or wept .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 10]: He was a `` disappointment '' to his father .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 29]: At least that was the parent 's word -- a confirmed and established word after his first attempt to make a `` business man '' of the boy .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 53]: He sent Bibbs to `` begin at the bottom and learn from the ground up '' in the machine-shop of the Sheridan Automatic Pump Works , and at the end of six months the family physician sent Bibbs to begin at the bottom and learn from the ground up in a sanitarium .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 14]: `` You need n't worry , mamma , '' Sheridan told his wife .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 20]: `` There 's nothin ' the matter with Bibbs except he hates work so much it makes him sick .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 25]: I put him in the machine-shop , and I guess I know what I 'm doin ' about as well as the next man .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 12]: Ole Doc Gurney always was one o ' them nutty alarmists .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 17]: Does he think I 'd do anything 'd be bad for my own flesh and blood ?
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 6]: He makes me tired ! ''
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 14]: Anything except perfectly definite health or perfectly definite disease was incomprehensible to Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 33]: He had a genuine conviction that lack of physical persistence in any task involving money must be due to some subtle weakness of character itself , to some profound shiftlessness or slyness .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 65]: He understood typhoid fever , pneumonia , and appendicitis -- one had them , and either died or got over them and went back to work -- but when the word `` nervous '' appeared in a diagnosis he became honestly suspicious : he had the feeling that there was something contemptible about it , that there was a nigger in the wood-pile somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 9]: `` Look at me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 10]: `` Look at what I did at his age !
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 24]: Why , when I was twenty years old , was n't I up every morning at four o'clock choppin ' wood -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 19]: and out in the dark and the snow -- to build a fire in a country grocery store ?
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 17]: And here Bibbs has to go and have a DOCTOR because he ca n't -- Pho !
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 5]: it makes me tired !
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 16]: If he 'd gone at it like a man he would n't be sick . ''
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 30]: He paced the bedroom -- the usual setting for such parental discussions -- in his nightgown , shaking his big , grizzled head and gesticulating to his bedded spouse .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 5]: `` My Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 27]: `` If a little , teeny bit o ' work like this is too much for him , why , he ai n't fit for anything !
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 37]: It 's nine-tenths imagination , and the rest of it -- well , I wo n't say it 's deliberate , but I WOULD like to know just how much of it 's put on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 13]: `` Bibbs did n't want the doctor , '' said Mrs. Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 21]: `` It was when he was here to dinner that night , and noticed how he could n't eat anything .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 9]: Honey , you better come to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 4]: `` Eat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 3]: he snorted .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 3]: `` Eat !
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 8]: It 's work that makes men eat !
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 11]: And it 's imagination that keeps people from eatin ' .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 53]: Busy men do n't get time for that kind of imagination ; and there 's another thing you 'll notice about good health , if you 'll take the trouble to look around you Mrs. Sheridan : busy men have n't got time to be sick and they do n't GET sick .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 14]: You just think it over and you 'll find that ninety-nine per cent .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 12]: of the sick people you know are either women or loafers .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 5]: Yes , ma'am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 18]: `` Honey , '' she said again , drowsily , `` you better come to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 13]: `` Look at the other boys , '' her husband bade her .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 7]: `` Look at Jim and Roscoe .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 6]: Look at how THEY work !
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 10]: There is n't a shiftless bone in their bodies .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 8]: Work never made Jim or Roscoe sick .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 10]: Jim takes half the load off my shoulders already .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 18]: Right now there is n't a harder-workin ' , brighter business man in this city than Jim .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 14]: I 've pushed him , but he give me something to push AGAINST .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 9]: You ca n't push ` nervous dyspepsia ' !
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 53]: And look at Roscoe ; just LOOK at what that boy 's done for himself , and barely twenty-seven years old -- married , got a fine wife , and ready to build for himself with his own money , when I put up the New House for you and Edie . ''
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 16]: `` Papa , you 'll catch cold in your bare feet , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 8]: `` You better come to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 31]: `` And I 'm just as proud of Edie , for a girl , '' he continued , emphatically , `` as I am of Jim and Roscoe for boys .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 14]: She 'll make some man a mighty good wife when the time comes .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 12]: She 's the prettiest and talentedest girl in the United States !
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 40]: Look at that poem she wrote when she was in school and took the prize with ; it 's the best poem I ever read in my life , and she 'd never even tried to write one before .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 46]: It 's the finest thing I ever read , and R. T. Bloss said so , too ; and I guess he 's a good enough literary judge for me -- turns out more advertisin ' liter ` cher than any man in the city .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 7]: I tell you she 's smart !
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 30]: Look at the way she worked me to get me to promise the New House -- and I guess you had your finger in that , too , mamma !
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 21]: This old shack 's good enough for me , but you and little Edie 'll have to have your way .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 17]: I 'll get behind her and push her the same as I will Jim and Roscoe .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 13]: I tell you I 'm mighty proud o ' them three chuldern !
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 11]: But Bibbs -- '' He paused , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 41]: `` Honest , mamma , when I talk to men that got ALL their boys doin ' well and worth their salt , why , I have to keep my mind on Jim and Roscoe and forget about Bibbs . ''
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 10]: Mrs. Sheridan tossed her head fretfully upon the pillow .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 30]: `` You did the best you could , papa , '' she said , impatiently , `` so come to bed and quit reproachin ' yourself for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 6]: He glared at her indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 6]: `` Reproachin ' myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 3]: he snorted .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 11]: `` I ai n't doin ' anything of the kind !
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 15]: What in the name o ' goodness would I want to reproach myself for ?
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 13]: And it was n't the ` best I could , ' either .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 7]: It was the best ANYBODY could !
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 34]: I was givin ' him a chance to show what was in him and make a man of himself -- and here he goes and gets ` nervous dyspepsia ' on me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 20]: He went to the old-fashioned gas-fixture , turned out the light , and muttered his way morosely into bed .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 12]: said his wife , crossly , bothered by a subsequent mumbling .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 15]: `` More like hook-worm , I said , '' he explained , speaking louder .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 12]: `` I do n't know what to do with him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 61]: CHAPTER III Beginning at the beginning and learning from the ground up was a long course for Bibbs at the sanitarium , with milk and `` zwieback '' as the basis of instruction ; and the months were many and tiresome before he was considered near enough graduation to go for a walk leaning on a nurse and a cane .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 46]: These and subsequent months saw the planning , the building , and the completion of the New House ; and it was to that abode of Bigness that Bibbs was brought when the cane , without the nurse , was found sufficient to his support .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 7]: Edith met him at the station .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 8]: `` Well , well , Bibbs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 21]: she said , as he came slowly through the gates , the last of all the travelers from that train .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 30]: She gave his hand a brisk little shake , averting her eyes after a quick glance at him , and turning at once toward the passage to the street .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 12]: `` Do you think they ought to 've let you come ?
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 8]: You certainly do n't look well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 38]: `` But I certainly do look better , '' he returned , in a voice as slow as his gait ; a drawl that was a necessity , for when Bibbs tried to speak quickly he stammered .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 15]: `` Up to about a month ago it took two people to see me .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 12]: They had to get me in a line between 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 56]: Edith did not turn her eyes directly toward him again , after her first quick glance ; and her expression , in spite of her , showed a faint , troubled distaste , the look of a healthy person pressed by some obligation of business to visit a `` bad '' ward in a hospital .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 33]: She was nineteen , fair and slim , with small , unequal features , but a prettiness of color and a brilliancy of eyes that created a total impression close upon beauty .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 34]: Her movements were eager and restless : there was something about her , as kind old ladies say , that was very sweet ; and there was something that was hurried and breathless .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 49]: This was new to Bibbs ; it was a perceptible change since he had last seen her , and he bent upon her a steady , whimsical scrutiny as they stood at the curb , waiting for an automobile across the street to disengage itself from the traffic .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 11]: `` That 's the new car , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 5]: `` Everything 's new .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 10]: We 've got four now , besides Jim 's .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 6]: Roscoe 's got two . ''
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 13]: `` Edith , you look -- '' he began , and paused .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 40]: `` Oh , WE 're all well , '' she said , briskly ; and then , as if something in his tone had caught her as significant , `` Well , HOW do I look , Bibbs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 60]: `` You look -- '' He paused again , taking in the full length of her -- her trim brown shoes , her scant , tapering , rough skirt , and her coat of brown and green , her long green tippet and her mad little rough hat in the mad mode -- all suited to the October day .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 7]: `` How do I look ? ''
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 3]: she insisted .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 31]: `` You look , '' he answered , as his examination ended upon an incrusted watch of platinum and enamel at her wrist , `` you look -- expensive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 40]: That was a substitute for what he intended to say , for her constraint and preoccupation , manifested particularly in her keeping her direct glance away from him , did not seem to grant the privilege of impulsive intimacies .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 7]: `` I expect I am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 12]: she laughed , and sidelong caught the direction of his glance .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 32]: `` Of course I ought n't to wear it in the daytime -- it 's an evening thing , for the theater -- but my day wrist-watch is out of gear .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 13]: Bobby Lamhorn broke it yesterday ; he 's a regular rowdy sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 10]: Do you want Claus to help you in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 8]: `` Oh no , '' said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 6]: `` I 'm alive . ''
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 29]: And after a fit of panting subsequent to his climbing into the car unaided , he added , `` Of course , I have to TELL people ! ''
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 29]: `` We only got your telegram this morning , '' she said , as they began to move rapidly through the `` wholesale district '' neighboring the station .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 12]: `` Mother said she 'd hardly expected you this month . ''
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 20]: `` They seemed to be through with me up there in the country , '' he explained , gently .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 28]: `` At least they said they were , and they would n't keep me any longer , because so many really sick people wanted to get in .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 18]: They told me to go home -- and I did n't have any place else to go .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 21]: It 'll be all right , Edith ; I 'll sit in the woodshed until after dark every day . ''
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 4]: `` Pshaw ! ''
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 4]: She laughed nervously .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 15]: `` Of course we 're all of us glad to have you back . ''
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 4]: `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 4]: `` Father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 4]: `` Of course !
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 12]: Did n't he write and tell you to come home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 10]: She did not turn to him with the question .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 11]: All the while she rode with her face directly forward .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 14]: `` No , '' he said ; `` father has n't written . ''
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 5]: She flushed a little .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 27]: `` I expect I ought to 've written sometime , or one of the boys -- '' `` Oh no ; that was all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 16]: `` You ca n't think how busy we 've all been this year , Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 21]: I often planned to write -- and then , just as I was going to , something would turn up .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 16]: And I 'm sure it 's been just the same way with Jim and Roscoe .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 16]: Of course we knew mamma was writing often and -- '' `` Of course ! ''
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 5]: he said , readily .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 14]: `` There 's a chunk of coal fallen on your glove , Edith .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 8]: Better flick it off before it smears .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 3]: My word !
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 11]: I 'd almost forgotten how sooty it is here . ''
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 15]: `` We 've been having very bright weather this month -- for us . ''
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 13]: She blew the flake of soot into the air , seeming relieved .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 31]: He looked up at the dingy sky , wherein hung the disconsolate sun like a cold tin pan nailed up in a smoke-house by some lunatic , for a decoration .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 7]: `` It 's very gay . ''
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 19]: A few moments later , as they passed a corner , `` Are n't we going home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 5]: `` Why , yes !
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 10]: Did you want to go somewhere else first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 16]: Your new driver 's taking us out of the way , is n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 4]: This is right .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 7]: We 're going straight home . ''
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 8]: `` But we 've passed the corner .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 10]: We always turned -- '' `` Good gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 9]: `` Did n't you know we 'd moved ?
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 12]: Did n't you know we were in the New House ? ''
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 6]: `` Why , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 3]: said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 5]: `` Are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 8]: `` We 've been there a month !
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 3]: Good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 48]: Did n't you know -- '' She broke off , flushing again , and then went on hastily : `` Of course , mamma 's never been so busy in her life ; we ALL have n't had time to do anything but keep on the hop .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 10]: Mamma could n't even come to the station to-day .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 41]: Papa 's got some of his business friends and people from around the OLD-house neighborhood coming to-night for a big dinner and ` house-warming ' -- dreadful kind of people -- but mamma 's got it all on her hands .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 30]: She 's never sat down a MINUTE ; and if she did , papa would have her up again before -- '' `` Of course , '' said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 11]: `` Do you like the new place , Edith ? ''
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 34]: `` I do n't like some of the things father WOULD have in it , but it 's the finest house in town , and that ought to be good enough for me !
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 43]: Papa bought one thing I like -- a view of the Bay of Naples in oil that 's perfectly beautiful ; it 's the first thing you see as you come in the front hall , and it 's eleven feet long .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 22]: But he would have that old fruit picture we had in the Murphy Street house hung up in the new dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 31]: You remember it -- a table and a watermelon sliced open , and a lot of rouged-looking apples and some shiny lemons , with two dead prairie-chickens on a chair ?
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 35]: He bought it at a furniture-store years and years ago , and he claims it 's a finer picture than any they saw in the museums , that time he took mamma to Europe .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 67]: But it 's horribly out of date to have those things in dining-rooms , and I caught Bobby Lamhorn giggling at it ; and Sibyl made fun of it , too , with Bobby , and then told papa she agreed with him about its being such a fine thing , and said he did just right to insist on having it where he wanted it .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 5]: She makes me tired !
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 3]: Sibyl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 42]: Edith 's first constraint with her brother , amounting almost to awkwardness , vanished with this theme , though she still kept her full gaze always to the front , even in the extreme ardor of her denunciation of her sister-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 4]: `` SIBYL ! ''
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 19]: she repeated , with such heat and vigor that the name seemed to strike fire on her lips .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 23]: `` I 'd like to know why Roscoe could n't have married somebody from HERE that would have done us some good !
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 44]: He could have got in with Bobby Lamhorn years ago just as well as now , and Bobby 'd have introduced him to the nicest girls in town , but instead of that he had to go and pick up this Sibyl Rink !
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 31]: I met some awfully nice people from her town when mamma and I were at Atlantic City , last spring , and not one had ever heard of the Rinks !
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 7]: Not even HEARD of 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 14]: `` I thought you were great friends with Sibyl , '' Bibbs said .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 11]: `` Up to the time I found her out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 8]: the sister returned , with continuing vehemence .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 21]: `` I 've found out some things about Mrs. Roscoe Sheridan lately -- '' `` It 's only lately ? ''
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 12]: `` Well -- '' Edith hesitated , her lips setting primly .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 22]: `` Of course , I always did see that she never cared the snap of her little finger about ROSCOE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 19]: `` It seems , '' said Bibbs , in laconic protest , `` that she married him . ''
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 34]: The sister emitted a shrill cry , to be interpreted as contemptuous laughter , and , in her emotion , spoke too impulsively : `` Why , she 'd have married YOU ! ''
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 18]: `` No , no , '' he said ; `` she could n't be that bad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 12]: `` I did n't mean -- '' she began , distressed .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 22]: `` I only meant -- I did n't mean -- '' `` Never mind , Edith , '' he consoled her .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 36]: `` You see , she could n't have married me , because I did n't know her ; and besides , if she 's as mercenary as all that she 'd have been too clever .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 16]: The head doctor even had to lend me the money for my ticket home . ''
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 14]: `` I did n't mean anything unpleasant about YOU , '' Edith babbled .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 30]: `` I only meant I thought she was the kind of girl who was so simply crazy to marry somebody she 'd have married anybody that asked her . ''
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 16]: `` Yes , yes , '' said Bibbs , `` it 's all straight . ''
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 26]: And , perceiving that his sister 's expression was that of a person whose adroitness has set matters perfectly to rights , he chuckled silently .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 16]: `` Roscoe 's perfectly lovely to her , '' she continued , a moment later .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 4]: `` Too lovely !
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 35]: If he 'd wake up a little and lay down the law , some day , like a MAN , I guess she 'd respect him more and learn to behave herself ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 5]: ` Behave ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 41]: `` Oh , well , I mean she 's so insincere , '' said Edith , characteristically evasive when it came to stating the very point to which she had led , and in this not unique of her sex .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 8]: Bibbs contented himself with a non-committal gesture .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 27]: `` Business is crawling up the old streets , '' he said , his long , tremulous hand indicating a vasty structure in course of erection .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 22]: `` The boarding-houses come first and then the -- '' `` That is n't for shops , '' she informed him .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 17]: `` That 's a new investment of papa 's -- the ` Sheridan Apartments . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 9]: `` Well , well , '' he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 15]: `` I supposed ` Sheridan ' was almost well enough known here already . ''
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 11]: `` Oh , we 're well enough known ABOUT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 5]: she said , impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 26]: `` I guess there is n't a man , woman , child , or nigger baby in town that does n't know who we are .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 11]: But we are n't in with the right people . ''
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 7]: `` Who 's all that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 7]: `` Who 's all what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 8]: `` The ` right people . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 35]: `` You know what I mean : the best people , the old families -- the people that have the real social position in this town and that know they 've got it . ''
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 13]: Bibbs indulged in his silent chuckle again ; he seemed greatly amused .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 21]: `` I thought that the people who actually had the real what-you-may-call-it did n't know it , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 35]: `` I 've always understood that it was very unsatisfactory , because if you thought about it you did n't have it , and if you had it you did n't know it . ''
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 10]: `` That 's just bosh , '' she retorted .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 11]: `` They know it in this town , all right !
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 21]: I found out a lot of things , long before we began to think of building out in this direction .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 80]: The right people in this town are n't always the society-column ones , and they mix around with outsiders , and they do n't all belong to any one club -- they 're taken in all sorts into all their clubs -- but they 're a clan , just the same ; and they have the clan feeling and they 're just as much We , Us and Company as any crowd you read about anywhere in the world .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 36]: Most of 'em were here long before papa came , and the grandfathers of the girls of my age knew each other , and -- '' `` I see , '' Bibbs interrupted , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 20]: `` Their ancestors fled together from many a stricken field , and Crusaders ' blood flows in their veins .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 51]: I always understood the first house was built by an old party of the name of Vertrees who could n't get along with Dan ' l Boone , and hurried away to these parts because Dan ' l wanted him to give back a gun he 'd lent him . ''
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 8]: Edith gave a little ejaculation of alarm .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 16]: `` You must n't repeat that story , Bibbs , even if it 's true .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 33]: The Vertreeses are THE best family , and of course the very oldest here ; they were an old family even before Mary Vertrees 's great-great-grandfather came west and founded this settlement .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 23]: He came from Lynn , Massachusetts , and they have relatives there YET -- some of the best people in Lynn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 5]: exclaimed Bibbs , incredulously .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 43]: `` And there are other old families like the Vertreeses , '' she went on , not heeding him ; `` the Lamhorns and the Kittersbys and the J. Palmerston Smiths -- '' `` Strange names to me , '' he interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 4]: `` Poor things !
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 8]: None of them have my acquaintance . ''
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 9]: `` No , that 's just it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 12]: `` And papa had never even heard the name of Vertrees !
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 33]: Mrs. Vertrees went with some anti-smoke committee to see him , and he told her that smoke was what made her husband bring home his wages from the pay-roll on Saturday night !
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 23]: HE told us about it , and I thought I just could n't live through the night , I was so ashamed !
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 19]: Mr. Vertrees has always lived on his income , and papa did n't know him , of course .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 13]: They 're the stiffist , most elegant people in the whole town .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 61]: And to crown it all , papa went and bought the next lot to the old Vertrees country mansion -- it 's in the very heart of the best new residence district now , and that 's where the New House is , right next door to them -- and I must say it makes their place look rather shabby !
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 38]: I met Mary Vertrees when I joined the Mission Service Helpers , but she never did any more than just barely bow to me , and since papa 's break I doubt if she 'll do that !
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 6]: They have n't called . ''
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 41]: `` And you think if I spread this gossip about Vertrees the First stealing Dan ' l Boone 's gun , the chances that they WILL call -- '' `` Papa knows what a break he made with Mrs. Vertrees .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 29]: I made him understand that , '' said Edith , demurely , `` and he 's promised to try and meet Mr. Vertrees and be nice to him .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 47]: It 's just this way : if we do n't know THEM , it 's practically no use in our having build the New House ; and if we DO know them and they 're decent to us , we 're right with the right people .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 9]: They can do the whole thing for us .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 54]: Bobby Lamhorn told Sibyl he was going to bring his mother to call on her and on mamma , but it was weeks ago , and I notice he has n't done it ; and if Mrs. Vertrees decides not to know us , I 'm darn sure Mrs Lamhorn 'll never come .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 9]: That 's ONE thing Sibyl did n't manage !
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 22]: She SAID Bobby offered to bring his mother -- '' `` You say he is a friend of Roscoe 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 3]: Bibbs asked .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 27]: `` Oh , he 's a friend of the whole family , '' she returned , with a petulance which she made an effort to disguise .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 20]: `` Roscoe and he got acquainted somewhere , and they take him to the theater about every other night .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 24]: Sibyl has him to lunch , too , and keeps -- '' She broke off with an angry little jerk of the head .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 13]: `` We can see the New House from the second corner ahead .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 13]: Roscoe has built straight across the street from us , you know .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 23]: Honestly , Sibyl makes me think of a snake , sometimes -- the way she pulls the wool over people 's eyes !
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 41]: She honeys up to papa and gets anything in the world she wants out of him , and then makes fun of him behind his back -- yes , and to his face , but HE ca n't see it !
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 22]: She got him to give her a twelve-thousand-dollar porch for their house after it was -- '' `` Good heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 25]: said Bibbs , staring ahead as they reached the corner and the car swung to the right , following a bend in the street .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 8]: `` Is that the New House ? ''
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 8]: What do you think of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 31]: `` Well , '' he drawled , `` I 'm pretty sure the sanitarium 's about half a size bigger ; I ca n't be certain till I measure . ''
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 23]: And a moment later , as they entered the driveway , he added , seriously : `` But it 's beautiful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 15]: CHAPTER IV It was gray stone , with long roofs of thick green slate .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 47]: An architect who loved the milder `` Gothic motives '' had built what he liked : it was to be seen at once that he had been left unhampered , and he had wrought a picture out of his head into a noble and exultant reality .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 51]: At the same time a landscape-designer had played so good a second , with ready-made accessories of screen , approach and vista , that already whatever look of newness remained upon the place was to its advantage , as showing at least one thing yet clean under the grimy sky .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 58]: For , though the smoke was thinner in this direction , and at this long distance from the heart of the town , it was not absent , and under tutelage of wind and weather could be malignant even here , where cows had wandered in the meadows and corn had been growing not ten years gone .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 9]: Altogether , the New House was a success .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 32]: It was one of those architects ' successes which leave the owners veiled in privacy ; it revealed nothing of the people who lived in it save that they were rich .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 53]: There are houses that can not be detached from their own people without protesting : every inch of mortar seems to mourn the separation , and such a house -- no matter what be done to it -- is ever murmurous with regret , whispering the old name sadly to itself unceasingly .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 14]: But the New House was of a kind to change hands without emotion .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 45]: In our swelling cities , great places of its type are useful as financial gauges of the business tides ; rich families , one after another , take title and occupy such houses as fortunes rise and fall -- they mark the high tide .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 36]: It was impossible to imagine a child 's toy wagon left upon a walk or driveway of the New House , and yet it was -- as Bibbs rightly called it -- `` beautiful . ''
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 42]: What the architect thought of the `` Golfo di Napoli , '' which hung in its vast gold revel of rococo frame against the gray wood of the hall , is to be conjectured -- perhaps he had not seen it .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 11]: `` Edith , did you say only eleven feet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 24]: Bibbs panted , staring at it , as the white-jacketed twin of a Pullman porter helped him to get out of his overcoat .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 10]: `` Eleven without the frame , '' she explained .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 10]: `` It 's splendid , do n't you think ?
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 6]: It lightens things up so .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 9]: The hall was kind of gloomy before . ''
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 6]: `` No gloom now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 3]: said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 15]: `` This statue in the corner is pretty , too , '' she remarked .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 8]: `` Mamma and I bought that . ''
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 35]: And Bibbs turned at her direction to behold , amid a grove of tubbed palms , a `` life-size , '' black-bearded Moor , of a plastic composition painted with unappeasable gloss and brilliancy .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 34]: Upon his chocolate head he wore a gold turban ; in his hand he held a gold-tipped spear ; and for the rest , he was red and yellow and black and silver .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 4]: `` Hallelujah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 27]: was the sole comment of the returned wanderer , and Edith , saying she would `` find mamma , '' left him blinking at the Moor .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 24]: Presently , after she had disappeared , he turned to the colored man who stood waiting , Bibbs 's traveling-bag in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 9]: `` What do YOU think of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 5]: Bibbs asked , solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 5]: `` Gran ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 4]: replied the servitor .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 8]: `` She mighty hard to dus ' .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 8]: Dus ' git in all 'em wrinkles .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 10]: Yessuh , she mighty hard to dus ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 24]: `` I expect she must be , '' said Bibbs , his glance returning reflectively to the black bull beard for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 12]: `` Is there a place anywhere I could lie down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 3]: `` Yessuh .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 15]: We got one nem spare rooms all fix up fo ' you , suh .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 6]: Right up staihs , suh .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 4]: Nice room . ''
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 36]: He led the way , and Bibbs followed slowly , stopping at intervals to rest , and noting a heavy increase in the staff of service since the exodus from the `` old '' house .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 29]: Maids and scrubwomen were at work under the patently nominal direction of another Pullman porter , who was profoundly enjoying his own affectation of being harassed with care .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 26]: `` Ev ` ything got look spick an ' span fo ' the big doin 's to-night , '' Bibbs 's guide explained , chuckling .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 10]: `` Yessuh , we got big doin 's to-night !
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 5]: Big doin 's ! ''
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 48]: The room to which he conducted his lagging charge was furnished in every particular like a room in a new hotel ; and Bibbs found it pleasant -- though , indeed , any room with a good bed would have seemed pleasant to him after his journey .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 28]: He stretched himself flat immediately , and having replied `` Not now '' to the attendant 's offer to unpack the bag , closed his eyes wearily .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 29]: White-jacket , racially sympathetic , lowered the window-shades and made an exit on tiptoe , encountering the other white-jacket -- the harassed overseer -- in the hall without .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 14]: Said the emerging one : `` He mighty shaky , Mist ' Jackson .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 9]: Drop right down an ' shet his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 4]: Eyelids all black .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 10]: Rich folks got ta go same as anybody else .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 17]: Anybody ast me if I change ` ith ` at ole boy -- No , suh !
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 20]: Le 'm keep ` is money ; I keep my black skin an ' keep out the ground ! ''
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 7]: Mr. Jackson expressed the same preference .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 17]: `` Yessuh , he look tuh me like somebody awready laid out , '' he concluded .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 23]: And upon the stairway landing , near by , two old women , on all-fours at their work , were likewise pessimistic .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 4]: `` Hech ! ''
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 8]: said one , lamenting in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 23]: `` It give me a turn to see him go by -- white as wax an ' bony as a dead fish !
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 19]: Mrs. Cronin , tell me : d'it make ye kind o ' sick to look at um ? ''
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 3]: `` Sick ?
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 14]: No more than the face of a blessed angel already in heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 41]: `` Well , '' said the other , `` I 'd a b ' y o ' me own come home t ' die once -- '' She fell silent at a rustling of skirts in the corridor above them .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 10]: It was Mrs. Sheridan hurrying to greet her son .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 29]: She was one of those fat , pink people who fade and contract with age like drying fruit ; and her outside was a true portrait of her .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 11]: Her husband and her daughter had long ago absorbed her .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 30]: What intelligence she had was given almost wholly to comprehending and serving those two , and except in the presence of one of them she was nearly always absent-minded .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 40]: Edith lived all day with her mother , as daughters do ; and Sheridan so held his wife to her unity with him that she had long ago become unconscious of her existence as a thing separate from his .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 51]: She invariably perceived his moods , and nursed him through them when she did not share them ; and she gave him a profound sympathy with the inmost spirit and purpose of his being , even though she did not comprehend it and partook of it only as a spectator .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 64]: They had known but one actual altercation in their lives , and that was thirty years past , in the early days of Sheridan 's struggle , when , in order to enhance the favorable impression he believed himself to be making upon some capitalists , he had thought it necessary to accompany them to a performance of `` The Black Crook . ''
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 14]: But she had not once referred to this during the last ten years .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 57]: Mrs. Sheridan 's manner was hurried and inconsequent ; her clothes rustled more than other women 's clothes ; she seemed to wear too many at a time and to be vaguely troubled by them , and she was patting a skirt down over some unruly internal dissension at the moment she opened Bibbs 's door .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 39]: At sight of the recumbent figure she began to close the door softly , withdrawing , but the young man had heard the turning of the knob and the rustling of skirts , and he opened his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 11]: `` Do n't go , mother , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 7]: `` I 'm not asleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 32]: He swung his long legs over the side of the bed to rise , but she set a hand on his shoulder , restraining him ; and he lay flat again .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 31]: `` No , '' she said , bending over to kiss his cheek , `` I just come for a minute , but I want to see how you seem .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 9]: Edith said -- '' `` Poor Edith ! ''
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 3]: he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 8]: `` She could n't look at me .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 7]: She -- '' `` Nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 18]: Mrs. Sheridan , having let in the light at a window , came back to the bedside .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 20]: `` You look a great deal better than what you did before you went to the sanitarium , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 14]: It 's done you good ; a body can see that right away .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 32]: You need fatting up , of course , and you have n't got much color -- '' `` No , '' he said , `` I have n't much color . ''
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 13]: `` But you will have when you get your strength back . ''
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 5]: `` Oh yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 5]: he responded , cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 6]: `` THEN I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 13]: `` You look a great deal better than what I expected . ''
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 9]: `` Edith must have a great vocabulary ! ''
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 3]: he chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 20]: `` She 's too sensitive , '' said Mrs. Sheridan , `` and it makes her exaggerate a little .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 6]: What about your diet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 6]: `` That 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 8]: They told me to eat anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 6]: `` Anything at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 8]: `` Well -- anything I could . ''
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 11]: `` That 's good , '' she said , nodding .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 12]: `` They mean for you just to build up your strength .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 18]: That 's what they told me the last time I went to see you at the sanitarium .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 18]: You look better than what you did then , and that 's only a little time ago .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 6]: How long was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 8]: `` Eight months , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 8]: `` No , it could n't be .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 17]: I know it ai n't THAT long , but maybe it was longer 'n I thought .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 72]: And this last month or so I have n't had scarcely even time to write more than just a line to ask how you were gettin ' along , but I told Edith to write , the weeks I could n't , and I asked Jim to , too , and they both said they would , so I suppose you 've kept up pretty well on the home news . ''
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 5]: `` Oh yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 28]: `` What I think you need , '' said the mother , gravely , `` is to liven up a little and take an interest in things .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 27]: That 's what papa was sayin ' this morning , after we got your telegram ; and that 's what 'll stimilate your appetite , too .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 15]: He was talkin ' over his plans for you -- '' `` Plans ? ''
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 25]: Bibbs , turning on his side , shielded his eyes from the light with his hand , so that he might see her better .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 7]: `` What -- '' He paused .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 12]: `` What plans is he making for me , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 15]: She turned away , going back to the window to draw down the shade .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 19]: `` Well , you better talk it over with HIM , '' she said , with perceptible nervousness .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 7]: `` He better tell you himself .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 29]: I do n't feel as if I had any call , exactly , to go into it ; and you better get to sleep now , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 10]: She came and stood by the bedside once more .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 16]: `` But you must remember , Bibbs , whatever papa does is for the best .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 29]: He loves his chuldern and wants to do what 's right by ALL of 'em -- and you 'll always find he 's right in the end . ''
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 31]: He made a little gesture of assent , which seemed to content her ; and she rustled to the door , turning to speak again after she had opened it .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 20]: `` You get a good nap , now , so as to be all rested up for to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 19]: `` You -- you mean -- he -- '' Bibbs stammered , having begun to speak too quickly .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 26]: Checking himself , he drew a long breath , then asked , quietly , `` Does father expect me to come down-stairs this evening ? ''
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 12]: `` Well , I think he does , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 40]: `` You see , it 's the ` house-warming , ' as he calls it , and he said he thinks all our chuldern ought to be around us , as well as the old friends and other folks .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 17]: It 's just what he thinks you need -- to take an interest and liven up .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 14]: You do n't feel too bad to come down , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 4]: `` Mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 12]: `` Take a good look at me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 7]: `` Oh , see here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 7]: she cried , with brusque cheerfulness .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 15]: `` You 're not so bad off as you think you are , Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 29]: You 're on the mend ; and it wo n't do you any harm to please your -- '' `` It is n't that , '' he interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 14]: `` Honestly , I 'm only afraid it might spoil somebody 's appetite .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 20]: Edith -- '' `` I told you the child was too sensitive , '' she interrupted , in turn .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 13]: `` You 're a plenty good-lookin ' enough young man for anybody !
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 25]: You look like you been through a long spell and begun to get well , and that 's all there is to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 4]: `` All right .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 7]: I 'll come to the party .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 13]: If the rest of you can stand it , I can ! ''
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 16]: `` It 'll do you good , '' she returned , rustling into the hall .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 29]: `` Now take a nap , and I 'll send one o ' the help to wake you in time for you to get dressed up before dinner .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 12]: You go to sleep right away , now , Bibbs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 13]: Bibbs was unable to obey , though he kept his eyes closed .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 17]: Something she had said kept running in his mind , repeating itself over and over interminably .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 167]: `` His plans for you -- his plans for you -- his plans for you -- his plans for you -- '' And then , taking the place of `` his plans for you , '' after what seemed a long , long while , her flurried voice came back to him insistently , seeming to whisper in his ear : `` He loves his chuldern -- he loves his chuldern -- he loves his chuldern '' -- `` you 'll find he 's always right -- you 'll find he 's always right -- '' Until at last , as he drifted into the state of half-dreams and distorted realities , the voice seemed to murmur from beyond a great black wing that came out of the wall and stretched over his bed -- it was a black wing within the room , and at the same time it was a black cloud crossing the sky , bridging the whole earth from pole to pole .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 47]: It was a cloud of black smoke , and out of the heart of it came a flurried voice whispering over and over , `` His plans for you -- his plans for you -- his plans for you -- '' And then there was nothing .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 55]: He woke refreshed , stretched himself gingerly -- as one might have a care against too quick or too long a pull upon a frayed elastic -- and , getting to his feet , went blinking to the window and touched the shade so that it flew up , letting in a pale sunset .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 32]: He looked out into the lemon-colored light and smiled wanly at the next house , as Edith 's grandiose phrase came to mind , `` the old Vertrees country mansion . ''
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 41]: It stood in a broad lawn which was separated from the Sheridans ' by a young hedge ; and it was a big , square , plain old box of a house with a giant salt-cellar atop for a cupola .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 52]: Paint had been spared for a long time , and no one could have put a name to the color of it , but in spite of that the place had no look of being out at heel , and the sward was as neatly trimmed as the Sheridans ' own .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 58]: The separating hedge ran almost beneath Bibbs 's window -- for this wing of the New House extended here almost to the edge of the lot -- and , directly opposite the window , the Vertreeses ' lawn had been graded so as to make a little knoll upon which stood a small rustic `` summer-house . ''
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 47]: It was almost on a level with Bibbs 's window and not thirty feet away ; and it was easy for him to imagine the present dynasty of Vertreeses in grievous outcry when they had found this retreat ruined by the juxtaposition of the parvenu intruder .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 12]: Probably the `` summer-house '' was pleasant and pretty in summer .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 66]: It had the look of a place wherein little girls had played for a generation or so with dolls and `` housekeeping , '' or where a lovely old lady might come to read something dull on warm afternoons ; but now in the thin light it was desolate , the color of dust , and hung with haggard vines which had lost their leaves .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 37]: Bibbs looked at it with grave sympathy , probably feeling some kinship with anything so dismantled ; then he turned to a cheval-glass beside the window and paid himself the dubious tribute of a thorough inspection .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 27]: He looked the mirror up and down , slowly , repeatedly , but came in the end to a long and earnest scrutiny of the face .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 31]: Throughout this cryptic seance his manner was profoundly impersonal ; he had the air of an entomologist intent upon classifying a specimen , but finally he appeared to become pessimistic .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 26]: He shook his head solemnly ; then gazed again and shook his head again , and continued to shake it slowly , in complete disapproval .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 9]: `` You certainly are one horrible sight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 5]: he said , aloud .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 11]: And at that he was instantly aware of an observer .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 53]: Turning quickly , he was vouchsafed the picture of a charming lady , framed in a rustic aperture of the `` summer-house '' and staring full into his window -- straight into his eyes , too , for the infinitesimal fraction of a second before the flashingly censorious withdrawal of her own .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 90]: Composedly , she pulled several dead twigs from a vine , the manner of her action conveying a message or proclamation to the effect that she was in the summer-house for the sole purpose of such-like pruning and tending , and that no gentleman could suppose her presence there to be due to any other purpose whatsoever , or that , being there on that account , she had allowed her attention to wander for one instant in the direction of things of which she was in reality unconscious .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 52]: Having pulled enough twigs to emphasize her unconsciousness -- and at the same time her disapproval -- of everything in the nature of a Sheridan or belonging to a Sheridan , she descended the knoll with maintained composure , and sauntered toward a side-door of the country mansion of the Vertreeses .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 17]: An elderly lady , bonneted and cloaked , opened the door and came to meet her .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 7]: `` Are you ready , Mary ?
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 7]: I 've been looking for you .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 6]: What were you doing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 3]: `` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 14]: Just looking into one of Sheridans ' windows , '' said Mary Vertrees .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 8]: `` I got caught at it . ''
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 4]: `` Mary ! ''
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 4]: cried her mother .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 9]: `` Just as we were going to call !
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 4]: Good heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 14]: `` We 'll go , just the same , '' the daughter returned .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 22]: `` I suppose those women would be glad to have us if we 'd burned their house to the ground . ''
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 7]: `` But WHO saw you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 4]: insisted Mrs. Vertrees .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 11]: `` One of the sons , I suppose he was .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 9]: I believe he 's insane , or something .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 18]: At least I hear they keep him in a sanitarium somewhere , and never talk about him .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 13]: He was staring at himself in a mirror and talking to himself .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 9]: Then he looked out and caught me . ''
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 13]: `` What did he -- '' `` Nothing , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 7]: `` How did he look ? ''
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 40]: `` Like a ghost in a blue suit , '' said Miss Vertrees , moving toward the street and waving a white-gloved hand in farewell to her father , who was observing them from the window of his library .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 7]: `` Rather tragic and altogether impossible .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 14]: Do come on , mother , and let 's get it over ! ''
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 24]: And Mrs. Vertrees , with many misgivings , set forth with her daughter for their gracious assault upon the New House next door .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 40]: CHAPTER V Mr. Vertrees , having watched their departure with the air of a man who had something at hazard upon the expedition , turned from the window and began to pace the library thoughtfully , pending their return .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 24]: He was about sixty ; a small man , withered and dry and fine , a trim little sketch of an elderly dandy .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 47]: His lambrequin mustache -- relic of a forgotten Anglomania -- had been profoundly black , but now , like his smooth hair , it was approaching an equally sheer whiteness ; and though his clothes were old , they had shapeliness and a flavor of mode .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 51]: And for greater spruceness there were some jaunty touches ; gray spats , a narrow black ribbon across the gray waistcoat to the eye-glasses in a pocket , a fleck of color from a button in the lapel of the black coat , labeling him the descendant of patriot warriors .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 20]: The room was not like him , being cheerful and hideous , whereas Mr. Vertrees was anxious and decorative .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 72]: Under a mantel of imitation black marble a merry little coal-fire beamed forth upon high and narrow `` Eastlake '' bookcases with long glass doors , and upon comfortable , incongruous furniture , and upon meaningless `` woodwork '' everywhere , and upon half a dozen Landseer engravings which Mr. and Mrs. Vertrees sometimes mentioned to each other , after thirty years of possession , as `` very fine things . ''
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 103]: They had been the first people in town to possess Landseer engravings , and there , in art , they had rested , but they still had a feeling that in all such matters they were in the van ; and when Mr. Vertrees discovered Landseers upon the walls of other people 's houses he thawed , as a chieftain to a trusted follower ; and if he found an edition of Bulwer Lytton accompanying the Landseers as a final corroboration of culture , he would say , inevitably , `` Those people know good pictures and they know good books . ''
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 26]: The growth of the city , which might easily have made him a millionaire , had ruined him because he had failed to understand it .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 19]: When towns begin to grow they have whims , and the whims of a town always ruin somebody .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 12]: Mr. Vertrees had been most strikingly the somebody in this case .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 72]: At about the time he bought the Landseers , he owned , through inheritance , an office-building and a large house not far from it , where he spent the winter ; and he had a country place -- a farm of four hundred acres -- where he went for the summers to the comfortable , ugly old house that was his home now , perforce , all the year round .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 54]: If he had known how to sit still and let things happen he would have prospered miraculously ; but , strangely enough , the dainty little man was one of the first to fall down and worship Bigness , the which proceeded straightway to enact the role of Juggernaut for his better education .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 23]: He was a true prophet of the prodigious growth , but he had a fatal gift for selling good and buying bad .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 36]: He should have stayed at home and looked at his Landseers and read his Bulwer , but he took his cow to market , and the trained milkers milked her dry and then ate her .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 52]: He sold the office-building and the house in town to buy a great tract of lots in a new suburb ; then he sold the farm , except the house and the ground about it , to pay the taxes on the suburban lots and to `` keep them up . ''
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 56]: The lots refused to stay up ; but he had to do something to keep himself and his family up , so in despair he sold the lots -LRB- which went up beautifully the next year -RRB- for `` traction stock '' that was paying dividends ; and thereafter he ceased to buy and sell .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 42]: Thus he disappeared altogether from the commercial surface at about the time James Sheridan came out securely on top ; and Sheridan , until Mrs. Vertrees called upon him with her `` anti-smoke '' committee , had never heard the name .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 42]: Mr. Vertrees , pinched , retired to his Landseers , and Mrs. Vertrees `` managed somehow '' on the dividends , though `` managing '' became more and more difficult as the years went by and money bought less and less .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 36]: But there came a day when three servitors of Bigness in Philadelphia took greedy counsel with four fellow-worshipers from New York , and not long after that there were no more dividends for Mr. Vertrees .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 56]: In fact , there was nothing for Mr. Vertrees , because the `` traction stock '' henceforth was no stock at all , and he had mortgaged his house long ago to help `` manage somehow '' according to his conception of his `` position in life '' -- one of his own old-fashioned phrases .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 75]: Six months before the completion of the New House next door , Mr. Vertrees had sold his horses and the worn Victoria and `` station-wagon , '' to pay the arrears of his two servants and re-establish credit at the grocer 's and butcher 's -- and a pair of elderly carriage-horses with such accoutrements are not very ample barter , in these days , for six months ' food and fuel and service .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 25]: Mr. Vertrees had discovered , too , that there was no salary for him in all the buzzing city -- he could do nothing .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 14]: It may be said that he was at the end of his string .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 34]: Such times do come in all their bitterness , finally , to the man with no trade or craft , if his feeble clutch on that slippery ghost , Property , shall fail .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 42]: The windows grew black while he paced the room , and smoky twilight closed round about the house , yet not more darkly than what closed round about the heart of the anxious little man patrolling the fan-shaped zone of firelight .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 31]: But as the mantel clock struck wheezily six there was the rattle of an outer door , and a rich and beautiful peal of laughter went ringing through the house .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 18]: Thus cheerfully did Mary Vertrees herald her return with her mother from their expedition among the barbarians .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 27]: She came rushing into the library and threw herself into a deep chair by the hearth , laughing so uncontrollably that tears were in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 37]: Mrs. Vertrees followed decorously , no mirth about her ; on the contrary , she looked vaguely disturbed , as if she had eaten something not quite certain to agree with her , and regretted it .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 3]: `` Papa !
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 5]: Oh , oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 13]: And Miss Vertrees was fain to apply a handkerchief upon her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 10]: `` I 'm SO glad you made us go !
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 14]: I would n't have missed it -- '' Mrs. Vertrees shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 14]: `` I suppose I 'm very dull , '' she said , gently .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 8]: `` I did n't see anything amusing .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 26]: They 're most ordinary , and the house is altogether in bad taste , but we anticipated that , and -- '' `` Papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 6]: Mary cried , breaking in .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 8]: `` They asked us to DINNER ! ''
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 7]: `` And I 'm GOING ! ''
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 10]: she shouted , and was seized with fresh paroxysms .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 5]: `` Think of it !
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 28]: Never in their house before ; never met any of them but the daughter -- and just BARELY met her -- '' `` What about you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 10]: interrupted Mr. Vertrees , turning sharply upon his wife .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 20]: She made a little face as if positive now that what she had eaten would not agree with her .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 6]: `` I could n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 24]: `` I -- '' `` Yes , that 's just -- just the way she -- she looked when they asked her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 5]: cried Mary , choking .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 35]: `` And then she -- she realized it , and tried to turn it into a cough , and she did n't know how , and it sounded like -- like a squeal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 24]: `` I suppose , '' said Mrs. Vertrees , much injured , `` that Mary will have an uproarious time at my funeral .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 42]: She makes fun of -- '' Mary jumped up instantly and kissed her ; then she went to the mantel and , leaning an elbow upon it , gazed thoughtfully at the buckle of her shoe , twinkling in the firelight .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 11]: `` THEY did n't notice anything , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 22]: `` So far as they were concerned , mamma , it was one of the finest coughs you ever coughed . ''
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 8]: `` Who were ` they ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 4]: asked her father .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 7]: `` Whom did you see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 11]: `` Only the mother and daughter , '' Mary answered .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 34]: `` Mrs. Sheridan is dumpy and rustly ; and Miss Sheridan is pretty and pushing -- dresses by the fashion magazines and talks about New York people that have their pictures in 'em .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 26]: She tutors the mother , but not very successfully -- partly because her own foundation is too flimsy and partly because she began too late .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 31]: They 've got an enormous Moor of painted plaster or something in the hall , and the girl evidently thought it was to her credit that she selected it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 22]: `` They have oil-paintings , too , '' added Mrs. Vertrees , with a glance of gentle price at the Landseers .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 16]: `` I 've always thought oil-paintings in a private house the worst of taste . ''
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 13]: `` Oh , if one owned a Raphael or a Titian ! ''
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 20]: said Mr. Vertrees , finishing the implication , not in words , but with a wave of his hand .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 6]: `` Go on , Mary .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 9]: None of the rest of them came in ?
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 25]: You did n't meet Mr. Sheridan or -- '' He paused and adjusted a lump of coal in the fire delicately with the poker .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 8]: `` Or one of the sons ? ''
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 16]: Mary 's glance crossed his , at that , with a flash of utter comprehension .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 13]: He turned instantly away , but she had begun to laugh again .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 23]: `` No , '' she said , `` no one except the women , but mamma inquired about the sons thoroughly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 4]: `` Mary ! ''
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 4]: Mrs. Vertrees protested .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 9]: `` Oh , most adroitly , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 4]: laughed the girl .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 19]: `` Only she could n't help unconsciously turning to look at me -- when she did it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 5]: `` Mary Vertrees ! ''
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 6]: `` Never mind , mamma !
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 24]: Mrs. Sheridan and Miss Sheridan neither of THEM could help unconsciously turning to look at me -- speculatively -- at the same time !
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 20]: They all three kept looking at me and talking about the oldest son , Mr. James Sheridan , Junior .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 31]: Mrs. Sheridan said his father is very anxious ` to get Jim to marry and settle down , ' and she assured me that ` Jim is right cultivated . '
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 62]: Another of the sons , the youngest one , caught me looking in the window this afternoon ; but they did n't seem to consider him quite one of themselves , somehow , though Mrs. Sheridan mentioned that a couple of years or so ago he had been ` right sick , ' and had been to some cure or other .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 22]: They seemed relieved to bring the subject back to ` Jim ' and his virtues -- and to look at me !
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 37]: The other brother is the middle one , Roscoe ; he 's the one that owns the new house across the street , where that young black-sheep of the Lamhorns , Robert , goes so often .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 27]: I saw a short , dark young man standing on the porch with Robert Lamhorn there the other day , so I suppose that was Roscoe .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 16]: ` Jim ' still lurks in the mists , but I shall meet him to-night .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 25]: Papa -- '' She stepped nearer to him so that he had to face her , and his eyes were troubled as he did .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 20]: There may have been a trouble deep within her own , but she kept their surface merry with laughter .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 25]: `` Papa , Bibbs is the youngest one 's name , and Bibbs -- to the best of our information -- is a lunatic .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 4]: Roscoe is married .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 10]: Papa , does it have to be Jim ? ''
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 4]: `` Mary ! ''
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 6]: Mrs. Vertrees cried , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 5]: `` You 're outrageous !
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 10]: That 's a perfectly horrible way of talking ! ''
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 17]: `` Well , I 'm close to twenty-four , '' said Mary , turning to her .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 24]: `` I have n't been able to like anybody yet that 's asked me to marry him , and maybe I never shall .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 37]: Until a year or so ago I 've had everything I ever wanted in my life -- you and papa gave it all to me -- and it 's about time I began to pay back .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 20]: Unfortunately , I do n't know how to do anything -- but something 's got to be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 12]: `` But you need n't talk of it like THAT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 6]: insisted the mother , plaintively .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 21]: `` It 's not -- it 's not -- '' `` No , it 's not , '' said Mary .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 6]: `` I know that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 12]: `` How did they happen to ask you to dinner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 7]: Mr. Vertrees inquired , uneasily . ''
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 7]: ` Stextrawdn ` ry thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 10]: `` Climbers ' hospitality , '' Mary defined it .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 9]: `` We were so very cordial and easy !
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 32]: I think Mrs. Sheridan herself might have done it just as any kind old woman on a farm might ask a neighbor , but it was Miss Sheridan who did it .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 43]: She played around it awhile ; you could see she wanted to -- she 's in a dreadful hurry to get into things -- and I fancied she had an idea it might impress that Lamhorn boy to find us there to-night .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 32]: It 's a sort of house-warming dinner , and they talked about it and talked about it -- and then the girl got her courage up and blurted out the invitation .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 15]: And mamma -- '' Here Mary was once more a victim to incorrigible merriment .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 11]: `` Mamma tried to say yes , and COULD N'T !
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 12]: She swallowed and squealed -- I mean you coughed , dear !
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 38]: And then , papa , she said that you and she had promised to go to a lecture at the Emerson Club to-night , but that her daughter would be delighted to come to the Big Show !
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 18]: So there I am , and there 's Mr. Jim Sheridan -- and there 's the clock .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 6]: Dinner 's at seven-thirty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 23]: And she ran out of the room , scooping up her fallen furs with a gesture of flying grace as she sped .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 34]: When she came down , at twenty minutes after seven , her father stood in the hall , at the foot of the stairs , waiting to be her escort through the dark .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 22]: He looked up and watched her as she descended , and his gaze was fond and proud -- and profoundly disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 22]: But she smiled and nodded gaily , and , when she reached the floor , put a hand on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 14]: `` At least no one could suspect me to-night , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 12]: `` I LOOK rich , do n't I , papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 3]: She did .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 14]: She had a look that worshipful girl friends bravely called `` regal . ''
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 52]: A head taller than her father , she was as straight and jauntily poised as a boy athlete ; and her brown hair and her brown eyes were like her mother 's , but for the rest she went back to some stronger and livelier ancestor than either of her parents .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 12]: `` Do n't I look too rich to be suspected ? ''
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 3]: she insisted .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 14]: `` You look everything beautiful , Mary , '' he said , huskily .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 6]: `` And my dress ? ''
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 16]: She threw open her dark velvet cloak , showing a splendor of white and silver .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 13]: `` Anything better at Nice next winter , do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 12]: She laughed , shrouding her glittering figure in the cloak again .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 12]: `` Two years old , and no one would dream it !
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 6]: I did it over . ''
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 9]: `` You can do anything , Mary . ''
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 22]: There was a curious humility in his tone , and something more -- a significance not veiled and yet abysmally apologetic .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 18]: It was as if he suggested something to her and begged her forgiveness in the same breath .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 15]: And upon that , for the moment , she became as serious as he .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 26]: She lifted her hand from his shoulder and then set it back more firmly , so that he should feel the reassurance of its pressure .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 16]: `` Do n't worry , '' she said , in a low voice and gravely .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 12]: `` I know exactly what you want me to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 53]: CHAPTER VI It was a brave and lustrous banquet ; and a noisy one , too , because there was an orchestra among some plants at one end of the long dining-room , and after a preliminary stiffness the guests were impelled to converse -- necessarily at the tops of their voices .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 93]: The whole company of fifty sat at a great oblong table , improvised for the occasion by carpenters ; but , not betraying itself as an improvisation , it seemed a permanent continent of damask and lace , with shores of crystal and silver running up to spreading groves of orchids and lilies and white roses -- an inhabited continent , evidently , for there were three marvelous , gleaming buildings : one in the center and one at each end , white miracles wrought by some inspired craftsman in sculptural icing .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 22]: They were models in miniature , and they represented the Sheridan Building , the Sheridan Apartments , and the Pump Works .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 21]: Nearly all the guests recognized them without having to be told what they were , and pronounced the likenesses superb .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 9]: The arrangement of the table was visibly baronial .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 74]: At the head sat the great Thane , with the flower of his family and of the guests about him ; then on each side came the neighbors of the `` old '' house , grading down to vassals and retainers -- superintendents , cashiers , heads of departments , and the like -- at the foot , where the Thane 's lady took her place as a consolation for the less important .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 28]: Here , too , among the thralls and bondmen , sat Bibbs Sheridan , a meek Banquo , wondering how anybody could look at him and eat .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 44]: Nevertheless , there was a vast , continuous eating , for these were wholesome folk who understood that dinner meant something intended for introduction into the system by means of an aperture in the face , devised by nature for that express purpose .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 8]: And besides , nobody looked at Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 51]: He was better content to be left to himself ; his voice was not strong enough to make itself heard over the hubbub without an exhausting effort , and the talk that went on about him was too fast and too fragmentary for his drawl to keep pace with it .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 29]: So he felt relieved when each of his neighbors in turn , after a polite inquiry about his health , turned to seek livelier responses in other directions .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 11]: For the talk went on with the eating , incessantly .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 27]: It rose over the throbbing of the orchestra and the clatter and clinking of silver and china and glass , and there was a mighty babble .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir !
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 6]: Started without a dollar . ''
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 32]: ... `` Yellow flounces on the overskirt -- '' ... `` I says , ` Wilkie , your department 's got to go bigger this year , ' I says . ''
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 6]: ... `` Fifteen per cent .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 6]: turnover in thirty-one weeks . ''
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 46]: ... `` One of the biggest men in the biggest -- '' ... `` The wife says she 'll have to let out my pants if my appetite -- '' ... `` Say , did you see that statue of a Turk in the hall ?
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 57]: One of the finest things I ever -- '' ... `` Not a dollar , not a nickel , not one red cent do you get out o ' me , ' I says , and so he ups and -- '' ... `` Yes , the baby makes four , they 've lost now . ''
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 16]: ... `` Well , they got their raise , and they went in big . ''
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 6]: ... `` Yes , sir !
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 18]: Not a dollar to his name , and look at what -- '' ... `` You wait !
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 18]: The population of this town 's goin ' to hit the million mark before she stops . ''
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 85]: ... `` Well , if you can show me a bigger deal than -- '' And through the interstices of this clamoring Bibbs could hear the continual booming of his father 's heavy voice , and once he caught the sentence , `` Yes , young lady , that 's just what did it for me , and that 's just what 'll do it for my boys -- they got to make two blades o ' grass grow where one grew before ! ''
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 23]: It was his familiar flourish , an old story to Bibbs , and now jovially declaimed for the edification of Mary Vertrees .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 15]: It was a great night for Sheridan -- the very crest of his wave .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 40]: He sat there knowing himself Thane and master by his own endeavor ; and his big , smooth , red face grew more and more radiant with good will and with the simplest , happiest , most boy-like vanity .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 18]: He was the picture of health , of good cheer , and of power on a holiday .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 100]: He had thirty teeth , none bought , and showed most of them when he laughed ; his grizzled hair was thick , and as unruly as a farm laborer 's ; his chest was deep and big beneath its vast facade of starched white linen , where little diamonds twinkled , circling three large pearls ; his hands were stubby and strong , and he used them freely in gestures of marked picturesqueness ; and , though he had grown fat at chin and waist and wrist , he had not lost the look of readiness and activity .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 14]: He dominated the table , shouting jocular questions and railleries at every one .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 39]: His idea was that when people were having a good time they were noisy ; and his own additions to the hubbub increased his pleasure , and , of course , met the warmest encouragement from his guests .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 60]: Edith had discovered that he had very foggy notions of the difference between a band and an orchestra , and when it was made clear to him he had held out for a band until Edith threatened tears ; but the size of the orchestra they hired consoled him , and he had now no regrets in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 49]: He kept time to the music continually -- with his feet , or pounding on the table with his fist , and sometimes with spoon or knife upon his plate or a glass , without permitting these side-products to interfere with the real business of eating and shouting .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 11]: `` Tell 'em to play ` Nancy Lee ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 29]: he would bellow down the length of the table to his wife , while the musicians were in the midst of the `` Toreador '' song , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 15]: `` Ask that fellow if they do n't know ` Nancy Lee ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 49]: And when the leader would shake his head apologetically in answer to an obedient shriek from Mrs. Sheridan , the `` Toreador '' continuing vehemently , Sheridan would roar half-remembered fragments of `` Nancy Lee , '' naturally mingling some Bizet with the air of that uxorious tribute .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 15]: `` Oh , there she stands and waves her hands while I 'm away !
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 11]: A sail-er 's wife a sail-er 's star should be !
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 7]: Yo ho , oh , oh !
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 9]: Oh , Nancy , Nancy , Nancy Lee !
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 6]: Oh , Na-hancy Lee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 9]: `` HAY , there , old lady ! ''
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 4]: he would bellow .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 11]: `` Tell 'em to play ` In the Gloaming . '
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 32]: In the gloaming , oh , my darling , la-la-lum-tee -- Well , if they do n't know that , what 's the matter with ` Larboard Watch , Ahoy ' ?
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 5]: THAT 'S good music !
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 10]: That 's the kind o ' music I like !
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 5]: Come on , now !
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 16]: Mrs. Callin , get 'em singin ' down in your part o ' the table .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 11]: What 's the matter you folks down there , anyway ?
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 6]: Larboard watch , ahoy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 11]: `` What joy he feels , as -- ta-tum-dum-tee-dee-dum steals .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 6]: La-a-r-board watch , ahoy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 63]: No external bubbling contributed to this effervescence ; the Sheridans ' table had never borne wine , and , more because of timidity about it than conviction , it bore none now ; though `` mineral waters '' were copiously poured from bottles wrapped , for some reason , in napkins , and proved wholly satisfactory to almost all of the guests .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 15]: And certainly no wine could have inspired more turbulent good spirits in the host .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 42]: Not even Bibbs was an alloy in this night 's happiness , for , as Mrs. Sheridan had said , he had `` plans for Bibbs '' -- plans which were going to straighten out some things that had gone wrong .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 53]: So he pounded the table and boomed his echoes of old songs , and then , forgetting these , would renew his friendly railleries , or perhaps , turning to Mary Vertrees , who sat near him , round the corner of the table at his right , he would become autobiographical .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 36]: Gentlemen less naive than he had paid her that tribute , for she was a girl who inspired the autobiographical impulse in every man who met her -- it needed but the sight of her .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 52]: The dinner seemed , somehow , to center about Mary Vertrees and the jocund host as a play centers about its hero and heroine ; they were the rubicund king and the starry princess of this spectacle -- they paid court to each other , and everybody paid court to them .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 18]: Down near the sugar Pump Works , where Bibbs sat , there was audible speculation and admiration .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 18]: `` Wonder who that lady is -- makin ' such a hit with the old man . ''
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 7]: `` Must be some heiress . ''
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 3]: `` Heiress ?
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 15]: Golly , I guess I could stand it to marry rich , then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 51]: Edith and Sibyl were radiant : at first they had watched Miss Vertrees with an almost haggard anxiety , wondering what disasterous effect Sheridan 's pastoral gaieties -- and other things -- would have upon her , but she seemed delighted with everything , and with him most of all .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 38]: She treated him as if he were some delicious , foolish old joke that she understood perfectly , laughing at him almost violently when he bragged -- probably his first experience of that kind in his life .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 4]: It enchanted him .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 16]: As he proclaimed to the table , she had `` a way with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 20]: She had , indeed , as Roscoe Sheridan , upon her right , discovered just after the feast began .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 54]: Since his marriage three years before , no lady had bestowed upon him so protracted a full view of brilliant eyes ; and , with the look , his lovely neighbor said -- and it was her first speech to him -- `` I hope you 're very susceptible , Mr. Sheridan ! ''
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 11]: Honest Roscoe was taken aback , and `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 7]: was all he managed to say .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 25]: She repeated the look deliberately , which was noted , with a mystification equal to his own , by his sister across the table .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 35]: No one , reflected Edith , could image Mary Vertrees the sort of girl who would `` really flirt '' with married men -- she was obviously the `` opposite of all that . ''
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 24]: Edith defined her as a `` thoroughbred , '' a `` nice girl '' ; and the look given to Roscoe was astounding .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 24]: Roscoe 's wife saw it , too , and she was another whom it puzzled -- though not because its recipient was married .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 4]: `` Because ! ''
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 10]: said Mary Vertrees , replying to Roscoe 's monosyllable .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 29]: `` And also because we 're next-door neighbors at table , and it 's dull times ahead for both of us if we do n't get along . ''
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 33]: Roscoe was a literal young man , all stocks and bonds , and he had been brought up to believe that when a man married he `` married and settled down . ''
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 57]: It was `` all right , '' he felt , for a man as old as his father to pay florid compliments to as pretty a girl as this Miss Vertrees , but for himself -- `` a young married man '' -- it would n't do ; and it would n't even be quite moral .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 35]: He knew that young married people might have friendships , like his wife 's for Lamhorn ; but Sibyl and Lamhorn never `` flirted '' -- they were always very matter-of-fact with each other .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 17]: Roscoe would have been troubled if Sibyl had ever told Lamhorn she hoped he was susceptible .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 13]: `` Yes -- we 're neighbors , '' he said , awkwardly .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 12]: `` Next-door neighbors in houses , too , '' she added .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 6]: `` No , not exactly .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 7]: I live across the street . ''
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 6]: `` Why , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 7]: she exclaimed , and seemed startled .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 14]: `` Your mother told me this afternoon that you lived at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 10]: `` Yes , of course I live at home .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 10]: I built that new house across the street . ''
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 21]: `` But you -- '' she paused , confused , and then slowly a deep color came into her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 32]: `` But I understood -- '' `` No , '' he said ; `` my wife and I lived with the old folks the first year , but that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 11]: Edith and Jim live with them , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 64]: `` I -- I see , '' she said , the deep color still deepening as she turned from him and saw , written upon a card before the gentleman at her left the name , `` Mr. James Sheridan , Jr. '' And from that moment Roscoe had little enough cause for wondering what he ought to reply to her disturbing coquetries .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 33]: Mr. James Sheridan had been anxiously waiting for the dazzling visitor to `` get through with old Roscoe , '' as he thought of it , and give a bachelor a chance .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 20]: `` Old Roscoe '' was the younger , but he had always been the steady wheel-horse of the family .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 26]: Jim was `` steady '' enough , but was considered livelier than Roscoe , which in truth is not saying much for Jim 's liveliness .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 37]: As their father habitually boasted , both brothers were `` capable , hard-working young business men , '' and the principal difference between them was merely that which resulted from Jim 's being still a bachelor .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 43]: Physically they were of the same type : dark of eyes and of hair , fresh-colored and thick-set , and though Roscoe was several inches taller than Jim , neither was of the height , breadth , or depth of the father .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 30]: Both wore young business men 's mustaches , and either could have sat for the tailor-shop lithographs of young business men wearing `` rich suitings in dark mixtures . ''
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 21]: Jim , approving warmly of his neighbor 's profile , perceived her access of color , which increased his approbation .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 14]: `` What 's that old Roscoe saying to you , Miss Vertrees ? ''
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 21]: `` These young married men are mighty forward nowadays , but you must n't let 'em make you blush . ''
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 6]: `` Am I blushing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 6]: `` Are you sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 21]: And with that she gave him ample opportunity to make sure , repeating with interest the look wasted upon Roscoe .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 12]: `` I think you must be mistaken , '' she continued .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 11]: `` I think it 's your brother who is blushing .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 8]: I 've thrown him into confusion . ''
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 30]: She laughed , and then , leaning to him a little , said in a tone as confidential as she could make it , under cover of the uproar .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 15]: `` By trying to begin with him a courtship I meant for YOU ! ''
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 14]: This might well be a style new to Jim ; and it was .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 16]: He supposed it a nonsensical form of badinage , and yet it took his breath .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 23]: He realized that he wished what she said to be the literal truth , and he was instantly snared by that realization .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 5]: `` By George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 25]: `` I guess you 're the kind of girl that can say anything -- yes , and get away with it , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 52]: She laughed again -- in her way , so that he could not tell whether she was laughing at him or at herself or at the nonsense she was talking ; and she said : `` But you see I do n't care whether I get away with it or not .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 22]: I wish you 'd tell me frankly if you think I 've got a change to get away with YOU ? ''
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 16]: `` More like if you 've got a chance to get away FROM me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 6]: Jim was inspired to reply .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 19]: `` Not one in the world , especially after beginning by making fun of me like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 23]: `` I might n't be so much in fun as you think , '' she said , regarding him with sudden gravity .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 19]: `` Well , '' said Jim , in simple honesty , `` you 're a funny girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 7]: Her gravity continued an instant longer .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 13]: `` I may not turn out to be funny for YOU . ''
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 25]: `` So long as you turn out to be anything at all for me , I expect I can manage to be satisfied . ''
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 21]: And with that , to his own surprise , it was his turn to blush , whereupon she laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 39]: `` Yes , '' he said , plaintively , not wholly lacking intuition , `` I can see you 're the sort of girl that would laugh the minute you see a man really means anything ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 5]: ` Laugh ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 5]: she cried , gaily .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 13]: `` Why , it might be a matter of life and death !
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 25]: But if you want tragedy , I 'd better put the question at once , considering the mistake I made with your brother . ''
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 4]: Jim was dazed .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 64]: She seemed to be playing a little game of mockery and nonsense with him , but he had glimpses of a flashing danger in it ; he was but too sensible of being outclassed , and had somewhere a consciousness that he could never quite know this giddy and alluring lady , no matter how long it pleased her to play with him .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 12]: But he mightily wanted her to keep on playing with him .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 6]: `` Put what question ? ''
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 5]: he said , breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 53]: `` As you are a new neighbor of mine and of my family , '' she returned , speaking slowly and with a cross-examiner 's severity , `` I think it would be well for me to know at once whether you are already walking out with any young lady or not .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 6]: Mr. Sheridan , think well !
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 6]: Are you spoken for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 8]: `` Not yet , '' he gasped .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 5]: `` Are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 4]: `` NO ! ''
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 26]: she cried , and with that they both laughed again ; and the pastime proceeded , increasing both in its gaiety and in its gravity .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 34]: Observing its continuance , Mr. Robert Lamhorn , opposite , turned from a lively conversation with Edith and remarked covertly to Sibyl that Miss Vertrees was `` starting rather picturesquely with Jim . ''
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 14]: And he added , languidly , `` Do you suppose she WOULD ? ''
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 67]: For the moment Sibyl gave no sign of having heard him , but seemed interested in the clasp of a long `` rope '' of pearls , a loop of which she was allowing to swing from her fingers , resting her elbow upon the table and following with her eyes the twinkle of diamonds and platinum in the clasp at the end of the loop .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 5]: She wore many jewels .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 35]: She was pretty , but hers was not the kind of prettiness to be loaded with too sumptuous accessories , and jeweled head-dresses are dangerous -- they may emphasize the wrongness of the wearer .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 19]: `` I said Miss Vertrees seems to be starting pretty strong with Jim , '' repeated Mr. Lamhorn .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 6]: `` I heard you . ''
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 38]: There was a latent discontent always somewhere in her eyes , no matter what she threw upon the surface of cover it , and just now she did not care to cover it ; she looked sullen .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 11]: `` Starting any stronger than you did with Edith ? ''
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 3]: she inquired .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 8]: `` Oh , keep the peace ! ''
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 5]: he said , crossly .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 9]: `` That 's off , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 23]: `` You have n't been making her see it this evening -- precisely , '' said Sibyl , looking at him steadily .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 25]: `` You 've talked to her for -- '' `` For Heaven 's sake , '' he begged , `` keep the peace ! ''
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 11]: `` Well , what have you just been doing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 4]: `` SH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 7]: `` Listen to your father-in-law . ''
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 25]: Sheridan was booming and braying louder than ever , the orchestra having begun to play `` The Rosary , '' to his vast content .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 19]: `` I COUNT THEM OVER , LA-LA-TUM-TEE-DUM , '' he roared , beating the measures with his fork .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 19]: `` EACH HOUR A PEARL , EACH PEARL TEE-DUM-TUM-DUM -- What 's the matter with all you folks ?
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 6]: Why 'n' t you SING ?
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 11]: Miss Vertrees , I bet a thousand dollars YOU sing !
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 29]: Why 'n' t -- '' `` Mr. Sheridan , '' she said , turning cheerfully from the ardent Jim , `` you do n't know what you interrupted !
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 30]: Your son is n't used to my rough ways , and my soldier 's wooing frightens him , but I think he was about to say something important . ''
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 14]: `` I 'll say something important to him if he does n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 11]: the father threatened , more delighted with her than ever .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 4]: `` By gosh !
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 19]: if I was his age -- or a widower right NOW -- '' `` Oh , wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 3]: cried Mary .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 9]: `` If they 'd only make less noise !
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 8]: I want Mrs. Sheridan to hear . ''
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 11]: `` She 'd say the same , '' he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 19]: `` She 'd tell me I was mighty slow if I could n't get ahead o ' Jim .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 31]: Why , when I was his age -- '' `` You must listen to your father , '' Mary interrupted , turning to Jim , who had grown red again .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 45]: `` He 's going to tell us how , when he was your age , he made those two blades of grass grow out of a teacup -- and you could see for yourself he did n't get them out of his sleeve ! ''
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 10]: At that Sheridan pounded the table till it jumped .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 8]: `` Look here , young lady ! ''
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 3]: he roared .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 25]: `` Some o ' these days I 'm either goin ' to slap you -- or I 'm goin ' to kiss you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 23]: Edith looked aghast ; she was afraid this was indeed `` too awful , '' but Mary Vertrees burst into ringing laughter .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 4]: `` Both ! ''
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 3]: `` Both !
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 10]: The one to make me forget the other ! ''
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 28]: `` But which -- '' he began , and then suddenly gave forth such stentorian trumpetings of mirth that for once the whole table stopped to listen .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 29]: `` Jim , '' he roared , `` if you do n't propose to that girl to-night I 'll send you back to the machine-shop with Bibbs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 37]: And Bibbs -- down among the retainers by the sugar Pump Works , and watching Mary Vertrees as a ragged boy in the street might watch a rich little girl in a garden -- Bibbs heard .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 14]: He heard -- and he knew what his father 's plans were now .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 31]: CHAPTER VII Mrs. Vertrees `` sat up '' for her daughter , Mr. Vertrees having retired after a restless evening , not much soothed by the society of his Landseers .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 34]: Mary had taken a key , insisting that he should not come for her and seeming confident that she would not lack for escort ; nor did the sequel prove her confidence unwarranted .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 10]: But Mrs. Vertrees had a long vigil of it .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 73]: She was not the woman to make herself easy -- no servant had ever seen her in a wrapper -- and with her hair and dress and her shoes just what they had been when she returned from the afternoon 's call , she sat through the slow night hours in a stiff little chair under the gaslight in her own room , which was directly over the `` front hall . ''
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 29]: There , book in hand , she employed the time in her own reminiscences , though it was her belief that she was reading Madame de Remusat 's .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 35]: Her thoughts went backward into her life and into her husband 's ; and the deeper into the past they went , the brighter the pictures they brought her -- and there is tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 16]: Like her husband , she thought backward because she did not dare think forward definitely .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 56]: What thinking forward this troubled couple ventured took the form of a slender hope which neither of them could have borne to hear put in words , and yet they had talked it over , day after day , from the very hour when they heard Sheridan was to build his New House next door .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 26]: For -- so quickly does any ideal of human behavior become an antique -- their youth was of the innocent old days , so dead !
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 29]: of `` breeding '' and `` gentility , '' and no craft had been more straitly trained upon them than that of talking about things without mentioning them .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 18]: Herein was marked the most vital difference between Mr. and Mrs. Vertrees and their big new neighbor .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 17]: Sheridan , though his youth was of the same epoch , knew nothing of such matters .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 19]: He had been chopping wood for the morning fire in the country grocery while they were still dancing .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 48]: It was after one o'clock when Mrs. Vertrees heard steps and the delicate clinking of the key in the lock , and then , with the opening of the door , Mary 's laugh , and `` Yes -- if you are n't afraid -- to-morrow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 25]: The door closed , and she rushed up-stairs , bringing with her a breath of cold and bracing air into her mother 's room .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 20]: `` Yes , '' she said , before Mrs. Vertrees could speak , `` he brought me home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 39]: She let her cloak fall upon the bed , and , drawing an old red-velvet rocking-chair forward , sat beside her mother after giving her a light pat upon the shoulder and a hearty kiss upon the cheek .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 4]: `` Mamma ! ''
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 22]: Mary exclaimed , when Mrs. Vertrees had expressed a hope that she had enjoyed the evening and had not caught cold .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 9]: `` Why do n't you ask me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 8]: This inquiry obviously made her mother uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 9]: `` I do n't -- '' she faltered .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 8]: `` Ask you what , Mary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 12]: `` How I got along and what he 's like . ''
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 4]: `` Mary ! ''
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 9]: `` Oh , it is n't distressing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 3]: said Mary .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 32]: `` And I got along so fast -- '' She broke off to laugh ; continuing then , `` But that 's the way I went at it , of course .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 11]: We ARE in a hurry , are n't we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 19]: `` I do n't know what you mean , '' Mrs. Vertrees insisted , shaking her head plaintively .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 34]: `` Yes , '' said Mary , `` I 'm going out in his car with him to-morrow afternoon , and to the theater the next night -- but I stopped it there .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 24]: You see , after you give the first push , you must leave it to them while YOU pretend to run away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 20]: `` My dear , I do n't know what to -- '' `` What to make of anything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 5]: Mary finished for her .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 7]: `` So that 's all right !
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 9]: Now I 'll tell you all about it .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 8]: It was gorgeous and deafening and tee-total .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 9]: We could have lived a year on it .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 46]: I 'm not good at figures , but I calculated that if we lived six months on poor old Charlie and Ned and the station-wagon and the Victoria , we could manage at least twice as long on the cost of the ` house-warming . '
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 14]: I think the orchids alone would have lasted us a couple of months .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 30]: There they were , before me , but I could n't steal 'em and sell 'em , and so -- well , so I did what I could ! ''
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 11]: She leaned back and laughed reassuringly to her troubled mother .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 36]: `` It seemed to be a success -- what I could , '' she said , clasping her hands behind her neck and stirring the rocker to motion as a rhythmic accompaniment to her narrative .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 23]: `` The girl Edith and her sister-in-law , Mrs. Roscoe Sheridan , were too anxious about the effect of things on me .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 16]: The father 's worth a bushel of both of them , if they knew it .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 6]: He 's what he is .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 5]: I like him . ''
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 42]: She paused reflectively , continuing , `` Edith 's ` interested ' in that Lamhorn boy ; he 's good-looking and not stupid , but I think he 's -- '' She interrupted herself with a cheery outcry : `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 8]: I must n't be calling him names !
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 20]: If he 's trying to make Edith like him , I ought to respect him as a colleague . ''
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 17]: `` I do n't understand a thing you 're talking about , '' Mrs. Vertrees complained .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 5]: `` All the better !
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 29]: Well , he 's a bad lot , that Lamhorn boy ; everybody 's always known that , but the Sheridans do n't know the everybodies that know .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 9]: He sat between Edith and Mrs. Roscoe Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 31]: SHE 'S like those people you wondered about at the theater , the last time we went -- dressed in ball-gowns ; bound to show their clothes and jewels SOMEwhere !
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 19]: She flatters the father , and so did I , for that matter -- but not that way .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 6]: I treated him outrageously ! ''
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 4]: `` Mary ! ''
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 7]: `` That 's what flattered him .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 26]: After dinner he made the whole regiment of us follow him all over the house , while he lectured like a guide on the Palatine .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 31]: He gave dimensions and costs , and the whole b ` ilin ' of 'em listened as if they thought he intended to make them a present of the house .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 18]: What he was proudest of was the plumbing and that Bay of Naples panorama in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 26]: He made us look at all the plumbing -- bath-rooms and everywhere else -- and then he made us look at the Bay of Naples .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 18]: He said it was a hundred and eleven feet long , but I think it 's more .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 22]: And he led us all into the ready-made library to see a poem Edith had taken a prize with at school .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 13]: They 'd had it printed in gold letters and framed in mother-of-pearl .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 25]: But the poem itself was rather simple and wistful and nice -- he read it to us , though Edith tried to stop him .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 15]: She was modest about it , and said she 'd never written anything else .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 41]: And then , after a while , Mrs. Roscoe Sheridan asked me to come across the street to her house with them -- her husband and Edith and Mr. Lamhorn and Jim Sheridan -- '' Mrs. Vertrees was shocked . ''
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 5]: ` Jim ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 14]: `` Mary , PLEASE -- '' `` Of course , '' said Mary .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 15]: `` I 'll make it as easy for you as I can , mamma .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 6]: Mr. James Sheridan , Junior .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 39]: We went over there , and Mrs. Roscoe explained that ` the men were all dying for a drink , ' though I noticed that Mr. Lamhorn was the only one near death 's door on that account .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 15]: Edith and Mrs. Roscoe said they knew I 'd been bored at the dinner .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 29]: They were objectionably apologetic about it , and they seemed to think NOW we were going to have a ` good time ' to make up for it .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 32]: But I had n't been bored at the dinner , I 'd been amused ; and the ` good time ' at Mrs. Roscoe 's was horribly , horribly stupid . ''
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 25]: `` But , Mary , '' her mother began , `` is -- is -- '' And she seemed unable to complete the question .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 6]: `` Never mind , mamma .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 5]: I 'll say it .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 9]: Is Mr. James Sheridan , Junior , stupid ?
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 12]: I 'm sure he 's not at all stupid about business .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 23]: Otherwise -- Oh , what right have I to be calling people ` stupid ' because they 're not exactly my kind ?
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 21]: On the big dinner-table they had enormous icing models of the Sheridan Building -- '' `` Oh , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 4]: Mrs. Vertrees cried .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 5]: `` Surely not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 17]: `` Yes , and two other things of that kind -- I do n't know what .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 13]: But , after all , I wondered if they were so bad .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 59]: If I 'd been at a dinner at a palace in Italy , and a relief or inscription on one of the old silver pieces had referred to some great deed or achievement of the family , I should n't have felt superior ; I 'd have thought it picturesque and stately -- I 'd have been impressed .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 7]: And what 's the real difference ?
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 16]: The icing is temporary , and that 's much more modest , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 27]: And why is it vulgar to feel important more on account of something you 've done yourself than because of something one of your ancestors did ?
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 35]: Besides , if we go back a few generations , we 've all got such hundreds of ancestors it seems idiotic to go picking out one or two to be proud of ourselves about .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 36]: Well , then , mamma , I managed not to feel superior to Mr. James Sheridan , Junior , because he did n't see anything out of place in the Sheridan Building in sugar . ''
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 27]: Mrs. Vertrees 's expression had lost none of its anxiety pending the conclusion of this lively bit of analysis , and she shook her head gravely .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 43]: `` My dear , dear child , '' she said , `` it seems to me -- It looks -- I 'm afraid -- '' `` Say as much of it as you can , mamma , '' said Mary , encouragingly .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 16]: `` I can get it , if you 'll just give me one key-word . ''
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 40]: `` Everything you say , '' Mrs. Vertrees began , timidly , `` seems to have the air of -- it is as if you were seeking to -- to make yourself -- '' `` Oh , I see !
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 17]: You mean I sound as if I were trying to force myself to like him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 6]: `` Not exactly , Mary .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 20]: That was n't quite what I meant , '' said Mrs. Vertrees , speaking direct untruth with perfect unconsciousness .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 69]: `` But you said that -- that you found the latter part of the evening at young Mrs. Sheridan 's unentertaining -- '' `` And as Mr. James Sheridan was there , and I saw more of him than at dinner , and had a horribly stupid time in spite of that , you think I -- '' And then it was Mary who left the deduction unfinished .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 24]: Mrs. Vertrees nodded ; and though both the mother and the daughter understood , Mary felt it better to make the understanding definite .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 18]: `` Well , '' she asked , gravely , `` is there anything else I can do ?
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 41]: You and papa do n't want me to do anything that distresses me , and so , as this is the only thing to be done , it seems it 's up to me not to let it distress me .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 13]: That 's all there is about it , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 8]: `` But nothing MUST distress you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 4]: the mother cried .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 8]: `` That 's what I say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 5]: said Mary , cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 7]: `` And so it does n't .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 6]: It 's all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 19]: She rose and took her cloak over her arm , as if to go to her own room .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 28]: But on the way to the door she stopped , and stood leaning against the foot of the bed , contemplating a threadbare rug at her feet .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 22]: `` Mother , you 've told me a thousand times that it does n't really matter whom a girl marries . ''
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 6]: `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 4]: Mrs. Vertrees protested .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 21]: `` I never said such a -- '' `` No , not in words ; I mean what you MEANT .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 26]: It 's true , is n't it , that marriage really is ` not a bed of roses , but a field of battle ' ?
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 20]: To get right down to it , a girl could fight it out with anybody , could n't she ?
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 8]: One man as well as another ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 6]: `` Oh , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 20]: I 'm sure your father and I -- '' `` Yes , yes , '' said Mary , indulgently .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 9]: `` I do n't mean you and papa .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 9]: But is n't it propinquity that makes marriages ?
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 14]: So many people say so , there must be something in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 15]: `` Mary , I ca n't bear for you to talk like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 17]: And Mrs. Vertrees lifted pleading eyes to her daughter -- eyes that begged to be spared .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 8]: `` It sounds -- almost reckless ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 14]: Mary caught the appeal , came to her , and kissed her gaily .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 6]: `` Never fret , dear !
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 24]: I 'm not likely to do anything I do n't want to do -- I 've always been too thorough-going a little pig !
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 28]: And if it IS propinquity that does our choosing for us , well , at least no girl in the world could ask for more than THAT !
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 15]: How could there be any more propinquity than the very house next door ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 30]: She gave her mother a final kiss and went gaily all the way to the door this time , pausing for her postscript with her hand on the knob .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 28]: `` Oh , the one that caught me looking in the window , mamma , the youngest one -- '' `` Did he speak of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 6]: Mrs. Vertrees asked , apprehensively .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 15]: He did n't speak at all , that I saw , to any one .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 6]: I did n't meet him .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 24]: But he is n't insane , I 'm sure ; or if he is , he has long intervals when he 's not .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 27]: Mr. James Sheridan mentioned that he lived at home when he was ` well enough ' ; and it may be he 's only an invalid .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 52]: He looks dreadfully ill , but he has pleasant eyes , and it struck me that if -- if one were in the Sheridan family '' -- she laughed a little ruefully -- `` he might be interesting to talk to sometimes , when there was too much stocks and bonds .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 9]: I did n't see him after dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 14]: `` There must be something wrong with him , '' said Mrs. Vertrees .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 12]: `` They 'd have introduced him if there was n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 27]: He 's been ill so much and away so much -- sometimes people like that just do n't seem to ` count ' in a family .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 25]: His father spoke of sending him back to a machine-shop or some sort ; I suppose he meant when the poor thing gets better .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 40]: I glanced at him just then , when Mr. Sheridan mentioned him , and he happened to be looking straight at me ; and he was pathetic-looking enough before that , but the most tragic change came over him .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 13]: He seemed just to die , right there at the table ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 16]: `` You mean when his father spoke of sending him to the shop place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 9]: `` Mr. Sheridan must be very unfeeling . ''
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 41]: `` No , '' said Mary , thoughtfully , `` I do n't think he is ; but he might be uncomprehending , and certainly he 's the kind of man to do anything he once sets out to do .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 15]: But I wish I had n't been looking at that poor boy just then !
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 15]: I 'm afraid I 'll keep remembering -- '' `` I would n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 19]: Mrs. Vertrees smiled faintly , and in her smile there was the remotest ghost of a genteel roguishness .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 13]: `` I 'd keep my mind on pleasanter things , Mary . ''
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 5]: Mary laughed and nodded .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 5]: `` Yes , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 20]: Plenty pleasant enough , and probably , if all were known , too good -- even for me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 33]: And when she had gone Mrs. Vertrees drew a long breath , as if a burden were off her mind , and , smiling , began to undress in a gentle reverie .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 21]: CHAPTER VIII Edith , glancing casually into the `` ready-made '' library , stopped abruptly , seeing Bibbs there alone .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 14]: He was standing before the pearl-framed and golden-lettered poem , musingly inspecting it .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 21]: He read it : FUGITIVE I will forget the things that sting : The lashing look , the barbed word .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 22]: I know the very hands that fling The stones at me had never stirred To anger but for their own scars .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 11]: They 've suffered so , that 's why they strike .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 15]: I 'll keep my heart among the stars Where none shall hunt it out .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 21]: Oh , like These wounded ones I must not be , For , wounded , I might strike in turn !
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 7]: So , none shall hurt me .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 12]: Far and free Where my heart flies no one shall learn .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 4]: `` Bibbs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 43]: Edith 's voice was angry , and her color deepened suddenly as she came into the room , preceded by a scent of violets much more powerful than that warranted by the actual bunch of them upon the lapel of her coat .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 18]: Bibbs did not turn his head , but wagged it solemnly , seeming depressed by the poem .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 9]: `` Pretty young , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 26]: `` There must have been something about your looks that got the prize , Edith ; I ca n't believe the poem did it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 36]: She glanced hurriedly over her shoulder and spoke sharply , but in a low voice : `` I do n't think it 's very nice of you to bring it up at all , Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 12]: I 'd like a chance to forget the whole silly business .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 46]: I did n't want them to frame it , and I wish to goodness papa 'd quit talking about it ; but here , that night , after the dinner , did n't he go and read it aloud to the whole crowd of 'em !
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 54]: And then they all wanted to know what other poems I 'd written and why I did n't keep it up and write some more , and if I did n't , why did n't I , and why this and why that , till I thought I 'd die of shame ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 15]: `` You could tell 'em you had writer 's cramp , '' Bibbs suggested .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 8]: `` I could n't tell 'em anything !
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 14]: I just choke with mortification every time anybody speaks of the thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 4]: Bibbs looked grieved .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 10]: `` The poem is n't THAT bad , Edith .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 13]: You see , you were only seventeen when you wrote it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 7]: `` Oh , hush up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 3]: she snapped .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 15]: `` I wish it had burnt my fingers the first time I touched it .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 14]: Then I might have had sense enough to leave it where it was .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 26]: I had no business to take it , and I 've been ashamed -- '' `` No , no , '' he said , comfortingly .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 13]: `` It was the very most flattering thing ever happen to me .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 35]: It was almost my last flight before I went to the machine-shop , and it 's pleasant to think somebody liked it enough to -- '' `` But I DO N'T like it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 25]: `` I do n't even understand it -- and papa made so much fuss over its getting the prize , I just hate it !
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 13]: The truth is I never dreamed it 'd get the prize . ''
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 14]: `` Maybe they expected father to endow the school , '' Bibbs murmured .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 20]: `` Well , I had to have something to turn in , and I could n't write a LINE !
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 25]: I hate poetry , anyhow ; and Bobby Lamhorn 's always teasing me about how I ` keep my heart among the stars . '
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 17]: He makes it seem such a mushy kind of thing , the way he says it .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 5]: I hate it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 11]: `` You 'll have to live it down , Edith .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 17]: Perhaps abroad and under another name you might find -- '' `` Oh , hush up !
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 18]: I 'll hire some one to steal it and burn it the first chance I get . ''
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 10]: She turned away petulantly , moving to the door .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 20]: `` I 'd like to think I could hope to hear the last of it before I die ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 4]: `` Edith ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 10]: he called , as she went into the hall .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 7]: `` What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 23]: `` I want to ask you : Do I really look better , or have you just got used to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 9]: `` What on earth do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 11]: she said , coming back as far as the threshold .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 21]: `` When I first came you could n't look at me , '' Bibbs explained , in his impersonal way .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 11]: `` But I 've noticed you look at me lately .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 24]: I wondered if I 'd -- '' `` It 's because you look so much better , '' she told him , cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 15]: `` This month you 've been here 's done you no end of good .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 6]: It 's the change . ''
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 16]: `` Yes , that 's what they said at the sanitarium -- the change . ''
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 20]: `` You look worse than ` most anybody I ever saw , '' said Edith , with supreme candor .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 10]: `` But I do n't know much about it .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 30]: I 've never seen a corpse in my life , and I 've never even seen anybody that was terribly sick , so you must n't judge by me .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 14]: I only know you do look better , I 'm glad to say .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 16]: But you 're right about my not being able to look at you at first .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 33]: You had a kind of whiteness that -- Well , you 're almost as thin , I suppose , but you 've got more just ordinarily pale ; not that ghastly look .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 20]: Anybody could look at you now , Bibbs , and no -- not get -- '' `` Sick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 7]: `` Well -- almost that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 3]: she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 17]: `` And you 're getting a better color every day , Bibbs ; you really are .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 7]: You 're getting along splendidly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 15]: `` I -- I 'm afraid so , '' he said , ruefully . ''
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 5]: ` Afraid so ' !
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 9]: Well , if you are n't the queerest !
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 18]: I suppose you mean father might send you back to the machine-shop if you get well enough .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 29]: I heard him say something about it the night of the -- '' The jingle of a distant bell interrupted her , and she glanced at her watch .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 4]: `` Bobby Lamhorn !
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 16]: I 'm going to motor him out to look at a place in the country .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 5]: Afternoon , Bibbs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 23]: When she had gone , Bibbs mooned pessimistically from shelf to shelf , his eye wandering among the titles of the books .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 58]: The library consisted almost entirely of handsome `` uniform editions '' : Irving , Poe , Cooper , Goldsmith , Scott , Byron , Burns , Longfellow , Tennyson , Hume , Gibbon , Prescott , Thackeray , Dickens , De Musset , Balzac , Gautier , Flaubert , Goethe , Schiller , Dante , and Tasso .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 56]: There were shelves and shelves of encyclopedias , of anthologies , of `` famous classics , '' of `` Oriental masterpieces , '' of `` masterpieces of oratory , '' and more shelves of `` selected libraries '' of `` literature , '' of `` the drama , '' and of `` modern science . ''
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 72]: They made an effective decoration for the room , all these big , expensive books , with a glossy binding here and there twinkling a reflection of the flames that crackled in the splendid Gothic fireplace ; but Bibbs had an impression that the bookseller who selected them considered them a relief , and that white-jacket considered them a burden of dust , and that nobody else considered them at all .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 7]: Himself , he disturbed not one .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 27]: There came a chime of bells from a clock in another part of the house , and white-jacket appeared beamingly in the doorway , bearing furs .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 11]: `` Awready , Mist ' Bibbs , '' he announced .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 41]: `` You ' ma say wrap up wawm f ' you ' ride , an ' she cain ' go with you to-day , an ' not f ` git go see you ' pa at fo ' ` clock .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 6]: Aw ready , suh . ''
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 26]: He equipped Bibbs for the daily drive Dr. Gurney had commanded ; and in the manner of a master of ceremonies unctuously led the way .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 37]: In the hall they passed the Moor , and Bibbs paused before it while white-jacket opened the door with a flourish and waved condescendingly to the chauffeur in the car which stood waiting in the driveway .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 30]: `` It seems to me I asked you what you thought about this ` statue ' when I first came home , George , '' said Bibbs , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 8]: `` What did you tell me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 4]: `` Yessuh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 21]: George chuckled , perfectly understanding that for some unknown reason Bibbs enjoyed hearing him repeat his opinion of the Moor .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 45]: `` You ast me when you firs ' come home , an ' you ast me nex ' day , an ' mighty near ev ' y day all time you been here ; an ' las ' Sunday you ast me twicet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 6]: He shook his head solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 18]: `` Look to me mus ' be somep 'm might lamiDAL ` bout ` at statue ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 5]: `` Mighty what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 5]: `` Mighty lamiDAL ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 6]: George , burst out laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 13]: `` What DO ` at word mean , Mist ' Bibbs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 9]: `` It 's new to me , George .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 7]: Where did you hear it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 9]: `` I nev ' DID hear it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 3]: said George .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 28]: `` I uz dess sittin ' thinkum to myse ' f an ' she pop in my head -- ` lamiDAL , ' dess like ` at !
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 18]: An ' she soun ' so good , seem like she GOT TA mean somep 'm ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 14]: `` Come to think of it , I believe she does mean something .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 10]: Why , yes -- '' `` Do she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 3]: cried George .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 6]: `` WHAT she mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 24]: `` It 's exactly the word for the statue , '' said Bibbs , with conviction , as he climbed into the car .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 8]: `` It 's a lamiDAL statue . ''
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 4]: `` Hiyi ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 3]: George exulted .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 3]: `` Man !
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 2]: Man !
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 2]: Listen !
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 21]: Well , suh , she mighty lamiDAL statue , but lamiDAL statue heap o ' trouble to dus ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 7]: `` I expect she is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 20]: said Bibbs , as the engine began to churn ; and a moment later he was swept from sight .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 16]: George turned to Mist ' Jackson , who had been listening benevolently in the hallway .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 18]: `` Same he aw-ways say , Mist ' Jackson -- ' I expec ' she is ! '
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 36]: Ev ' y day he try t ' git me talk ` bout ` at lamiDAL statue , an ' aw-ways , las ' thing HE say , ' I expec ' she is ! '
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 29]: You know , Mist ' Jackson , if he git well , ` at young man go ' be pride o ' the family , Mist ' Jackson .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 15]: Yes-suh , right now I pick ` im fo ' firs ' money ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 12]: `` Look out with all ` at money , George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 5]: Jackson warned the enthusiast .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 15]: `` White folks 'n ` is house know ` im heap longer 'n you .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 13]: You the on ' y man bettin ' on ` im ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 6]: `` I risk it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 5]: cried George , merrily .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 13]: `` I put her all on now -- ev ' y cent !
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 14]: ` At boy 's go ' be flower o ' the flock ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 39]: This singular prophecy , founded somewhat recklessly upon gratitude for the meaning of `` lamiDAL , '' differed radically from another prediction concerning Bibbs , set forth for the benefit of a fair auditor some twenty minutes later .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 28]: Jim Sheridan , skirting the edges of the town with Mary Vertrees beside him , in his own swift machine , encountered the invalid upon the highroad .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 53]: The two cars were going in opposite directions , and the occupants of Jim 's had only a swaying glimpse of Bibbs sitting alone on the back seat -- his white face startlingly white against cap and collar of black fur -- but he flashed into recognition as Mary bowed to him .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 7]: Jim waved his left hand carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 13]: `` It 's Bibbs , taking his constitutional , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 10]: `` Yes , I know , '' said Mary .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 15]: `` I bowed to him , too , though I 've never met him .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 14]: In fact , I 've only seen him once -- no , twice .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 16]: I hope he wo n't think I 'm very bold , bowing to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 13]: `` I doubt if he noticed it , '' said honest Jim .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 6]: `` Oh , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 7]: `` What 's the trouble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 15]: `` I 'm almost sure people notice it when I bow to them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 7]: `` Oh , I see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 3]: said Jim .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 13]: `` Of course they would ordinarily , but Bibbs is funny . ''
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 4]: `` Is he ?
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 3]: How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 10]: `` He strikes me as anything but funny . ''
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 49]: `` Well , I 'm his brother , '' Jim said , deprecatingly , `` but I do n't know what he 's like , and , to tell the truth , I 've never felt exactly like I WAS his brother , the way I do Roscoe .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 11]: Bibbs never did seem more than half alive to me .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 34]: Of course Roscoe and I are older , and when we were boys we were too big to play with him , but he never played anyway , with boys his own age .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 14]: He 'd rather just sit in the house and mope around by himself .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 19]: Nobody could ever get him to DO anything ; you ca n't get him to do anything now .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 32]: He never had any LIFE in him ; and honestly , if he is my brother , I must say I believe Bibbs Sheridan is the laziest man God ever made !
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 28]: Father put him in the machine-shop over at the Pump Works -- best thing in the world for him -- and he was just plain no account .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 5]: It made him sick !
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 34]: If he 'd had the right kind of energy -- the kind father 's got , for instance , or Roscoe , either -- why , it would n't have made him sick .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 29]: And suppose it was either of them -- yes , or me , either -- do you think any of us would have stopped if we WERE sick ?
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 3]: Not much !
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 21]: I hate to say it , but Bibbs Sheridan 'll never amount to anything as long as he lives . ''
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 4]: Mary looked thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 11]: `` Is there any particular reason why he should ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 5]: `` Good gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 10]: `` You do n't mean that , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 25]: Do n't you believe in a man 's knowing how to earn his salt , no matter how much money his father 's got ?
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 17]: Has n't the business of this world got to be carried on by everybody in it ?
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 20]: Are we going to lay back on what we 've got and see other fellows get ahead of us ?
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 23]: If we 've got big things already , is n't it every man 's business to go ahead and make 'em bigger ?
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 6]: Is n't it his duty ?
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 12]: Do n't we always want to get bigger and bigger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 8]: `` Ye-es -- I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 9]: But I feel rather sorry for your brother .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 9]: He looked so lonely -- and sick . ''
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 13]: `` He 's gettin ' better every day , '' Jim said .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 6]: `` Dr. Gurney says so .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 16]: There 's nothing much the matter with him , really -- it 's nine-tenths imaginary .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 4]: ` Nerves ' !
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 24]: People that are willing to be busy do n't have nervous diseases , because they do n't have time to imagine 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 10]: `` You mean his trouble is really mental ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 13]: `` Oh , he 's not a lunatic , '' said Jim .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 6]: `` He 's just queer .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 34]: Sometimes he 'll say something right bright , but half the time what he says is ` way off the subject , or else there is n't any sense to it at all .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 20]: For instance , the other day I heard him talkin ' to one of the darkies in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 58]: The darky asked him what time he wanted the car for his drive , and anybody else in the world would have just said what time they DID want it , and that would have been all there was to it ; but here 's what Bibbs says , and I heard him with my own ears .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 10]: ` What time do I want the car ? '
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 3]: he says .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 15]: ` Well , now , that depends -- that depends , ' he says .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 9]: He talks slow like that , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 32]: ` I 'll tell you what time I want the car , George , ' he says , ` if you 'll tell ME what you think of this statue ! '
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 6]: That 's exactly his words !
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 18]: Asked the darky what he thought of that Arab Edith and mother bought for the hall ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 5]: Mary pondered upon this .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 14]: `` He might have been in fun , perhaps , '' she suggested .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 20]: `` Askin ' a darky what he thought of a piece of statuary -- of a work of art !
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 10]: Where on earth would be the fun of that ?
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 29]: No , you 're just kind-hearted -- and that 's the way you OUGHT to be , of course -- '' `` Thank you , Mr. Sheridan ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 3]: she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 5]: `` See here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 17]: `` Is n't there any way for us to get over this Mister and Miss thing ?
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 43]: A month 's got thirty-one days in it ; I 've managed to be with you a part of pretty near all the thirty-one , and I think you know how I feel by this time -- '' She looked panic-stricken immediately .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 11]: `` Oh , no , '' she protested , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 27]: `` No , I do n't , and -- '' `` Yes , you do , '' he said , and his voice shook a little .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 8]: `` You could n't help knowing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 6]: `` But I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 5]: she denied , hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 6]: `` I do help knowing .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 8]: I mean -- Oh , wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 4]: `` What for ?
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 33]: You do know how I feel , and you -- well , you 've certainly WANTED me to feel that way -- or else pretended -- '' `` Now , now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 3]: she lamented .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 11]: `` You 're spoiling such a cheerful afternoon ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 7]: ` Spoilin ' it ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 13]: He slowed down the car and turned his face to her squarely .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 15]: `` See here , Miss Vertrees , have n't you -- '' `` Stop !
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 7]: Stop the car a minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 19]: And when he had complied she faced him as squarely as he evidently desired her to face him .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 3]: `` Listen .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 12]: I do n't want you to go on , to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 5]: he asked , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 7]: `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 10]: `` You mean it 's just a whim ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 10]: `` I do n't know , '' she repeated .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 18]: Her voice was low and troubled and honest , and she kept her clear eyes upon his .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 8]: `` Will you tell me something ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 5]: `` Almost anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 12]: `` Have you ever told any man you loved him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 14]: And at that , though she laughed , she looked a little contemptuous .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 7]: `` No , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 21]: `` And I do n't think I ever shall tell any man that -- or ever know what it means .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 9]: I 'm in earnest , Mr. Sheridan . ''
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 13]: `` Then you -- you 've just been flirting with me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 8]: Poor Jim looked both furious and crestfallen .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 6]: `` Not one bit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 5]: `` Not one word !
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 4]: Not one syllable !
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 8]: I 've meant every single thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 14]: `` I do n't -- '' `` Of course you do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 14]: `` Now , Mr. Sheridan , I want you to start the car .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 2]: Now !
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 3]: Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 11]: Slowly , till I finish what I have to say .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 7]: I have not flirted with you .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 6]: I have deliberately courted you .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 23]: One thing more , and then I want you to take me straight home , talking about the weather all the way .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 22]: I said that I do not believe I shall ever ` care ' for any man , and that is true .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 21]: I doubt the existence of the kind of ` caring ' we hear about in poems and plays and novels .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 16]: I think it must be just a kind of emotional TALK -- most of it .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 10]: At all events , I do n't feel it .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 10]: Now , we can go faster , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 10]: `` Just where does that let me out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 32]: `` How does that excuse you for -- '' `` It is n't an excuse , '' she said , gently , and gave him one final look , wholly desolate .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 11]: `` I have n't said I should never marry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 3]: Jim gasped .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 17]: She inclined her head in a broken sort of acquiescence , very humble , unfathomably sorrowful .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 11]: `` I promise nothing , '' she said , faintly .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 6]: `` You need n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 7]: shouted Jim , radiant and exultant .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 5]: `` You need n't !
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 3]: By George !
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 12]: I know you 're square ; that 's enough for me !
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 10]: You wait and promise whenever you 're ready ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 13]: `` Do n't forget what I asked , '' she begged him .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 6]: `` Talk about the weather ?
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 3]: I will !
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 7]: God bless the old weather ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 5]: cried the happy Jim .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 66]: CHAPTER IX Through the open country Bibbs was borne flying between brown fields and sun-flecked groves of gray trees , to breathe the rushing , clean air beneath a glorious sky -- that sky so despised in the city , and so maltreated there , that from early October to mid-May it was impossible for men to remember that blue is the rightful color overhead .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 26]: Upon each of Bibbs 's cheeks there was a hint of something almost resembling a pinkishness ; not actual color , but undeniably its phantom .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 58]: How largely this apparition may have been the work of the wind upon his face it is difficult to calculate , for beyond a doubt it was partly the result of a lady 's bowing to him upon no more formal introduction than the circumstance of his having caught her looking into his window a month before .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 10]: She had bowed definitely ; she had bowed charmingly .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 15]: And it seemed to Bibbs that she must have meant to convey her forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 22]: There had been something in her recognition of him unfamiliar to his experience , and he rode the warmer for it .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 48]: Nor did he lack the impression that he would long remember her as he had just seen her : her veil tumultuously blowing back , her face glowing in the wind -- and that look of gay friendliness tossed to him like a fresh rose in carnival .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 35]: By and by , upon a rising ground , the driver halted the car , then backed and tacked , and sent it forward again with its nose to the south and the smoke .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 32]: Far before him Bibbs saw the great smudge upon the horizon , that nest of cloud in which the city strove and panted like an engine shrouded in its own steam .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 49]: But to Bibbs , who had now to go to the very heart of it , for a commanded interview with his father , the distant cloud was like an implacable genius issuing thunderously in smoke from his enchanted bottle , and irresistibly drawing Bibbs nearer and nearer .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 70]: They passed from the farm lands , and came , in the amber light of November late afternoon , to the farthermost outskirts of the city ; and here the sky shimmered upon the verge of change from blue to gray ; the smoke did not visibly permeate the air , but it was there , nevertheless -- impalpable , thin , no more than the dust of smoke .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 60]: And then , as the car drove on , the chimneys and stacks of factories came swimming up into view like miles of steamers advancing abreast , every funnel with its vast plume , savage and black , sweeping to the horizon , dripping wealth and dirt and suffocation over league on league already rich and vile with grime .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 27]: The sky had become only a dingy thickening of the soiled air ; and a roar and clangor of metals beat deafeningly on Bibbs 's ears .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 61]: And now the car passed two great blocks of long brick buildings , hideous in all ways possible to make them hideous ; doorways showing dark one moment and lurid the next with the leap of some virulent interior flame , revealing blackened giants , half naked , in passionate action , struggling with formless things in the hot illumination .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 37]: And big as these shops were , they were growing bigger , spreading over a third block , where two new structures were mushrooming to completion in some hasty cement process of a stability not over-reassuring .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 33]: Bibbs pulled the rug closer about him , and not even the phantom of color was left upon his cheeks as he passed this place , for he knew it too well .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 94]: Across the face of one of the buildings there was an enormous sign : `` Sheridan Automatic Pump Co. , Inc. '' Thence they went through streets of wooden houses , all grimed , and adding their own grime from many a sooty chimney ; flimsey wooden houses of a thousand flimsy whimsies in the fashioning , built on narrow lots and nudging one another crossly , shutting out the stingy sunlight from one another ; bad neighbors who would destroy one another root and branch some night when the right wind blew .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 32]: They were only waiting for that wind and a cigarette , and then they would all be gone together -- a pinch of incense burned upon the tripod of the god .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 26]: Along these streets there were skinny shade-trees , and here and there a forest elm or walnut had been left ; but these were dying .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 44]: Some people said it was the scale ; some said it was the smoke ; and some were sure that asphalt and `` improving '' the streets did it ; but Bigness was in too Big a hurry to bother much about trees .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 17]: He had telegraph-poles and telephone-poles and electric-light-poles and trolley-poles by the thousand to take their places .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 12]: So he let the trees die and put up his poles .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 27]: They were hideous , but nobody minded that ; and sometimes the wires fell and killed people -- but not often enough to matter at all .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 93]: Thence onward the car bore Bibbs through the older parts of the town where the few solid old houses not already demolished were in transition : some , with their fronts torn away , were being made into segments of apartment-buildings ; others had gone uproariously into trade , brazenly putting forth `` show-windows '' on their first floors , seeming to mean it for a joke ; one or two with unaltered facades peeped humorously over the tops of temporary office buildings of one story erected in the old front yards .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 21]: Altogether , the town here was like a boarding-house hash the Sunday after Thanksgiving ; the old ingredients were discernible .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 21]: This was the fringe of Bigness 's own sanctuary , and now Bibbs reached the roaring holy of holies itself .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 22]: The car must stop at every crossing while the dark-garbed crowds , enveloped in maelstroms of dust , hurried before it .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 66]: Magnificent new buildings , already dingy , loomed hundreds of feet above him ; newer ones , more magnificent , were rising beside them , rising higher ; old buildings were coming down ; middle-aged buildings were coming down ; the streets were laid open to their entrails and men worked underground between palisades , and overhead in metal cobwebs like spiders in the sky .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 91]: Trolley-cars and long interurban cars , built to split the wind like torpedo-boats , clanged and shrieked their way round swarming corners ; motor-cars of every kind and shape known to man babbled frightful warnings and frantic demands ; hospital ambulances clamored wildly for passage ; steam-whistles signaled the swinging of titanic tentacle and claw ; riveters rattled like machine-guns ; the ground shook to the thunder of gigantic trucks ; and the conglomerate sound of it all was the sound of earthquake playing accompaniments for battle and sudden death .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 15]: On one of the new steel buildings no work was being done that afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 24]: The building had killed a man in the morning -- and the steel-workers always stop for the day when that `` happens . ''
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 36]: And in the hurrying crowds , swirling and sifting through the brobdingnagian camp of iron and steel , one saw the camp-followers and the pagan women -- there would be work to-day and dancing to-night .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 27]: For the Puritan 's dry voice is but the crackling of a leaf underfoot in the rush and roar of the coming of the new Egypt .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 5]: Bibbs was on time .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 35]: He knew it must be `` to the minute '' or his father would consider it an outrage ; and the big chronometer in Sheridan 's office marked four precisely when Bibbs walked in .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 23]: Coincidentally with his entrance five people who had been at work in the office , under Sheridan 's direction , walked out .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 20]: They departed upon no visible or audible suggestion , and with a promptness that seemed ominous to the new-comer .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 70]: As the massive door clicked softly behind the elderly stenographer , the last of the procession , Bibbs had a feeling that they all understood that he was a failure as a great man 's son , a disappointment , the `` queer one '' of the family , and that he had been summoned to judgment -- a well-founded impression , for that was exactly what they understood .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 8]: `` Sit down , '' said Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 20]: It is frequently an advantage for deans , school-masters , and worried fathers to place delinquents in the sitting-posture .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 3]: Bibbs sat .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 43]: Sheridan , standing , gazed enigmatically upon his son for a period of silence , then walked slowly to a window and stood looking out of it , his big hands , loosely hooked together by the thumbs , behind his back .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 22]: They were soiled , as were all other hands down-town , except such as might be still damp from a basin .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 31]: `` Well , Bibbs , '' he said at last , not altering his attitude , `` do you know what I 'm goin ' to do with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 16]: Bibbs , leaning back in his chair , fixed his eyes contemplatively upon the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 16]: `` I heard you tell Jim , '' he began , in his slow way .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 21]: `` You said you 'd send him to the machine-shop with me if he did n't propose to Miss Vertrees .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 11]: So I suppose that must be your plan for me .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 8]: But -- '' `` But what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 10]: said Sheridan , irritably , as the son paused .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 13]: `` Is n't there somebody you 'd let ME propose to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 10]: That brought his father sharply round to face him .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 6]: `` You beat the devil !
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 9]: Bibbs , what IS the matter with you ?
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 10]: Why ca n't you be like anybody else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 11]: `` Liver , maybe , '' said Bibbs , gently .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 3]: `` Boh !
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 14]: Even ole Doc Gurney says there 's nothin ' wrong with you organically .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 21]: You 're a dreamer , Bibbs ; that 's what 's the matter , and that 's ALL the matter .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 16]: Oh , not one o ' these BIG dreamers that put through the big deals !
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 4]: No , sir !
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 28]: You 're the kind o ' dreamer that just sets out on the back fence and thinks about how much trouble there must be in the world !
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 47]: That ai n't the kind that builds the bridges , Bibbs ; it 's the kind that borrows fifteen cents from his wife 's uncle 's brother-in-law to get ten cent 's worth o ' plug tobacco and a nickel 's worth o ' quinine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 19]: He put the finishing touch on this etching with a snort , and turned again to the window .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 6]: `` Look out there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 5]: he bade his son .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 8]: `` Look out o ' that window !
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 9]: Look at the life and energy down there !
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 20]: I should think ANY young man 's blood would tingle to get into it and be part of it .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 15]: Look at the big things young men are doin ' in this town ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 16]: He swung about , coming to the mahogany desk in the middle of the room .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 12]: `` Look at what I was doin ' at your age !
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 10]: Look at what your own brothers are doin ' !
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 4]: Look at Roscoe !
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 7]: Yes , and look at Jim !
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 60]: I made Jim president o ' the Sheridan Realty Company last New-Year 's , with charge of every inch o ' ground and every brick and every shingle and stick o ' wood we own ; and it 's an example to any young man -- or ole man , either -- the way he took ahold of it .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 20]: Last July we found out we wanted two more big warehouses at the Pump Works -- wanted 'em quick .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 25]: Contractors said it could n't be done ; said nine or ten months at the soonest ; could n't see it any other way .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 5]: What 'd Jim do ?
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 39]: Took the contract himself ; found a fellow with a new cement and concrete process ; kept men on the job night and day , and stayed on it night and day himself -- and , by George !
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 9]: we begin to USE them warehouses next week !
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 11]: Four months and a half , and every inch fireproof !
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 15]: I tell you Jim 's one o ' these fellers that make miracles happen !
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 35]: Now , I do n't say every young man can be like Jim , because there 's mighty few got his ability , but every young man can go in and do his share .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 26]: This town is God 's own country , and there 's opportunity for anybody with a pound of energy and an ounce o ' gumption .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 15]: I tell you these young business men I watch just do my heart good !
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 14]: THEY do n't set around on the back fence -- no , sir !
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 56]: They take enough exercise to keep their health ; and they go to a baseball game once or twice a week in summer , maybe , and they 're raisin ' nice families , with sons to take their places sometime and carry on the work -- because the work 's got to go ON !
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 48]: They 're puttin ' their life-blood into it , I tell you , and that 's why we 're gettin ' bigger every minute , and why THEY 'RE gettin ' bigger , and why it 's all goin ' to keep ON gettin ' bigger ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 43]: He slapped the desk resoundingly with his open palm , and then , observing that Bibbs remained in the same impassive attitude , with his eyes still fixed upon the ceiling in a contemplation somewhat plaintive , Sheridan was impelled to groan .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 6]: `` Oh , Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 9]: `` This is the way you always were .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 14]: I do n't believe you understood a darn word I been sayin ' !
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 9]: You do n't LOOK as if you did .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 3]: By George !
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 5]: it 's discouraging ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 27]: `` I do n't understand about getting -- about getting bigger , '' said Bibbs , bringing his gaze down to look at his father placatively .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 13]: `` I do n't see just why -- '' `` WHAT ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 19]: Sheridan leaned forward , resting his hands upon the desk and staring across it incredulously at his son .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 17]: `` I do n't understand -- exactly -- what you want it all bigger for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 5]: `` Great God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 14]: shouted Sheridan , and struck the desk a blow with his clenched fist .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 9]: `` A son of mine asks me that !
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 12]: You go out and ask the poorest day-laborer you can find !
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 23]: Ask him that question -- '' `` I did once , '' Bibbs interrupted ; `` when I was in the machine-shop .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 10]: I -- '' `` Wha 'd he say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 11]: `` He said , ` Oh , hell ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 5]: answered Bibbs , mildly .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 9]: `` Yes , I reckon he would ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 7]: Sheridan swung away from the desk .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 7]: `` I reckon he certainly would !
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 13]: And I got plenty sympathy with him right now , myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 10]: `` It 's the same answer , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 9]: Bibbs 's voice was serious , almost tremulous .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 4]: `` Damnation ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 3]: Sheridan roared .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 12]: `` Did you ever hear the word Prosperity , you ninny ?
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 8]: Did you ever hear the word Ambition ?
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 9]: Did you ever hear the word PROGRESS ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 22]: He flung himself into a chair after the outburst , his big chest surging , his throat tumultuous with gutteral incoherences .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 26]: `` Now then , '' he said , huskily , when the anguish had somewhat abated , `` what do you want to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 4]: `` Sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 12]: `` What do you WANT to do , I said . ''
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 7]: Taken by surprise , Bibbs stammered .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 32]: `` What -- what do -- I -- what -- '' `` If I 'd let you do exactly what you had the whim for , what would you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 13]: Bibbs looked startled ; then timidity overwhelmed him -- a profound shyness .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 36]: He bent his head and fixed his lowered eyes upon the toe of his shoe , which he moved to and fro upon the rug , like a culprit called to the desk in school .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 6]: `` What would you do ?
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 3]: Loaf ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 6]: `` No , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 19]: Bibbs 's voice was almost inaudible , and what little sound it made was unquestionably a guilty sound .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 14]: `` I suppose I 'd -- I 'd -- '' `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 12]: `` I suppose I 'd try to -- to write . ''
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 5]: `` Write what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 12]: `` Nothing important -- just poems and essays , perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 5]: `` That all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 20]: `` I see , '' said his father , breathing quickly with the restraint he was putting upon himself .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 22]: `` That is , you want to write , but you do n't want to write anything of any account . ''
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 10]: `` You think -- '' Sheridan got up again .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 22]: `` I take my hat off to the man that can write a good ad , '' he said , emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 18]: `` The best writin ' talent in this country is right spang in the ad business to-day .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 16]: You buy a magazine for good writin ' -- look on the back of it !
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 15]: Let me tell you I pay money for that kind o ' writin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 7]: Maybe you think it 's easy .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 4]: Just try it !
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 12]: I 've tried it , and I ca n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 38]: I tell you an ad 's got to be written so it makes people do the hardest thing in this world to GET 'em to do : it 's got to make 'em give up their MONEY !
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 9]: You talk about ` poems and essays . '
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 50]: I tell you when it comes to the actual skill o ' puttin ' words together so as to make things HAPPEN , R. T. Bloss , right here in this city , knows more in a minute than George Waldo Emerson ever knew in his whole life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 21]: `` You -- you may be -- '' Bibbs said , indistinctly , the last word smothered in a cough .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 7]: `` Of COURSE I 'm right !
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 28]: And if it ai n't just like you to want to take up with the most out-o ' - date kind o ' writin ' there is !
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 6]: ` Poems and essays ' !
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 11]: My Lord , Bibbs , that 's WOMEN 'S work !
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 35]: You ca n't pick up a newspaper without havin ' to see where Mrs. Rumskididle read a paper on ` Jane Eyre , ' or ` East Lynne , ' at the God-Knows-What Club .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 5]: And ` poetry ' !
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 6]: Why , look at Edith !
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 36]: I expect that poem o ' hers would set a pretty high-water mark for you , young man , and it 's the only one she 's ever managed to write in her whole LIFE !
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 19]: When I wanted her to go on and write some more she said it took too much time .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 7]: Said it took months and months .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 32]: And Edith 's a smart girl ; she 's got more energy in her little finger than you ever give me a chance to see in your whole body , Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 25]: Now look at the facts : say she could turn out four or five poems a year and you could turn out maybe two .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 21]: That medal she got was worth about fifteen dollars , so there 's your income -- thirty dollars a year !
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 11]: That 's a fine success to make of your life !
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 10]: I 'm not sayin ' a word against poetry .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 34]: I would n't take ten thousand dollars right now for that poem of Edith 's ; and poetry 's all right enough in its place -- but you leave it to the girls .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 15]: A man 's got to do a man 's work in this world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 23]: He seated himself in a chair at his son 's side and , leaning over , tapped Bibbs confidentially on the knee .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 40]: `` This city 's got the greatest future in America , and if my sons behave right by me and by themselves they 're goin ' to have a mighty fair share of it -- a mighty fair share .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 5]: I love this town .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 27]: It 's God 's own footstool , and it 's made money for me every day right along , I do n't know how many years .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 27]: I love it like I do my own business , and I 'd fight for it as quick as I 'd fight for my own family .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 6]: It 's a beautiful town .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 33]: Look at our wholesale district ; look at any district you want to ; look at the park system we 're puttin ' through , and the boulevards and the public statuary .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 4]: And she grows .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 2]: God !
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 5]: how she grows ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 11]: He had become intensely grave ; he spoke with solemnity .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 35]: `` Now , Bibbs , I ca n't take any of it -- nor any gold or silver nor buildings nor bonds -- away with me in my shroud when I have to go .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 13]: But I want to leave my share in it to my boys .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 41]: I 've worked for it ; I 've been a builder and a maker ; and two blades of grass have grown where one grew before , whenever I laid my hand on the ground and willed 'em to grow .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 15]: I 've built big , and I want the buildin ' to go on .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 32]: And when my last hour comes I want to know that my boys are ready to take charge ; that they 're fit to take charge and go ON with it .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 26]: Bibbs , when that hour comes I want to know that my boys are big men , ready and fit to hold of big things .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 37]: Bibbs , when I 'm up above I want to know that the big share I 've made mine , here below , is growin ' bigger and bigger in the charge of my boys . ''
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 7]: He leaned back , deeply moved .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 5]: he said , huskily .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 15]: `` I 've never spoken more what was in my heart in my life .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 18]: I do it because I want you to understand -- and not think me a mean father .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 12]: I never had to talk that way to Jim and Roscoe .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 9]: They understood without any talk , Bibbs . ''
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 8]: `` I see , '' said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 8]: `` At least I think I do .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 9]: But -- '' `` Wait a minute ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 5]: Sheridan raised his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 37]: `` If you see the least bit in the world , then you understand how it feels to me to have my son set here and talk about ` poems and essays ' and such-like fooleries .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 44]: And you must understand , too , what it meant to start one o ' my boys and have him come back on me the way you did , and have to be sent to a sanitarium because he could n't stand work .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 12]: Now , let 's get right down to it , Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 37]: I 've had a whole lot o ' talk with ole Doc Gurney about you , one time another , and I reckon I understand your case just about as well as he does , anyway !
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 10]: Now here , I 'll be frank with you .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 35]: I started you in harder than what I did the other boys , and that was for your own good , because I saw you needed to be shook up more 'n they did .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 21]: You were always kind of moody and mopish -- and you needed work that 'd keep you on the jump .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 26]: Now , why did it make you sick instead of brace you up and make a man of you the way it ought of done ?
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 8]: I pinned ole Gurney down to it .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 19]: I says , ` Look here , ai n't it really because he just plain hated it ? '
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 12]: ` Yes , ' he says , ` that 's it .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 15]: If he 'd enjoyed it , it would n't ` a ' hurt him .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 11]: He loathes it , and that affects his nervous system .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 27]: The more he tries it , the more he hates it ; and the more he hates it , the more injury it does him . '
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 14]: That ai n't quite his words , but it 's what he meant .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 10]: And that 's about the way it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 17]: `` Yes , '' said Bibbs , `` that 's about the way it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 28]: `` Well , then , I reckon it 's up to me not only to make you do it , but to make you like it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 3]: Bibbs shivered .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 13]: And he turned upon his father a look that was almost ghostly .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 14]: `` I ca n't , '' he said , in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 6]: `` I ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 10]: `` Ca n't go back to the shop ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 5]: Ca n't like it .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 5]: I ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 8]: Sheridan jumped up , his patience gone .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 45]: To his own view , he had reasoned exhaustively , had explained fully and had pleaded more than a father should , only to be met in the end with the unreasoning and mysterious stubbornness which had been Bibbs 's baffling characteristic from childhood .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 8]: `` By George , you will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 12]: `` You 'll go back there and you 'll like it !
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 43]: Gurney says it wo n't hurt you if you like it , and he says it 'll kill you if you go back and hate it ; so it looks as if it was about up to you not to hate it .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 7]: Well , Gurney 's a fool !
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 25]: Hatin ' work does n't kill anybody ; and this is n't goin ' to kill you , whether you hate it or not .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 30]: I 've never made a mistake in a serious matter in my life , and it was n't a mistake my sendin ' you there in the first place .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 23]: And I 'm goin ' to prove it -- I 'm goin ' to send you back there and vindicate my judgment .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 10]: Gurney says it 's all ` mental attitude . '
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 12]: Well , you 're goin ' to learn the right one !
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 43]: He says in a couple more months this fool thing that 's been the matter with you 'll be disappeared completely and you 'll be back in as good or better condition than you were before you ever went into the shop .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 15]: And right then is when you begin over -- right in that same shop !
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 12]: Nobody can call me a hard man or a mean father .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 25]: I do the best I can for my chuldern , and I take full responsibility for bringin ' my sons up to be men .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 11]: Now , so far , I 've failed with you .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 12]: But I 'm not goin ' to keep ON failin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 25]: I never tackled a job YET I did n't put through , and I 'm not goin ' to begin with my own son .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 11]: I 'm goin ' to make a MAN of you .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 3]: By God !
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 4]: I am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 13]: Bibbs rose and went slowly to the door , where he turned .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 12]: `` You say you give me a couple of months ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 8]: Sheridan pushed a bell-button on his desk .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 14]: `` Gurney said two months more would put you back where you were .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 22]: You go home and begin to get yourself in the right ` mental attitude ' before those two months are up !
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 3]: Good-by ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 11]: `` Good-by , sir , '' said Bibbs , meekly .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 47]: CHAPTER X Bibbs 's room , that neat apartment for transients to which the `` lamidal '' George had shown him upon his return , still bore the appearance of temporary quarters , possibly because Bibbs had no clear conception of himself as a permanent incumbent .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 49]: However , he had set upon the mantelpiece the two photographs that he owned : one , a `` group '' twenty years old -- his father and mother , with Jim and Roscoe as boys -- and the other a `` cabinet '' of Edith at sixteen .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 26]: And upon a table were the books he had taken from his trunk : Sartor Resartus , Virginibus Puerisque , Huckleberry Finn , and Afterwhiles .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 31]: There were some other books in the trunk -- a large one , which remained unremoved at the foot of the bed , adding to the general impression of transiency .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 43]: It contained nearly all the possessions as well as the secret life of Bibbs Sheridan , and Bibbs sat beside it , the day after his interview with his father , raking over a small collection of manuscripts in the top tray .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 20]: Some of these he glanced through dubiously , finding little comfort in them ; but one made him smile .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 15]: Then he shook his head ruefully indeed , and ruefully began to read it .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 20]: It was written on paper stamped `` Hood Sanitarium , '' and bore the title , `` Leisure . ''
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 22]: A man may keep a quiet heart at seventy miles an hour , but not if he is running the train .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 32]: Nor is the habit of contemplation a useful quality in the stoker of a foundry furnace ; it will not be found to recommend him to the approbation of his superiors .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 33]: For a profession adapted solely to the pursuit of happiness in thinking , I would choose that of an invalid : his money is time and he may spend it on Olympus .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 10]: It will not suffice to be an amateur invalid .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 28]: To my way of thinking , the perfect practitioner must be to all outward purposes already dead if he is to begin the perfect enjoyment of life .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 23]: His serenity must not be disturbed by rumors of recovery ; he must lie serene in his long chair in the sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 40]: The world must be on the other side of the wall , and the wall must be so thick and so high that he can not hear the roaring of the furnace fires and the screaming of the whistles .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 24]: Peace -- Having read so far as the word `` peace , '' Bibbs suffered an interruption interesting as a coincidence of contrast .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 48]: High voices sounded in the hall just outside his door ; and it became evident that a woman 's quarrel was in progress , the parties to it having begun it in Edith 's room , and continuing it vehemently as they came out into the hall .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 9]: `` Yes , you BETTER go home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 8]: Bibbs heard his sister vociferating , shrilly .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 17]: `` You better go home and keep your mind a little more on your HUSBAND ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 6]: `` Edie , Edie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 9]: he heard his mother remonstrating , as peacemaker .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 6]: `` You see here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 13]: This was Sibyl , and her voice was both acrid and tremulous .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 10]: `` Do n't you talk to me that way !
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 36]: I came here to tell Mother Sheridan what I 'd heard , and to let her tell Father Sheridan if she thought she ought to , and I did it for your own good . ''
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 7]: `` Yes , you did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 8]: And Edith 's gibing laughter tooted loudly .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 6]: `` Yes , you did !
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 8]: YOU did n't have any other reason !
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 3]: OH no !
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 21]: YOU do n't want to break it up between Bobby Lamhorn and me because -- '' `` Edie , Edie !
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 5]: Now , now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 8]: `` Oh , hush up , mamma !
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 39]: I 'd like to know , then , if she says her new friends tell her he 's got such a reputation that he ought n't to come here , what about his not going to HER house .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 13]: How -- '' `` I 've explained that to Mother Sheridan . ''
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 11]: Sibyl 's voice indicated that she was descending the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 8]: `` Married people are not the same .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 24]: Some things that should be shielded from a young girl -- '' This seemed to have no very soothing effect upon Edith . ''
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 9]: ` Shielded from a young girl ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 3]: she shrilled .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 10]: `` You seem pretty willing to be the shield !
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 16]: You look out Roscoe does n't notice what kind of a shield you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 17]: Sibyl 's answer was inaudible , but Mrs. Sheridan 's flurried attempts at pacification were renewed .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 35]: `` Now , Edie , Edie , she means it for your good , and you 'd ought n't to -- '' `` Oh , hush up , mamma , and let me alone !
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 12]: If you dare tell papa -- '' `` Now , now !
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 25]: I 'm not going to tell him to-day , and maybe -- '' `` You 've got to promise NEVER to tell him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 6]: the girl cried , passionately .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 7]: `` Well , we 'll see .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 17]: You just come back in your own room , and we 'll -- '' `` No !
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 9]: I WO N'T ` talk it over ' !
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 4]: Stop pulling me !
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 5]: Let me ALONE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 57]: And Edith , flinging herself violently upon Bibbs 's door , jerked it open , swung round it into the room , slammed the door behind her , and threw herself , face down , upon the bed in such a riot of emotion that she had no perception of Bibbs 's presence in the room .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 20]: Gasping and sobbing in a passion of tears , she beat the coverlet and pillows with her clenched fists .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 4]: `` Sneak ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 4]: she babbled aloud .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 3]: `` Sneak !
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 2]: Snake-in-the-grass !
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 3]: Cat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 49]: Bibbs saw that she did not know he was there , and he went softly toward the door , hoping to get away before she became aware of him ; but some sound of his movement reached her , and she sat up , startled , facing him .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 3]: `` Bibbs !
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 11]: I thought I saw you go out awhile ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 6]: I came back , though .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 15]: I 'm sorry -- '' `` Did you hear me quarreling with Sibyl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 9]: `` Only what you said in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 7]: You lie down again , Edith .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 6]: I 'm going out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 8]: `` No ; do n't go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 17]: She applied a handkerchief to her eyes , emitted a sob , and repeated her request .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 5]: `` Do n't go .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 12]: I do n't mind you ; you 're quiet , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 10]: Mamma 's so fussy , and never gets anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 17]: I do n't mind you at all , but I wish you 'd sit down . ''
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 5]: `` All right . ''
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 10]: And he returned to his chair beside the trunk .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 15]: `` Go ahead and cry all you want , Edith , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 7]: `` No harm in that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 8]: `` Sibyl told mamma -- OH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 5]: she began , choking .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 97]: `` Mary Vertrees had mamma and Sibyl and I to tea , one afternoon two weeks or so ago , and she had some women there that Sibyl 's been crazy to get in with , and she just laid herself out to make a hit with 'em , and she 's been running after 'em ever since , and now she comes over here and says THEY say Bobby Lamhorn is so bad that , even though they like his family , none of the nice people in town would let him in their houses .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 45]: In the first place , it 's a falsehood , and I do n't believe a word of it ; and in the second place I know the reason she did it , and , what 's more , she KNOWS I know it !
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 42]: I wo n't SAY what it is -- not yet -- because papa and all of you would think I 'm as crazy as she is snaky ; and Roscoe 's such a fool he 'd probably quit speaking to me .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 5]: But it 's true !
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 11]: Just you watch her ; that 's all I ask .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 6]: Just you watch that woman .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 5]: You 'll see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 13]: As it happened , Bibbs was literally watching `` that woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 21]: Glancing from the window , he saw Sibyl pause upon the pavement in front of the old house next door .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 26]: She stood a moment , in deep thought , then walked quickly up the path to the door , undoubtedly with the intention of calling .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 41]: But he did not mention this to his sister , who , after delivering herself of a rather vague jeremiad upon the subject of her sister-in-law 's treacheries , departed to her own chamber , leaving him to his speculations .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 11]: The chief of these concerned the social elasticities of women .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 52]: Sibyl had just been a participant in a violent scene ; she had suffered hot insult of a kind that could not fail to set her quivering with resentment ; and yet she elected to betake herself to the presence of people whom she knew no more than `` formally . ''
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 3]: Bibbs marveled .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 45]: Surely , he reflected , some traces of emotion must linger upon Sibyl 's face or in her manner ; she could not have ironed it all quite out in the three or four minutes it took her to reach the Vertreeses ' door .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 27]: And in this he was not mistaken , for Mary Vertrees was at that moment wondering what internal excitement Mrs. Roscoe Sheridan was striving to master .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 28]: But Sibyl had no idea that she was allowing herself to exhibit anything except the gaiety which she conceived proper to the manner of a casual caller .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 25]: She was wholly intent upon fulfilling the sudden purpose that brought her , and she was no more self-conscious than she was finely intelligent .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 12]: For Sibyl Sheridan belonged to a type Scriptural in its antiquity .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 38]: She was merely the idle and half-educated intriguer who may and does delude men , of course , and the best and dullest of her own sex as well , finding invariably strong supporters among these latter .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 49]: It is a type that has wrought some damage in the world and would have wrought greater , save for the check put upon its power by intelligent women and by its own `` lack of perspective , '' for it is a type that never sees itself .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 24]: Sibyl followed her impulses with no reflection or question -- it was like a hound on the gallop after a master on horseback .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 13]: She had not even the instinct to stop and consider her effect .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 15]: If she wished to make a certain impression she believed that she made it .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 7]: She believed that she was believed .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 26]: `` My mother asked me to say that she was sorry she could n't come down , '' Mary said , when they were seated .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 42]: Sibyl ran the scale of a cooing simulance of laughter , which she had been brought up to consider the polite thing to do after a remark addressed to her by any person with whom she was not on familiar terms .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 18]: It was intended partly as a courtesy and partly as the foundation for an impression of sweetness .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 26]: `` Just thought I 'd fly in a minute , '' she said , continuing the cooing to relieve the last doubt of her gentiality .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 12]: `` I thought I 'd just behave like REAL country neighbors .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 17]: We are almost out in the country , so far from down-town , are n't we ?
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 8]: And it seemed such a LOVELY day !
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 18]: I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed meeting those nice people at tea that afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 35]: You see , coming here a bride and never having lived here before , I 've had to depend on my husband 's friends almost entirely , and I really 've known scarcely anybody .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 34]: Mr. Sheridan has been so engrossed in business ever since he was a mere boy , why , of course -- '' She paused , with the air of having completed an explanation .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 12]: `` Of course , '' said Mary , sympathetically accepting it .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 19]: I 've been seeing quite a lot of the Kittersbys since that afternoon , '' Sibyl went on .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 7]: `` They 're really delightful people .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 4]: Indeed they are !
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 29]: Yes -- '' She stopped with unconscious abruptness , her mind plainly wandering to another matter ; and Mary perceived that she had come upon a definite errand .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 51]: Moreover , a tensing of Sibyl 's eyelids , in that moment of abstraction as she looked aside from her hostess , indicated that the errand was a serious one for the caller and easily to be connected with the slight but perceptible agitation underlying her assumption of cheerful ease .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 12]: There was a restlessness of breathing , a restlessness of hands .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 31]: `` Mrs. Kittersby and her daughter were chatting about some to the people here in town the other day , '' said Sibyl , repeating the cooing and protracting it .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 10]: `` They said something that took ME by surprise !
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 18]: We were talking about our mutual friend , Mr. Robert Lamhorn -- '' Mary interrupted her promptly .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 15]: `` Do you mean ` mutual ' to include my mother and me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 19]: `` Why , yes ; the Kittersbys and you and all of us Sheridans , I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Mary .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 14]: `` We should n't consider Mr. Robert Lamhorn a friend of ours . ''
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 13]: To her surprise , Sibyl nodded eagerly , as if greatly pleased .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 11]: `` That 's just the way Mrs. Kittersby talked ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 11]: she cried , with a vehemence that made Mary stare .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 20]: `` Yes , and I hear that 's the way ALL you old families here speak of him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 14]: Mary looked aside , but otherwise she was able to maintain her composure .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 27]: `` I had the impression he was a friend of yours , '' she said ; adding , hastily , `` and your husband 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 11]: `` Oh yes , '' said the caller , absently .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 6]: `` He is , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 22]: A man 's reputation for a little gaiety ought n't to make a great difference to married people , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 9]: It 's where young girls are in question .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 9]: THEN it may be very , very dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 24]: There are a great many things safe and proper for married people that might be awf ` ly imprudent for a young girl .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 9]: Do n't you agree , Miss Vertrees ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 12]: `` I do n't know , '' returned the frank Mary .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 26]: `` Do you mean that you intend to remain a friend of Mr. Lamhorn 's , but disapprove of Miss Sheridan 's doing so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 7]: `` That 's it exactly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 9]: was the naive and ardent response of Sibyl .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 32]: `` What I feel about it is that a man with his reputation is n't at all suitable for Edith , and the family ought to be made to understand it .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 26]: I tell you , '' she cried , with a sudden access of vehemence , `` her father ought to put his foot down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 49]: Her eyes flashed with a green spark ; something seemed to leap out and then retreat , but not before Mary had caught a glimpse of it , as one might catch a glimpse of a thing darting forth and then scuttling back into hiding under a bush .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 32]: `` Of course , '' said Sibyl , much more composedly , `` I hardly need say that it 's entirely on Edith 's account that I 'm worried about this .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 23]: I 'm as fond of Edith as if she was really my sister , and I ca n't help fretting about it .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 13]: It would break my heart to have Edith 's life spoiled . ''
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 12]: This tune was off the key , to Mary 's ear .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 11]: Sibyl tried to sing with pathos , but she flatted .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 52]: And when a lady receives a call from another who suffers under the stress of some feeling which she wishes to conceal , there is not uncommonly developed a phenomenon of duality comparable to the effect obtained by placing two mirrors opposite each other , one clear and the other flawed .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 14]: In this case , particularly , Sibyl had an imperfect consciousness of Mary .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 29]: The Mary Vertrees that she saw was merely something to be cozened to her own frantic purpose -- a Mary Vertrees who was incapable of penetrating that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 48]: Sibyl sat there believing that she was projecting the image of herself that she desired to project , never dreaming that with every word , every look , and every gesture she was more and more fully disclosing the pitiable truth to the clear eyes of Mary .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 39]: And the Sibyl that Mary saw was an overdressed woman , in manner half rustic , and in mind as shallow as a pan , but possessed by emotions that appeared to be strong -- perhaps even violent .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 15]: What those emotions were Mary had not guessed , but she began to suspect .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 13]: `` And Edith 's life WOULD be spoiled , '' Sibyl continued .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 12]: `` It would be a dreadful thing for the whole family .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 26]: She 's the very apple of Father Sheridan 's eye , and he 's as proud of her as he is of Jim and Roscoe .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 66]: It would be a horrible thing for him to have her marry a man like Robert Lamhorn ; but he does n't KNOW anything about him , and if somebody does n't tell him , what I 'm most afraid of is that Edith might get his consent and hurry on the wedding before he finds out , and then it would be too late .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 24]: You see , Miss Vertrees , it 's very difficult for me to decide just what it 's my duty to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 28]: `` I see , '' said Mary , looking at her thoughtfully , `` Does Miss Sheridan seem to -- to care very much about him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 19]: `` He 's deliberately fascinated her , '' returned the visitor , beginning to breathe quickly and heavily .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 8]: `` Oh , she was n't difficult !
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 31]: She knew she was n't in right in this town , and she was crazy to meet the people that were , and she thought he was one of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 20]: But that was only the start that made it easy for him -- and he did n't need it .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 9]: He could have done it , anyway ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 14]: Sibyl was launched now ; her eyes were furious and her voice shook .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 21]: `` He went after her deliberately , the way he does everything ; he 's as cold-blooded as a fish .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 33]: All he cares about is his own pleasure , and lately he 's decided it would be pleasant to get hold of a piece of real money -- and there was Edith !
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 6]: And he 'll marry her !
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 35]: Nothing on earth can stop him unless he finds out she wo n't HAVE any money if she marries him , and the only person that could make him understand that is Father Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 23]: Somehow , that 's got to be managed , because Lamhorn is going to hurry it on as fast as he can .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 7]: He told me so last night .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 29]: He said he was going to marry her the first minute he could persuade her to it -- and little Edith 's all ready to be persuaded ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 7]: Sibyl 's eyes flashed green again .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 13]: `` And he swore he 'd do it , '' she panted .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 18]: `` He swore he 'd marry Edith Sheridan , and nothing on earth could stop him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 5]: And then Mary understood .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 28]: Her lips parted and she stared at the babbling creature incredulously , a sudden vivid picture in her mind , a canvas of unconscious Sibyl 's painting .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 39]: Mary beheld it with pity and horror : she saw Sibyl clinging to Robert Lamhorn , raging , in a whisper , perhaps -- for Roscoe might have been in the house , or servants might have heard .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 42]: She saw Sibyl entreating , beseeching , threatening despairingly , and Lamhorn -- tired of her -- first evasive , then brutally letting her have the truth ; and at last , infuriated , `` swearing '' to marry her rival .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 18]: If Sibyl had not babbled out the word `` swore '' it might have been less plain .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 14]: The poor woman blundered on , wholly unaware of what she had confessed .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 25]: `` You see , '' she said , more quietly , `` whatever 's going to be done ought to be done right away .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 22]: I went over and told Mother Sheridan what I 'd heard about Lamhorn -- oh , I was open and aboveboard !
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 7]: I told her right before Edith .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 33]: I think it ought all to be done with perfect frankness , because nobody can say it is n't for the girl 's own good and what her best friend would do .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 21]: But Mother Sheridan 's under Edith 's thumb , and she 's afraid to ever come right out with anything .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 5]: Father Sheridan 's different .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 34]: Edith can get anything she wants out of him in the way of money or ordinary indulgence , but when it comes to a matter like this he 'd be a steel rock .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 24]: If it 's a question of his will against anybody else 's he 'd make his will rule if it killed 'em both !
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 21]: Now , he 'd never in the world let Lamhorn come near the house again if he knew his reputation .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 12]: So , you see , somebody 's got to tell him .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 17]: It is n't a very easy position for me , is it , Miss Vertrees ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 9]: `` No , '' said Mary , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 24]: `` Well , to be frank , '' said Sibyl , smiling , `` that 's why I 've come to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 5]: `` To ME ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 3]: Mary frowned .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 6]: Sibyl rippled and cooed again .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 20]: `` There is n't ANYBODY ever made such a hit with Father Sheridan in his life as you have .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 23]: And of course we ALL hope you 're not going to be exactly an outsider in the affairs of the family ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 12]: -LRB- This sally with another and louder effect of laughter -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 25]: `` And if it 's MY duty , why , in a way , I think it might be thought yours , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 6]: `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 5]: exclaimed Mary , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 7]: `` Listen , '' said Sibyl .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 62]: `` Now suppose I go to Father Sheridan with this story , and Edith says it 's not true ; suppose she says Lamhorn has a good reputation and that I 'm repeating irresponsible gossip , or suppose -LRB- what 's most likely -RRB- she loses her temper and says I invented it , then what am I going to do ?
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 21]: Father Sheridan does n't know Mrs. Kittersby and her daughter , and they 're out of the question , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 19]: But suppose I could say : ` All right , if you want proof , ask Miss Vertrees .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 30]: She came with me , and she 's waiting in the next room right now , to -- '' `` No , no , '' said Mary , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 19]: `` You must n't -- '' `` Listen just a minute more , '' Sibyl urged , confidingly .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 20]: She was on easy ground now , to her own mind , and had no doubt of her success .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 30]: `` You naturally do n't want to begin by taking part in a family quarrel , but if YOU take part in it , it wo n't be one .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 31]: You do n't know yourself what weight you carry over there , and no one would have the right to say you did it except out of the purest kindness .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 18]: Do n't you see that Jim and his father would admire you all the more for it ?
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 5]: Miss Vertrees , listen !
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 14]: Do n't you see we OUGHT to do it , you and I ?
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 14]: Do you suppose Robert Lamhorn cares a snap of his finger for her ?
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 21]: Do you suppose a man like him would LOOK at Edith Sheridan if it was n't for the money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 10]: And again Sibyl 's emotion rose to the surface .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 28]: `` I tell you he 's after nothing on earth but to get his finger in that old man 's money-pile , over there , next door !
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 8]: He 'd marry ANYBODY to do it .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 4]: Marry Edith ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 14]: `` I tell you he 'd marry their nigger cook for THAT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 37]: She stopped , afraid -- at the wrong time -- that she had been too vehement , but a glance at Mary reassured her , and Sibyl decided that she had produced the effect she wished .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 23]: Mary was not looking at her ; she was staring straight before her at the wall , her eyes wide and shining .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 12]: She became visibly a little paler as Sibyl looked at her .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 24]: `` After nothing on earth but to get his finger in that old man 's money-pile , over there , next door ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 17]: The voice was vulgar , the words were vulgar -- and the plain truth was vulgar !
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 9]: How it rang in Mary Vertrees 's ears !
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 16]: The clear mirror had caught its own image clearly in the flawed one at last .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 11]: Sibyl put forth her best bid to clench the matter .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 5]: She offered her bargain .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 21]: `` Now do n't you worry , '' she said , sunnily , `` about this setting Edith against you .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 57]: She 'll get over it after a while , anyway , but if she tried to be spiteful and make it uncomfortable for you when you drop in over there , or managed so as to sort of leave you out , why , I 've got a house , and Jim likes to come there .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 35]: I do n't THINK Edith WOULD be that way ; she 's too crazy to have you take her around with the smart crowd , but if she DID , you need n't worry .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 18]: And another thing -- I guess you wo n't mind Jim 's own sister-in-law speaking of it .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 51]: Of course , I do n't know just how matters stand between you and Jim , but Jim and Roscoe are about as much alike as two brothers can be , and Roscoe was very slow making up his mind ; sometimes I used to think he actually never WOULD .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 20]: Now , what I mean is , sisters-in-law can do lots of things to help matters on like that .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 19]: There 's lots of little things can be said , and lots -- '' She stopped , puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 45]: Mary Vertrees had gone from pale to scarlet , and now , still scarlet indeed , she rose , without a word of explanation , or any other kind of word , and walked slowly to the open door and out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 7]: Sibyl was a little taken aback .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 47]: She supposed Mary had remembered something neglected and necessary for the instruction of a servant , and that she would return in a moment ; but it was rather a rude excess of absent-mindedness not to have excused herself , especially as her guest was talking .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 26]: And , Mary 's return being delayed , Sibyl found time to think this unprefaced exit odder and ruder than she had first considered it .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 35]: There might have been more excuse for it , she thought , had she been speaking of matters less important -- offering to do the girl all the kindness in her power , too !
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 46]: Sibyl yawned and swung her muff impatiently ; she examined the sole of her shoe ; she decided on a new shape of heel ; she made an inventory of the furniture of the room , of the rugs , of the wall-paper and engravings .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 36]: Then she looked at her watch and frowned ; went to a window and stood looking out upon the brown lawn , then came back to the chair she had abandoned , and sat again .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 8]: There was no sound in the house .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 27]: A strange expression began imperceptibly to alter the planes of her face , and slowly she grew as scarlet as Mary -- scarlet to the ears .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 20]: She looked at her watch again -- and twenty-five minutes had elapsed since she had looked at it before .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 33]: She went into the hall , glanced over her shoulder oddly ; then she let herself softly out of the front door , and went across the street to her own house .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 9]: Roscoe met her upon the threshold , gloomily .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 11]: `` Saw you from the window , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 14]: `` You must find a lot to say to that old lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 6]: `` What old lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 4]: `` Mrs. Vertrees .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 34]: I been waiting for you a long time , and I saw the daughter come out , fifteen minutes ago , and post a letter , and then walk on up the street .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 14]: Do n't stand out on the porch , '' he said , crossly .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 5]: `` Come in here .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 16]: There 's something it 's come time I 'll have to talk to you about .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 4]: Come in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 18]: But as she was moving to obey he glanced across at his father 's house and started .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 16]: He lifted his hand to shield his eyes from the setting sun , staring fixedly .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 37]: `` Something 's the matter over there , '' he muttered , and then , more loudly , as alarm came into his voice , he said , `` What 's the matter over there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 43]: Bibbs dashed out of the gate in an automobile set at its highest speed , and as he saw Roscoe he made a gesture singularly eloquent of calamity , and was lost at once in a cloud of dust down the street .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 22]: Edith had followed part of the way down the drive , and it could be seen that she was crying bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 10]: She lifted both arms to Roscoe , summoning him .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 5]: `` By George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 3]: gasped Roscoe .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 8]: `` I believe somebody 's dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 11]: And he started for the New House at a run .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 47]: CHAPTER XI Sheridan had decided to conclude his day 's work early that afternoon , and at about two o'clock he left his office with a man of affairs from foreign parts , who had traveled far for a business conference with Sheridan and his colleagues .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 16]: Herr Favre , in spite of his French name , was a gentleman of Bavaria .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 25]: It was his first visit to our country , and Sheridan took pleasure in showing him the sights of the country 's finest city .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 76]: They got into an open car at the main entrance of the Sheridan Building , and were driven first , slowly and momentously , through the wholesale district and the retail district ; then more rapidly they inspected the packing-houses and the stock-yards ; then skirmished over the `` park system '' and `` boulevards '' ; and after that whizzed through the `` residence section '' on their way to the factories and foundries .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 12]: `` All cray , '' observed Herr Favre , smilingly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 5]: ` Cray ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 3]: echoed Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 9]: `` I do n't know what you mean .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 5]: ` Cray ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 28]: `` No white , '' said Herr Favre , with a wave of his hand toward the long rows of houses on both sides of the street .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 12]: `` No white lace window-curtains ; all cray lace window-curtains . ''
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 3]: `` Oh .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 4]: I see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 4]: Sheridan laughed indulgently .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 7]: `` You mean ` GRAY . '
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 10]: No , they ai n't , they 're white .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 8]: I never saw any gray ones . ''
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 9]: Herr Favre shook his head , much amused .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 11]: `` There are NO white ones , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 23]: `` There is no white ANYTHING in your city ; no white window-curtains , no white house , no white peeble ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 4]: He pointed upward .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 4]: `` Smoke ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 14]: Then he sniffed the air and clasped his nose between forefinger and thumb .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 3]: `` Smoke !
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 5]: Smoke ef ` rywhere .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 6]: Smoke in your insites . ''
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 5]: He tapped his chest .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 7]: `` Smoke in your lunks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 3]: SMOKE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 16]: Sheridan cried with gusto , drawing in a deep breath and patently finding it delicious .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 8]: `` You BET we got smoke ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 4]: `` Exbensif ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 4]: said Herr Favre .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 7]: `` Ruins foliage ; ruins fabrics .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 19]: Maybe in summer it iss not so bad , but I wonder your wifes will bear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 4]: Sheridan laughed uproariously .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 12]: `` They know it means new spring hats for 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 9]: `` They must need many , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 4]: said the visitor .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 12]: `` New hats , new all things , but nothing white .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 15]: In Munchen we could not do it ; we are a safing peeble . ''
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 6]: `` Where 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 4]: `` In Munchen .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 7]: You say ` Munich . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 46]: `` Well , I never been to Munich , but I took in the Mediterranean trip , and I tell you , outside o ' some right good scenery , all I saw was mighty dirty and mighty shiftless and mighty run-down at the heel .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 24]: Now comin ' right down TO it , Mr. Farver , would n't you rather live here in this town than in Munich ?
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 59]: I know you got more enterprise up there than the part of the old country I saw , and I know YOU 'RE a live business man and you 're associated with others like you , but when it comes to LIVIN ' in a place , would n't you heap rather be here than over there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 12]: `` For me , '' said Herr Favre , `` no .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 9]: Here I should not think I was living .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 18]: It would be like the miner who goes into the mine to work ; nothing else . ''
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 17]: `` We got a good many good citizens here from your part o ' the world .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 5]: THEY like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 5]: `` Oh yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 6]: And Herr Favre laughed deprecatingly .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 25]: `` The first generation , they bring their Germany with them ; then , after that , they are Americans , like you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 9]: He tapped his host 's big knee genially .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 10]: `` You are patriot ; so are they . ''
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 19]: `` Well , I reckon you must be a pretty hot little patriot yourself , Mr. Farver ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 5]: Sheridan exclaimed , gaily .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 26]: `` You certainly stand up for your own town , if you stick to sayin ' you 'd rather live there than you would here .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 4]: Yes , SIR !
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 16]: You sure are some patriot to say THAT -- after you 've seen our city !
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 43]: It ai n't reasonable in you , but I must say I kind of admire you for it ; every man ought to stick up for his own , even when he sees the other fellow 's got the goods on him .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 33]: Yet I expect way down deep in your heart , Mr. Farver , you 'd rather live right here than any place else in the world , if you had your choice .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 3]: Man alive !
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 20]: this is God 's country , Mr. Farver , and a blind man could n't help seein ' it !
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 16]: You could n't stand where you do in a business way and NOT see it .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 4]: Soho , boy !
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 4]: Here we are .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 22]: This is the big works , and I 'll show you something now that 'll make your eyes stick out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 35]: They had arrived at the Pump Works ; and for an hour Mr. Favre was personally conducted and personally instructed by the founder and president , the buzzing queen bee of those buzzing hives .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 28]: `` Now I 'll take you for a spin in the country , '' said Sheridan , when at last they came out to the car again .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 8]: `` We 'll take a breezer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 27]: But , with his foot on the step , he paused to hail a neat young man who came out of the office smiling a greeting .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 7]: `` Hello , young fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 5]: Sheridan said , heartily .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 10]: `` On the job , are you , Jimmie ?
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 39]: They do n't catch you OFF of it very often , I guess , though I do hear you go automobile-ridin ' in the country sometimes with a mighty fine-lookin ' girl settin ' up beside you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 12]: He roared with laughter , clapping his son upon the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 14]: `` That 's all right with me -- if it is with HER !
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 4]: So , Jimmie ?
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 13]: Well , when we goin ' to move into your new warehouses ?
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 3]: Monday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 12]: `` Sunday , if you want to , '' said Jim .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 6]: cried his father , delighted .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 16]: `` Do n't tell me you 're goin ' to keep your word about dates !
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 9]: That 's no way to do contractin ' !
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 13]: Never heard of a contractor yet did n't want more time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 16]: `` They 'll be all ready for you on the minute , '' said Jim .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 20]: `` I 'm going over both of 'em now , with Links and Sherman , from foundation to roof .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 10]: I guess they 'll pass inspection , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 28]: `` Well , then , when you get through with that , '' said his father , `` you go and take your girl out ridin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 3]: By George !
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 5]: you 've earned it !
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 10]: You tell her you stand high with ME ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 33]: He stepped into the car , waving a waggish farewell , and when the wheels were in motion again , he turned upon his companion a broad face literally shining with pride .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 8]: `` That 's my boy Jimmie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 12]: `` Fine young man , yes , '' said Herr Favre .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 36]: `` I got two o ' the finest boys , '' said Sheridan , `` I got two o ' the finest boys God ever made , and that 's a fact , Mr. Farver !
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 26]: Jim 's the oldest , and I tell you they got to get up the day before if they expect to catch HIM in bed !
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 21]: My other boy , Roscoe , he 's always to the good , too , but Jim 's a wizard .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 11]: You saw them two new-process warehouses , just about finished ?
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 6]: Well , JIM built 'em .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 11]: I 'll tell you about that , Mr. Farver . ''
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 36]: And he recited this history , describing the new process at length ; in fact , he had such pride in Jim 's achievement that he told Herr Favre all about it more than once .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 19]: `` Fine young man , yes , '' repeated the good Munchner , three-quarters of an hour later .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 13]: They were many miles out in the open country by this time .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 6]: `` He is that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 22]: said Sheridan , adding , as if confidentially : `` I got a fine family , Mr. Farver -- fine chuldern .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 26]: I got a daughter now ; you take her and put her anywhere you please , and she 'll shine up with ANY of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 36]: There 's culture and refinement and society in this town by the car-load , and here lately she 's been gettin ' right in the thick of it -- her and my daughter-in-law , both .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 10]: I got a mighty fine daughter-in-law , Mr. Farver .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 46]: I 'm goin ' to get you up for a meal with us before you leave town , and you 'll see -- and , well , sir , from all I hear the two of 'em been holdin ' their own with the best .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 43]: Myself , I and the wife never had time for much o ' that kind o ' doin 's , but it 's all right and good for the chuldern ; and my daughter she 's always kind of taken to it .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 17]: I 'll read you a poem she wrote when I get you up at the house .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 15]: She wrote it in school and took the first prize for poetry with it .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 17]: I tell you they do n't make 'em any smarter 'n that girl , Mr. Farver .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 20]: Yes , sir ; take us all round , we 're a pretty happy family ; yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 51]: Roscoe has n't got any chuldern yet , and I have n't ever spoke to him and his wife about it -- it 's kind of a delicate matter -- but it 's about time the wife and I saw some gran ' - chuldern growin ' up around us .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 18]: I certainly do hanker for about four or five little curly-headed rascals to take on my knee .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 14]: Boys , I hope , o ' course ; that 's only natural .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 19]: Jim 's got his eye on a mighty splendid-lookin ' girl ; lives right next door to us .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 13]: I expect you heard me joshin ' him about it back yonder .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 23]: She 's one of the ole blue-bloods here , and I guess it was a mighty good stock -- to raise HER !
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 14]: She 's one these girls that stand right up and look at you !
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 3]: And pretty ?
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 9]: She 's the prettiest thing you ever saw !
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 11]: Good size , too ; good health and good sense .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 10]: Jim 'll be just right if he gets her .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 23]: I must say it tickles ME to think o ' the way that boy took ahold o ' that job back yonder .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 6]: Four months and a half !
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 25]: Yes , sir -- '' He expanded this theme once more ; and thus he continued to entertain the stranger throughout the long drive .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 42]: Darkness had fallen before they reached the city on their return , and it was after five when Sheridan allowed Herr Favre to descend at the door of his hotel , where boys were shrieking extra editions of the evening paper .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 24]: `` Now , good night , Mr. Farver , '' said Sheridan , leaning from the car to shake hands with his guest .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 24]: `` Do n't forget I 'm goin ' to come around and take you up to -- Go on away , boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 14]: A newsboy had thrust himself almost between them , yelling , `` Extry !
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 4]: Secon ' Extry .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 8]: Extry , all about the horrable acciDENT .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 3]: Extry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 5]: `` Get out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 3]: laughed Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 8]: `` Who wants to read about accidents ?
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 4]: Get out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 6]: The boy moved away philosophically .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 3]: `` Extry !
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 3]: Extry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 3]: he shrilled .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 5]: `` Three men killed !
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 2]: Extry !
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 3]: Millionaire killed !
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 5]: Two other men killed !
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 2]: Extry !
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 3]: Extry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 15]: `` Do n't forget , Mr. Farver , '' Sheridan completed his interrupted farewells .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 15]: `` I 'll come by to take you up to our house for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 12]: I 'll be here for you about half-past five to-morrow afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 11]: Hope you ` njoyed the drive much as I have .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 7]: Good night -- good night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 9]: He leaned back , speaking to the chauffer .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 15]: `` Now you can take me around to the Central City barber-shop , boy .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 14]: I want to get a shave ` fore I go up home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 3]: `` Extry !
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 3]: Extry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 14]: screamed the newsboys , zig-zagging among the crowds like bats in the dusk .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 3]: `` Extry !
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 6]: All about the horrable acciDENT !
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 3]: Extry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 28]: It struck Sheridan that the papers sent out too many `` Extras '' ; they printed `` Extras '' for all sorts of petty crimes and casualties .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 10]: It was a mistake , he decided , critically .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 5]: Crying `` Wolf ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 13]: too often would n't sell the goods ; it was bad business .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 31]: The papers would `` make more in the long run , '' he was sure , if they published an `` Extra '' only when something of real importance happened .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 3]: `` Extry !
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 10]: All about the hor ` ble AX ` nt !
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 3]: Extry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 14]: a boy squawked under his nose , as he descended from the car .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 6]: `` Go on away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 9]: said Sheridan , gruffly , though he smiled .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 16]: He liked to see the youngsters working so noisily to get on in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 31]: But as he crossed the pavement to the brilliant glass doors of the barber-shop , a second newsboy grasped the arm of the one who had thus cried his wares .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 24]: `` Say , Yallern , '' said this second , hoarse with awe , '' 'n' t chew know who that IS ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 6]: `` It 's SHERIDAN ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 4]: `` Jeest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 7]: cried the first , staring insanely .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 33]: At about the same hour , four times a week -- Monday , Wednesday , Friday , and Saturday -- Sheridan stopped at this shop to be shaved by the head barber .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 46]: The barbers were negroes , he was their great man , and it was their habit to give him a `` reception , '' his entrance being always the signal for a flurry of jocular hospitality , followed by general excesses of briskness and gaiety .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 8]: But it was not so this evening .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 5]: The shop was crowded .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 23]: Copies of the `` Extra '' were being read by men waiting , and by men in the latter stages of treatment .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 16]: `` Extras '' lay upon vacant seats and showed from the pockets of hanging coats .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 25]: There was a loud chatter between the practitioners and their recumbent patients , a vocal charivari which stopped abruptly as Sheridan opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 44]: His name seemed to fizz in the air like the last sputtering of a firework ; the barbers stopped shaving and clipping ; lathered men turned their prostrate heads to stare , and there was a moment of amazing silence in the shop .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 16]: The head barber , nearest the door , stood like a barber in a tableau .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 32]: His left hand held stretched between thumb and forefinger an elastic section of his helpless customer 's cheek , while his right hand hung poised above it , the razor motionless .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 21]: And then , roused from trance by the door 's closing , he accepted the fact of Sheridan 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 27]: The barber remembered that there are no circumstances in life -- or just after it -- under which a man does not need to be shaved .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 7]: He stepped forward , profoundly grave .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 26]: `` I be through with this man in the chair one minute , Mist ' Sheridan , '' he said , in a hushed tone .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 4]: `` Yessuh . ''
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 20]: And of a solemn negro youth who stood by , gazing stupidly , `` You goin ' RESIGN ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 7]: he demanded in a fierce undertone .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 12]: `` You goin ' take Mist ' Sheridan 's coat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 36]: He sent an angry look round the shop , and the barbers , taking his meaning , averted their eyes and fell to work , the murmur of subdued conversation buzzing from chair to chair .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 19]: `` You sit down ONE minute , Mist ' Sheridan , '' said the head barber , gently .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 13]: `` I fix nice chair fo ' you to wait in . ''
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 8]: `` Never mind , '' said Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 10]: `` Go on get through with your man . ''
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 4]: `` Yessuh . ''
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 18]: And he went quickly back to his chair on tiptoe , followed by Sheridan 's puzzled gaze .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 10]: Something had gone wrong in the shop , evidently .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 10]: Sheridan did not know what to make of it .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 47]: Ordinarily he would have shouted a hilarious demand for the meaning of the mystery , but an inexplicable silence had been imposed upon him by the hush that fell upon his entrance and by the odd look every man in the shop had bent upon him .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 38]: Vaguely disquieted , he walked to one of the seats in the rear of the shop , and looked up and down the two lines of barbers , catching quickly shifted , furtive glances here and there .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 33]: He made this brief survey after wondering if one of the barbers had died suddenly , that day , or the night before ; but there was no vacancy in either line .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 35]: The seat next to his was unoccupied , but some one had left a copy of the `` Extra '' there , and , frowning , he picked it up and glanced at it .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 16]: The first of the swollen display lines had little meaning to him : Fatally Faulty .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 11]: New Process Roof Collapses Hurling Capitalist to Death with Inventor .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 6]: Seven Escape When Crash Comes .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 43]: Death Claims -- Thus far had he read when a thin hand fell upon the paper , covering the print from his eyes ; and , looking up , he saw Bibbs standing before him , pale and gentle , immeasurably compassionate .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 13]: `` I 've come for you , father , '' said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 11]: `` Here 's the boy with your coat and hat .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 8]: Put them on and come home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 8]: And even then Sheridan did not understand .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 25]: So secure was he in the strength and bigness of everything that was his , he did not know what calamity had befallen him .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 5]: But he was frightened .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 45]: Without a word , he followed Bibbs heavily out throught the still shop , but as they reached the pavement he stopped short and , grasping his son 's sleeve with shaking fingers , swung him round so that they stood face to face .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 24]: `` What -- what -- '' His mouth could not do him the service he asked of it , he was so frightened .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 4]: `` Extry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 8]: screamed a newsboy straight in his face .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 8]: `` Young North Side millionaire insuntly killed !
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 3]: Extry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 6]: `` Not -- JIM ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 3]: said Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 10]: Bibbs caught his father 's hand in his own .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 10]: `` And YOU come to tell me that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 8]: Sheridan did not know what he said .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 32]: But in those first words and in the first anguish of the big , stricken face Bibbs understood the unuttered cry of accusation : `` Why was n't it you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 65]: CHAPTER XII Standing in the black group under gaunt trees at the cemetery , three days later , Bibbs unwillingly let an old , old thought become definite in his mind : the sickly brother had buried the strong brother , and Bibbs wondered how many million times that had happened since men first made a word to name the sons of one mother .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 22]: Almost literally he had buried his strong brother , for Sheridan had gone to pieces when he saw his dead son .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 21]: He had nothing to help him meet the shock , neither definite religion nor `` philosophy '' definite or indefinite .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 42]: He could only beat his forehead and beg , over and over , to be killed with an ax , while his wife was helpless except to entreat him not to `` take on , '' herself adding a continuous lamentation .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 20]: Edith , weeping , made truce with Sibyl and saw to it that the mourning garments were beyond criticism .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 24]: Roscoe was dazed , and he shirked , justifying himself curiously by saying he `` never had any experience in such matters . ''
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 42]: So it was Bibbs , the shy outsider , who became , during this dreadful little time , the master of the house ; for as strange a thing as that , sometimes , may be the result of a death .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 48]: He met the relatives from out of town at the station ; he set the time for the funeral and the time for meals ; he selected the flowers and he selected Jim 's coffin ; he did all the grim things and all the other things .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 60]: Jim had belonged to an order of Knights , who lengthened the rites with a picturesque ceremony of their own , and at first Bibbs wished to avoid this , but upon reflection he offered no objection -- he divined that the Knights and their service would be not precisely a consolation , but a satisfaction to his father .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 49]: So the Knights led the procession , with their band playing a dirge part of the long way to the cemetery ; and then turned back , after forming in two lines , plumed hats sympathetically in hand , to let the hearse and the carriages pass between .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 12]: `` Mighty fine-lookin ' men , '' said Sheridan , brokenly .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 8]: `` They all -- all liked him .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 14]: He was -- '' His breath caught in a sob and choked him .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 10]: `` He was -- a Grand Supreme Herald . ''
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 5]: Bibbs had divined aright .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 26]: `` Dust to dust , '' said the minister , under the gaunt trees ; and at that Sheridan shook convulsively from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 20]: All of the black group shivered , except Bibbs , when it came to `` Dust to dust . ''
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 50]: Bibbs stood passive , for he was the only one of them who had known that thought as a familiar neighbor ; he had been close upon dust himself for a long , long time , and even now he could prophesy no protracted separation between himself and dust .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 46]: The machine-shop had brought him very close , and if he had to go back it would probably bring him closer still ; so close -- as Dr. Gurney predicted -- that no one would be able to tell the difference between dust and himself .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 35]: And Sheridan , if Bibbs read him truly , would be all the more determined to `` make a man '' of him , now that there was a man less in the family .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 47]: To Bibbs 's knowledge , no one and nothing had ever prevented his father from carrying through his plans , once he had determined upon them ; and Sheridan was incapable of believing that any plan of his would not work out according to his calculations .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 8]: His nature unfitted him to accept failure .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 64]: He had the gift of terrible persistence , and with unflecked confidence that his way was the only way he would hold to that way of `` making a man '' of Bibbs , who understood very well , in his passive and impersonal fashion , that it was a way which might make , not a man , but dust of him .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 9]: But he had no shudder for the thought .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 13]: He had no shudder for that thought or for any other thought .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 50]: The truth about Bibbs was in the poem which Edith had adopted : he had so thoroughly formed the over-sensitive habit of hiding his feelings that no doubt he had forgotten -- by this time -- where he had put some of them , especially those which concerned himself .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 17]: But he had not hidden his feelings about his father where they could not be found .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 16]: He was strange to his father , but his father was not strange to him .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 38]: He knew that Sheridan 's plans were conceived in the stubborn belief that they would bring about a good thing for Bibbs himself ; and whatever the result was to be , the son had no bitterness .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 29]: Far otherwise , for as he looked at the big , woeful figure , shaking and tortured , an almost unbearable pity laid hands upon Bibbs 's throat .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 34]: Roscoe stood blinking , his lip quivering ; Edith wept audibly ; Mrs. Sheridan leaned in half collapse against her husband ; but Bibbs knew that his father was the one who cared .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 4]: It was over .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 27]: Men in overalls stepped forward with their shovels , and Bibbs nodded quickly to Roscoe , making a slight gesture toward the line of waiting carriages .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 18]: Roscoe understood -- Bibbs would stay and see the grave filled ; the rest were to go .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 35]: The groups began to move away over the turf ; wheels creaked on the graveled drive ; and one by one the carriages filled and departed , the horses setting off at a walk .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 34]: Bibbs gazed steadfastly at the workmen ; he knew that his father kept looking back as he went toward the carriage , and that was a thing he did not want to see .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 30]: But after a little while there were no sounds of wheels or hoofs on the gravel , and Bibbs , glancing up , saw that every one had gone .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 13]: A coupe had been left for him , the driver dozing patiently .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 44]: The workmen placed the flowers and wreaths upon the mound and about it , and Bibbs altered the position of one or two of these , then stood looking thoughtfully at the grotesque brilliancy of that festal-seeming hillock beneath the darkening November sky .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 7]: `` It 's too bad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 30]: he half whispered , his lips forming the words -- and his meaning was that it was too bad that the strong brother had been the one to go .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 29]: For this was his last thought before he walked to the coupe and saw Mary Vertrees standing , all alone , on the other side of the drive .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 72]: She had just emerged from a grove of leafless trees that grew on a slope where the tombs were many ; and behind her rose a multitude of the barbaric and classic shapes we so strangely strew about our graveyards : urn-crowned columns and stone-draped obelisks , shop-carved angels and shop-carved children poising on pillars and shafts , all lifting -- in unthought pathos -- their blind stoniness toward the sky .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 64]: Against such a background , Bibbs was not incongruous , with his figure , in black , so long and slender , and his face so long and thin and white ; nor was the undertaker 's coupe out of keeping , with the shabby driver dozing on the box and the shaggy horses standing patiently in attitudes without hope and without regret .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 23]: But for Mary Vertrees , here was a grotesque setting -- she was a vivid , living creature of a beautiful world .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 13]: And a graveyard is not the place for people to look charming .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 16]: She also looked startled and confused , but not more startled and confused than Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 37]: In `` Edith 's '' poem he had declared his intention of hiding his heart `` among the stars '' ; and in his boyhood one day he had successfully hidden his body in the coal-pile .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 32]: He had been no comrade of other boys or of girls , and his acquaintances of a recent period were only a few fellow-invalids and the nurses at the Hood Sanitarium .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 20]: All his life Bibbs had kept himself to himself -- he was but a shy onlooker in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 23]: Nevertheless , the startled gaze he bent upon the unexpected lady before him had causes other than his shyness and her unexpectedness .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 42]: For Mary Vertrees had been a shining figure in the little world of late given to the view of this humble and elusive outsider , and spectators sometimes find their hearts beating faster than those of the actors in the spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 5]: Thus with Bibbs now .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 25]: He started and stared ; he lifted his hat with incredible awkwardness , his fingers fumbling at his forehead before they found the brim .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 22]: `` Mr. Sheridan , '' said Mary , `` I 'm afraid you 'll have to take me home with you .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 15]: I -- '' She stopped , not lacking a momentary awkwardness of her own .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 11]: `` Why -- why -- yes , '' Bibbs stammered .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 16]: `` I 'll -- I 'll be de -- Wo n't you get in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 13]: In that manner and in that place they exchanged their first words .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 18]: Then Mary without more ado got into the coupe , and Bibbs followed , closing the door .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 13]: `` You 're very kind , '' she said , somewhat breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 16]: `` I should have had to walk , and it 's beginning to get dark .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 9]: It 's three miles , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 10]: `` It -- it is beginning to get dark .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 7]: I -- I noticed that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 15]: `` I ought to tell you -- I -- '' Mary began , confusedly .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 15]: She bit her lip , sat silent a moment , then spoke with composure .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 15]: `` It must seem odd , my -- '' `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 5]: Bibbs protested , earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 10]: `` Not in the -- in the least . ''
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 10]: `` It does , though , '' said Mary .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 45]: `` I had not intended to come to the cemetery , Mr. Sheridan , but one of the men in charge at the house came and whispered to me that ` the family wished me to ' -- I think your sister sent him .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 4]: So I came .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 20]: But when we reached here I -- oh , I felt that perhaps I -- '' Bibbs nodded gravely .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 9]: `` Yes , yes , '' he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 16]: `` I got out on the opposite side of the carriage , '' she continued .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 13]: `` I mean opposite from -- from where all of you were .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 21]: And I wandered off over in the other direction ; and I did n't realize how little time it takes .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 20]: From where I was I could n't see the carriages leaving -- at least I did n't notice them .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 16]: So when I got back , just now , you were the only one here .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 26]: I did n't know the other people in the carriage I came in , and of course they did n't think to wait for me .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 27]: That 's why -- '' `` Yes , '' said Bibbs , `` I -- '' And that seemed all he had to say just then .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 8]: Mary looked out through the dusty window .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 18]: `` I think we 'd better be going home , if you please , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 10]: `` Yes , '' Bibbs agreed , not moving .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 11]: `` It will be dark before we get there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 8]: She gave him a quick little glance .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 27]: `` I think you must be very tired , Mr. Sheridan ; and I know you have reason to be , '' she said , gently .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 30]: `` If you 'll let me , I 'll -- '' And without explaining her purpose she opened the door on her side of the coupe and leaned out .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 14]: Bibbs started in blank perplexity , not knowing what she meant to do .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 4]: `` Driver ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 10]: she called , in her clear voice , loudly .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 3]: `` Driver !
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 8]: We 'd like to start , please !
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 2]: Driver !
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 14]: Stop at the house just north of Mr. Sheridan 's , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 15]: The wheels began to move , and she leaned back beside Bibbs once more .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 16]: `` I noticed that he was asleep when we got in , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 13]: `` I suppose they have a great deal of night work . ''
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 14]: Bibbs drew a long breath and waited till he could command his voice .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 28]: `` I 've never been able to apologize quickly , '' he said , with his accustomed slowness , `` because if I try to I stammer .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 18]: My brother Roscoe whipped me once , when we were boys , for stepping on his slate-pencil .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 20]: It took me so long to tell him it was an accident , he finished before I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 33]: Mary Vertrees had never heard anything quite like the drawling , gentle voice or the odd implication that his not noticing the motionless state of their vehicle was an `` accident . ''
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 32]: She had formed a casual impression of him , not without sympathy , but at once she discovered that he was unlike any of her cursory and vague imaginings of him .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 31]: And suddenly she saw a picture he had not intended to paint for sympathy : a sturdy boy hammering a smaller , sickly boy , and the sickly boy unresentful .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 10]: Not that picture alone ; others flashed before her .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 14]: Instantaneously she had a glimpse of Bibbs 's life and into his life .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 16]: She had a queer feeling , new to her experience , of knowing him instantly .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 40]: It startled her a little ; and then , with some surprise , she realized that she was glad he had sat so long , after getting into the coupe , before he noticed that it had not started .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 33]: What she did not realize , however , was that she had made no response to his apology , and they passed out of the cemetery gates , neither having spoken again .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 16]: Bibbs was so content with the silence he did not know that it was silence .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 41]: The dusk , gathering in their small inclosure , was filled with a rich presence for him ; and presently it was so dark that neither of the two could see the other , nor did even their garments touch .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 9]: But neither had any sense of being alone .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 47]: The wheels creaked steadily , rumbling presently on paved streets ; there were the sounds , as from a distance , of the plod-plod of the horses ; and sometimes the driver became audible , coughing asthmatically , or saying , `` You , JOE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 12]: with a spiritless flap of the whip upon an unresponsive back .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 30]: Oblongs of light from the lamps at street-corners came swimming into the interior of the coupe and , thinning rapidly to lances , passed utterly , leaving greater darkness .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 17]: And yet neither of these two last attendants at Jim Sheridan 's funeral broke the silence .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 13]: It was Mary who preceived the strangeness of it -- too late .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 21]: Abruptly she realized that for an indefinite interval she had been thinking of her companion and not talking to him .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 43]: `` Mr. Sheridan , '' she began , not knowing what she was going to say , but impelled to say anything , as she realized the queerness of this drive -- `` Mr. Sheridan , I -- '' The coupe stopped .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 6]: `` You , JOE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 14]: said the driver , reproachfully , and climbed down and opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 7]: `` What 's the trouble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 3]: Bibbs inquired .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 17]: `` Lady said stop at the first house north of Mr. Sheridan 's , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 29]: Mary was incredulous ; she felt that it could n't be true and that it must n't be true that they had driven all the way without speaking .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 3]: Bibbs demanded .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 14]: `` We 're there , sir , '' said the driver , sympathetically .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 10]: `` Next house north of Mr. Sheridan 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 6]: Bibbs descended to the curb .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 9]: `` Why , yes , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 10]: `` Yes , you seem to be right . ''
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 22]: And while he stood staring at the dimly illuminated front windows of Mr. Vertrees 's house Mary got out , unassisted .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 27]: `` Let me help you , '' said Bibbs , stepping toward her mechanically ; and she was several feet from the coupe when he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 8]: `` Oh no , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 39]: `` I think I can -- '' She meant that she could get out of the coupe without help , but , perceiving that she had already accomplished this feat , she decided not to complete the sentence .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 6]: `` You , JOE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 11]: cried the driver , angrily , climbing to his box .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 15]: And he rumbled away at his team 's best pace -- a snail 's .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 17]: `` Thank you for bringing me home , Mr. Sheridan , '' said Mary , stiffly .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 7]: She did not offer her hand .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 5]: `` Good night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 23]: `` Good night , '' Bibbs said in response , and , turning with her , walked beside her to the door .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 11]: Mary made that a short walk ; she almost ran .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 43]: Realization of the queerness of their drive was growing upon her , beginning to shock her ; she stepped aside from the light that fell through the glass panels of the door and withheld her hand as it touched the old-fashioned bell-handle .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 18]: `` I 'm quite safe , thank you , '' she said , with a little emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 5]: `` Good night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 12]: `` Good night , '' said Bibbs , and went obediently .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 17]: When he reached the street he looked back , but she had vanished within the house .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 21]: Moving slowly away , he caromed against two people who were turning out from the pavement to cross the street .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 7]: They were Roscoe and his wife .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 9]: `` Where are your eyes , Bibbs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 3]: demanded Roscoe .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 7]: `` Sleep-walking , as usual ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 9]: But Sibyl took the wanderer by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 17]: `` Come over to our house for a little while , Bibbs , '' she urged .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 17]: `` I want to -- '' `` No , I 'd better -- '' `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 5]: I want you to .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 19]: Your father 's gone to bed , and they 're all quiet over there -- all worn out .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 7]: Just come for a minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 24]: He yielded , and when they were in the house she repeated herself with real feeling : '' ` All worn out ! '
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 11]: Well , if anybody is , YOU are , Bibbs !
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 17]: And I do n't wonder ; you 've done every bit of the work of it .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 8]: You must n't get down sick again .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 12]: I 'm going to make you take a little brandy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 34]: He let her have her own way , following her into the dining-room , and was grateful when she brought him a tiny glass filled from one of the decanters on the sideboard .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 45]: Roscoe gloomily poured for himself a much heavier libation in a larger glass ; and the two men sat , while Sibyl leaned against the sideboard , reviewing the episodes of the day and recalling the names of the donors of flowers and wreaths .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 28]: She pressed Bibbs to remain longer when he rose to go , and then , as he persisted , she went with him to the front door .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 25]: He opened it , and she said : `` Bibbs , you were coming out of the Vertreeses ' house when we met you .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 9]: How did you happen to be there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 13]: `` I had only been to the door , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 7]: `` Good night , Sibyl . ''
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 7]: `` Wait , '' she insisted .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 8]: `` We saw you coming out . ''
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 13]: `` I was n't , '' he explained , moving to depart .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 10]: `` I 'd just brought Miss Vertrees home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 19]: `` Yes , '' he said , and stepped out upon the porch , `` that was it .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 6]: Good night , Sibyl . ''
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 4]: `` Wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 9]: she said , following him across the threshold .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 6]: `` How did that happen ?
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 25]: I thought you were going to wait while those men filled the -- the -- '' She paused , but moved nearer him insistently .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 5]: `` I did wait .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 11]: Miss Vertrees was there , '' he said , reluctantly .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 18]: `` She had walked away for a while and did n't notice that the carriages were leaving .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 16]: When she came back the coupe waiting for me was the only one left . ''
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 7]: Sibyl regarded him with dilating eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 7]: She spoke with a slow breathlessness .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 14]: `` And she drove home from Jim 's funeral -- with you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 30]: Without warning she burst into laughter , clapped her hand ineffectually over her mouth , and ran back uproariously into the house , hurling the door shut behind her .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 7]: CHAPTER XIII Bibbs went home pondering .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 9]: He did not understand why Sibyl had laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 34]: The laughter itself had been spontaneous and beyond suspicion , but it seemed to him that she had only affected the effort to suppress it and that she wished it to be significant .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 4]: Significant of what ?
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 16]: And why had she wished to impress upon him the fact of her overwhelming amusement ?
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 23]: He found no answer , but she had succeeded in disturbing him , and he wished that he had not encountered her .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 45]: At home , uncles , aunts , and cousins from out of town were wandering about the house , several mournfully admiring the `` Bay of Naples , '' and others occupied with the Moor and the plumbing , while they waited for trains .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 29]: Edith and her mother had retired to some upper fastness , but Bibbs interviewed Jackson and had the various groups of relatives summoned to the dining-room for food .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 22]: One great-uncle , old Gideon Sheridan from Boonville , could not be found , and Bibbs went in search of him .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 14]: He ransacked the house , discovering the missing antique at last by accident .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 20]: Passing his father 's closed door on tiptoe , Bibbs heard a murmurous sound , and paused to listen .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 24]: The sound proved to be a quavering and rickety voice , monotonously bleating : `` The Lo-ord givuth and the Lo-ord takuth away !
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 12]: We got to remember that ; we got to remember that !
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 40]: I 'm a-gittin ' along , James ; I 'm a-gittin ' along , and I 've seen a-many of 'em go -- two daughters and a son the Lord give me , and He has taken all away .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 10]: For the Lo-ord givuth and the Lo-ord takuth away !
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 10]: Remember the words of Bildad the Shuhite , James .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 25]: Bildad the Shuhite says , ` He shall have neither son nor nephew among his people , nor any remaining in his dwellings . '
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 11]: Bildad the Shuhite -- '' Bibbs opened the door softly .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 44]: His father was lying upon the bed , in his underclothes , face downward , and Uncle Gideon sat near by , swinging backward and forward in a rocking-chair , stroking his long white beard and gazing at the ceiling as he talked .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 12]: Bibbs beckoned him urgently , but Uncle Gideon paid no attention .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 40]: `` Bildad the Shuhite spake and his says , ` If thy children have sinned against Him and He have cast them away -- ' '' There was a muffled explosion beneath the floor , and the windows rattled .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 20]: The figure lying face downward on the bed did not move , but Uncle Gideon leaped from his chair .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 5]: `` My God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 6]: `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 15]: There came a second explosion , and Uncle Gideon ran out into the hall .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 22]: Bibbs went to the head of the great staircase , and , looking down , discovered the source of the disturbance .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 26]: Gideon 's grandson , a boy of fourteen , had brought his camera to the funeral and was taking `` flash-lights '' of the Moor .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 52]: Uncle Gideon , reassured by Bibbs 's explanation , would have returned to finish his quotation from Bildad the Shuhite , but Bibbs detained him , and after a little argument persuaded him to descend to the dining-room whither Bibbs followed , after closing the door of his father 's room .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 51]: He kept his eye on Gideon after dinner , diplomatically preventing several attempts on the part of that comforter to reascend the stairs ; and it was a relief to Bibbs when George announced that an automobile was waiting to convey the ancient man and his grandson to their train .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 20]: They were the last to leave , and when they had gone Bibbs went sighing to his own room .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 32]: He stretched himself wearily upon the bed , but presently rose , went to the window , and looked for a long time at the darkened house where Mary Vertrees lived .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 27]: Then he opened his trunk , took therefrom a small note-book half filled with fragmentary scribblings , and began to write : Laughter after a funeral .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 12]: In this reaction people will laugh at anything and at nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 38]: The band plays a dirge on the way to the cemetery , but when it turns back , and the mourning carriages are out of hearing , it strikes up , `` Darktown is Out To-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 17]: That is natural -- but there are women whose laughter is like the whirring of whips .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 18]: Why is it that certain kinds of laughter seem to spoil something hidden away from the laughers ?
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 21]: If they do not know of it , and have never seen it , how can their laughter hurt it ?
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 4]: Yet it does .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 9]: Beauty is not out of place among grave-stones .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 8]: It is not out of place anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 18]: But a woman who has been betrothed to a man would not look beautiful at his funeral .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 21]: A woman might look beautiful , though , at the funeral of a man whom she had known and liked .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 34]: And in that case , too , she would probably not want to talk if she drove home from the cemetery with his brother : nor would she want the brother to talk .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 8]: Silence is usually either stupid or timid .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 37]: But for a man who stammers if he tries to talk fast , and drawls so slowly , when he does n't stammer , that nobody has time to listen to him , silence is advisable .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 10]: Nevertheless , too much silence is open to suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 12]: It may be reticence , or it may be a vacuum .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 12]: It may be dignity , or it may be false teeth .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 18]: Sometimes an imperceptible odor will become perceptible in a small inclosure , such as a closed carriage .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 28]: The ghost of gasoline rising from a lady 's glove might be sweeter to the man riding beside her than all the scents of Arcady in spring .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 10]: It depends on the lady -- but there ARE !
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 15]: Three miles may be three hundred miles , or it may be three feet .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 22]: When it is three feet you have not time to say a great deal before you reach the end of it .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 12]: Still , it may be that one should begin to speak .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 22]: No one could help wishing to stay in a world that holds some of the people that are in this world .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 15]: There are some so wonderful you do not understand how the dead COULD die .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 6]: How could they let themselves ?
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 11]: A falling building does not care who falls with it .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 15]: It does not choose who shall be upon its roof and who shall not .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 5]: Silence CAN be golden ?
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 47]: But perhaps if a woman of the world should find herself by accident sitting beside a man for the length of time it must necessarily take two slow old horses to jog three miles , she might expect that man to say something of some sort !
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 71]: Even if she thought him a feeble hypochondriac , even if she had heard from others that he was a disappointment to his own people , even if she had seen for herself that he was a useless and irritating encumbrance everywhere , she might expect him at least to speak -- she might expect him to open his mouth and try to make sounds , if he only barked .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 29]: If he did not even try , but sat every step of the way as dumb as a frozen fish , she might THINK him a frozen fish .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 6]: And she might be right .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 20]: She might be right if she thought him about as pleasant a companion as -- as Bildad the Shuhite !
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 11]: Bibbs closed his note-book , replacing it in his trunk .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 33]: Then , after a period of melancholy contemplation , he undressed , put on a dressing-gown and slippers , and went softly out into the hall -- to his father 's door .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 33]: Upon the floor was a tray which Bibbs had sent George , earlier in the evening , to place upon a table in Sheridan 's room -- but the food was untouched .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 10]: Bibbs stood listening outside the door for several minutes .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 19]: There came no sound from within , and he went back to his own room and to bed .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 16]: In the morning he woke to a state of being hitherto unknown in his experience .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 23]: Sometimes in the process of waking there is a little pause -- sleep has gone , but coherent thought has not begun .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 41]: It is a curious half-void , a glimpse of aphasia ; and although the person experiencing it may not know for that instant his own name or age or sex , he may be acutely conscious of depression or elation .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 33]: It is the moment , as we say , before we `` remember '' ; and for the first time in Bibbs 's life it came to him bringing a vague happiness .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 21]: He woke to a sense of new riches ; he had the feeling of a boy waking to a birthday .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 19]: But when the next moment brought him his memory , he found nothing that could explain his exhilaration .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 12]: On the contrary , under the circumstances it seemed grotesquely unwarranted .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 16]: However , it was a brief visitation and was gone before he had finished dressing .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 21]: It left a little trail , the pleased recollection of it and the puzzle of it , which remained unsolved .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 23]: And , in fact , waking happily in the morning is not usually the result of a drive home from a funeral .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 8]: No wonder the sequence evaded Bibbs Sheridan !
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 9]: His father had gone when he came down-stairs .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 17]: `` Went on down to 's office , jes ' same , '' Jackson informed him .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 17]: `` Came sat breakfas ' - table , all by ` mself ; eat nothin ' .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 14]: George bring nice breakfas ' , but he di 'n' eat a thing .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 13]: Yessuh , went on down-town , jes ' same he yoosta do .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 20]: Yessuh , I reckon putty much ev ` y-thing goin ' go on same as it yoosta do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 8]: It struck Bibbs that Jackson was right .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 9]: The day passed as other days had passed .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 29]: Mrs. Sheridan and Edith were in black , and Mrs. Sheridan cried a little , now and then , but no other external difference was to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 35]: Edith was quiet , but not noticeably depressed , and at lunch proved herself able to argue with her mother upon the propriety of receiving calls in the earliest stages of `` mourning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 22]: Lunch was as usual -- for Jim and his father had always lunched down-town -- and the afternoon was as usual .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 23]: Bibbs went for his drive , and his mother went with him , as she sometimes did when the weather was pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 12]: Altogether , the usualness of things was rather startling to Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 12]: During the drive Mrs. Sheridan talked fragmentarily of Jim 's childhood .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 18]: `` But you would n't remember about that , '' she said , after narrating an episode .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 6]: `` You were too little .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 11]: He was always a good boy , just like that .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 16]: And he 'd save whatever papa gave him , and put it in the bank .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 24]: I reckon it 'll just about kill your father to put somebody in his place as president of the Realty Company , Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 33]: I know he ca n't move Roscoe over ; he told me last week he 'd already put as much on Roscoe as any one man could handle and not go crazy .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 15]: Oh , it 's a pity -- '' She stopped to wipe her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 24]: `` It 's a pity you did n't run more with Jim , Bibbs , and kind o ' pick up his ways .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 9]: Think what it 'd meant to papa now !
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 17]: You never did run with either Roscoe or Jim any , even before you got sick .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 23]: Of course , you were younger ; but it always DID seem queer -- and you three bein ' brothers like that .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 22]: I do n't believe I ever saw you and Jim sit down together for a good talk in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 16]: `` Mother , I 've been away so long , '' Bibbs returned , gently .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 25]: `` And since I came home I -- '' `` Oh , I ai n't reproachin ' you , Bibbs , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 41]: `` Jim ai n't been home much of an evening since you got back -- what with his work and callin ' and goin ' to the theater and places , and often not even at the house for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 51]: Right the evening before he got hurt he had his dinner at some miser ` ble rest ` rant down by the Pump Works , he was so set on overseein ' the night work and gettin ' everything finished up right to the minute he told papa he would .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 22]: I reckon you might ` a ' put in more time with Jim if there 'd been more opportunity , Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 16]: I expect you feel almost as if you scarcely really knew him right well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 10]: `` I suppose I really did n't , mother .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 31]: He was busy , you see , and I had n't much to say about the things that interested him , because I do n't know much about them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 6]: `` It 's a pity !
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 8]: Oh , it 's a pity ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 3]: she moaned .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 15]: `` And you 'll have to learn to know about 'em NOW , Bibbs !
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 44]: I have n't said much to you , because I felt it was all between your father and you , but I honestly do believe it will just kill him if he has to have any more trouble on top of all this !
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 12]: You must n't LET him , Bibbs -- you must n't !
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 25]: You do n't know how he 's grieved over you , and now he ca n't stand any more -- he just ca n't !
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 18]: Whatever he says for you to do , you DO it , Bibbs , you DO it !
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 10]: I want you to promise me you will . ''
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 13]: `` I would if I could , '' he said , sorrowfully .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 5]: `` No , no !
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 6]: Why ca n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 7]: she cried , clutching his arm .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 22]: `` He wants you to go back to the machine-shop and -- '' `` And -- ` like it ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 3]: said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 14]: `` Yes , that 's it -- to go in a cheerful spirit .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 24]: Dr. Gurney said it would n't hurt you if you went in a cheerful spirit -- the doctor said that himself , Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 8]: So why ca n't you do it ?
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 10]: Ca n't you do that much for your father ?
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 11]: You ought to think what he 's done for YOU .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 33]: You got a beautiful house to live in ; you got automobiles to ride in ; you got fur coats and warm clothes ; you been taken care of all your life .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 19]: And you do n't KNOW how he worked for the money to give all these things to you !
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 29]: You do n't DREAM what he had to go through and what he risked when we were startin ' out in life ; and you never WILL know !
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 31]: And now this blow has fallen on him out of a clear sky , and you make it out to be a hardship to do like he wants you to !
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 27]: And all on earth he asks is for you to go back to the work in a cheerful spirit , so it wo n't hurt you !
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 6]: That 's all he asks .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 33]: Look , Bibbs , we 're gettin ' back near home , but before we get there I want you to promise me that you 'll do what he asks you to .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 4]: Promise me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 25]: In her earnestness she cleared away her black veil that she might see him better , and it blew out on the smoky wind .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 9]: He readjusted it for her before he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 20]: `` I 'll go back in as cheerful a spirit as I can , mother , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 5]: she exclaimed , satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 7]: `` That 's a good boy !
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 10]: That 's all I wanted you to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 14]: `` Do n't give me any credit , '' he said , ruefully .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 12]: `` There is n't anything else for me to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 12]: `` Now , do n't begin talkin ' THAT way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 10]: `` No , no , '' he soothed her .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 14]: `` We 'll have to begin to make the spirit a cheerful one .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 25]: We may -- '' They were turning into their own driveway as he spoke , and he glanced at the old house next door .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 22]: Mary Vertrees was visible in the twilight , standing upon the front steps , bareheaded , the door open behind her .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 5]: She bowed gravely . ''
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 8]: ` We may ' -- what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 9]: asked Mrs. Sheridan , with a slight impatience .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 8]: `` What is it , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 20]: `` You said , ` We may , ' and did n't finish what you were sayin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 5]: `` Did I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 5]: said Bibbs , blankly .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 9]: `` Well , what WERE we saying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 8]: `` Of all the queer boys ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 5]: `` You always were .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 2]: Always !
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 14]: You have n't forgot what you just promised me , have you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 12]: `` No , '' he answered , as the car stopped .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 18]: `` No , the spirit will be as cheerful as the flesh will let it , mother .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 31]: It wo n't do to behave like -- '' His voice was low , and in her movement to descend from the car she failed to here his final words .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 8]: `` Behave like who , Bibbs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 4]: `` Nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 8]: But she was fretful in her grief .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 12]: `` You said it would n't do to behave like SOMEBODY .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 5]: Behave like WHO ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 15]: `` It was just nonsense , '' he explained , turning to go in .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 13]: `` An obscure person I do n't think much of lately . ''
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 6]: `` Behave like WHO ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 31]: she repeated , and upon his yielding to her petulant insistence , she made up her mind that the only thing to do was to tell Dr. Gurney about it .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 7]: `` Like Bildad the Shuhite ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 5]: was what Bibbs said .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 11]: CHAPTER XIV The outward usualness of things continued after dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 48]: It was Sheridan 's custom to read the evening paper beside the fire in the library , while his wife , sitting near by , either sewed -LRB- from old habit -RRB- or allowed herself to be repeatedly baffled by one of the simpler forms of solitaire .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 51]: To-night she did neither , but sat in her customary chair , gazing at the fire , while Sheridan let the unfolded paper rest upon his lap , though now and then he lifted it , as if to read , and let it fall back upon his knees again .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 32]: Bibbs came in noiselessly and sat in a corner , doing nothing ; and from a `` reception-room '' across the hall an indistinct vocal murmur became just audible at intervals .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 31]: Once , when this murmur grew louder , under stress of some irrepressible merriment , Edith 's voice could be heard -- `` Bobby , are n't you awful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 9]: and Sheridan glanced across at his wife appealingly .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 40]: She rose at once and went into the `` reception-room '' ; there was a flurry of whispering , and the sound of tiptoeing in the hall -- Edith and her suitor changing quarters to a more distant room .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 10]: Mrs. Sheridan returned to her chair in the library .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 20]: `` They wo n't bother you any more , papa , '' she said , in a comforting voice .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 43]: `` She told me at lunch he 'd ` phoned he wanted to come up this evening , and I said I thought he 'd better wait a few days , but she said she 'd already told him he could . ''
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 29]: She paused , then added , rather guiltily : `` I got kind of a notion maybe Roscoe do n't like him as much as he used to .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 11]: Maybe -- maybe you better ask Roscoe , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 20]: And as Sheridan nodded solemnly , she concluded , in haste : `` Do n't say I said to .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 10]: I might be wrong about it , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 31]: He nodded again , and they sat for some time in a silence which Mrs. Sheridan broke with a little sniff , having fallen into a reverie that brought tears .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 13]: `` That Miss Vertrees was a good girl , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 7]: `` SHE was all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 21]: Her husband evidently had no difficulty in following her train of thought , for he nodded once more , affirmatively .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 17]: `` Did you -- How did you fix it about the -- the Realty Company ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 3]: she faltered .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 21]: `` Did you -- '' He rose heavily , helping himself to his feet by the arms of his chair .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 14]: `` I fixed it , '' he said , in a husky voice .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 33]: `` I moved Cantwell up , and put Johnston in Cantwell 's place , and split up Johnston 's work among the four men with salaries high enough to take it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 22]: He went to her , put his hand upon her shoulder , and drew a long , audible , tremulous breath .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 15]: `` It 's my bedtime , mamma ; I 'm goin ' up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 31]: He dropped the hand from her shoulder and moved slowly away , but when he reached the door he stopped and spoke again , without turning to look at her .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 16]: `` The Realty Company 'll go right on just the same , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 12]: `` It 's like -- it 's like sand , mamma .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 13]: It puts me in mind of chuldern playin ' in a sand-pile .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 69]: One of 'em sticks his finger in the sand and makes a hole , and another of 'em 'll pat the place with his hand , and all the little grains of sand run in and fill it up and settle against one another ; and then , right away it 's flat on top again , and you ca n't tell there ever was a hole there .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 11]: The Realty Company 'll go on all right , mamma .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 21]: There ai n't anything anywhere , I reckon , that would n't go right on -- just the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 19]: And he passed out slowly into the hall ; then they heard his heavy tread upon the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 16]: Mrs. Sheridan , rising to follow him , turned a piteous face to her son .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 12]: `` It 's so forlone , '' she said , chokingly .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 17]: `` That 's the first time he spoke since he came in the house this evening .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 18]: I know it must ` a ' hurt him to hear Edith laughin ' with that Lamhorn .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 25]: She 'd ought n't to let him come , right the very first evening this way ; she 'd ought n't to done it !
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 15]: She just seems to lose her head over him , and it scares me .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 27]: You heard what Sibyl said the other day , and -- and you heard what -- what -- '' `` What Edith said to Sibyl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 7]: Bibbs finished the sentence for her .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 13]: `` We CA N'T have any trouble o ' THAT kind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 3]: she wailed .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 21]: `` Oh , it looks as if movin ' up to this New House had brought us awful bad luck !
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 5]: It scares me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 9]: She put both her hands over her face .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 7]: `` Oh , Bibbs , Bibbs !
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 8]: if you only was n't so QUEER !
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 11]: If you could only been a kind of dependable son !
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 13]: I do n't know what we 're all comin ' to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 9]: And , weeping , she followed her husband .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 45]: Bibbs gazed for a while at the fire ; then he rose abruptly , like a man who has come to a decision , and briskly sought the room -- it was called `` the smoking-room '' -- where Edith sat with Mr. Lamhorn .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 23]: They looked up in no welcoming manner , at Bibbs 's entrance , and moved their chairs to a less conspicuous adjacency .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 21]: `` Good evening , '' said Bibbs , pleasantly ; and he seated himself in a leather easy-chair near them .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 6]: asked Edith , plainly astonished .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 9]: `` Nothing , '' he returned , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 3]: She frowned .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 7]: `` Did you want something ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 6]: `` Nothing in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 40]: Father and mother have gone up-stairs ; I sha 'n' t be going up for several hours , and there did n't seem to be anybody left for me to chat with except you and Mr. Lamhorn . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 6]: ` CHAT with ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 5]: she echoed , incredulously .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 18]: `` I can talk about almost anything , '' said Bibbs with an air of genial politeness .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 8]: `` It does n't matter to ME .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 19]: I do n't know much about business -- if that 's what you happened to be talking about .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 14]: But you are n't in business , are you , Mr. Lamhorn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 10]: `` Not now , '' returned Lamhorn , shortly .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 11]: `` I 'm not , either , '' said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 23]: `` It was getting cloudier than usual , I noticed , just before dark , and there was wind from the southwest .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 10]: Rain to-morrow , I should n't be surprised . ''
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 50]: He seemed to feel that he had begun a conversation the support of which had now become the pleasurable duty of other parties ; and he sat expectantly , looking first at his sister , then at Lamhorn , as if implying that it was their turn to speak .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 36]: Edith returned his gaze with a mixture of astonishment and increasing anger , while Mr. Lamhorn was obviously disturbed , though Bibbs had been as considerate as possible in presenting the weather as a topic .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 29]: Bibbs had perceived that Lamhorn had nothing in his mind at any time except `` personalities '' -- he could talk about people and he could make love .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 11]: Bibbs , wishing to be courteous , offered the weather .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 30]: Lamhorn refused it , and concluded from Bibbs 's luxurious attitude in the leather chair that this half-crazy brother was a permanent fixture for the rest of the evening .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 21]: There was not reason to hope that he would move , and Lamhorn found himself in danger of looking silly .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 12]: `` I was just going , '' he said , rising .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 5]: `` Oh NO ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 5]: Edith cried , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 3]: Good night !
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 35]: I think I -- '' `` Too bad , '' said Bibbs , genially , walking to the door with the visitor , while Edith stood staring as the two disappeared in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 34]: She heard Bibbs offering to `` help '' Lamhorn with his overcoat and the latter rather curtly declining assistance , these episodes of departure being followed by the closing of the outer door .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 6]: She ran into the hall .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 9]: `` What 's the matter with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 5]: she cried , furiously .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 6]: `` What do you MEAN ?
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 33]: How did you dare come in there when you knew -- '' Her voice broke ; she made a gesture of rage and despair , and ran up the stairs , sobbing .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 27]: She fled to her mother 's room , and when Bibbs came up , a few minutes later , Mrs. Sheridan met him at his door .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 24]: `` Oh , Bibbs , '' she said , shaking her head woefully , `` you 'd ought n't to distress your sister !
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 13]: She says you drove that young man right out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 9]: You 'd ought to been more considerate . ''
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 22]: Bibbs smiled faintly , noting that Edith 's door was open , with Edith 's naive shadow motionless across its threshold .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 16]: `` He does n't appear to be much of a ` man 's man . '
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 10]: He ran at just a glimpse of one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 17]: Edith 's shadow moved ; her voice came quavering : `` You call yourself one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 9]: `` No , no , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 12]: `` I said , ` just a glimpse of one . '
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 19]: I did n't claim -- '' But her door slammed angrily ; and he turned to his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 9]: `` There , '' he said , sighing .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 33]: `` That 's almost the first time in my life I ever tried to be a man of action , mother , and I succeeded perfectly in what I tried to do .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 10]: As a consequence I feel like a horse-thief ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 11]: `` You hurt her feelin 's , '' she groaned .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 15]: `` You must ` a ' gone at it too rough , Bibbs . ''
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 6]: He looked upon her wanly .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 12]: `` That 's my trouble , mother , '' he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 9]: `` I 'm a plain , blunt fellow .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 13]: I have rough ways , and I 'm a rough man . ''
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 10]: For once she perceived some meaning in his queerness .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 6]: `` Hush your nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 13]: she said , good-naturedly , the astral of a troubled smile appearing .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 7]: `` You go to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 6]: He kissed her and obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 13]: Edith gave him a cold greeting the next morning at the breakfast-table .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 23]: `` You must n't do that under a misapprehension , '' he warned her , when they were alone in the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 8]: `` Do what under a what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 5]: `` Speak to me .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 19]: I came into the smoking-room last night ` on purpose , ' '' he told her , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 11]: `` I have a prejudice against that young man . ''
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 3]: She laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 17]: `` I guess you think it means a great deal who you have prejudices against ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 11]: In mockery she adopted the manner of one who implores .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 21]: `` Bibbs , for pity 's sake PROMISE me , DO N'T use YOUR influence with papa against him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 5]: And she laughed louder .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 11]: `` Listen , '' he said , with peculiar earnestness .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 21]: `` I 'll tell you now , because -- because I 've decided I 'm one of the family . ''
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 35]: And then , as if the earnestness were too heavy for him to carry it further , he continued , in his usual tone , `` I 'm drunk with power , Edith . ''
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 10]: `` What do you want to tell me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 5]: she demanded , brusquely .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 11]: `` Lamhorn made love to Sibyl , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 3]: Edith hooted .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 6]: `` SHE did to HIM !
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 40]: And because you overheard that spat between us the other day when I the same as accused her of it , and said something like that to you afterward -- '' `` No , '' he said , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 5]: `` I KNOW . ''
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 27]: `` I was there , one day a week ago , with Roscoe , and I heard Sibyl and Lamhorn -- '' Edith screamed with laughter .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 16]: `` You were with ROSCOE -- and you heard Lamhorn making love to Sibyl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 6]: I heard them quarreling . ''
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 10]: `` You 're funnier than ever , Bibbs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 15]: `` You say he made love to her because you heard them quarreling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 5]: `` That 's it .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 22]: If you want to know what 's ` between ' people , you can -- by the way they quarrel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 8]: `` You 'll kill me , Bibbs !
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 7]: What were they quarreling about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 3]: `` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 6]: That 's how I knew .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 6]: People who quarrel over nothing !
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 17]: -- it 's always certain -- '' Edith stopped laughing abruptly , but continued her mockery .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 6]: `` You ought to know .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 10]: You 've had so much experience , yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 12]: `` I have n't any , Edith , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 14]: `` My life has been about as exciting as an incubator chicken 's .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 11]: But I look out through the glass at things . ''
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 30]: `` Well , then , '' she said , `` if you look out through the glass you must know what effect such stuff would have upon ME ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 6]: She rose , visibly agitated .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 8]: `` What if it WAS true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 5]: she demanded , bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 11]: `` What if it was true a hundred times over ?
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 44]: You sit there with your silly face half ready to giggle and half ready to sniffle , and tell me stories like that , about Sibyl picking on Bobby Lamhorn and worrying him to death , and you think it matters to ME ?
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 12]: What if I already KNEW all about their ` quarreling ' ?
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 35]: What if I understood WHY she -- '' She broke off with a violent gesture , a sweep of her arm extended at full length , as if she hurled something to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 19]: `` Do you think a girl that really cared for a man would pay any attention to THAT ?
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 8]: Or to YOU , Bibbs Sheridan ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 17]: He looked at her steadily , and his gaze was as keen as it was steady .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 7]: She met it with unwavering pride .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 20]: Finally he nodded slowly , as if she had spoken and he meant to agree with what she said .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 9]: `` Ah , yes , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 10]: `` I wo n't come into the smoking-room again .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 6]: I 'm sorry , Edith .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 8]: Nobody can make you see anything now .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 10]: You 'll never see until you see for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 17]: The rest of us will do better to keep out of it -- especially me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 11]: `` That 's sensible , '' she responded , curtly .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 15]: `` You 're most surprising of all when you 're sensible , Bibbs . ''
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' he sighed .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 7]: `` I 'm a dull dog .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 9]: Shake hands and forgive me , Edith . ''
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 32]: Thawing so far as to smile , she underwent this brief ceremony , and George appeared , summoning Bibbs to the library ; Dr. Gurney was waiting there , he announced .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 24]: And Bibbs gave his sister a shy but friendly touch upon the shoulder as a complement to the handshaking , and left her .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 27]: Dr. Gurney was sitting by the log fire , alone in the room , and he merely glanced over his shoulder when his patient came in .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 18]: He was not over fifty , in spite of Sheridan 's habitual `` ole Doc Gurney . ''
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 19]: He was gray , however , almost as thin as Bibbs , and nearly always he looked drowsy .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 17]: `` Your father telephoned me yesterday afternoon , Bibbs , '' he said , not rising .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 11]: `` Wants me to ` look you over ' again .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 14]: Come around here in front of me -- between me and the fire .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 12]: I want to see if I can see through you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 16]: `` You mean you 're too sleepy to move , '' returned Bibbs , complying .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 13]: `` I think you 'll notice that I 'm getting worse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 11]: `` Taken on about twelve pounds , '' said Gurney .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 6]: `` Thirteen , maybe . ''
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 4]: `` Twelve . ''
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 9]: `` Well , it wo n't do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 6]: The doctor rubbed his eyelids .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 24]: `` You 're so much better I 'll have to use some machinery on you before we can know just where you are .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 9]: You come down to my place this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 7]: Walk down -- all the way .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 12]: I suppose you know why your father wants to know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 3]: Bibbs nodded .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 4]: `` Machine-shop . ''
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 6]: `` Still hate it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 4]: Bibbs nodded again .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 7]: `` Do n't blame you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 4]: the doctor grunted .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 15]: `` Yes , I expect it 'll make a lump in your gizzard again .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 7]: Well , what do you say ?
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 13]: Shall I tell him you 've got the old lump there yet ?
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 10]: You still want to write , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 7]: `` What 's the use ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 6]: Bibbs said , smiling ruefully .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 7]: `` My kind of writing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' the doctor agreed .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 50]: `` I suppose it you broke away and lived on roots and berries until you began to ` attract the favorable attention of editors ' you might be able to hope for an income of four or five hundred dollars a year by the time you 're fifty . ''
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 10]: `` That 's about it , '' Bibbs murmured .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 17]: `` Of course I know what you want to do , '' said Gurney , drowsily .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 36]: `` You do n't hate the machine-shop only ; you hate the whole show -- the noise and jar and dirt , the scramble -- the whole bloomin ' craze to ` get on . '
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 27]: You 'd like to go somewhere in Algiers , or to Taormina , perhaps , and bask on a balcony , smelling flowers and writing sonnets .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 16]: You 'd grow fat on it and have a delicate little life all to yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 7]: Well , what do you say ?
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 8]: I can lie like sixty , Bibbs !
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 21]: Shall I tell your father he 'll lose another of his boys if you do n't go to Sicily ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 14]: `` I do n't want to go to Sicily , '' said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 9]: `` I want to stay right here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 18]: The doctor 's drowsiness disappeared for a moment , and he gave his patient a sharp glance .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 10]: `` It 's a risk , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 22]: `` I think we 'll find you 're so much better he 'll send you back to the shop pretty quick .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 20]: Something 's got hold of you lately ; you 're not quite so lackadaisical as you used to be .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 26]: But I warn you : I think the shop will knock you just as it did before , and perhaps even harder , Bibbs . ''
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 11]: He rose , shook himself , and rubbed his eyelids .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 20]: `` Well , when we go over you this afternoon what are we going to say about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 16]: `` Tell him I 'm ready , '' said Bibbs , looking at the floor .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 8]: `` Oh no , '' Gurney laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 11]: `` Not quite yet ; but you may be almost .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 4]: We 'll see .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 10]: Do n't forget I said to walk down . ''
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 25]: And when the examination was concluded , that afternoon , the doctor informed Bibbs that the result was much too satisfactory to be pleasing .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 28]: `` Here 's a new ` situation ' for a one-act farce , '' he said , gloomily , to his next patient when Bibbs had gone .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 18]: `` Doctor tells a man he 's well , and that 's his death sentence , likely .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 6]: Dam ' funny world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 16]: Bibbs decided to walk home , though Gurney had not instructed him upon this point .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 23]: In fact , Gurney seemed to have no more instructions on any point , so discouraging was the young man 's improvement .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 41]: It was a dingy afternoon , and the smoke was evident not only to Bibbs 's sight , but to his nostrils , though most of the pedestrians were so saturated with the smell they could no longer detect it .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 35]: Nearly all of them walked hurriedly , too intent upon their destinations to be more than half aware of the wayside ; they wore the expressions of people under a vague yet constant strain .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 28]: They were all lightly powdered , inside and out , with fine dust and grit from the hard-paved streets , and they were unaware of that also .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 21]: They did not even notice that they saw the smoke , though the thickened air was like a shrouding mist .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 37]: And when Bibbs passed the new `` Sheridan Apartments , '' now almost completed , he observed that the marble of the vestibule was already streaky with soot , like his gloves , which were new .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 39]: That recalled to him the faint odor of gasolene in the coupe on the way from his brother 's funeral , and this incited a train of thought which continued till he reached the vicinity of his home .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 81]: His route was by a street parallel to that on which the New House fronted , and in his preoccupation he walked a block farther than he intended , so that , having crossed to his own street , he approached the New House from the north , and as he came to the corner of Mr. Vertrees 's lot Mr. Vertrees 's daughter emerged from the front door and walked thoughtfully down the path to the old picket gate .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 31]: She was unconscious of the approach of the pedestrian from the north , and did not see him until she had opened the gate and he was almost beside her .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 14]: Then she looked up , and as she saw him she started visibly .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 26]: And if this thing had happened to Robert Lamhorn , he would have had a thought far beyond the horizon of faint-hearted Bibbs 's thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 10]: Lamhorn , indeed , would have spoken his thought .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 16]: He would have said : `` You jumped because you were thinking of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 11]: CHAPTER XV Mary was the picture of a lady flustered .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 24]: She stood with one hand closing the gate behind her , and she had turned to go in the direction Bibbs was walking .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 23]: There appeared to be nothing for it but that they should walk together , at least as far as the New House .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 51]: But Bibbs had paused in his slow stride , and there elapsed an instant before either spoke or moved -- it was no longer than that , and yet it sufficed for each to seem to say , by look and attitude , `` Why , it 's YOU ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 24]: Then they both spoke at once , each hurriedly pronouncing the other 's name as if about to deliver a message of importance .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 30]: Then both came to a stop simultaneously , but Bibbs made a heroic effort , and as they began to walk on together he contrived to find his voice .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 15]: `` I -- I -- hate a frozen fish myself , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 17]: `` I think three miles was too long for you to put up with one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 5]: `` Good gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 18]: she cried , turning to him a glowing face from which restraint and embarrassment had suddenly fled .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 13]: `` Mr. Sheridan , you 're lovely to put it that way .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 15]: But it 's always the girl 's place to say it 's turning cooler !
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 23]: I ought to have been the one to show that we did n't know each other well enough not to say SOMETHING !
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 28]: It was an imposition for me to have made you bring me home , and after I went into the house I decided I should have walked .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 11]: Besides , it was n't three miles to the car-line .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 7]: I never thought of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 9]: `` No , '' said Bibbs , earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 7]: `` I did n't , either .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 12]: I might have said something if I 'd thought of anything .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 19]: I 'm talking now , though ; I must remember that , and not worry about it later .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 16]: I think I 'm talking , though it does n't sound intelligent even to me .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 29]: I made up my mind that if I ever met you again I 'd turn on my voice and keep it going , no mater what it said .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 38]: I -- '' She interrupted him with laughter , and Mary Vertrees 's laugh was one which Bibbs 's father had declared , after the house-warming , `` a cripple would crawl five miles to hear . ''
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 21]: And at the merry lilting of it Bibbs 's father 's son took heart to forget some of his trepidation .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 23]: `` I 'll be any kind of idiot , '' he said , `` if you 'll laugh at me some more .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 9]: It wo n't be difficult for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 17]: She did ; and Bibbs 's cheeks showed a little actual color , which Mary perceived .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 29]: It recalled to her , by contrast , her careless and irritated description of him to her mother just after she had seen him for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 8]: `` Rather tragic and altogether impossible . ''
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 12]: It seemed to her now that she must have been blind .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 28]: They had passed the New House without either of them showing -- or possessing -- any consciousness that it had been the destination of one of them .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 20]: `` I 'll keep on talking , '' Bibbs continued , cheerfully , `` and you keep on laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 11]: I 'm amounting to something in the world this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 13]: I 'm making a noise , and that makes you make music .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 13]: Do n't be bothered by my bleating out such things as that .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 12]: I 'm really frightened , and that makes me bleat anything .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 46]: I 'm frightened about two things : I 'm afraid of what I 'll think of myself later if I do n't keep talking -- talking now , I mean -- and I 'm afraid of what I 'll think of myself if I do .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 12]: And besides these two things , I 'm frightened , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 18]: I do n't remember talking as much as this more than once or twice in my life .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 32]: I suppose it was always in me to do it , though , the first time I met any one who did n't know me well enough not to listen . ''
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 14]: `` But you 're not really talking to me , '' said Mary .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 8]: `` You 're just thinking aloud . ''
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 9]: `` No , '' he returned , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 22]: `` I 'm not thinking at all ; I 'm only making vocal sounds because I believe it 's more mannerly .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 28]: I seem to be the subject of what little meaning they possess , and I 'd like to change it , but I do n't know how .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 19]: I have n't any experience in talking , and I do n't know how to manage it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 18]: `` You need n't change the subject on my account , Mr. Sheridan , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 11]: `` Not even if you really talked about yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 27]: She turned her face toward him as she spoke , and Bibbs caught his breath ; he was pathetically amazed by the look she gave him .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 25]: It was a glowing look , warmly friendly and understanding , and , what almost shocked him , it was an eagerly interested look .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 9]: Bibbs was not accustomed to anything like that .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 25]: `` I -- you -- I -- I 'm -- '' he stammered , and the faint color in his cheeks grew almost vivid .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 19]: She was still looking at him , and she saw the strange radiance that came into his face .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 44]: There was something about him , too , that explained how `` queer '' many people might think him ; but he did not seem `` queer '' to Mary Vertrees ; he seemed the most quaintly natural person she had ever met .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 7]: He waited , and became coherent .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 10]: `` YOU say something now , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 24]: `` I do n't even belong in the chorus , and here I am , trying to sing the funny man 's solo !
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 10]: You -- '' `` No , '' she interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 9]: `` I 'd rather play your accompaniment . ''
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 12]: `` I 'll stop and listen to it , then . ''
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 29]: `` Perhaps -- '' she began , but after pausing thoughtfully she made a gesture with her muff , indicating a large brick church which they were approaching .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 11]: `` Do you see that church , Mr. Sheridan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 17]: `` I suppose I could , '' he answered in simple truthfulness , looking at her .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 8]: `` But I do n't want to .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 28]: Once , when I was ill , the nurse told me I 'd better say anything that was on my mind , and I got the habit .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 33]: The other reason I do n't want to see the church is that I have a feeling it 's where you 're going , and where I 'll be sent back . ''
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 8]: She shook her head in cheery negation .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 8]: `` Not unless you want to be .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 9]: Would you like to come with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 11]: `` Why -- why -- yes , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 4]: `` Anywhere ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 12]: And again it was apparent that he spoke in simple truthfulness .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 11]: `` Then come -- if you care for organ music .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 16]: The organist is an old friend of mine , and sometimes he plays for me .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 7]: He 's a dear old man .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 21]: He had a degree from Bonn , and was a professor afterward , but he gave up everything for music .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 9]: That 's he , waiting in the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 9]: He looks like Beethoven , does n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 13]: I think he knows that , perhaps and enjoys it a little .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 5]: I hope so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 14]: `` Yes , '' said Bibbs , as they reached the church steps .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 10]: `` I think Beethoven would like it , too .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 11]: It must be pleasant to look like other people . ''
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 8]: `` I have n't kept you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 6]: Mary said to the organist .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 11]: `` No , no , '' he answered , heartily .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 13]: `` I would not mind so only you should shooer come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 9]: `` This is Mr. Sheridan , Dr. Kraft .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 9]: He has come to listen with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 6]: The organist looked bluntly surprised .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 6]: `` Iss that SO ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 20]: `` Well , I am glad if you wish him , and if he can stant my liddle playink .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 11]: He iss musician himself , then , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 15]: `` No , '' said Bibbs , as the three entered the church together .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 41]: `` I -- I played the -- I tried to play -- '' Fortunately he checked himself ; he had been about to offer the information that he had failed to master the jews ' - harp in his boyhood .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 16]: `` No , I 'm not a musician , '' he contented himself with saying .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 6]: Dr. Kraft 's surprise increased .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 8]: `` Young man , you are fortunate !
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 11]: I play for Miss Vertrees ; she comes always alone .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 5]: You are the first .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 8]: You are the first one EVER ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 72]: They had reached the head of the central aisle , and as the organist finished speaking Bibbs stopped short , turning to look at Mary Vertrees in a dazed way that was not of her perceiving ; for , though she stopped as he did , her gaze followed the organist , who was walking away from them toward the front of the church , shaking his white Beethovian mane roguishly .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 13]: `` It 's false pretenses on my part , '' Bibbs said .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 19]: `` You mean to be kind to the sick , but I 'm not an invalid any more .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 15]: I 'm so well I 'm going back to work in a few days .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 15]: I 'd better leave before he begins to play , had n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 12]: `` No , '' said Mary , beginning to walk forward .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 11]: `` Not unless you do n't like great music . ''
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 19]: He followed her to a seat about half-way up the aisle while Dr. Kraft ascended to the organ .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 62]: It was an enormous one , the procession of pipes ranging from long , starveling whistles to thundering fat guns ; they covered all the rear wall of the church , and the organist 's figure , reaching its high perch , looked like that of some Lilliputian magician ludicrously daring the attempt to control a monster certain to overwhelm him .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 7]: `` This afternoon some Handel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 5]: he turned to shout .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 3]: Mary nodded .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 7]: `` Will you like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 4]: she asked Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 9]: I never heard any except ` Largo . '
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 8]: I do n't know anything about music .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 11]: I do n't even know how to pretend I do .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 11]: If I knew enough to pretend , I would . ''
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 20]: `` No , '' said Mary , looking at him and smiling faintly , `` you would n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 46]: She turned away as a great sound began to swim and tremble in the air ; the huge empty space of the church filled with it , and the two people listening filled with it ; the universe seemed to fill and thrill with it .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 33]: The two sat intensely still , the great sound all round about them , while the church grew dusky , and only the organist 's lamp made a tiny star of light .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 45]: His white head moved from side to side beneath it rhythmically , or lunged and recovered with the fierceness of a duelist thrusting , but he was magnificently the master of his giant , and it sang to his magic as he bade it .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 9]: Bibbs was swept away upon that mighty singing .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 19]: Such a thing was wholly unknown to him ; there had been no music in his meager life .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 31]: Unlike the tale , it was the Princess Bedrulbudour who had brought him to the enchanted cave , and that -- for Bibbs -- was what made its magic dazing .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 66]: It seemed to him a long , long time since he had been walking home drearily from Dr. Gurney 's office ; it seemed to him that he had set out upon a happy journey since then , and that he had reached another planet , where Mary Vertrees and he sat alone together listening to a vast choiring of invisible soldiers and holy angels .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 18]: There were armies of voices about them singing praise and thanksgiving ; and yet they were alone .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 60]: It was incredible that the walls of the church were not the boundaries of the universe , to remain so for ever ; incredible that there was a smoky street just yonder , where housemaids were bringing in evening papers from front steps and where children were taking their last spins on roller-skates before being haled indoors for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 12]: He had a curious sense of communication with his new friend .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 30]: He knew it could not be so , and yet he felt as if all the time he spoke to her , saying : `` You hear this strain ?
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 5]: You hear that strain ?
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 12]: You know the dream that these sounds bring to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 15]: And it seemed to him as though she answered continually : `` I hear !
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 17]: I hear that strain , and I hear the new one that you are hearing now .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 11]: I know the dream that these sounds bring to you .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 9]: Yes , yes , I hear it all !
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 6]: We hear -- together ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 68]: And though the church grew so dim that all was mysterious shadow except the vague planes of the windows and the organist 's light , with the white head moving beneath it , Bibbs had no consciousness that the girl sitting beside him had grown shadowy ; he seemed to see her as plainly as ever in the darkness , though he did not look at her .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 50]: And all the mighty chanting of the organ 's multitudinous voices that afternoon seemed to Bibbs to be chorusing of her and interpreting her , singing her thoughts and singing for him the world of humble gratitude that was in his heart because she was so kind to him .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 5]: It all meant Mary .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 20]: CHAPTER XVI But when she asked him what it meant , on their homeward way , he was silent .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 15]: They had come a few paces from the church without speaking , walking slowly .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 22]: `` I 'll tell you what it meant to me , '' she said , as he did not immediately reply .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 19]: `` Almost any music of Handel 's always means one thing above all others to me : courage !
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 4]: That 's it .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 22]: It makes cowardice of whining seem so infinitesimal -- it makes MOST things in our hustling little lives seem infinitesimal . ''
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 40]: `` It seems odd , does n't it , that people down-town are hurrying to trains and hanging to straps in trolley-cars , weltering every way to get home and feed and sleep so they can get down-town to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 12]: And yet there is n't anything down there worth getting to .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 21]: They 're like servants drudging to keep the house going , and believing the drudgery itself is the great thing .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 20]: They make so much noise and fuss and dirt they forget that the house was meant to live in .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 26]: The housework has to be done , but the people who do it have been so overpaid that they 're confused and worship the housework .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 10]: They 're overpaid , and yet , poor things !
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 11]: they have n't anything that a chicken ca n't have .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 18]: Of course , when the world gets to paying its wages sensibly that will be different . ''
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 9]: `` Do you mean ` communism ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 21]: she asked , and she made their slow pace a little slower -- they had only three blocks to go .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 33]: `` Whatever the word is , I only mean that things do n't look very sensible now -- especially to a man that wants to keep out of 'em and ca n't !
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 4]: ` Communism ' ?
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 47]: Well , at least any ` decent sport ' would say it 's fair for all the strong runners to start from the same mark and give the weak ones a fair distance ahead , so that all can run something like even on the stretch .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 18]: And would n't it be pleasant , really , if they could all cross the winning-line together ?
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 15]: Who really enjoys beating anybody -- if he sees the beaten man 's face ?
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 21]: The only way we can enjoy getting ahead of other people nowadays is by forgetting what the other people feel .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 18]: And that , '' he added , `` is nothing of what the music meant to me .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 25]: You see , if I keep talking about what it did n't mean I can keep from telling you what it did mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 15]: `` Did n't it mean courage to you , too -- a little ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 18]: `` Triumph and praise were in it , and somehow those things mean courage to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 12]: `` Yes , they were all there , '' Bibbs said .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 22]: `` I do n't know the name of what he played , but I should n't think it would matter much .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 45]: The man that makes the music must leave it to you what it can mean to you , and the name he puts to it ca n't make much difference -- except to himself and people very much like him , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 18]: `` I suppose that 's true , though I 'd never thought of it like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 42]: `` I imagine music must make feelings and paint pictures in the minds of the people who hear it , '' Bibbs went on , musingly , `` according to their own natures as much as according to the music itself .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 65]: The musician might compose something and play it , wanting you to think of the Holy Grail , and some people who heard it would think of a prayer-meeting , and some would think of how good they were themselves , and a boy might think of himself at the head of a solemn procession , carrying a banner and riding a white horse .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 21]: And then , if there were some jubilant passages in the music , he 'd think of a circus . ''
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 20]: They had reached her gate , and she set her hand upon it , but did not open it .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 20]: Bibbs felt that this was almost the kindest of her kindnesses -- not to be prompt in leaving him .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 20]: `` After all , '' she said , `` you did n't tell me whether you liked it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 7]: I did n't need to . ''
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 15]: `` No , that 's true , and I did n't need to ask .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 3]: I knew .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 17]: But you said you were trying to keep from telling me what it did mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 15]: `` I ca n't keep from telling it any longer , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 17]: `` The music meant to me -- it meant the kindness of -- of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 3]: `` Kindness ?
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 3]: How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 24]: `` You thought I was a sort of lonely tramp -- and sick -- '' `` No , '' she said , decidedly .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 13]: `` I thought perhaps you 'd like to hear Dr. Kraft play .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 5]: And you did . ''
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 19]: `` It 's curious ; sometimes it seemed to me that it was you who were playing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 3]: Mary laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 3]: `` I ?
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 3]: I strum !
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 2]: Piano .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 8]: A little Chopin -- Grieg -- Chaminade .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 6]: You would n't listen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 6]: Bibbs drew a deep breath .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 15]: `` I 'm frightened again , '' he said , in an unsteady voice .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 25]: `` I 'm afraid you 'll think I 'm pushing , but -- '' He paused , and the words sank to a murmur .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 13]: `` Oh , if you want ME to play for you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 5]: `` Yes , gladly .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 12]: It will be merely absurd after what you heard this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 14]: I play like a hundred thousand other girls , and I like it .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 29]: I 'm glad when any one 's willing to listen , and if you -- '' She stopped , checked by a sudden recollection , and laughed ruefully .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 11]: `` But my piano wo n't be here after to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 9]: I -- I 'm sending it away to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 22]: I 'm afraid that if you 'd like me to play to you you 'd have to come this evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 7]: `` You 'll let me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 9]: `` Certainly , if you care to . ''
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 30]: `` If I could play -- '' he said , wistfully , `` if I could play like that old man in the church I could thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 11]: `` Ah , but you have n't heard me play .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 17]: I KNOW you liked this afternoon , but -- '' `` Yes , '' said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 12]: `` It was the greatest happiness I 've ever known . ''
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 38]: It was too dark to see his face , but his voice held such plain honesty , and he spoke with such complete unconsciousness of saying anything especially significant , that she knew it was the truth .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 16]: For a moment she was nonplussed , then she opened the gate and went in .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 10]: `` You 'll come after dinner , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 10]: `` Yes , '' he said , not moving .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 15]: `` Would you mind if I stood here until time to come in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 45]: She had reached the steps , and at that she turned , offering him the response of laughter and a gay gesture of her muff toward the lighted windows of the New House , as though bidding him to run home to his dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 10]: That night , Bibbs sat writing in his note-book .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 12]: Music can come into a blank life , and fill it .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 12]: Everything that is beautiful is music , if you can listen .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 15]: There is no gracefulness like that of a graceful woman at a grand piano .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 41]: There is a swimming loveliness of line that seems to merge with the running of the sound , and you seem , as you watch her , to see what you are hearing and to hear what you are seeing .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 17]: There are women who make you think of pine woods coming down to a sparkling sea .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 32]: The air about such a woman is bracing , and when she is near you , you feel strong and ambitious ; you forget that the world does n't like you .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 13]: You think that perhaps you are a great fellow , after all .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 19]: Then you come away and feel like a boy who has fallen in love with his Sunday-school teacher .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 12]: You 'll be whipped for it -- and ought to be .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 15]: There are women who make you think of Diana , crowned with the moon .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 11]: But they do not have the `` Greek profile . ''
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 30]: I do not believe Helen of Troy had a `` Greek profile '' ; they would not have fought about her if her nose had been quite that long .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 9]: The Greek nose is not the adorable nose .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 12]: The adorable nose is about an eighth of an inch shorter .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 17]: Much of the music of Wagner , it appears , is not suitable to the piano .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 27]: Wagner was a composer who could interpret into music such things as the primitive impulses of humanity -- he could have made a machine-shop into music .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 10]: But not if he had to work in it .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 23]: Wagner was always dealing in immensities -- a machine-shop would have put a majestic lump in so grand a gizzard as that .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 10]: There is a mystery about pianos , it seems .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 10]: Sometimes they have to be `` sent away . ''
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 10]: That is how some people speak of the penitentiary .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 14]: `` Sent away '' is a euphuism for `` sent to prison . ''
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 24]: But pianos are not sent to prison , and they are not sent to the tuner -- the tuner is sent to them .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 11]: Why are pianos `` sent away '' -- and where ?
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 13]: Sometimes a glorious day shines into the most ordinary and useless life .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 33]: Happiness and beauty come caroling out of the air into the gloomy house of that life as if some stray angel just happened to perch on the roof-tree , resting and singing .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 17]: And the night after such a day is lustrous and splendid with the memory of it .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 17]: Music and beauty and kindness -- those are the three greatest things God can give us .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 15]: To bring them all in one day to one who expected nothing -- ah !
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 14]: the heart that received them should be as humble as it is thankful .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 16]: But it is hard to be humble when one is so rich with new memories .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 12]: It is impossible to be humble after a day of glory .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 19]: Yes -- the adorable nose is more than an eighth of an inch shorter than the Greek nose .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 10]: It is a full quarter of an inch shorter .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 17]: There are women who will be kinder to a sick tramp than to a conquering hero .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 13]: But the sick tramp had better remember that 's what he is .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 6]: Take care , take care !
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 5]: Humble 's the word !
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 40]: CHAPTER XVII That `` mystery about pianos '' which troubled Bibbs had been a mystery to Mr. Vertrees , and it was being explained to him at about the time Bibbs scribbled the reference to it in his notes .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 27]: Mary had gone up-stairs upon Bibbs 's departure at ten o'clock , and Mr. and Mrs. Vertrees sat until after midnight in the library , talking .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 74]: And in all that time they found not one cheerful topic , but became more depressed with everything and with every phase of everything that they discussed -- no extraordinary state of affairs in a family which has always `` held up its head , '' only to arrive in the end at a point where all it can do is to look on helplessly at the processes of its own financial dissolution .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 24]: For that was the point which this despairing couple had reached -- they could do nothing except look on and talk about it .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 10]: They were only vaporing , and they knew it .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 17]: `` She need n't to have done that about her piano , '' vapored Mr. Vertrees .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 9]: `` We could have managed somehow without it .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 26]: At least she ought to have consulted me , and if she insisted I could have arranged the details with the -- the dealer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 17]: `` She thought that it might be -- annoying for you , '' Mrs. Vertrees explained .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 33]: `` Really , she planned for you not to know about it until they had removed -- until after to-morrow , that is , but I decided to -- to mention it .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 15]: You see , she did n't even tell me about it until this morning .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 11]: She has another idea , too , I 'm afraid .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 11]: It 's -- it 's -- '' `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 12]: he urged , as she found it difficult to go on .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 29]: `` Her other idea is -- that is , it was -- I think it can be avoided , of course -- it was about her furs . ''
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 5]: he exclaimed , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 7]: `` I wo n't have it !
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 6]: You must see to that .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 18]: I 'd rather not talk to her about it , but you must n't let her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 11]: `` I 'll try not , '' his wife promised .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 10]: `` Of course , they 're very handsome . ''
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 12]: `` All the more reason for her to keep them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 5]: he returned , irritably .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 12]: `` We 're not THAT far gone , I think ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 10]: `` Perhaps not yet , '' Mrs. Vertrees said .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 17]: `` She seems to be troubled about the -- the coal matter and -- about Tilly .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 25]: Of course the piano will take care of some things like those for a while and -- '' `` I do n't like it .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 31]: I gave her the piano to play on , not to -- '' `` You must n't be distressed about it in ONE way , '' she said , comfortingly .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 24]: `` She arranged with the -- with the purchaser that the men will come for it about half after five in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 13]: The days are so short now it 's really quite winter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 11]: `` Oh , yes , '' he agreed , moodily .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 29]: `` So far as that goes people have a right to move a piece of furniture without stirring up the neighbors , I suppose , even by daylight .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 30]: I do n't suppose OUR neighbors are paying much attention just now , though I hear Sheridan was back in his office early the morning after the funeral . ''
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 9]: Mrs. Vertrees made a little sound of commiseration .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 15]: `` I do n't believe that was because he was n't suffering , though .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 15]: I 'm sure it was only because he felt his business was so important .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 22]: Mary told me he seemed wrapped up in his son 's succeeding ; and that was what he bragged about most .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 39]: He is n't vulgar in his boasting , I understand ; he does n't talk a great deal about his -- his actual money -- though there was something about blades of grass that I did n't comprehend .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 13]: I think he meant something about his energy -- but perhaps not .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 27]: No , his bragging usually seemed to be not so much a personal vainglory as about his family and the greatness of this city . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 8]: ` Greatness of this city ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 8]: Mr. Vertrees echoed , with dull bitterness .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 8]: `` It 's nothing but a coal-hole !
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 21]: I suppose it looks ` great ' to the man who has the luck to make it work for him .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 24]: I suppose it looks ` great ' to any YOUNG man , too , starting out to make his fortune out of it .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 24]: The fellows that get what they want out of it say it 's ` great , ' and everybody else gets the habit .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 22]: But you have a different point of view if it 's the city that got what it wanted out of you !
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 11]: Of course Sheridan says it 's ` great ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 9]: Mrs. Vertrees seemed unaware of this unusual outburst .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 36]: `` I believe , '' she began , timidly , `` he does n't boast of -- that is , I understand he has never seemed so interested in the -- the other one . ''
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 25]: Her husband 's face was dark , but at that a heavier shadow fell upon it ; he looked more haggard than before . ''
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 14]: ` The other one ' , '' he repeated , averting his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 19]: `` You mean -- you mean the third son -- the one that was here this evening ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 22]: `` Yes , the -- the youngest , '' she returned , her voice so feeble it was almost a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 11]: And then neither of them spoke for several long minutes .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 11]: Nor did either look at the other during that silence .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 12]: At last Mr. Vertrees contrived to cough , but not convincingly .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 24]: `` What -- ah -- what was it Mary said about him out in the hall , when she came in this afternoon ?
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 29]: I heard you asking her something about him , but she answered in such a low voice I did n't -- ah -- happen to catch it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 9]: `` She -- she did n't say much .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 36]: All she said was this : I asked her if she had enjoyed her walk with him , and she said , ` He 's the most wistful creature I 've ever known . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 5]: `` That was all .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 19]: He IS wistful-looking ; and so fragile -- though he does n't seem quite so much so lately .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 38]: I was watching Mary from the window when she went out to-day , and he joined her , and if I had n't known about him I 'd have thought he had quite an interesting face . ''
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 11]: `` If you ` had n't known about him ' ?
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 4]: Known what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 14]: `` Oh , nothing , of course , '' she said , hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 7]: `` Nothing definite , that is .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 21]: Mary said decidely , long ago , that he 's not at all insane , as we thought at first .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 17]: It 's only -- well , of course it IS odd , their attitude about him .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 34]: I suppose it 's some nervous trouble that makes him -- perhaps a little queer at times , so that he ca n't apply himself to anything -- or perhaps does odd things .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 16]: But , after all , of course , we only have an impression about it .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 10]: We do n't know -- that is , positively .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 31]: I -- '' She paused , then went on : `` I did n't know just how to ask -- that is -- I did n't mention it to Mary .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 18]: I did n't -- I -- '' The poor lady floundered pitifully , concluding with a mumble .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 12]: `` So soon after -- after the -- the shock . ''
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 20]: `` I do n't think I 've caught more than a glimpse of him , '' said Mr. Vertrees .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 31]: `` I would n't know him if I saw him , but your impression of him is -- '' He broke off suddenly , springing to his feet in agitation .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 12]: `` I ca n't imagine her -- oh , NO ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 3]: he gasped .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 8]: And he began to pace the floor .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 6]: `` A half-witted epileptic ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 6]: `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 7]: `` He may be all right .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 10]: We -- '' `` Oh , it 's horrible !
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 30]: I ca n't -- '' He threw himself back into his chair again , sweeping his hands across his face , then letting them fall limply at his sides .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 5]: Mrs. Vertrees was tremulous .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 20]: `` You must n't give way so , '' she said , inspired for once almost to direct discourse .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 23]: `` Whatever Mary might think of doing , it would n't be on her own account ; it would be on ours .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 18]: But if WE should -- should consider it , that would n't be on OUR own account .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 10]: It is n't because we think of ourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 7]: `` Oh God , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 3]: he groaned .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 5]: `` Not for us !
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 16]: We can go to the poorhouse , but Mary ca n't be a stenographer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 8]: Sighing , Mrs. Vertrees resumed her obliqueness .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 51]: `` Of course , '' she murmured , `` it all seems very premature , speculating about such things , but I had a queer sort of feeling that she seemed quite interested in this -- '' She had almost said `` in this one , '' but checked herself .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 6]: `` In this young man .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 36]: It 's natural , of course ; she is always so strong and well , and he is -- he seems to be , that is -- rather appealing to the -- the sympathies . ''
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 5]: he agreed , bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 3]: `` Precisely .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 4]: The sympathies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 25]: `` Perhaps , '' she faltered , `` perhaps you might feel easier if I could have a little talk with some one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 5]: `` With whom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 71]: `` I had thought of -- not going about it too brusquely , of course , but perhaps just waiting for his name to be mentioned , if I happened to be talking with somebody that knew the family -- and then I might find a chance to say that I was sorry to hear he 'd been ill so much , and -- Something of that kind perhaps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 12]: `` You do n't know anybody that knows the family . ''
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 17]: That is -- well , in a way , of course , one OF the family .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 28]: That Mrs. Roscoe Sheridan is not a -- that is , she 's rather a pleasant-faced little woman , I think , and of course rather ordinary .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 26]: I think she is interested about -- that is , of course , she 'd be anxious to be more intimate with Mary , naturally .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 35]: She 's always looking over here from her house ; she was looking out the window this afternoon when Mary went out , I noticed -- though I do n't think Mary saw her .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 19]: I 'm sure she would n't think it out of place to -- to be frank about matters .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 25]: She called the other day , and Mary must rather like her -- she said that evening that the call had done her good .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 10]: Do n't you think it might be wise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 3]: `` Wise ?
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 9]: I feel the whole matter is impossible . ''
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 13]: `` Yes , so do I , '' she returned , promptly .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 16]: `` It is n't really a thing we should be considering seriously , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 9]: Still -- '' `` I should say not !
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 53]: But possibly -- '' Thus they skirmished up and down the field , but before they turned the lights out and went up-stairs it was thoroughly understood between them that Mrs. Vertrees should seek the earliest opportunity to obtain definite information from Sibyl Sheridan concerning the mental and physical status of Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 28]: And if he were subject to attacks of lunacy , the unhappy pair decided to prevent the sacrifice they supposed their daughter intended to make of herself .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 28]: Altogether , if there were spiteful ghosts in the old house that night , eavesdropping upon the woeful comedy , they must have died anew of laughter !
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 10]: Mrs. Vertrees 's opportunity occurred the very next afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 10]: Darkness had fallen , and the piano-movers had come .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 51]: They were carrying the piano down the front steps , and Mrs. Vertrees was standing in the open doorway behind them , preparing to withdraw , when she heard a sharp exclamation ; and Mrs. Roscoe Sheridan , bareheaded , emerged from the shadow into the light of the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 5]: `` Good gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 9]: `` It did give me a fright ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 11]: `` It 's Mrs. Sheridan , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 18]: Mrs. Vertrees was perplexed by this informal appearance , but she reflected that it might be providential .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 8]: `` Wo n't you come in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 7]: Oh no , thank you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 10]: Sibyl panted , pressing her hand to her side .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 13]: `` You do n't know what a fright you 've given me !
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 9]: And it was nothing but your piano ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 4]: She laughed shrilly .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 27]: `` You know , since our tragedy coming so suddenly the other day , you have no idea how upset I 've been -- almost hysterical !
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 39]: And I just glanced out of the window , a minute or so ago , and saw your door wide open and black figures of men against the light , carrying something heavy , and I almost fainted .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 31]: You see , it was just the way it looked when I saw them bringing my poor brother-in-law in , next door , only such a few short days ago .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 34]: And I thought I 'd seen your daughter start for a drive with Bibbs Sheridan in a car about three o'clock -- and -- They are n't back yet , are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 4]: Good heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 32]: `` And the only thing I could think of was that something must have happened to them , and I just dashed over -- and it was only your PIANO ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 6]: She broke into laughter again .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 18]: `` I suppose you 're just sending it somewhere to be repaired , are n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 15]: `` It 's -- it 's being taken down-town , '' said Mrs. Vertrees .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 13]: `` Wo n't you come in and make me a little visit .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 25]: I was SO sorry , the other day , that I was -- ah -- '' She stopped inconsequently , then repeated her invitation .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 7]: `` Wo n't you come in ?
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 16]: I 'd really -- '' `` Thank you , but I must be running back .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 23]: My husband usually gets home about this time , and I make a little point of it always to be there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 7]: `` That 's very sweet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 13]: Mrs. Vertrees descended the steps and walked toward the street with Sibyl .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 15]: `` It 's quite balmy for so late in November , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 7]: Almost like a May evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 27]: `` I 'm afraid Miss Vertrees will miss her piano , '' said Sibyl , watching the instrument disappear into the big van at the curb .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 11]: `` She plays wonderfully , Mrs. Kittersby tells me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 8]: `` Yes , she plays very well .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 24]: One of your relatives came to hear her yesterday , after dinner , and I think she played all evening for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 6]: `` You mean Bibbs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 3]: asked Sibyl .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 8]: `` The -- the youngest Mr. Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 10]: He 's very musical , is n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 7]: `` I never heard of it .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 26]: But I should n't think it would matter much whether he was or not , if he could get Miss Vertrees to play to him .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 10]: Does your daughter expect the piano back soon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 8]: `` I -- I believe not immediately .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 27]: Mr. Sheridan came last evening to hear her play because she had arranged with the -- that is , it was to be removed this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 7]: He seems almost well again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 3]: Sibyl nodded .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 14]: `` His father 's going to try to start him to work . ''
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 11]: `` He seems very delicate , '' said Mrs. Vertrees .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 40]: `` I should n't think he would be able to stand a great deal , either physically or -- '' She paused and then added , glowing with the sense of her own adroitness -- `` or mentally . ''
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 18]: `` Oh , mentally Bibbs is all right , '' said Sibyl , in an odd voice .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 4]: `` Entirely ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 6]: Mrs. Vertrees asked , breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 6]: `` Yes , entirely . ''
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 8]: `` But has he ALWAYS been ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 9]: This question came with the same anxious eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 3]: `` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 16]: He had a long siege of nervous dyspepsia , but he 's over it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 12]: `` And you think -- '' `` Bibbs is all right .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 17]: You need n't wor -- '' Sibyl choked , and pressed her handkerchief to her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 42]: `` Good night , Mrs. Vertrees , '' she said , hurriedly , as the head-lights of an automobile swung round the corner above , sending a brightening glare toward the edge of the pavement where the two ladies were standing .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 8]: `` Wo n't you come in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 22]: urged Mrs. Vertrees , cordially , hearing the sound of a cheerful voice out of the darkness beyond the approaching glare .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 3]: `` Do !
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 17]: There 's Mary now , and she -- '' But Sibyl was half-way across the street .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 9]: `` No , thanks , '' she called .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 11]: `` I hope she wo n't miss her piano ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 25]: And she ran into her own house and plunged headlong upon a leather divan in the hall , holding her handkerchief over her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 64]: The noise of her tumultuous entrance was evidently startling in the quiet house , for upon the bang of the door there followed the crash of a decanter , dropped upon the floor of the dining-room at the end of the hall ; and , after a rumble of indistinct profanity , Roscoe came forth , holding a dripping napkin in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 7]: `` What 's your excitement ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 11]: `` What do you find to go into hysterics over ?
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 7]: Another death in the family ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 8]: `` Oh , it 's funny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 3]: she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 6]: `` Those old frost-bitten people !
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 9]: I guess THEY 'RE getting their come-uppance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 21]: Lying prone , she elevated her feet in the air , clapped her heels together repeatedly , in an ecstasy .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 8]: `` Come through , come through ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 6]: said her husband , crossly .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 8]: `` What you been up to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 4]: `` Me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 13]: she cried , dropping her feet and swinging around to face him .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 3]: `` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 4]: It 's them !
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 4]: Those Vertreeses ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 5]: She wiped her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 10]: `` They 've had to sell their piano ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 8]: `` Well , what of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 17]: `` That Mrs. Kittersby told me all about 'em a week ago , '' said Sibyl .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 48]: `` They 've been hard up for a long time , and she says as long ago as last winter she knew that girl got a pair of walking-shoes re-soled and patched , because she got it done the same place Mrs. Kittersby 's cook had HERS !
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 14]: And the night of the house-warming I kind of got suspicious , myself .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 27]: She did n't have one single piece of any kind of real jewelry , and you could see her dress was an old one done over .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 27]: Men ca n't tell those things , and you all made a big fuss over her , but I thought she looked a sight , myself !
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 19]: Of course , EDITH was crazy to have her , and -- '' `` Well , well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 5]: he urged , impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 8]: `` Well , I 'm TELLING you !
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 10]: Mrs. Kittersby says they have n't got a THING !
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 13]: Just absolutely NOTHING -- and they do n't know anywhere to turn !
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 27]: The family 's all died out but them , and all the relatives they got are very distant , and live East and scarcely know 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 14]: She says the whole town 's been wondering what WOULD become of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 39]: The girl had plenty chances to marry up to a year or so ago , but she was so indifferent she scared the men off , and the ones that had wanted to went and married other girls .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 2]: Gracious !
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 4]: they were lucky !
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 3]: Marry HER ?
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 20]: The man that found himself tied up to THAT girl -- '' `` Terrible funny , terrible funny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 6]: said Roscoe , with sarcasm .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 21]: `` It 's so funny I broke a cut-glass decanter and spilled a quart of -- '' `` Wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 3]: she begged .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 5]: `` You 'll see .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 30]: I was sitting by the window a little while ago , and I saw a big wagon drive up across the street and some men go into the house .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 33]: It was too dark to make out much , and for a minute I got the idea they were moving out -- the house has been foreclosed on , Mrs. Kittersby says .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 17]: It seemed funny , too , because I knew that girl was out riding with Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 19]: Well , I thought I 'd see , so I slipped over -- and it was their PIANO !
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 21]: They 'd sold it and were trying to sneak it out after dark , so nobody 'd catch on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 21]: Again she gave way to her enjoyment , but resumed , as her husband seemed about to interrupt the narrative .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 9]: `` Wait a minute , ca n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 13]: The old lady was superintending , and she gave it all away .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 32]: I sized her up for one of those old churchy people that tell all kinds of lies except when it comes to so many words , and then they ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 9]: She might just as well told me outright !
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 18]: Yes , they 'd sold it ; and I hope they 'll pay some of their debts .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 20]: They owe everybody , and last week a coal-dealer made an awful fuss at the door with Mr. Vertrees .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 23]: Their cook told our upstairs girl , and she said she did n't know WHEN she 'd seen any money , herself !
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 16]: Did you ever hear of such a case as that girl in your LIFE ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 4]: `` What girl ?
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 4]: Their cook ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 5]: `` That Vertrees girl !
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 18]: Do n't you see they looked on our coming up into this neighborhood as their last chance ?
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 19]: They were just going down and out , and here bobs up the green , rich Sheridan family !
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 30]: So they doll the girl up in her old things , made over , and send her out to get a Sheridan -- she 's GOT to get one !
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 16]: And she just goes in blind ; and she tries it on first with YOU .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 40]: You remember , she just plain TOLD you she was going to mash you , and then she found out you were the married one , and turned right square around to Jim and carried him off his feet .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 13]: Oh , Jim was landed -- there 's no doubt about THAT !
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 23]: But Jim was lucky ; he did n't live to STAY landed , and it 's a good thing for him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 13]: Sibyl 's mirth had vanished , and she spoke with virulent rapidity .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 25]: `` Well , she could n't get you , because you were married , and she could n't get Jim , because Jim died .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 8]: And there they were , dead broke !
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 7]: Do you know what she did ?
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 9]: Do you know what she 's DOING ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 13]: `` No , I do n't , '' said Roscoe , gruffly .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 13]: Sibyl 's voice rose and culminated in a scream of renewed hilarity .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 3]: `` BIBBS !
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 16]: She waited in the grave-yard , and drove home with him from JIM 'S FUNERAL !
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 6]: Never spoke to him before !
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 6]: Jim was n't COLD ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 10]: She rocked herself back and forth upon the divan .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 4]: `` Bibbs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 3]: she shrieked .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 3]: `` Bibbs !
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 6]: Roscoe , THINK of it !
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 3]: BIBBS ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 13]: He stared unsympathetically , but her mirth was unabated for all that .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 26]: `` And yesterday , '' she continued , between paroxysms -- `` yesterday she came out of the house -- just as he was passing .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 22]: She must have been looking out -- waiting for the chance ; I saw the old lady watching at the window !
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 22]: And she got him there last night -- to ` PLAY ' to him ; the old lady gave that away !
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 12]: And to-day she made him take her out in a machine !
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 34]: And the cream of it is that they did n't even know whether he was INSANE or not -- they thought maybe he was , but she went after him just the same !
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 12]: The old lady set herself to pump me about it to-day .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 2]: BIBBS !
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 5]: Oh , my Lord !
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 3]: BIBBS ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 5]: But Roscoe looked grim .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 11]: `` So it 's funny to you , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 8]: It sounds kind of pitiful to me .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 12]: I should think it would to a woman , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 12]: `` Oh , it might , '' she returned , sobering .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 14]: `` It might , if those people were n't such frozen-faced smart Alecks .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 48]: If they 'd had the decency to come down off the perch a little I probably would n't think it was funny , but to see 'em sit up on their pedestal all the time they 're eating dirt -- well , I think it 's funny !
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 50]: That girl sits up as if she was Queen Elizabeth , and expects people to wallow on the ground before her until they get near enough for her to give 'em a good kick with her old patched shoes -- oh , she 'd do THAT , all right !
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 16]: -- and then she powders up and goes out to mash -- BIBBS SHERIDAN ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 22]: `` Look here , '' said Roscoe , heavily ; `` I do n't care about that one way or another .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 16]: If you 're through , I got something I want to talk to you about .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 15]: I was going to , that day just before we heard about Jim . ''
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 12]: At this Sibyl stiffened quickly ; her eyes became intensely bright .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 46]: `` Well , '' he began , frowning , `` what I was going to say then -- '' He broke off , and , becoming conscious that he was still holding the wet napkin in his hand , threw it pettishly into a corner .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 34]: `` I never expected I 'd have to say anything like this to anybody I MARRIED ; but I was going to ask you what was the matter between you and Lamhorn . ''
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 6]: Sibyl uttered a sharp monosyllable .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 19]: `` I felt the time had come for me to know about it , '' he went on .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 19]: `` You never told me anything -- '' `` You never asked , '' she interposed , curtly .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 18]: `` Well , we 'd got in a way of not talking much , '' said Roscoe .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 26]: `` It looks to me now as if we 'd pretty much lost the run of each other the way a good many people do .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 10]: I do n't say it was n't my fault .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 45]: I was up early and down to work all day , and I 'd come home tired at night , and want to go to bed soon as I 'd got the paper read -- unless there was some good musical show in town .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 24]: Well , you seemed all right until here lately , the last month or so , I began to see something was wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 8]: I could n't help seeing it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 4]: `` Wrong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 5]: `` What like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 11]: `` You changed ; you did n't look the same .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 19]: You were all strung up and excited and fidgety ; you got to looking peakid and run down .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 49]: Now then , Lamhorn had been going with us a good while , but I noticed that not long ago you got to picking on him about every little thing he did ; you got to quarreling with him when I was there and when I was n't .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 17]: I could see you 'd been quarreling whenever I came in and he was here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 8]: `` Do you object to that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 6]: asked Sibyl , breathing quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 12]: `` Yes -- when it injures my wife 's health ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 13]: he returned , with a quick lift of his eyes to hers .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 18]: `` You began to run down just about the time you began falling out with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 6]: He stepped close to her .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 16]: `` See here , Sibyl , I 'm going to know what it means . ''
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 7]: `` Oh , you ARE ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 3]: she snapped .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 11]: `` You 're trembling , '' he said , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 14]: I 'm angry enough to do more than tremble , you 'll find .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 4]: Go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 17]: `` That was all I was going to say the other day , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 24]: `` I was going to ask you -- '' `` Yes , that was all you were going to say THE OTHER DAY .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 9]: What else have you to say to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 33]: `` To-night , '' he replied , with grim swiftness , `` I want to know why you keep telephoning him you want to see him since he stopped coming here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 26]: She made a long , low sound of comprehension before she said , `` And what else did Edith want you to ask me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 20]: `` I want to know what you say over the telephone to Lamhorn , '' he said , fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 11]: `` Is that all Edith told you to ask me ?
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 19]: You saw her when you stopped in there on your way home this evening , did n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 17]: Did n't she tell you then what I said over the telephone to Mr. Lamhorn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 8]: `` No , she did n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 8]: he vociferated , his voice growing louder .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 30]: `` She said , ` You tell your wife to stop telephoning Robert Lamhorn to come and see her , because he is n't going to do it ! '
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 6]: That 's what she said !
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 9]: And I want to know what it means .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 15]: I intend -- '' A maid appeared at the lower end of the hall .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 24]: `` Dinner is ready , '' she said , and , giving the troubled pair one glance , went demurely into the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 5]: Roscoe disregarded the interruption .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 16]: `` I intend to know exactly what has been going on , '' he declared .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 24]: `` I mean to know just what -- '' Sibyl jumped up , almost touching him , standing face to face with him .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 7]: `` Oh , you DO ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 5]: she cried , shrilly .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 13]: `` You mean to know just what 's what , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 30]: You listen to your sister insinuating ugly things about your wife , and then you come home making a scene before the servants and humiliating me in their presence !
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 14]: Do you suppose that Irish girl did n't hear every word you said ?
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 10]: You go in there and eat your dinner alone !
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 3]: Go on !
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 16]: Go and eat your dinner alone -- because I wo n't eat with you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 23]: And she broke away from the detaining grasp he sought to fasten upon her , and dashed up the stairway , panting .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 21]: He heard the door of her room slam overhead , and the sharp click of the key in the lock .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 43]: CHAPTER XVIII At seven o'clock on the last morning of that month , Sheridan , passing through the upper hall on his way to descend the stairs for breakfast , found a couple of scribbled sheets of note-paper lying on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 28]: A window had been open in Bibbs 's room the evening before ; he had left his note-book on the sill -- and the sheets were loose .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 29]: The door was open , and when Bibbs came in and closed it , he did not notice that the two sheets had blown out into the hall .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 37]: Sheridan recognized the handwriting and put the sheets in his coat pocket , intending to give them to George or Jackson for return to the owner , but he forgot and carried them down-town with him .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 32]: At noon he found himself alone in his office , and , having a little leisure , remembered the bits of manuscript , took them out , and glanced at them .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 12]: A glance was enough to reveal that they were not epistolary .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 46]: Sheridan would not have read a `` private letter '' that came into his possession in that way , though in a `` matter of business '' he might have felt it his duty to take advantage of an opportunity afforded in any manner whatsoever .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 38]: Having satisfied himself that Bibbs 's scribblings were only a sample of the kind of writing his son preferred to the machine-shop , he decided , innocently enough , that he would be justified in reading them .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 74]: It appears that a lady will nod pleasantly upon some windy generalization of a companion , and will wear the most agreeable expression of accepting it as the law , and then -- days afterward , when the thing is a mummy to its promulgator -- she will inquire out of a clear sky : `` WHY did you say that the people down-town have nothing in life that a chicken has n't ?
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 6]: What did you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 29]: And she may say it in a manner that makes a sensible reply very difficult -- you will be so full of wonder that she remembered so seriously .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 8]: Yet , what does the rooster lack ?
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 25]: He has food and shelter ; he is warm in winter ; his wives raise not one fine family for him , but dozens .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 25]: He has a clear sky over him ; he breathes sweet air ; he walks in his April orchard under a roof of flowers .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 10]: He must die , violently perhaps , but quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 8]: Is Midas 's cancer a better way ?
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 9]: The rooster 's wives and children must die .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 6]: Are those of Midas immortal ?
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 27]: His life is shorter than the life of Midas , but Midas 's life is only a sixth as long as that of the Galapagos tortoise .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 27]: The worthy money-worker takes his vacation so that he may refresh himself anew for the hard work of getting nothing that the rooster does n't get .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 14]: The office-building has an elevator , the rooster flies up to the bough .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 18]: Midas has a machine to take him to his work ; the rooster finds his worm underfoot .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 47]: The `` business man '' feels a pressure sometimes , without knowing why , and sits late at wine after the day 's labor ; next morning he curses his head because it interferes with the work -- he swears never to relieve that pressure again .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 16]: The rooster has no pressure and no wine ; this difference is in his favor .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 15]: The rooster is a dependent ; he depends upon the farmer and the weather .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 14]: Midas is a dependent ; he depends upon the farmer and the weather .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 13]: The rooster thinks only of the moment ; Midas provides for to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 7]: What does he provide for to-morrow ?
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 10]: Nothing that the rooster will not have without providing .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 29]: The rooster and the prosperous worker : they are born , they grub , they love ; they grub and love grubbing ; they grub and they die .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 8]: Neither knows beauty ; neither knows knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 24]: And after all , when Midas dies and the rooster dies , there is one thing Midas has had and rooster has not .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 25]: Midas has had the excitement of accumulating what he has grubbed , and that has been his life and his love and his god .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 12]: He can not take that god with him when he dies .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 14]: I wonder if the worthy gods are those we can take with us .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 31]: Midas must teach all to be as Midas ; the young must be raised in his religion -- The manuscript ended there , and Sheridan was not anxious for more .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 57]: He crumpled the sheets into a ball , depositing it -LRB- with vigor -RRB- in a waste-basket beside him ; then , rising , he consulted a Cyclopedia of Names , which a book-agent had somehow sold to him years before ; a volume now first put to use for the location of `` Midas . ''
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 20]: Having read the legend , Sheridan walked up and down the spacious office , exhaling the breath of contempt .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 6]: `` Dam ' fool ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 3]: he mumbled .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 30]: But this was no new thought , nor was the contrariness of Bibbs 's notes a surpise to him ; and presently he dismissed the matter from his mind .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 15]: He felt very lonely , and this was , daily , his hardest hour .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 12]: For a long time he and Jim had lunched together habitually .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 42]: Roscoe preferred a club luncheon , but Jim and his father almost always went to a small restaurant near the Sheridan Building , where they spent twenty minutes in the consumption of food , and twenty in talk , with cigars .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 27]: Jim came for his father every day , at five minutes after twelve , and Sheridan was again in his office at five minutes before one .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 41]: But now that Jim no longer came , Sheridan remained alone in his office ; he had not gone out to lunch since Jim 's death , nor did he have anything sent to him -- he fasted until evening .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 26]: It was the time he missed Jim personally the most -- the voice and eyes and handshake , all brisk and alert , all business-like .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 20]: But these things were not the keenest in Sheridan 's grief ; his sense of loss went far deeper .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 31]: Roscoe was dependable , a steady old wheel-horse , and that was a great comfort ; but it was in Jim that Sheridan had most happily perceived his own likeness .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 21]: Jim was the one who would have been surest to keep the great property growing greater , year by year .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 18]: Sheridan had fallen asleep , night after night , picturing what the growth would be under Jim .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 19]: He had believed that Jim was absolutely certain to be one of the biggest men in the country .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 10]: Well , it was all up to Roscoe now !
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 14]: That reminded him of a question he had in mind to ask Roscoe .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 32]: It was a question Sheridan considered of no present importance , but his wife had suggested it -- though vaguely -- and he had meant to speak to Roscoe about it .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 30]: However , Roscoe had not come into his father 's office for several days , and when Sheridan had seen his son at home there had been no opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 34]: He waited until the greater part of his day 's work was over , toward four o'clock , and then went down to Roscoe 's office , which was on a lower floor .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 53]: He found several men waiting for business interviews in an outer room of the series Roscoe occupied ; and he supposed that he would find his son busy with others , and that his question would have to be postponed , but when he entered the door marked `` R. C. Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 8]: Private , '' Roscoe was there alone .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 28]: He was sitting with his back to the door , his feet on a window-sill , and he did not turn as his father opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 20]: `` Some pretty good men out there waitin ' to see you , my boy , '' said Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 7]: `` What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 11]: `` Nothing , '' Roscoe answered indistinctly , not moving .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 12]: `` Well , I guess that 's all right , too .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 7]: I let 'em wait sometimes myself !
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 28]: I just wanted to ask you a question , but I expect it 'll keep , if you 're workin ' something out in your mind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 34]: Roscoe made no reply ; and his father , who had turned to the door , paused with his hand on the knob , staring curiously at the motionless figure in the chair .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 14]: Usually the son seemed pleased and eager when he came to the office .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 11]: `` You 're all right , ai n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 3]: said Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 8]: `` Not sick , are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 15]: Sheridan was puzzled ; then , abruptly , he decided to ask his question .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 16]: `` I wanted to talk to you about that young Lamhorn , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 53]: `` I guess your mother thinks he 's comin ' to see Edith pretty often , and you known him longer 'n any of us , so -- '' `` I wo n't , '' said Roscoe , thickly -- `` I wo n't say a dam ' thing about him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 22]: Sheridan uttered an exclamation and walked quickly to a position near the window where he could see his son 's face .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 24]: Roscoe 's eyes were bloodshot and vacuous ; his hair was disordered , his mouth was distorted , and he was deathly pale .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 5]: The father stood aghast .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 5]: `` By George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 3]: he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 4]: `` ROSCOE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 8]: `` My name , '' said Roscoe .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 7]: `` Can ' help that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 4]: `` ROSCOE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 8]: Blank astonishment was Sheridan 's first sensation .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 24]: Probably nothing in the world could have more amazed his than to find Roscoe -- the steady old wheel-horse -- in this condition .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 9]: `` How 'd you GET this way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 12]: `` You caught cold and took too much for it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 6]: For reply Roscoe laughed hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 3]: `` Yeuh !
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 2]: Cold !
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 8]: I been drinkun all time , lately .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 7]: Firs ' you notice it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 5]: `` By George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 3]: cried Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 32]: `` I THOUGHT I 'd smelt it on you a good deal lately , but I would n't ` a ' believed you 'd take more 'n was good for you .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 2]: Boh !
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 9]: To see you like a common hog ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 13]: Roscoe chuckled and threw out his right arm in a meaningless gesture .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 4]: `` Hog ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 5]: he repeated , chuckling .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 7]: `` Yes , a hog ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 5]: said Sheridan , angrily .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 5]: `` In business hours !
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 61]: I do n't object to anybody 's takin ' a drink if you wants to , out o ' business hours ; nor , if a man keeps his work right up to the scratch , I would n't be the one to baste him if he got good an ' drunk once in two , three years , maybe .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 6]: It ai n't MY way .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 22]: I let it alone , but I never believed in forcin ' my way on a grown-up son in moral matters .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 6]: I guess I was wrong !
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 16]: You think them men out there are waitin ' to talk business with a drunkard ?
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 13]: You think you can come to your office and do business drunk ?
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 3]: By George !
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 15]: I wonder how often this has been happening and me not on to it !
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 49]: I 'll have a look over your books to-morrow , and I 'll -- '' Roscoe stumbled to his feet , laughing wildly , and stood swaying , contriving to hold himself in position by clutching the back of the heavy chair in which he had been sitting .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 6]: `` Hoo -- hoorah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 4]: he cried . ''
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 6]: 'S my principles , too .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 11]: Be drunkard all you want to -- outside business hours .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 11]: Don ' for Gossake le 'n' thing innerfere business hours !
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 2]: Business !
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 2]: Thassit !
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 6]: You 're right , father .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 2]: Drink !
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 2]: Die !
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 13]: L'everything go to hell , but DON ' let innerfere business ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 19]: Sheridan had seized the telephone upon Roscoe 's desk , and was calling his own office , overhead .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 3]: `` Abercrombie ?
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 26]: Come down to my son Roscoe 's suite and get rid of some gentlemen that are waitin ' there to see him in room two-fourteen .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 16]: There 's Maples and Schirmer and a couple o ' fellows on the Kinsey business .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 26]: Tell 'em something 's come up I have to go over with Roscoe , and tell 'em to come back day after to-morrow at two .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 21]: You need n't come in to let me know they 're gone ; we do n't want to be disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 16]: Tell Pauly to call my house and send Claus down here with a closed car .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 7]: We may have to go out .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 20]: Tell him to hustle , and call me at Roscoe 's room as soon as the car gets here .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 6]: ` T 's all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 8]: Roscoe had laughed bitterly throughout this monologue .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 6]: `` Drunk in business hours !
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 5]: Thass awf ` l !
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 6]: Mus 'n' do such thing !
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 20]: Mus 'n' get drunk , mus 'n' gamble , mus 'n' kill ` nybody -- not in business hours !
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 6]: All right any other time .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 16]: Kill ` nybody you want to -- 's long ` tai n't in business hours !
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 2]: Fine !
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 11]: Mus 'n' have any trouble ` t 'll innerfere business .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 7]: Keep your trouble ' t home .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 9]: Don ' bring it to th ' office .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 4]: Might innerfere business !
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 9]: Have funerals on Sunday -- might innerfere business !
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 8]: Don ' let your wife innerfere business !
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 28]: Keep all , all , ALL your trouble an ' your meanness , an ' your trad -- your tradegy -- keep 'em ALL for home use !
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 20]: If you got die , go on die ' t home -- don ' die round th ' office !
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 5]: Might innerfere business ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 24]: Sheridan picked up a newspaper from Roscoe 's desk , and sat down with his back to his son , affecting to read .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 12]: Roscoe seemed to be unaware of his father 's significant posture .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 9]: `` You know wh ' I think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 4]: he went on .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 16]: `` I think Bibbs only one the fam ` ly any ` telligence at all .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 11]: Won ' work , an ' di 'n' get married .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 9]: Jim worked , an ' he got killed .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 9]: I worked , an ' I got married .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 4]: Look at me !
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 10]: Jus ' look at me , I ask you .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 7]: Fine ` dustriss young business man .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 7]: Look whass happen ' to me !
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 3]: Fine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 52]: He lifted his hand from the sustaining chair in a deplorable gesture , and , immediately losing his balance , fell across the chair and caromed to the floor with a crash , remaining prostrate for several minutes , during which Sheridan did not relax his apparent attention to the newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 14]: He did not even look round at the sound of Roscoe 's fall .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 17]: Roscoe slowly climbed to an upright position , pulling himself up by holding to the chair .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 20]: He was slightly sobered outwardly , having progressed in the prostrate interval to a state of befuddlement less volatile .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 13]: He rubbed his dazed eyes with the back of his left hand .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 11]: `` What -- what you ask me while ago ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 5]: `` Nothin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 6]: `` Yes , you did .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 7]: What -- what was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 4]: `` Nothin ' .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 6]: You better sit down . ''
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 11]: `` You ask ' me what I thought about Lamhorn .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 6]: You did ask me that .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 8]: Well , I wo n't tell you .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 12]: I wo n't say dam ' word ` bout him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 4]: The telephone-bell tinkled .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 15]: Sheridan placed the receiver to his ear and said , `` Right down . ''
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 18]: Then he got Roscoe 's coat and hat from a closet and brought them to his son .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 10]: `` Get into this coat , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 8]: `` You 're goin ' home . ''
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 11]: `` All ri ' , '' Roscoe murmured , obediently .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 47]: They went out into the main hall by a side door , not passing through the outer office ; and Sheridan waited for an empty elevator , stopped it , and told the operator to take on no more passengers until they reached the ground floor .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 41]: Roscoe walked out of the building and got into the automobile without lurching , and twenty minutes later walked into his own house in the same manner , neither he nor his father having spoken a word in the interval .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 24]: Sheridan did not go in with him ; he went home , and to his own room without meeting any of his family .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 32]: But as he passed Bibbs 's door he heard from within the sound of a cheerful young voice humming jubilant fragments of song : WHO looks a mustang in the eye ?
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 14]: ... With a leap from the ground To the saddle in a bound .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 6]: And away -- and away !
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 2]: Hi-yay !
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 46]: It was the first time in Sheridan 's life that he had ever detected any musical symptom whatever in Bibbs -- he had never even heard him whistle -- and it seemed the last touch of irony that the useless fool should be merry to-day .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 35]: To Sheridan it was Tom o ' Bedlam singing while the house burned ; and he did not tarry to enjoy the melody , but went into his own room and locked the door .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 52]: CHAPTER XIX He emerged only upon a second summons to dinner , two hours later , and came to the table so white and silent that his wife made her anxiety manifest and was but partially reassured by his explanation that his lunch had `` disagreed '' with him a little .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 8]: Presently , however , he spoke effectively .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 22]: Bibbs , whose appetite had become hearty , was helping himself to a second breast of capon from white-jacket 's salver .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 16]: `` Here 's another difference between Midas and chicken , '' Sheridan remarked , grimly .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 13]: `` Midas can eat rooster , but rooster ca n't eat Midas .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 6]: I reckon you overlooked that .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 12]: Midas looks to me like he had the advantage there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 30]: Bibbs retained enough presence of mind to transfer the capon breast to his plate without dropping it and to respond , `` Yes -- he crows over it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 43]: Having returned his antagonists 's fire in this fashion , he blushed -- for he could blush distinctly now -- and his mother looked upon him with pleasure , thought the reference to Midas and roosters was of course jargon to her .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 14]: `` Did you ever see anybody improve the way that child has ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 14]: `` I declare , Bibbs , sometimes lately you look right handsome ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 14]: `` He 's got to be such a gadabout , '' Edith giggled .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 22]: `` I found something of his on the floor up-stairs this morning , before anybody was up , '' said Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 28]: `` I reckon if people lose things in this house and expect to get 'em back , they better get up as soon as I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 8]: `` What was it he lost ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 3]: asked Edith .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 5]: `` He knows ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 4]: her father returned .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 14]: `` Seems to me like I forgot to bring it home with me .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 23]: I looked it over -- thought probably it was something pretty important , belongin ' to a busy man like him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 7]: He affected to search his pockets .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 10]: `` What DID I do with it , now ?
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 3]: Oh yes !
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 19]: Seems to me like I remember leavin ' it down at the office -- in the waste-basket . ''
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 13]: `` Good place for it , '' Bibbs murmured , still red .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 6]: Sheridan gave him a grin .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 20]: `` Perhaps pretty soon you 'll be gettin ' up early enough to find things before I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 32]: It was a threat , and Bibbs repeated the substance of it , later in the evening , to Mary Vertrees -- they had come to know each other that well .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 31]: `` My time 's here at last , '' he said , as they sat together in the melancholy gas-light of the room which had been denuded of its piano .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 56]: That removal had left an emptiness so distressing to Mr. and Mrs. Vertrees that neither of them had crossed the threshold since the dark day ; but the gas-light , though from a single jet , shed no melancholy upon Bibbs , nor could any room seem bare that knew the glowing presence of Mary .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 7]: He spoke lightly , not sadly .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 7]: `` Yes , it 's come .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 18]: I 've shirked and put off , but I ca n't shirk and put off any longer .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 18]: It 's really my part to go to him -- at least it would save my face .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 16]: He means what he says , and the time 's come to serve my sentence .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 9]: Hard labor for life , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 5]: Mary shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 7]: `` I do n't think so .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 6]: He 's too kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 9]: `` You think my father 's KIND ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 6]: And Bibbs stared at her .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 6]: I 'm sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 12]: I 've felt that he has a great , brave heart .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 24]: It 's only that he has to be kind in his own way -- because he ca n't understand any other way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 8]: `` Ah yes , '' said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 13]: `` If that 's what you mean by ` kind ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 13]: She looked at him gravely , earnest concern in her friendly eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 16]: `` It 's going to be pretty hard for you , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 6]: `` Oh -- self-pity ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 5]: he returned , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 11]: `` This has been just the last flicker of revolt .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 11]: Nobody minds work if he likes the kind of work .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 41]: There 'd be no loafers in the world if each man found the thing that he could do best ; but the only work I happen to want to do is useless -- so I have to give it up .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 8]: To-morrow I 'll be a day-laborer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 9]: `` What is it like -- exactly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 11]: `` I get up at six , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 17]: `` I have a lunch-basket to carry with me , which is aristocratic and no advantage .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 13]: The other workmen have tin buckets , and tin buckets are better .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 18]: I leave the house at six-thirty , and I 'm at work in my overalls at seven .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 17]: I have an hour off at noon , and work again from one till five . ''
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 7]: `` But the work itself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 11]: `` It was n't muscularly exhausting -- not at all .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 16]: They could n't give me a heavier job because I was n't good enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 7]: `` But what will you do ?
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 6]: I want to know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 46]: `` When I left , '' said Bibbs , `` I was ` on ' what they call over there a ` clipping-machine , ' in one of the ` by-products ' departments , and that 's what I 'll be sent back to . ''
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 7]: `` But what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 3]: she insisted .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 3]: Bibbs explained .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 9]: `` It 's very simple and very easy .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 23]: I feed long strips of zinc into a pair of steel jaws , and the jaws bite the zinc into little circles .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 32]: All I have to do is to see that the strip goes into the jaws at a certain angle -- and yet I was a very bad hand at it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 29]: He had kept his voice cheerful as he spoke , but he had grown a shade paler , and there was a latent anguish deep in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 18]: He may have known it and wished her not to see it , for he turned away .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 9]: `` You do that all day long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 14]: she asked , and as he nodded , `` It seems incredible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 15]: `` YOU feeding a strip of zinc into a machine nine hours a day !
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 39]: No wonder -- '' She broke off , and then , after a keen glance at his face , she said : `` I should think you WOULD have been a ` bad hand at it ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 4]: He laughed ruefully .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 16]: `` I think it 's the noise , though I 'm ashamed to say it .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 31]: You see , it 's a very powerful machine , and there 's a sort of rhythmical crashing -- a crash every time the jaws bite off a circle . ''
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 7]: `` How often is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 20]: `` The thing should make about sixty-eight disks a minute -- a little more than one a second . ''
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 9]: `` And you 're close to it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 22]: `` Oh , the workman has to sit in its lap , '' he said , turning to her more gaily .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 7]: `` The others do n't mind .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 10]: You see , it 's something wrong with me .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 32]: I have an idiotic way of flinching from the confounded thing -- I flinch and duck a little every time the crash comes , and I could n't get over it .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 21]: I was a treat to the other workmen in that room ; they 'll be glad to see me back .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 11]: They used to laugh at me all day long . ''
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 30]: Mary 's gaze was averted from Bibbs now ; she sat with her elbow resting on the arm of the chair , her lifted hand pressed against her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 17]: She was staring at the wall , and her eyes had a burning brightness in them .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 23]: `` It does n't seem possible any one could do that to you , '' she said , in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 5]: He 's not kind .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 37]: He ought to be proud to help you to the leisure to write books ; it should be his greatest privilege to have them published for you -- '' `` Ca n't you SEE him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 12]: Bibbs interrupted , a faint ripple of hilarity in his voice .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 41]: `` If he could understand what you 're saying -- and if you can imagine his taking such a notion , he 'd have had R. T. Bloss put up posters all over the country : ` Read B. Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 8]: Read the Poet with a Punch ! '
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 16]: It 's just as well he never got the -- But what 's the use ?
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 14]: I 've never written anything worth printing , and I never shall . ''
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 5]: `` You could ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 19]: `` That 's because you 've never seen the poor little things I 've tried to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 13]: `` You would n't let me , but I KNOW you could !
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 8]: Ah , it 's a pity ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 11]: `` It is n't , '' said BIBBS , honestly .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 19]: `` I never could -- but you 're the kindest lady in this world , Miss Vertrees . ''
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 18]: She gave him a flashing glance , and it was as kind as he said she was .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 11]: `` That sounds wrong , '' she said , impulsively .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 8]: `` I mean ` Miss Vertrees . '
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 15]: I 've thought of you by your first name ever since I met you .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 11]: Would n't you rather call me ` Mary ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 16]: Bibbs was dazzled ; he drew a long , deep breath and did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 6]: `` Would n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 9]: she asked , without a trace of coquetry .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 6]: `` If I CAN ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 8]: he said , in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 9]: `` Ah , that 's very pretty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 3]: she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 23]: `` You 're such an honest person , it 's pleasant to have you gallant sometimes , by way of variety . ''
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 6]: She became grave again immediately .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 13]: `` I hear myself laughing as if it were some one else .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 13]: It sounds like laughter on the eve of a great calamity . ''
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 17]: She got up restlessly , crossed the room and leaned against the wall , facing him .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 12]: `` You 've GOT to go back to that place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 3]: He nodded .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 19]: `` And the other time you did it -- '' `` Just over it , '' said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 4]: `` Two years .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 22]: But I do n't mind the prospect of a repetition so much as -- '' `` So much as what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 7]: she prompted , as he stopped .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 7]: Bibbs looked up at her shyly .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 20]: `` I want to say it , but -- but I come to a dead balk when I try .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 7]: I -- '' `` Go on .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 12]: Say it , whatever it is , '' she bade him .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 15]: `` You would n't know how to say anything I should n't like . ''
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 39]: `` I doubt if you 'd either like or dislike what I want to say , '' he returned , moving uncomfortably in his chair and looking at his feet -- he seemed to feel awkward , thoroughly .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 26]: `` You see , all my life -- until I met you -- if I ever felt like saying anything , I wrote it instead .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 38]: Saying things is a new trick for me , and this -- well , it 's just this : I used to feel as if I had n't ever had any sort of a life at all .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 27]: I 'd never been of use to anything or anybody , and I 'd never had anything , myself , except a kind of haphazard thinking .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 34]: But now it 's different -- I 'm still of no use to anybody , and I do n't see any prospect of being useful , but I have had something for myself .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 28]: I 've had a beautiful and happy experience , and it makes my life seem to be -- I mean I 'm glad I 've lived it !
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 28]: That 's all ; it 's your letting me be near you sometimes , as you have , this strange , beautiful , happy little while ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 30]: He did not once look up , and reached silence , at the end of what he had to say , with his eyes still awkwardly regarding his feet .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 25]: She did not speak , but a soft rustling of her garments let him know that she had gone back to her chair again .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 26]: The house was still ; the shabby old room was so quiet that the sound of a creaking in the wall seemed sharp and loud .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 15]: And yet , when Mary spoke at last , her voice was barely audible .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 27]: `` If you think it has been -- happy -- to be friends with me -- you 'd want to -- to make it last . ''
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 10]: `` Yes , '' said Bibbs , as faintly .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 21]: `` You 'd want to go on being my friend as long as we live , would n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' he gulped .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 18]: `` But you make that kind of speech to me because you think it 's over . ''
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 6]: He tried to evade her .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 25]: `` Oh , a day-laborer ca n't come in his overalls -- '' `` No , '' she interrupted , with a sudden sharpness .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 18]: `` You said what you did because you think the shop 's going to kill you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 6]: `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 9]: `` Yes , you do think that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 13]: She rose to her feet again and came and stood before him .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 15]: `` Or you think it 's going to send you back to the sanitarium .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 7]: Do n't deny it , Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 8]: See how easily I call you that !
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 14]: You see I 'm a friend , or I could n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 19]: Well , if you meant what you said -- and you did mean it , I know it !
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 12]: -- you 're not going to go back to the sanitarium .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 8]: The shop sha 'n' t hurt you .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 6]: It sha 'n' t ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 6]: And now Bibbs looked up .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 20]: She stood before him , straight and tall , splendid in generous strength , her eyes shining and wet .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 20]: `` If I mean THAT much to you , '' she cried , `` they ca n't harm you !
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 18]: Go back to the shop -- but come to me when your day 's work is done .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 27]: Let the machines crash their sixty-eight times a minute , but remember each crash that deafens you is that much nearer the evening and me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 6]: He stumbled to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 8]: `` You say -- '' he gasped .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 8]: `` Every evening , dear Bibbs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 7]: He could only stare , bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 4]: `` EVERY evening .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 4]: I want you .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 9]: They sha 'n' t hurt you again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 19]: And she held out her hand to him ; it was strong and warm in his tremulous clasp .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 24]: `` If I could , I 'd go and feed the strips of zinc to the machine with you , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 13]: `` But all day long I 'll send my thoughts to you .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 11]: You must keep remembering that your friend stands beside you .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 18]: And when the work is done -- wo n't the night make up for the day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 16]: Light seemed to glow from her ; he was blinded by that radiance of kindness .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 51]: But all he could say was , huskily , `` To think you 're there -- with me -- standing beside the old zinc-eater -- '' And they laughed and looked at each other , and at last Bibbs found what it meant not to be alone in the world .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 5]: He had a friend .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 26]: CHAPTER XX When he came into the New House , a few minutes later , he found his father sitting alone by the library fire .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 8]: Bibbs went in and stood before him .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 11]: `` I 'm cured , father , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 10]: `` When do I go back to the shop ?
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 5]: I 'm ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 10]: The desolate and grim old man did not relax .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 18]: `` I was sittin ' up to give you a last chance to say something like that .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 7]: I reckon it 's about time !
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 23]: I just wanted to see if you 'd have manhood enough not to make me take you over there by the collar .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 16]: Last night I made up my mind I 'd give you just one more day .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 17]: Well , you got to it before I did -- pretty close to the eleventh hour !
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 3]: All right .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 4]: Start in to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 9]: It 's the first o ' the month .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 9]: Think you can get up in time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 10]: `` Six o'clock , '' Bibbs responded , briskly .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 18]: `` And I want to tell you -- I 'm going in a ` cheerful spirit . '
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 16]: As you said , I 'll go and I 'll ` like it ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 7]: `` That 's YOUR lookout ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 4]: his father grunted .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 13]: `` They 'll put you back on the clippin ' - machine .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 8]: You get nine dollars a week . ''
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 15]: `` More than I 'm worth , too , '' said Bibbs , cheerily .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 22]: `` That reminds me , I did n't mean YOU by ` Midas ' in that nonsense I 'd been writing .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 19]: I meant -- '' `` Makes a hell of a lot o ' difference what you meant ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 8]: `` I just wanted you to know .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 6]: Good night , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 4]: `` G'night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 20]: The sound of the young man 's footsteps ascending the stairs became inaudible , and the house was quiet .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 64]: But presently , as Sheridan sat staring angrily at the fire , the shuffling of a pair of slippers could be heard descending , and Mrs. Sheridan made her appearance , her oblique expression and the state of her toilette being those of a person who , after trying unsuccessfully to sleep on one side , has got up to look for burglars .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 4]: `` Papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 5]: she exclaimed , drowsily .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 9]: `` Why 'n' t you go to bed ?
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 11]: It must be goin ' on ` leven o'clock ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 17]: She yawned , and seated herself near him , stretching out her hands to the fire .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 7]: `` What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 15]: she asked , sleep and anxiety striving sluggishly with each other in her voice .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 9]: `` I knew you were worried all dinner-time .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 18]: You got something new on your mind besides Jim 's bein ' taken away like he was .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 10]: What 's worryin ' you now , papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 5]: `` Nothin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 4]: She jeered feebly .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 7]: `` N ' tell ME that !
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 12]: You sat up to see Bibbs , did n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 15]: `` He starts in at the shop again to-morrow morning , '' said Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 10]: `` Just the same as he did before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 5]: `` Just pre-CISELY ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 17]: `` How -- how long you goin ' to keep him at it , papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 5]: she asked , timidly .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 7]: `` Until he KNOWS something ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 28]: The unhappy man struck his palms together , then got to his feet and began to pace the room , as was his wont when he talked .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 35]: `` He 'll go back to the machine he could n't learn to tend properly in the six months he was there , and he 'll stick to it till he DOES learn it !
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 16]: Do you suppose that lummix ever asked himself WHY I want him to learn it ?
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 12]: And I ai n't a-goin ' to tell him , either !
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 21]: When he went there I had 'em set him on the simplest machine we got -- and he stuck there !
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 26]: How much prospect would there be of his learnin ' to run the whole business if he ca n't run the easiest machine in it ?
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 9]: I sent him there to make him THOROUGH .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 4]: And what happened ?
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 6]: He did n't LIKE it !
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 27]: That boy 's whole life , there 's been a settin ' up o ' something mulish that 's against everything I want him to do .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 19]: I do n't know what it is , but it 's got to be worked out of him .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 19]: Now , labor ai n't any more a simple question than what it was when we were young .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 29]: My idea is that , outside o ' union troubles , the man that can manage workin ' - men is the man that 's been one himself .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 26]: Well , I set Bibbs to learn the men and to learn the business , and HE set himself to balk on the first job !
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 17]: That 's what he did , and the balk 's lasted close on to three years .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 11]: If he balks again I 'm just done with him !
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 15]: Sometimes I feel like I was pretty near done with everything , anyhow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 18]: `` I knew there was something else , '' said Mrs. Sheridan , blinking over a yawn .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 22]: `` You better let it go till to-morrow and get to bed now -- ` less you 'll tell me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 11]: `` Suppose something happened to Roscoe , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 11]: `` THEN what 'd I have to look forward to ?
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 11]: THEN what could I depend on to hold things together ?
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 3]: A lummix !
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 19]: A lummix that has n't learned how to push a strip o ' zinc along a groove ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 4]: `` Roscoe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 3]: she yawned .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 10]: `` You need n't worry about Roscoe , papa .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 8]: He 's the strongest child we had .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 12]: I never did know anybody keep better health than he does .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 14]: I do n't believe he 's even had a cold in five years .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 10]: You better go up to bed , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 10]: `` Suppose something DID happen to him , though .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 32]: You do n't know what it means , keepin ' property together these days -- just keepin ' it ALIVE , let alone makin ' it grow the way I do .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 15]: I 've seen too many estates hacked away in chunks , big and little .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 55]: I tell you when a man dies the wolves come out o ' the woods , pack after pack , to see what they can tear off for themselves ; and if that dead man 's chuldern ai n't on the job , night and day , everything he built 'll get carried off .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 3]: Carried off ?
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 27]: I 've seen a big fortune behave like an ash-barrel in a cyclone -- there was n't even a dust-heap left to tell where it stood !
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 9]: I 've seen it , time and again .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 3]: My Lord !
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 12]: when I think o ' such things comin ' to ME !
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 23]: It do n't seem like I deserved it -- no man ever tried harder to raise his boys right than I have .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 32]: I planned and planned and planned how to bring 'em up to be guards to drive the wolves off , and how to be builders to build , and build bigger .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 27]: I tell you this business life is no fool 's job nowadays -- a man 's got to have eyes in the back of his head .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 33]: You hear talk , sometimes , 'd make you think the millennium had come -- but right the next breath you 'll hear somebody hollerin ' about ` the great unrest . '
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 10]: You BET there 's a ` great unrest ' !
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 46]: There ai n't any man alive smart enough to see what it 's goin ' to do to us in the end , nor what day it 's got set to bust loose , but it 's frothin ' and bubblin ' in the boiler .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 32]: This country 's been fillin ' up with it from all over the world for a good many years , and the old camp-meetin ' days are dead and done with .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 9]: Church ai n't what it used to be .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 30]: Nothin 's what it used to be -- everything 's turned up from the bottom , and the growth is so big the roots stick out in the air .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 31]: There 's an awful ruction goin ' on , and you got to keep hoppin ' if you 're goin ' to keep your balance on the top of it .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 4]: And the schemers !
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 22]: They run like bugs on the bottom of a board -- after any piece o ' money they hear is loose .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 16]: Fool schemes and crooked schemes ; the fool ones are the most and the worst !
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 14]: You got to FIGHT to keep your money after you 've made it .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 30]: And the woods are full o ' mighty industrious men that 's got only one motto : ` Get the other fellow 's money before he gets yours ! '
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 51]: And when a man 's built as I have , when he 's built good and strong , and made good things grow and prosper -- THOSE are the fellows that lay for the chance to slide in and sneak the benefit of it and put their names to it !
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 25]: And what 's the use of my havin ' ever been born , if such a thing as that is goin ' to happen ?
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 37]: What 's the use of my havin ' worked my life and soul into my business , if it 's all goin ' to be dispersed and scattered soon as I 'm in the ground ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 22]: He strode up and down the long room , gesticulating -- little regarding the troubled and drowsy figure by the fireside .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 12]: His throat rumbled thunderously ; the words came with stormy bitterness .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 19]: `` You think this is a time for young men to be lyin ' on beds of ease ?
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 17]: I tell you there never was such a time before ; there never was such opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 13]: The sluggard is despoiled while he sleeps -- yes , by George !
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 13]: if a man lays down they 'll eat him before he wakes !
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 15]: -- but the live man can build straight up till he touches the sky !
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 27]: This is the business man 's day ; it used to be the soldier 's day and the statesman 's day , but this is OURS !
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 15]: And it ai n't a Sunday to go fishin ' -- it 's turmoil !
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 2]: turmoil !
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 35]: -- and you got to go out and live it and breathe it and MAKE it yourself , or you 'll only be a dead man walkin ' around dreamin ' you 're alive .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 32]: And that 's what my son Bibbs has been doin ' all his life , and what he 'd rather do now than go out and do his part by me .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 32]: And if anything happens to Roscoe -- '' `` Oh , do stop worryin ' over such nonsense , '' Mrs. Sheridan interrupted , irritated into sharp wakefulness for the moment .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 23]: `` There is n't anything goin ' to happen to Roscoe , and you 're just tormentin ' yourself about nothin ' .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 10]: Are n't you EVER goin ' to bed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 3]: Sheridan halted .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 15]: `` All right , mamma , '' he said , with a vast sigh .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 7]: `` Let 's go up . ''
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 17]: And he snapped off the electric light , leaving only the rosy glow of the fire .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 8]: `` Did you speak to Roscoe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 9]: she yawned , rising lopsidedly in her drowsiness .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 14]: `` Did you mention about what I told you the other evening ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 5]: I will to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 26]: But Roscoe did not come down-town the next day , nor the next ; nor did Sheridan see fit to enter his son 's house .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 3]: He waited .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 30]: Then , on the fourth day of the month , Roscoe walked into his father 's office at nine in the morning , when Sheridan happened to be alone .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 16]: `` They told me down-stairs you 'd left word you wanted to see me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 10]: `` Sit down , '' said Sheridan , rising .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 3]: Roscoe sat .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 18]: His father walked close to him , sniffed suspiciously , and then walked away , smiling bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 4]: `` Boh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 6]: `` Still at it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' said Roscoe .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 11]: `` I 've had a couple of drinks this morning .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 5]: What about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 16]: `` I reckon I better adopt some decent young man , '' his father returned .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 18]: `` I 'd bring Bibbs up here and put him in your place if he was fit .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 4]: I would ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 11]: `` Better do it , '' Roscoe assented , sullenly .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 9]: `` When 'd you begin this thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 8]: `` I always did drink a little .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 10]: Ever since I grew up , that is . ''
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 6]: `` Leave that talk out !
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 7]: You know what I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 23]: `` Well , I do n't know as I ever had too much in office hours -- until the other day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 4]: Sheridan began cutting .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 6]: `` It 's a lie .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 10]: I 've had Ray Wills up from your office .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 22]: He did n't want to give you away , but I put the hooks into him , and he came through .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 10]: You were drunk twice before and could n't work .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 17]: You been leavin ' your office for drinks every few hours for the last three weeks .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 6]: I been over your books .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 6]: Your office is way behind .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 15]: You have n't done any work , to count , in a month . ''
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 13]: `` All right , '' said Roscoe , drooping under the torture .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 7]: `` It 's all true . ''
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 11]: `` What you goin ' to do about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 9]: Roscoe 's head was sunk between his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 19]: `` I ca n't stand very much talk about it , father , '' he said , pleadingly .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 3]: Sheridan cried .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 5]: `` Neither can I !
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 10]: What do you think it means to ME ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 12]: He dropped into the chair at his big desk , groaning .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 43]: `` I ca n't stand to talk about it any more 'n you can to listen , but I 'm goin ' to find out what 's the matter with you , and I 'm goin ' to straighten you out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 6]: Roscoe shook his head helplessly .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 9]: `` You ca n't straighten me out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 5]: `` See here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 3]: said Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 55]: `` Can you go back to your office and stay sober to-day , while I get my work done , or will I have to hire a couple o ' huskies to follow you around and knock the whiskey out o ' your hand if they see you tryin ' to take it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 19]: `` You need n't worry about that , '' said Roscoe , looking up with a faint resentment .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 13]: `` I 'm not drinking because I 've got a thirst . ''
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 9]: `` Well , what have you got ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 3]: `` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 7]: Nothing you can do anything about .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 7]: Nothing , I tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 8]: `` We 'll see about that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 5]: said Sheridan , harshly .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 27]: `` Now I ca n't fool with you to-day , and you get up out o ' that chair and get out o ' my office .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 8]: You bring your wife to dinner to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 12]: You did n't come last Sunday -- but you come to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 19]: I 'll talk this out with you when the women-folks are workin ' the phonograph , after dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 7]: Can you keep sober till then ?
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 28]: You better be sure , because I 'm going to send Abercrombie down to your office every little while , and he 'll let me know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 6]: Roscoe paused at the door .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 8]: `` You told Abercrombie about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 5]: `` TOLD him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 5]: And Sheridan laughed hideously .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 22]: `` Do you suppose there 's an elevator-boy in the whole dam ' building that ai n't on to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 12]: Roscoe settled his hat down over his eyes and went out .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 11]: CHAPTER XXI `` WHO looks a mustang in the eye ?
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 6]: Changety , chang , chang !
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 2]: Bash !
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 2]: Crash !
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 3]: BANG ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 19]: So sang Bibbs , his musical gaieties inaudible to his fellow-workmen because of the noise of the machinery .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 70]: He had discovered long ago that the uproar was rhythmical , and it had been intolerable ; but now , on the afternoon of the fourth day of his return , he was accompanying the swing and clash of the metals with jubilant vaquero fragments , mingling improvisations of his own among them , and mocking the zinc-eater 's crash with vocal imitations : Fearless and bold , Chang !
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 2]: Bash !
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 2]: Behold !
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 19]: With a leap from the ground To the saddle in a bound , And away -- and away !
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 2]: Hi-YAY !
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 13]: WHO looks a chang , chang , bash , crash , bang !
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 11]: WHO cares a dash how you bash and you crash ?
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 12]: NIGHT 'S on the way EACH time I say , Hi-YAY !
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 4]: Crash , chang !
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 4]: Bash , chang !
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 6]: Chang , bang , BANG !
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 41]: The long room was ceaselessly thundering with metallic sound ; the air was thick with the smell of oil ; the floor trembled perpetually ; everything was implacably in motion -- nowhere was there a rest for the dizzied eye .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 27]: The first time he had entered the place Bibbs had become dizzy instantly , and six months of it had only added increasing nausea to faintness .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 6]: But he felt neither now .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 12]: `` ALL DAY LONG I 'LL SEND MY THOUGHTS TO YOU .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 12]: YOU MUST KEEP REMEMBERING THAT YOUR FRIEND STANDS BESIDE YOU . ''
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 18]: He saw her there beside him , and the greasy , roaring place became suffused with radiance .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 15]: The poet was happy in his machine-shop ; he was still a poet there .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 15]: And he fed his old zinc-eater , and sang : Away -- and away !
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 2]: Hi-YAY !
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 10]: Crash , bash , crash , bash , CHANG !
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 9]: Wild are his eyes , Fiercely he dies !
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 2]: Hi-YAH !
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 6]: Crash , bash , bang !
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 4]: Bash , CHANG !
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 23]: Ready to fling Our gloves in the ring -- He was unaware of a sensation that passed along the lines of workmen .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 23]: Their great master had come among them , and they grinned to see him standing with Dr. Gurney behind the unconscious Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 26]: Sheridan nodded to those nearest him -- he had personal acquaintance with nearly all of them -- but he kept his attention upon his son .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 10]: Bibbs worked steadily , never turning from his machine .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 15]: Now and then he varied his musical programme with remarks addressed to the zinc-eater .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 8]: `` Go on , you old crash-basher !
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 4]: Chew it up !
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 16]: It 's good for you , if you do n't try to bolt your vittles .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 5]: Fletcherize , you pig !
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 14]: That 's right -- YOU 'LL never get a lump in your gizzard .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 4]: Want some more ?
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 9]: Here 's a nice , shiny one . ''
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 24]: The words were indistinguishable , but Sheridan inclined his head to Gurney 's ear and shouted fiercely : `` Talkin ' to himself !
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 4]: By George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 9]: Gurney laughed reassuringly , and shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 7]: Bibbs returned to song : Chang !
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 6]: Chang , bash , chang !
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 4]: It 's I !
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 8]: WHO looks a mustang in the eye ?
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 12]: Fearless and bo -- His father grasped him by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 4]: `` Here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 13]: `` Let ME show you how to run a strip through there .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 33]: The foreman says you 're some better 'n you used to be , but that 's no way to handle -- Get out the way and let me show you once . ''
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 15]: `` Better be careful , '' Bibbs warned him , stepping to one side .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 3]: `` Careful ?
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 3]: Boh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 10]: Sheridan seized a strip of zinc from the box .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 9]: `` What you talkin ' to yourself about ?
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 21]: Tryin ' to make yourself think you 're so abused you 're goin ' wrong in the head ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 4]: ` Abused ' ?
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 3]: No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 3]: shouted Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 12]: `` I was SINGING -- because I ` like it ' !
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 14]: I told you I 'd come back and ` like it . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 6]: Sheridan may not have understood .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 21]: At all events , he made no reply , but began to run the strip of zinc through the machine .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 10]: He did it awkwardly -- and with bad results .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 4]: `` Here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 6]: `` This is the way .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 6]: Watch how I do it .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 16]: There 's nothin ' to it , if you put your mind on it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 12]: By his own showing then his mind was not upon it .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 5]: He continued to talk .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 35]: `` All you got to look out for is to keep it pressed over to -- '' `` Do n't run your hand up with it , '' Bibbs vociferated , leaning toward him .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 5]: `` Run nothin ' !
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 10]: You GOT to -- '' `` Look out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 12]: shouted Bibbs and Gurney together , and they both sprang forward .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 27]: But Sheridan 's right hand had followed the strip too far , and the zinc-eater had bitten off the tips of the first and second fingers .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 37]: He swore vehemently , and wrung his hand , sending a shower of red drops over himself and Bibbs , but Gurney grasped his wrist , and said , sharply : `` Come out of here .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 9]: Come over to the lavatory in the office .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 6]: Bibbs , fetch my bag .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 9]: It 's in my machine , outside . ''
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 27]: And when Bibbs brought the bag to the washroom he found the doctor still grasping Sheridan 's wrist , holding the injured hand over a basin .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 10]: Sheridan had lost color , and temper , too .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 17]: He glared over his shoulder at his son as the latter handed the bag to Gurney .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 13]: `` You go on back to your work , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 13]: `` I 've had worse snips than that from a pencil-sharpener . ''
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 9]: `` Oh no , you have n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 3]: said Gurney .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 7]: `` I have , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 5]: Sheridan retorted , angrily .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 11]: `` Bibbs , you go on back to your work .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 31]: There 's no reason to stand around here watchin ' ole Doc Gurney tryin ' to keep himself awake workin ' on a scratch that only needs a little court-plaster .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 9]: I slipped , or it would n't happened .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 8]: You get back on your job . ''
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 8]: `` All right , '' said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 4]: `` HERE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 13]: Sheridan bellowed , as his son was passing out of the door .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 12]: `` You watch out when you 're runnin ' that machine !
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 6]: You hear what I say ?
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 24]: I slipped , or I would n't got scratched , but you -- YOU 'RE liable to get your whole hand cut off !
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 7]: You keep your eyes open ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 8]: And Bibbs returned to the zinc-eater thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 21]: Half an hour later , Gurney touched him on the shoulder and beckoned him outside , where conversation was possible .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 8]: `` I sent him home , Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 10]: He 'll have to be careful of that hand .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 6]: Go get your overalls off .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 14]: I 'll take you for a drive and leave you at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 8]: `` Ca n't , '' said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 13]: `` Got to stick to my job till the whistle blows . ''
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 16]: `` No , you do n't , '' the doctor returned , smothering a yawn .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 31]: `` He wants me to take you down to my office and give you an overhauling to see how much harm these four days on the machine have done you .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 21]: I guess you folks have got that old man pretty thoroughly upset , between you , up at your house !
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 10]: But I do n't need to go over you .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 25]: I can see with my eyes half shut -- '' `` Yes , '' Bibbs interrupted , `` that 's what they are . ''
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 18]: `` I say I can see you 're starting out , at least , in good shape .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 7]: What 's made the difference ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 10]: `` I like the machine , '' said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 9]: `` I 've made a friend of it .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 17]: I serenade it and talk to it , and then it talks back to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 5]: `` Indeed , indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 6]: What does it say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 8]: `` What I want to hear . ''
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 6]: `` Well , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 10]: The doctor stretched himself and stamped his foot repeatedly .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 11]: `` Better come along and take a drive with me .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 25]: You can take the time off that he allowed for the examination , and -- '' `` Not at all , '' said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 14]: `` I 'm going to stand by my old zinc-eater till five o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 8]: I tell you I LIKE it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 15]: `` Then I suppose that 's the end of your wanting to write . ''
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 28]: `` I do n't know about that , '' Bibbs said , thoughtfully ; `` but the zinc-eater does n't interfere with my thinking , at least .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 14]: It 's better than being in business ; I 'm sure of that .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 8]: I do n't want anything to change .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 21]: I 'd be content to lead just the life I 'm leading now to the end of my days . ''
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 8]: `` You do beat the devil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 3]: exclaimed Gurney .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 14]: `` Your father 's right when he tells me you 're a mystery .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 24]: Perhaps the Almighty knew what He was doing when He made you , but it takes a lot of faith to believe it !
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 6]: Well , I 'm off .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 10]: Go on back to your murdering old machine . ''
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 21]: He climbed into his car , which he operated himself , but he refrained from setting it immediately in motion .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 64]: `` Well , I rubbed it in on the old man that you had warned him not to slide his hand along too far , and that he got hurt because he did n't pay attention to your warning , and because he was trying to show you how to do something you were already doing a great deal better than he could .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 18]: You tell him I 'll be around to look at it and change the dressing to-morrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 3]: Good-by . ''
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 24]: But when he paid the promised visit , the next morning , he did more than change the dressing upon the damaged hand .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 42]: The injury was severe of its kind , and Gurney spent a long time over it , though Sheridan was rebellious and scornful , being brought to a degree of tractability only by means of horrible threats and talk of amputation .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 38]: However , he appeared at the dinner-table with his hand supported in a sling , which he seemed to regard as an indignity , while the natural inquiries upon the subject evidently struck him as deliberate insults .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 63]: Mrs. Sheridan , having been unable to contain her solicitude several times during the day , and having been checked each time in a manner that blanched her cheek , hastened to warn Roscoe and Sibyl , upon their arrival at five , to omit any reference to the injury and to avoid even looking at the sling if they possibly could .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 8]: The Sheridans dined on Sundays at five .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 43]: Sibyl had taken pains not to arrive either before or after the hand was precisely on the hour ; and the members of the family were all seated at the table within two minutes after she and Roscoe had entered the house .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 10]: It was a glum gathering , overhung with portents .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 40]: The air seemed charged , awaiting any tiny ignition to explode ; and Mrs. Sheridan 's expression , as she sat with her eyes fixed almost continually upon her husband , was that of a person engaged in prayer .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 6]: Edith was pale and intent .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 16]: Roscoe looked ill ; Sibyl looked ill ; and Sheridan looked both ill and explosive .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 24]: Bibbs had more color than any of these , and there was a strange brightness , like a light , upon his face .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 16]: It was curious to see anything so happy in the tense gloom of that household .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 14]: Edith ate little , but gazed nearly all the time at her plate .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 26]: She never once looked at Sibyl , though Sibyl now and then gave her a quick glance , heavily charged , and then looked away .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 39]: Roscoe ate nothing , and , like Edith , kept his eyes upon his plate and made believe to occupy himself with the viands thereon , loading his fork frequently , but not lifting it to his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 21]: He did not once look at his father , though his father gazed heavily at him most of the time .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 36]: And between Edith and Sibyl , and between Roscoe and his father , some bitter wireless communication seemed continually to be taking place throughout the long silences prevailing during this enlivening ceremony of Sabbath refection .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 13]: `` Did n't you go to church this morning , Bibbs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 16]: his mother asked , in the effort to break up one of those ghastly intervals .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 9]: `` What did you say , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 11]: `` Did n't you go to church this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 15]: `` I think so , '' he answered , as from a roseate trance .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 5]: `` You THINK so !
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 6]: Do n't you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 4]: `` Oh yes .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 8]: Yes , I went to church ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 5]: `` Which one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 6]: `` Just down the street .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 5]: It 's brick . ''
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 8]: `` What was the sermon about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 6]: `` What , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 8]: `` Ca n't you hear me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 11]: `` I asked you what the sermon was about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 4]: He roused himself .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 19]: `` I think it was about -- '' He frowned , seeming to concentrate his will to recollect .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 12]: `` I think it was about something in the Bible . ''
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 23]: White-jacket George was glad of an opportunity to leave the room and lean upon Mist ' Jackson 's shoulder in the pantry .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 11]: `` He do n't know they WAS any suhmon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 9]: he concluded , having narrated the dining-room dialogue .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 18]: `` All he know is he was with ` at lady lives nex ' do ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 4]: George was right .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 13]: `` Did you go to church all by yourself , Bibbs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 3]: Sibyl asked .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 7]: `` No , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 10]: `` No , I did n't go alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 4]: `` Oh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 24]: Sibyl gave the ejaculation an upward twist , as of mocking inquiry , and followed it by another , expressive of hilarious comprehension .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 4]: `` OH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 12]: Bibbs looked at her studiously , but she spoke no further .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 10]: And that completed the conversation at the lugubrious feast .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 20]: Coffee came finally , was disposed of quickly , and the party dispersed to other parts of the house .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 16]: Bibbs followed his father and Roscoe into the library , but was not well received .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 16]: `` YOU go and listen to the phonograph with the women-folks , '' Sheridan commanded .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 3]: Bibbs retreated .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 14]: `` Sometimes you do seem to be a hard sort of man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 29]: However , he went obediently to the gilt-and-brocade room in which his mother and his sister and his sister-in-law had helplessly withdrawn , according to their Sabbatical custom .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 52]: Edith sat in a corner , tapping her feet together and looking at them ; Sibyl sat in the center of the room , examining a brooch which she had detached from her throat ; and Mrs. Sheridan was looking over a collection of records consisting exclusively of Caruso and rag-time .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 30]: She selected one of the latter , remarking that she thought it `` right pretty , '' and followed it with one of the former and the same remark .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 27]: As the second reached its conclusion , George appeared in the broad doorway , seeming to have an errand there , but he did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 41]: Instead , he favored Edith with a benevolent smile , and she immediately left the room , George stepping aside for her to precede him , and then disappearing after her in the hall with an air of successful diplomacy .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 28]: He made it perfectly clear that Edith had given him secret instructions and that it had been his pride and pleasure to fulfil them to the letter .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 24]: Sibyl stiffened in her chair ; her lips parted , and she watched with curious eyes the vanishing back of the white jacket .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 6]: `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 11]: she asked , in a low voice , but sharply .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 23]: `` Here 's another right pretty record , '' said Mrs. Sheridan , affecting -- with patent nervousness -- not to hear .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 6]: And she unloosed the music .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 14]: Sibyl bit her lip and began to tap her chin with the brooch .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 23]: After a little while she turned to Bibbs , who reposed at half-length in a gold chair , with his eyes closed .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 7]: `` Where did Edith go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 5]: she asked , curiously .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 4]: `` Edith ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 8]: he repeated , opening his eyes blankly .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 6]: `` Is she gone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 9]: Sibyl got up and stood in the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 14]: She leaned against the casing , still tapping her chin with the brooch .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 22]: Her eyes were dilating ; she was suddenly at high tension , and her expression had become one of sharp excitement .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 4]: She listened intently .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 38]: When the record was spun out she could hear Sheridan rumbling in the library , during the ensuing silence , and Roscoe 's voice , querulous and husky : `` I wo n't say anything at all .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 14]: I tell you , you might just as well let me alone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 21]: But there were other sounds : a rustling and murmur , whispering , low protesting cadences in a male voice .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 22]: And as Mrs. Sheridan started another record , a sudden , vital resolve leaped like fire in the eyes of Sibyl .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 11]: She walked down the hall and straight into the smoking-room .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 11]: Lamhorn and Edith both sprang to their feet , separating .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 26]: Edith became instantly deathly white with a rage that set her shaking from head to foot , and Lamhorn stuttered as he tried to speak .
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 19]: But Edith 's shaking was not so violent as Sibyl 's , nor was her face so white .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 17]: At sight of them and of their embrace , all possible consequences became nothing to Sibyl .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 18]: She courtesied , holding up her skirts and contorting her lips to the semblance of a smile .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 12]: `` Sit just as you were -- both of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 19]: And then to Edith : `` Did you tell my husband I had been telephoning to Lamhorn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 8]: `` You march out of here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 5]: said Edith , fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 8]: `` March straight out of here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 7]: Sibyl leveled a forefinger at Lamhorn .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 17]: `` Did you tell her I 'd been telephoning you I wanted you to come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 7]: `` Oh , good God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 3]: Lamhorn said .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 4]: `` Hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 14]: `` You knew she 'd tell my husband , DID N'T you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 6]: `` You knew that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 4]: `` HUSH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 5]: he begged , panic-stricken .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 9]: `` That was a MANLY thing to do !
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 8]: Oh , it was like a gentleman !
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 21]: You would n't come -- you would n't even come for five minutes to hear what I had to say !
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 10]: You were TIRED of what I had to say !
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 16]: You 'd heard it all a thousand times before , and you would n't come !
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 3]: NO ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 3]: she stormed .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 18]: `` You would n't even come for five minutes , but you could tell that little cat !
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 6]: And SHE told my husband !
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 6]: You 're a MAN ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 31]: Edith saw in a flash that the consequences of battle would be ruinous to Sibyl , and the furious girl needed no further temptation to give way to her feelings .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 8]: `` Get out of this house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 3]: she shrieked .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 8]: `` This is my father 's house .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 11]: Do n't you dare speak to Robert like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 13]: I must n't SPEAK -- '' `` Do n't you DARE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 21]: Edith and Sibyl began to scream insults at each other simultaneously , fronting each other , their furious faces close .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 11]: Their voices shrilled and rose and cracked -- they screeched .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 18]: They could be heard over the noise of the phonograph , which was playing a brass-band selection .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 9]: They could be heard all over the house .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 16]: They were heard in the kitchen ; they could have been heard in the cellar .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 7]: Neither of them cared for that .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 7]: `` You told my husband ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 12]: screamed Sibyl , bringing her face still closer to Edith 's .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 6]: `` You told my husband !
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 12]: This man put THAT in your hands to strike me with !
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 4]: HE did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 8]: `` I 'll tell your husband again !
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 8]: I 'll tell him everything I know !
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 16]: It 's TIME your husband -- '' They were swept asunder by a bandaged hand .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 9]: `` Do you want the neighbors in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 3]: Sheridan thundered .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 6]: There fell a shocking silence .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 20]: Frenzied Sibyl saw her husband and his mother in the doorway , and she understood what she had done .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 14]: She moved slowly toward the door ; then suddenly she began to run .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 16]: She ran into the hall , and through it , and out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 11]: Roscoe followed her heavily , his eyes on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 5]: `` NOW THEN ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 5]: said Sheridan to Lamhorn .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 11]: The words were indefinite , but the voice was not .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 42]: Neither was the vicious gesture of the bandaged hand , which concluded its orbit in the direction of the door in a manner sufficient for the swift dispersal of George and Jackson and several female servants who hovered behind Mrs. Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 4]: They fled lightly .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 6]: `` Papa , papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 4]: wailed Mrs. Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 6]: `` Look at your hand !
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 19]: You 'd ought n't to been so rough with Edie ; you hurt your hand on her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 3]: Look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 30]: There was , in fact , a spreading red stain upon the bandages at the tips of the fingers , and Sheridan put his hand back in the sling .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 5]: `` Now then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 3]: he repeated .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 10]: `` You goin ' to leave my house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 6]: `` He will NOT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 3]: sobbed Edith .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 10]: `` Do n't you DARE order him out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 14]: `` Do n't you bother , dear , '' said Lamhorn , quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 6]: `` He does n't understand .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 7]: YOU must n't be troubled . ''
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 47]: Pallor was becoming to him ; he looked very handsome , and as he left the room he seemed in the girl 's distraught eyes a persecuted noble , indifferent to the rabble yawping insult at his heels -- the rabble being enacted by her father .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 9]: `` Do n't come back , either ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 9]: said , Sheridan , realistic in this impersonation .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 7]: `` Keep off the premises ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 7]: he called savagely into the hall .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 9]: `` This family 's through with you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 6]: `` It is NOT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 8]: Edith cried , breaking from her mother .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 7]: `` You 'll SEE about that !
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 5]: You 'll find out !
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 8]: You 'll find out what 'll happen !
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 5]: What 's HE done ?
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 18]: I guess if I can stand it , it 's none of YOUR business , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 11]: What 's HE done , I 'd like to know ?
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 8]: You do n't know anything about it .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 10]: Do n't you s ` pose he told ME ?
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 20]: She was crazy about him soon as he began going there , and he flirted with her a little .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 14]: That 's everything he did , and it was before he met ME !
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 23]: After that he would n't , and it was n't anything , anyway -- he never was serious a minute about it .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 18]: SHE wanted it to be serious , and she was bound she would n't give him up .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 35]: He told her long ago he cared about me , but she kept persecuting him and -- '' `` Yes , '' said Sheridan , sternly ; `` that 's HIS side of it !
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 4]: That 'll do !
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 10]: He does n't come in this house again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 6]: `` You look out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 3]: Edith cried .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 8]: `` Yes , I 'll look out !
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 27]: I 'd ` a ' told you to-day he was n't to be allowed on the premises , but I had other things on my mind .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 17]: I had Abercrombie look up this young man privately , and he 's no ` count .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 8]: He 's no ` count on earth !
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 5]: He 's no good !
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 5]: He 's NOTHIN ' !
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 23]: But it would n't matter if he was George Washington , after what 's happened and what I 've heard to-night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 42]: `` But , papa , '' Mrs. Sheridan began , `` if Edie says it was all Sibyl 's fault , makin ' up to him , and he never encouraged her much , nor -- '' '' 'S enough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 3]: he roared .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 7]: `` He keeps off these premises !
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 48]: And if any of you so much as ever speak his name to me again -- '' But Edith screamed , clapping her hands over her ears to shut out the sound of his voice , and ran up-stairs , sobbing loudly , followed by her mother .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 17]: However , Mrs. Sheridan descended a few minutes later and joined her husband in the library .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 24]: Bibbs , still sitting in his gold chair , saw her pass , roused himself from reverie , and strolled in after her .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 16]: `` She locked her door , '' said Mrs. Sheridan , shaking her head woefully .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 8]: `` She would n't even answer me .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 10]: They was n't a sound from her room . ''
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 17]: `` Well , '' said her husband , `` she can settle her mind to it .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 19]: She never speaks to that fellow again , and if he tries to telephone her to-morrow -- Here !
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 18]: You tell the help if he calls up to ring off and say it 's my orders .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 6]: No , you need n't .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 7]: I 'll tell 'em myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 10]: `` Better not , '' said Bibbs , gently .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 6]: His father glared at him .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 10]: `` It 's no good , '' said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 17]: `` Mother , when you were in love with father -- '' `` My goodness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 30]: `` You ai n't a-goin ' to compare your father to that -- '' `` Edith feels about him just what you did about father , '' said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 21]: `` And if YOUR father had told you -- '' `` I wo n't LISTEN to such silly talk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 5]: she declared , angrily .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 16]: `` So you 're handin ' out your advice , are you , Bibbs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 3]: said Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 10]: `` Let her see him all she wants . ''
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 11]: `` You 're a -- '' Sheridan gave it up .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 11]: `` I do n't know what to call you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 15]: `` Let her see him all she wants , '' Bibbs repeated , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 11]: `` You 're up against something too strong for you .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 18]: If Edith were a weakling you 'd have a chance this way , but she is n't .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 25]: She 's got a lot of your determination , father , and with what 's going on inside of her she 'll beat you .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 22]: You ca n't keep her from seeing him , as long as she feels about him the way she does now .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 12]: You ca n't make her think less of him , either .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 3]: Nobody can .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 25]: Your only chance is that she 'll do it for herself , and if you give her time and go easy she probably will .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 40]: Marriage would do it for her quickest , but that 's just what you do n't want , and as you DO N'T want it , you 'd better -- '' `` I ca n't stand any more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 4]: Sheridan burst out .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 19]: `` If it 's come to BIBBS advisin ' me how to run this house I better resign .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 8]: Mamma , where 's that nigger George ?
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 13]: Maybe HE 'S got some plan how I better manage my family .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 11]: Bibbs , for God 's sake go and lay down !
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 10]: ` Let her see him all she wants ' !
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 4]: Oh , Lord !
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 44]: here 's wisdom ; here 's -- '' `` Bibbs , '' said Mrs. Sheridan , `` if you have n't got anything to do , you might step over and take Sibyl 's wraps home -- she left 'em in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 17]: I do n't think you seem to quiet your poor father very much just now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 5]: `` All right . ''
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 22]: And Bibbs bore Sibyl 's wraps across the street and delivered them to Roscoe , who met him at the door .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 29]: Bibbs said only , `` Forgot these , '' and , `` Good night , Roscoe , '' cordially and cheerfully , and returned to the New House .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 35]: His mother and father were still talking in the library , but with discretion he passed rapidly on and upward to his own room , and there he proceeded to write in his note-book .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 16]: CHAPTER XXII There seems to be another curious thing about Love -LSB- Bibbs wrote -RSB- .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 20]: Love is blind while it lives and only opens its eyes and becomes very wide awake when it dies .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 6]: Let it alone until then .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 12]: You can not reason with love or with any other passion .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 12]: The wise will not wish for love -- nor for ambition .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 17]: These are passions and bring others in their train -- hatreds and jealousies -- all blind .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 9]: Friendship and a quiet heart for the wise .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 6]: What a turbulence is love !
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 17]: It is dangerous for a blind thing to be turbulent ; there are precipices in life .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 14]: One would not cross a mountain-pass with a thick cloth over his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 3]: Lovers do .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 8]: Friendship walks gently and with open eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 8]: To walk to church with a friend !
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 6]: To sit beside her there !
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 25]: To rise when she rises , and to touch with one 's thumb and fingers the other half of the hymn-book that she holds !
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 14]: What lover , with his fierce ways , could know this transcendent happiness ?
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 8]: Friendship brings everything that heaven could bring .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 25]: There is no labor that can not become a living rapture if you know that a friend is thinking of you as you labor .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 7]: So you sing at your work .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 17]: For the work is part of the thoughts of your friend ; so you love it !
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 8]: Love is demanding and claiming and insistent .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 13]: Friendship is all kindness -- it makes the world glorious with kindness .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 11]: What color you see when you walk with a friend !
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 29]: You see that the gray sky is brilliant and shimmering ; you see that the smoke has warm browns and is marvelously sculptured -- the air becomes iridescent .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 8]: You see the gold in brown hair .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 4]: Light floods everything .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 18]: When you walk to church with a friend you know that life can give you nothing richer .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 13]: You pray that there will be no change in anything for ever .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 30]: What an adorable thing it is to discover a little foible in your friend , a bit of vanity that gives you one thing more about her to adore !
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 36]: On a cold morning she will perhaps walk to church with you without her furs , and she will blush and return an evasive answer when you ask her why she does not wear them .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 10]: You will say no more , because you understand .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 61]: She looks beautiful in her furs ; you love their darkness against her cheek ; but you comprehend that they conceal the loveliness of her throat and the fine line of her chin , and that she also has comprehended this , and , wishing to look still more bewitching , discards her furs at the risk of taking cold .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 19]: So you hold your peace , and try to look as if you had not thought it out .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 17]: This theory is satisfactory except that it does not account for the absence of the muff .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 12]: Ah , well , there must always be a mystery somewhere !
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 7]: Mystery is a part of enchantment .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 5]: Manual labor is best .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 15]: Your heart can sing and your mind can dream while your hands are working .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 31]: You could not have a singing heart and a dreaming mind all day if you had to scheme out dollars , or if you had to add columns of figures .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 6]: Those things take your attention .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 20]: You can not be thinking of your friend while you write letters beginning `` Yours of the 17th inst .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 8]: rec 'd and contents duly noted . ''
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 36]: But to work with your hands all day , thinking and singing , and then , after nightfall , to hear the ineffable kindness of your friend 's greeting -- always there -- for you !
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 10]: Who would wake from such a dream as this ?
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 28]: Dawn and the sea -- music in moonlit gardens -- nightingales serenading through almond-groves in bloom -- what could bring such things into the city 's turmoil ?
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 12]: Yet they are here , and roses blossom in the soot .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 10]: That is what it means not to be alone !
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 8]: That is what a friend gives you !
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 55]: Having thus demonstrated that he was about twenty-five and had formed a somewhat indefinite definition of friendship , but one entirely his own -LRB- and perhaps Mary 's -RRB- Bibbs went to bed , and was the only Sheridan to sleep soundly through the night and to wake at dawn with a light heart .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 15]: His cheerfulness was vaguely diminished by the troublous state of affairs of his family .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 21]: He had recognized his condition when he wrote , `` Who would wake from such a dream as this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 40]: Bibbs was a sympathetic person , easily touched , but he was indeed living in a dream , and all things outside of it were veiled and remote -- for that is the way of youth in a dream .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 25]: And Bibbs , who had never before been of any age , either old or young , had come to his youth at last .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 14]: He went whistling from the house before even his father had come down-stairs .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 54]: There was a fog outdoors , saturated with a fine powder of soot , and though Bibbs noticed absently the dim shape of an automobile at the curb before Roscoe 's house , he did not recognize it as Dr. Gurney 's , but went cheerily on his way through the dingy mist .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 33]: And when he was once more installed beside his faithful zinc-eater he whistled and sang to it , as other workmen did to their own machines sometimes , when things went well .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 13]: His comrades in the shop glanced at him amusedly now and then .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 30]: They liked him , and he ate his lunch at noon with a group of Socialists who approved of his ideas and talked of electing him to their association .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 18]: The short days of the year had come , and it was dark before the whistles blew .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 39]: When the signal came , Bibbs went to the office , where he divested himself of his overalls -- his single divergence from the routine of his fellow-workmen -- and after that he used soap and water copiously .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 41]: This was his transformation scene : he passed into the office a rather frail young working-man noticeably begrimed , and passed out of it to the pavement a cheerfully pre-occupied sample of gentry , fastidious to the point of elegance .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 25]: The sidewalk was crowded with the bearers of dinner-pails , men and boys and women and girls from the work-rooms that closed at five .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 31]: Many hurried and some loitered ; they went both east and west , jostling one another , and Bibbs , turning his face homeward , was forced to go slowly .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 54]: Coming toward him , as slowly , through the crowd , a tall girl caught sight of his long , thin figure and stood still until he had almost passed her , for in the thick crowd and the thicker gloom he did not recognize her , though his shoulder actually touched hers .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 18]: He would have gone by , but she laughed delightedly ; and he stopped short , startled .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 24]: Two boys , one chasing the other , swept between them , and Bibbs stood still , peering about him in deep perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 5]: She leaned toward him .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 6]: `` I knew YOU ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 5]: `` Good heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 3]: cried Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 14]: `` I thought it was your voice coming out of a star ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 15]: `` There 's only smoke overhead , '' said Mary , and laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 8]: `` There are n't any stars . ''
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 12]: `` Oh yes , there were -- when you laughed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 10]: She took his arm , and they went on .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 12]: `` I 've come to walk home with you , Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 5]: I wanted to . ''
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 14]: `` But were you here in the -- '' `` In the dark ?
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 2]: Waiting ?
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 3]: Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 10]: Bibbs was radiant ; he felt suffocated with happiness .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 6]: He began to scold her .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 14]: `` But it 's not safe , and I 'm not worth it .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 11]: You should n't have -- you ought to know better .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 16]: What did -- '' `` I only waited about twelve seconds , '' she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 8]: `` I 'd just got here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 34]: `` But to come all this way and to this part of town in the dark , you -- '' `` I was in this part of town already , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 41]: `` At least , I was only seven or eight blocks away , and it was dark when I came out , and I 'd have had to go home alone -- and I preferred going home with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 17]: `` It 's pretty beautiful for me , '' said Bibbs , with a deep breath .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 26]: `` You 'll never know what it was to hear your laugh in the darkness -- and then to -- to see you standing there !
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 21]: Oh , it was like -- it was like -- how can I TELL you what it was like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 27]: They had passed beyond the crowd now , and a crossing-lamp shone upon them , which revealed the fact that again she was without her furs .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 5]: Here was a puzzle .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 17]: Why did that adorable little vanity of hers bring her out without them in the DARK ?
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 11]: But of course she had gone out long before dark .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 25]: For undefinable reasons this explanation was not quite satisfactory ; however , allowing it to stand , his solicitude for her took another turn .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 25]: `` I think you ought to have a car , '' he said , `` especially when you want to be out after dark .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 8]: You need one in winter , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 10]: Have you ever asked your father for one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 13]: `` I do n't think I 'd care for one particularly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 7]: `` I wish you would . ''
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 8]: Bibbs 's tone was earnest and troubled .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 19]: `` I think in winter you -- '' `` No , no , '' she interrupted , lightly .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 24]: `` I do n't need -- '' `` But my mother tried to insist on sending one over here every afternoon for me .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 30]: I would n't let her , because I like the walk , but a girl -- '' `` A girl likes to walk , too , '' said Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 26]: `` Let me tell you where I 've been this afternoon and how I happened to be near enough to make you take me home .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 16]: I 've been to see a little old man who makes pictures of the smoke .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 31]: He has a sort of warehouse for a studio , and he lives there with his mother and his wife and their seven children , and he 's gloriously happy .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 27]: I 'd seen one of his pictures at an exhibition , and I wanted to see more of them , so he showed them to me .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 25]: He has almost everthing he ever painted ; I do n't suppose he 's sold more than four or five pictures in his life .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 8]: He gives drawing-lessons to keep alive . ''
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 11]: `` How do you mean he paints the smoke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 3]: Bibbs asked .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 3]: `` Literally .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 13]: He paints from his studio window and from the street -- anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 14]: He just paints what 's around him -- and it 's beautiful . ''
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 5]: `` The smoke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 3]: `` Wonderful !
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 9]: He sees the sky through it , somehow .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 86]: He does the ugly roofs of cheap houses through a haze of smoke , and he does smoky sunsets and smoky sunrises , and he has other things with the heavy , solid , slow columns of smoke going far out and growing more ethereal and mixing with the hazy light in the distance ; and he has others with the broken sky-line of down-town , all misted with the smoke and puffs and jets of vapor that have colors like an orchard in mid-April .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 14]: I 'm going to take you there some Sunday afternoon , Bibbs . ''
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 12]: `` You 're showing me the town , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 13]: `` I did n't know what was in it at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 15]: `` There are workers in beauty here , '' she told him , gently .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 11]: `` There are other painters more prosperous than my friend .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 8]: There are all sorts of things . ''
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 7]: `` I did n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 34]: Since the town began growing so great that it called itself ` greater , ' one could live here all one 's life and know only the side of it that shows . ''
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 12]: `` The beauty-workers seem buried very deep , '' said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 19]: `` And I imagine that your friend who makes the smoke beautiful must be buried deepest of all .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 20]: My father loves the smoke , but I ca n't imagine his buying one of your friend 's pictures .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 19]: He 'd buy the ` Bay of Naples , ' but he would n't get one of those .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 20]: He 'd think smoke in a picture was horrible -- unless he could use it for an advertisement . ''
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 9]: `` Yes , '' she said , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 8]: `` And really he 's the town .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 14]: They ARE buried pretty deep , it seems , sometimes , Bibbs . ''
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 12]: `` And yet it 's all wonderful , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 8]: `` It 's wonderful to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 11]: `` You mean the town is wonderful to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 14]: `` Yes , because everything is , since you called me your friend .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 12]: The city is only a rumble on the horizon for me .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 29]: It ca n't come any closer than the horizon so long as you let me see you standing by my old zinc-eater all day long , helping me .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 9]: Mary -- '' He stopped with a gasp .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 15]: `` That 's the first time I 've called you ` Mary ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 7]: She laughed , a little tremuously .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 8]: `` Though I wanted you to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 7]: `` I said it without thinking .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 13]: It must be because you came there to walk home with me .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 6]: That must be it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 18]: `` Women like to have things said , '' Mary informed him , her tremulous laughter continuing .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 10]: `` Were you glad I came for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 8]: `` No -- not ` glad . '
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 19]: I felt as if I were being carried straight up and up and up -- over the clouds .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 6]: I feel like that still .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 11]: I think I 'm that way most of the time .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 11]: I wonder what I was like before I knew you .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 18]: The person I was then seems to have been somebody else , not Bibbs Sheridan at all .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 7]: It seems long , long ago .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 36]: I was gloomy and sickly -- somebody else -- somebody I do n't understand now , a coward afraid of shadows -- afraid of things that did n't exist -- afraid of my old zinc-eater !
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 13]: And now I 'm only afraid of what might change anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 17]: She was silent a moment , and then , `` You 're happy , Bibbs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 9]: `` Ah , do n't you see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 18]: `` I want it to last for a thousand , thousand years , just as it is !
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 12]: You 've made me so rich , I 'm a miser .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 13]: I would n't have one thing different -- nothing , nothing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 5]: `` Dear Bibbs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 7]: she said , and laughed happily .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 13]: CHAPTER XXIII Bibbs continued to live in the shelter of his dream .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 57]: He had told Edith , after his ineffective effort to be useful in her affairs , that he had decided that he was `` a member of the family '' ; but he appeared to have relapsed to the retired list after that one attempt at participancy -- he was far enough detached from membership now .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 37]: These were turbulent days in the New House , but Bibbs had no part whatever in the turbulence -- he seemed an absent-minded stranger , present by accident and not wholly aware that he was present .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 42]: He would sit , faintly smiling over pleasant imaginings and dear reminiscences of his own , while battle raged between Edith and her father , or while Sheridan unloosed jeremiads upon the sullen Roscoe , who drank heavily to endure them .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 16]: The happy dreamer wandered into storm-areas like a somnambulist , and wandered out again unawakened .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 26]: He was sorry for his father and for Roscoe , and for Edith and for Sibyl , but their sufferings and outcries seemed far away .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 7]: Sibyl was under Gurney 's care .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 45]: Roscoe had sent for him on Sunday night , not long after Bibbs returned the abandoned wraps ; and during the first days of Sibyl 's illness the doctor found it necessary to be with her frequently , and to install a muscular nurse .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 28]: And whether he would or no , Gurney received from his hysterical patient a variety of pungent information which would have staggered anybody but a family physician .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 31]: Among other things he was given to comprehend the change in Bibbs , and why the zinc-eater was not putting a lump in the operator 's gizzard as of yore .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 17]: Sibyl was not delirious -- she was a thin little ego writhing and shrieking in pain .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 48]: Life had hurt her , and had driven her into hurting herself ; her condition was only the adult 's terrible exaggeration of that of a child after a bad bruise -- there must be screaming and telling mother all about the hurt and how it happened .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 9]: Sibyl babbled herself hoarse when Gurney withheld morphine .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 12]: She went from the beginning to the end in a breath .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 9]: No protest stopped her ; nothing stopped her .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 9]: `` You ought to let me die ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 3]: she wailed .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 10]: `` It 's cruel not to let me die !
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 16]: What harm have I ever done to anybody that you want to keep me alive ?
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 6]: Just look at my life !
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 18]: I only married Roscoe to get away from home , and look what that got me into !
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 7]: -- look where I am now !
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 19]: He brought me to this town , and what did I have in my life but his FAMILY ?
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 10]: And they did n't even know the right crowd !
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 10]: If they had , it might have been SOMETHING !
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 11]: I had nothing -- nothing -- nothing in the world !
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 13]: I wanted to have a good time -- and how could I ?
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 9]: Where 's any good time among these Sheridans ?
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 9]: They never even had wine on the table !
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 35]: I thought I was marrying into a rich family where I 'd meet attractive people I 'd read about , and travel , and go to dances -- and , oh , my Lord !
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 7]: all I got was these Sheridans !
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 12]: I did the best I could ; I did , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 5]: Oh , I DID !
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 6]: I just tried to live .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 18]: Every woman 's got a right to live , some time in her life , I guess !
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 52]: Things were just beginning to look brighter -- we 'd moved up here , and that frozen crowd across the street were after Jim for their daughter , and they 'd have started us with the right people -- and then I saw how Edith was getting him away from me .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 6]: She did it , too !
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 4]: She got him !
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 20]: A girl with money can do that to a married woman -- yes , she can , every time !
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 6]: And what could I do ?
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 9]: What can any woman do in my fix ?
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 18]: I could n't do ANYTHING but try to stand it -- and I could n't stand it !
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 27]: I went to that icicle -- that Vertrees girl -- and she could have helped me a little , and it would n't have hurt her .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 14]: It would n't have done her any harm to help me THAT little !
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 24]: She treated me as if I 'd been dirt that she would n't even take the trouble to sweep out of her house !
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 5]: Let her WAIT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 24]: Sibyl 's voice , hoarse from babbling , became no more than a husky whisper , though she strove to make it louder .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 11]: She struggled half upright , and the nurse restrained her .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 21]: `` I 'd get up out of this bed to show her she ca n't do such things to me !
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 15]: I was absolutely ladylike , and she walked out and left me there alone !
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 4]: She 'll SEE !
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 27]: She started after Bibbs before Jim 's casket was fairly underground , and she thinks she 's landed that poor loon -- but she 'll see !
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 4]: She 'll see !
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 29]: If I 'm ever able to walk across the street again I 'll show her how to treat a woman in trouble that comes to her for help !
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 16]: It would n't have hurt her any -- it would n't -- it would n't .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 22]: And Edith need n't have told what she told Roscoe -- it would n't have hurt her to let me alone .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 16]: And HE told her I bored him -- telephoning him I wanted to see him .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 7]: He need n't have done it !
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 35]: He need n't -- need n't -- '' Her voice grew fainter , for that while , with exhaustion , though she would go over it all again as soon as her strength returned .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 4]: She lay panting .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 23]: Then , seeing her husband standing disheveled in the doorway , `` Do n't come in , Roscoe , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 10]: `` I do n't want to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 20]: And as he turned away she added , `` I 'm kind of sorry for you , Roscoe . ''
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 25]: Her antagonist , Edith , was not more coherent in her own wailings , and she had the advantage of a mother for listener .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 27]: She had also the disadvantage of a mother for duenna , and Mrs. Sheridan , under her husband 's sharp tutelage , proved an effective one .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 22]: Edith was reduced to telephoning Lamhorn from shops whenever she could juggle her mother into a momentary distraction over a counter .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 12]: Edith was incomparably more in love than before Lamhorn 's expulsion .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 17]: Her whole being was nothing but the determination to hurdle everything that separated her from him .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 45]: She was in a state that could be altered by only the lightest and most delicate diplomacy of suggestion , but Sheridan , like legions of other parents , intensified her passion and fed it hourly fuel by opposing to it an intolerable force .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 13]: He swore she should cool , and thus set her on fire .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 4]: Edith planned neatly .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 29]: She fought hard , every other evening , with her father , and kept her bed betweentimes to let him see what his violence had done to her .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 47]: Then , when the mere sight of her set him to breathing fast , she said pitiably that she might bear her trouble better if she went away ; it was impossible to be in the same town with Lamhorn and not think always of him .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 10]: Perhaps in New York she might forget a little .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 29]: She had written to a school friend , established quietly with an aunt in apartments -- and a month or so of theaters and restaurants might bring peace .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 34]: Sheridan shouted with relief ; he gave her a copious cheque , and she left upon a Monday morning wearing violets with her mourning and having kissed everybody good-by except Sibyl and Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 38]: She might have kissed Bibbs , but he failed to realize that the day of her departure had arrived , and was surprised , on returning from his zinc-eater , that evening , to find her gone .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 15]: `` I suppose they 'll be maried there , '' he said , casually .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 17]: Sheridan , seated , warming his stockinged feet at the fire , jumped up , fuming .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 16]: `` Either you go out o ' here , or I will , Bibbs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 3]: he snorted .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 20]: `` I do n't want to be in the same room with the particular kind of idiot you are !
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 33]: She 's through with that riff-raff ; all she needed was to be kept away from him a few weeks , and I KEPT her away , and it did the business .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 13]: For Heaven 's sake , go on out o ' here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 10]: Bibbs obeyed the gesture of a hand still bandaged .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 33]: And the black silk sling was still round Sheridan 's neck , but no word of Gurney 's and no excruciating twinge of pain could keep Sheridan 's hand in the sling .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 25]: The wounds , slight enough originally , had become infected the first time he had dislodged the bandages , and healing was long delayed .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 49]: Sheridan had the habit of gesture ; he could not `` take time to remember , '' he said , that he must be careful , and he had also a curious indignation with his hurt ; he refused to pay it the compliment of admitting its existence .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 31]: The Saturday following Edith 's departure Gurney came to the Sheridan Building to dress the wounds and to have a talk with Sheridan which the doctor felt had become necessary .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 35]: But he was a little before the appointed time and was obliged to wait a few minutes in an anteroom -- there was a directors ' meeting of some sort in Sheridan 's office .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 21]: The door was slightly ajar , leaking cigar-smoke and oratory , the latter all Sheridan 's , and Gurney listened .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 14]: `` No , sir ; no , sir ; no , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 20]: he heard the big voice rumbling , and then , breaking into thunder , `` I tell you NO !
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 9]: Some o ' you men make me sick !
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 18]: You 'd lose your confidence in Almighty God if a doodle-bug flipped his hind leg at you !
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 10]: You say money 's tight all over the country .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 7]: Well , what if it is ?
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 22]: There 's no reason for it to be tight , and it 's not goin ' to keep OUR money tight !
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 27]: You 're always runnin ' to the woodshed to hide your nickels in a crack because some fool newspaper says the market 's a little skeery !
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 23]: You listen to every street-corner croaker and then come and set here and try to scare ME out of a big thing !
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 8]: We 're IN on this -- understand ?
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 9]: I tell you there never WAS better times .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 21]: These are good times and big times , and I wo n't stand for any other kind o ' talk .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 27]: This country 's on its feet as it never was before , and this city 's on its feet and goin ' to stay there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 14]: And Gurney heard a series of whacks and thumps upon the desk . ''
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 6]: ` Bad times ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 7]: Sheridan vociferated , with accompanying thumps .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 4]: `` Rabbit talk !
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 9]: These times are glorious , I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 16]: We 're in the promised land , and we 're goin ' to STAY there !
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 6]: That 's all , gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 5]: The loan goes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 14]: The directors came forth , flushed and murmurous , and Gurney hastened in .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 16]: His guess was correct : Sheridan had been thumping the desk with his right hand .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 45]: The physician scolded wearily , making good the fresh damage as best he might ; and then he said what he had to say on the subject of Roscoe and Sibyl , his opinion meeting , as he expected , a warmly hostile reception .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 28]: But the result of this conversation was that by telephonic command Roscoe awaited his father , an hour later , in the library at the New House .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 20]: `` Gurney says your wife 's able to travel , '' Sheridan said brusquely , as he came in .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 17]: Roscoe occupied a deep chair and sat in the dejected attitude which had become his habit .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 7]: `` Yes , she is . ''
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 19]: `` Edith had to leave town , and so Sibyl thinks she 'll have to , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 17]: `` Oh , I would n't put it that way , '' Roscoe protested , drearily .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 10]: `` No , I hear YOU would n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 33]: There was a bitter gibe in the father 's voice , and he added : `` It 's a good thing she 's goin ' abroad -- if she 'll stay there .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 19]: I should n't think any of us want her here any more -- you least of all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 14]: `` It 's no use your talking that way , '' said Roscoe .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 9]: `` You wo n't do any good . ''
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 14]: `` Well , when are you comin ' back to your office ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 8]: Sheridan used a brisker , kinder tone .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 11]: `` Three weeks since you showed up there at all .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 24]: When you goin ' to be ready to cut out whiskey and all the rest o ' the foolishness and start in again ?
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 44]: You ought to be able to make up for a lot o ' lost time and a lot o ' spilt milk when that woman takes herself out o ' the way and lets you and all the rest of us alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 12]: `` It 's no use , father , I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 11]: I know what Gurney was going to say to you .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 9]: I 'm not going back to the office .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 5]: I 'm DONE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 11]: `` Wait a minute before you talk that way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 10]: Sheridan began his sentry-go up and down the room .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 35]: `` I suppose you know it 's taken two pretty good men about sixteen hours a day to set things straight and get 'em runnin ' right again , down in your office ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 8]: `` They must be good men . ''
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 4]: Roscoe nodded indifferently .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 12]: `` I thought I was doing about eight men 's work .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 12]: I 'm glad you found two that could handle it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 4]: `` Look here !
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 11]: If I worked you it was for your own good .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 16]: There are plenty men drive harder 'n I do , and -- '' `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 15]: There are some that break down all the other men that work with 'em .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 23]: They either die , or go crazy , or have to quit , and are no use the rest of their lives .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 17]: The last 's my case , I guess -- ` complicated by domestic difficulties ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 12]: `` You set there and tell me you give up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 20]: Sheridan 's voice shook , and so did the gesticulating hand which he extended appealingly toward the despondent figure .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 8]: `` Do n't do it , Roscoe !
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 5]: Do n't say it !
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 12]: Say you 'll come down there again and be a man !
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 12]: This woman ai n't goin ' to trouble you any more .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 39]: The work ai n't goin ' to hurt you if you have n't got her to worry you , and you can get shut o ' this nasty whiskey-guzzlin ' ; it ai n't fastened on you yet .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 17]: Do n't say -- '' `` It 's no use on earth , '' Roscoe mumbled .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 7]: `` No use on earth . ''
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 4]: `` Look here !
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 28]: If you want another month 's vacation -- '' `` I know Gurney told you , so what 's the use talking about ` vacations ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 4]: `` Gurney ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 6]: Sheridan vociferated the name savagely .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 9]: `` It 's Gurney , Gurney , Gurney !
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 3]: Always Gurney !
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 35]: I do n't know what the world 's comin ' to with everybody runnin ' around squealin ' , ` The doctor says this , ' and , ` The doctor says that ' !
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 5]: It makes me sick !
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 29]: How 's this country expect to get its Work done if Gurney and all the other old nanny-goats keep up this blattin ' -- ` Oh , oh !
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 16]: Do n't lift that stick o ' wood ; you 'll ruin your NERVES ! '
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 16]: So he says you got ` nervous exhaustion induced by overwork and emotional strain . '
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 14]: They always got to stick the Work in if they see a chance !
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 21]: I reckon you did have the 'em otional strain , ' and that 's all 's the matter with you .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 28]: You 'll be over it soon 's this woman 's gone , and Work 's the very thing to make you quit frettin ' about her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 12]: `` Did Gurney tell you I was fit to work ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 5]: `` Shut up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 3]: Sheridan bellowed .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 24]: `` I 'm so sick o ' that man 's name I feel like shootin ' anybody that says it to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 16]: He fumed and chafed , swearing indistinctly , then came and stood before his son .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 17]: `` Look here ; do you think you 're doin ' the square thing by me ?
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 3]: Do you ?
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 6]: How much you worth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 21]: `` I 've got between seven and eight thousand a year clear , of my own , outside the salary .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 11]: That much is mine whether I work or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 4]: `` It is ?
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 20]: You could ' a pulled it out without me , I suppose you think , at your age ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 11]: But it 's mine , and it 's enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 4]: `` My Lord !
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 15]: It 's about what a Congressman gets , and you want to quit there !
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 27]: I suppose you think you 'll get the rest when I kick the bucket , and all you have to do is lay back and wait !
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 17]: You let me tell you right here , you 'll never see one cent of it .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 26]: You go out o ' business now , and what would you know about handlin ' it five or ten or twenty years from now ?
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 14]: Because I intend to STAY here a little while yet , my boy !
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 43]: They 'd either get it away from you or you 'd sell for a nickel and let it be split up and -- '' He whirled about , marched to the other end of the room , and stood silent a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 9]: Then he said , solemnly : `` Listen .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 35]: If you go out now , you leave me in the lurch , with nothin ' on God 's green earth to depend on but your brother -- and you know what he is .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 12]: I 've depended on you for it ALL since Jim died .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 43]: Now you 've listened to that dam ' doctor , and he says maybe you wo n't ever be as good a man as you were , and that certainly you wo n't be for a year or so -- probably more .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 8]: Now , that 's all a lie .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 11]: Men do n't break down that way at your age .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 4]: Look at ME !
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 12]: And I tell you , you can shake this thing off .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 12]: All you need is a little GET-up and a little gumption .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 22]: Men do n't go away for YEARS and then come back into MOVING businesses like ours -- they lose the strings .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 44]: And if you could , I wo n't let you -- if you lay down on me now , I wo n't -- and that 's because if you lay down you prove you ai n't the man I thought you were . ''
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 27]: He cleared his throat and finished quietly : `` Roscoe , will you take a month 's vacation and come back and go to it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 9]: `` No , '' said Roscoe , listlessly .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 6]: `` I 'm through . ''
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 8]: `` All right , '' said Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 27]: He picked up the evening paper from a table , went to a chair by the fire and sat down , his back to his son .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 4]: `` Good-by . ''
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 17]: Roscoe rose , his head hanging , but there was a dull relief in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 18]: `` Best I can do , '' he muttered , seeming about to depart , yet lingering .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 15]: `` I figure it out a good deal like this , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 60]: `` I did n't KNOW my job was any strain , and I managed all right , but from what Gur -- from what I hear , I was just up to the limit of my nerves from overwork , and the -- the trouble at home was the extra strain that 's fixed me the way I am .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 27]: I tried to brace , so I could stand the work and the trouble too , on whiskey -- and that put the finish to me !
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 45]: I -- I 'm not hitting it as hard as I was for a while , and I reckon pretty soon , if I can get to feeling a little more energy , I better try to quit entirely -- I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 11]: I 'm all in -- and the doctor says so .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 30]: I thought I was running along fine up to a few months ago , but all the time I was ready to bust , and did n't know it .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 42]: Now , then , I do n't want you to blame Sibyl , and if I were you I would n't speak of her as ` that woman , ' because she 's your daughter-in-law and going to stay that way .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 7]: She did n't do anything wicked .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 48]: It was a shock to me , and I do n't deny it , to find what she had done -- encouraging that fellow to hang around her after he began trying to flirt with her , and losing her head over him the way she did .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 25]: I do n't deny it was a shock and that it 'll always be a hurt inside of me I 'll never get over .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 16]: But it was my fault ; I did n't understand a woman 's nature . ''
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 11]: Poor Roscoe spoke in the most profound and desolate earnest .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 17]: `` A woman craves society , and gaiety , and meeting attractive people , and traveling .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 42]: Well , I ca n't give her the other things , but I can give her the traveling -- real traveling , not just going to Atlantic City or New Orleans , the way she has , two , three times .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 14]: A woman has to have something in her life besides a business man .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 7]: And that 's ALL I was .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 43]: I never understood till I heard her talking when she was so sick , and I believe if you 'd heard her then you would n't speak so hard-heartedly about her ; I believe you might have forgiven her like I have .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 4]: That 's all .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 27]: I never cared anything for any girl but her in my life , but I was so busy with business I put it ahead of her .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 13]: I never THOUGHT about her , I was so busy thinking business .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 36]: Well , this is where it 's brought us to -- and now when you talk about ` business ' to me I feel the way you do when anybody talks about Gurney to you .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 18]: The word ` business ' makes me dizzy -- it makes me honestly sick at the stomach .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 25]: I believe if I had to go down-town and step inside that office door I 'd fall down on the floor , deathly sick .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 17]: You talk about a ` month 's vacation ' -- and I get just as sick .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 42]: I 'm rattled -- I ca n't plan -- I have n't got any plans -- ca n't make any , except to take my girl and get just as far away from that office as I can -- and stay .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 18]: We 're going to Japan first , and if we -- '' His father rustled the paper .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 8]: `` I said good-by , Roscoe . ''
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 9]: `` Good-by , '' said Roscoe , listlessly .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 28]: CHAPTER XXIV Sheridan waited until he heard the sound of the outer door closing ; then he rose and pushed a tiny disk set in the wall .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 3]: Jackson appeared .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 9]: `` Has Bibbs got home from work ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 5]: `` Mist ' Bibbs ?
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 5]: No , suh . ''
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 15]: `` Tell him I want to see him , soon as he comes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 4]: `` Yessuh . ''
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 14]: Sheridan returned to his chair and fixed his attention fiercely upon the newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 31]: He found it difficult to pursue the items beyond their explanatory rubrics -- there was nothing unusual or startling to concentrate his attention : `` Motorman Puts Blame on Brakes .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 7]: Three Killed when Car Slides . ''
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 7]: `` Burglars Make Big Haul . ''
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 9]: `` Board Works Approve Big Car-line Extension . ''

Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 7]: -LRB- Sheridan nodded approvingly here . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 13]: Bibbs came through the hall whistling , and entered the room briskly .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 11]: `` Well , father , did you want me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 4]: Sit down . ''
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 28]: Sheridan got up , and Bibbs took a seat by the fire , holding out his hands to the crackling blaze , for it was cold outdoors .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 15]: `` I came within seven of the shop record to-day , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 15]: `` I handled more strips than any other workman has any day this month .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 9]: The nearest to me is sixteen behind . ''
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 7]: exclaimed his father , greatly pleased .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 7]: `` What 'd I tell you ?
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 26]: I 'd like to hear Gurney hint again that I was n't right in sending you there -- I would just like to hear him !
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 16]: And you -- ai n't you ashamed of makin ' such a fuss about it ?
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 5]: Ai n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 30]: `` I did n't go at it in the right spirit the other time , '' Bibbs said , smiling brightly , his face ruddy in the cheerful firelight .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 15]: `` I did n't know the difference it meant to like a thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 13]: `` Well , I guess I 've pretty thoroughly vindicated my judgement .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 5]: I guess I HAVE !
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 14]: I said the shop 'd be good for you , and it was .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 13]: I said it would n't hurt you , and it has n't .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 12]: It 's been just exactly what I said it would be .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 6]: Ai n't that so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 6]: `` Looks like it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 5]: Bibbs agreed , gaily .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 18]: `` Well , I 'd like to know any place I been wrong , first and last !
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 17]: Instead o ' hurting you , it 's been the makin ' of you -- physically .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 40]: You 're a good inch taller 'n what I am , and you 'd be a bigger man than what I am if you 'd get some flesh on your bones ; and you ARE gettin ' a little .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 18]: Physically , it 's started you out to be the huskiest one o ' the whole family .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 10]: Now , then , mentally -- that 's different .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 26]: I do n't say it unkindly , Bibbs , but you got to do something for yourself mentally , just like what 's begun physically .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 10]: And I 'm goin ' to help you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 7]: Sheridan decided to sit down again .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 21]: He brought his chair close to his son 's , and , leaning over , tapped Bibbs 's knee confidentially .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 13]: `` I got plans for you , Bibbs , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 6]: Bibbs instantly looked thoroughly alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 4]: He drew back .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 12]: `` I -- I 'm all right now , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 4]: `` Listen . ''
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 18]: Sheridan settled himself in his chair , and spoke in the tone of a reasonable man reasoning .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 6]: `` Listen here , Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 30]: I had another blow to-day , and it was a hard one and right in the face , though I HAVE been expectin ' it some little time back .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 9]: Well , it 's got to be met .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 8]: Now I 'll be frank with you .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 17]: As I said a minute ago , mentally I could n't ever called you exactly strong .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 13]: You been a little weak both ways , most of your life .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 18]: Not but what I think you GOT a mentality , if you 'd learn to use it .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 11]: You got will-power , I 'll say that for you .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 17]: I never knew boy or man that could be stubborner -- never one in my life !
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 28]: Now , then , you 've showed you could learn to run that machine best of any man in the shop , in no time at all .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 13]: That looks to me like you could learn to do other things .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 13]: I do n't deny but what it 's an encouragin ' sign .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 9]: I do n't deny that , at all .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 17]: Well , that helps me to think the case ai n't so hopeless as it looks .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 23]: You 're all I got to meet this blow with , but maybe you ai n't as poor material as I thought .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 32]: Your tellin ' me about comin ' within seven strips of the shop 's record to-day looks to me like encouragin ' information brought in at just about the right time .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 14]: Now , then , I 'm goin ' to give you a raise .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 26]: I wanted to send you straight on up through the shops -- a year or two , maybe -- but I ca n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 11]: I lost Jim , and now I 've lost Roscoe .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 4]: He 's quit .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 7]: He 's laid down on me .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 34]: If he ever comes back at all , he 'll be a long time pickin ' up the strings , and , anyway , he ai n't the man I thought he was .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 7]: I ca n't count on him .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 12]: I got to have SOMEBODY I KNOW I can count on .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 13]: And I 'm down to this : you 're my last chance .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 24]: Bibbs , I got to learn you to use what brains you got and see if we ca n't develop 'em a little .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 3]: Who knows ?
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 13]: And I 'm goin ' to put my time in on it .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 29]: I 'm goin ' to take you right down-town with ME , and I wo n't be hard on you if you 're a little slow at first .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 13]: And I 'm goin ' to do the big thing for you .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 21]: I 'm goin ' to make you feel you got to do the big thing for me , in return .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 54]: I 've vindicated my policy with you about the shop , and now I 'm goin ' to turn right around and swing you ` way over ahead of where the other boys started , and I 'm goin ' to make an appeal to your ambition that 'll make you dizzy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 9]: He tapped his son on the knee again .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 50]: `` Bibbs , I 'm goin ' to start you off this way : I 'm goin ' to make you a director in the Pump Works Company ; I 'm goin ' to make you vice-president of the Realty Company and a vice-president of the Trust Company ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 8]: Bibbs jumped to his feet , blanched .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 5]: `` Oh no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 12]: Sheridan took his dismay to be the excitement of sudden joy .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir !
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 27]: And there 's some pretty fat little salaries goes with those vice-presidencies , and a pinch o ' stock in the Pump Company with the directorship .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 17]: You thought I was pretty mean about the shop -- oh , I know you did !
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 13]: -- but you see the old man can play it both ways .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 27]: And so right now , the minute you 've begun to make good the way I wanted you to , I deal from the new deck .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 29]: And I 'll keep on handin ' it out bigger and bigger every time you show me you 're big enough to play the hand I deal you .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 15]: I 'm startin ' you with a pretty big one , my boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 17]: `` But I do n't -- I do n't -- I do n't want it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 3]: Bibbs stammered .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 7]: `` What 'd you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 8]: Sheridan thought he had not heard aright .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 9]: `` I do n't want it , father .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 14]: I thank you -- I do thank you -- '' Sheridan looked perplexed .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 8]: `` What 's the matter with you ?
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 12]: Did n't you understand what I was tellin ' you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 4]: `` You sure ?
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 6]: I reckon you did n't .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 11]: I offered -- '' `` I know , I know !
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 8]: But I ca n't take it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 9]: `` What 's the matter with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 8]: Sheridan was half amazed , half suspicious .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 7]: `` Your head feel funny ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 22]: `` I 've never been quite so sane in my life , '' said Bibbs , `` as I have lately .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 9]: And I 've got just what I want .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 8]: I 'm living exactly the right life .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 15]: I 'm earning my daily bread , and I 'm happy in doing it .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 5]: My wages are enough .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 20]: I do n't want any more money , and I do n't deserve any -- '' `` Damnation ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 4]: Sheridan sprang up .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 6]: `` You 've turned Socialist !
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 18]: You been listening to those fellows down there , and you -- '' `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 19]: I think there 's a great deal in what they say , but that is n't it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 12]: Sheridan tried to restrain his growing fury , and succeeded partially .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 6]: `` Then what is it ?
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 6]: What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 10]: `` Nothing , '' his son returned , nervously .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 9]: `` Nothing -- except that I 'm content .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 9]: I do n't want to change anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 10]: Bibbs had the incredible folly to try to explain .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 12]: `` I 'll tell you , father , if I can .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 25]: I know it may be hard to understand -- '' `` Yes , I think it may be , '' said Sheridan , grimly .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 11]: `` What you say usually is a LITTLE that way .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 4]: Go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 16]: Perturbed and distressed , Bibbs rose instinctively ; he felt himself at every possible disadvantage .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 20]: He was a sleeper clinging to a dream -- a rough hand stretched to shake him and waken him .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 25]: He went to a table and made vague drawings upon it with a finger , and as he spoke he kept his eyes lowered .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 23]: `` You were n't altogether right about the shop -- that is , in one way you were n't , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 5]: He glanced up apprehensively .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 14]: Sheridan stood facing him , expressionless , and made no attempt to interrupt .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 24]: `` That 's difficult to explain , '' Bibbs continued , lowering his eyes again , to follow the tracings of his finger .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 42]: `` I -- I believe the shop might have done for me this time if I had n't -- if something had n't helped me to -- oh , not only to bear it , but to be happy in it .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 8]: Well , I AM happy in it .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 10]: I want to go on just as I am .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 32]: And of all things on earth that I do n't want , I do n't want to live a business life -- I do n't want to be drawn into it .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 14]: I do n't think it IS living -- and now I AM living .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 11]: I have the healthful toil -- and I can think .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 14]: In business as important as yours I could n't think anything but business .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 15]: I do n't -- I do n't think making money is worth while . ''
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 15]: `` Go on , '' said Sheridan , curtly , as Bibbs paused timidly .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 18]: `` It has n't seemed to get anywhere , that I can see , '' said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 22]: `` You think this city is rich and powerful -- but what 's the use of its being rich and powerful ?
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 19]: They do n't teach the children any more in the schools because the city is rich and powerful .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 27]: They teach them more than they used to because some people -- not rich and powerful people -- have thought the thoughts to teach the children .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 29]: And yet when you 've been reading the paper I 've heard you objecting to the children being taught anything except what would help them to make money .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 8]: You said it was wasting the taxes .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 14]: You want them taught to make a living , but not to live .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 18]: When I was a little boy this was n't an ugly town ; now it 's hideous .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 12]: What 's the use of being big just to be hideous ?
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 25]: I mean I do n't think all this has meant really going ahead -- it 's just been getting bigger and dirtier and noisier .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 22]: Was n't the whole country happier and in many ways wiser when it was smaller and cleaner and quieter and kinder ?
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 31]: I know you think I 'm an utter fool , father , but , after all , though , are n't business and politics just the housekeeping part of life ?
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 35]: And would n't you despise a woman that not only made her housekeeping her ambition , but did it so noisily and dirtily that the whole neighborhood was in a continual turmoil over it ?
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 56]: And suppose she talked and thought about her housekeeping all the time , and was always having additions built to her house when she could n't keep clean what she already had ; and suppose , with it all , she made the house altogether unpeaceful and unlivable -- '' `` Just one minute ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 16]: Sheridan interrupted , adding , with terrible courtesy , `` If you will permit me ?
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 9]: Have you ever been right about anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 29]: `` I do n't quite -- '' `` I ask the simple question : Have you ever been right about anything whatever in the course of your life ?
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 18]: Have you ever been right upon any subject or question you 've thought about and talked about ?
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 15]: Can you mention one single time when you were proved to be right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 36]: He was flourishing the bandaged hand as he spoke , but Bibbs said only , `` If I 've always been wrong before , surely there 's more chance that I 'm right about this .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 16]: It seems reasonable to suppose something would be due to bring up my average . ''
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 12]: `` Yes , I thought you would n't see the point .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 20]: And there 's another you probably could n't see , but I 'll take the liberty to mention it .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 8]: You been balkin ' all your life .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 48]: Pretty much everything I ever wanted you to do , you 'd let out SOME kind of a holler , like you are now -- and yet I ca n't seem to remember once when you did n't have to lay down and do what I said .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 16]: But go on with your remarks about our city and the business of this country .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 4]: Go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 20]: `` I do n't want to be a part of it , '' said Bibbs , with unwonted decision .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 15]: `` I want to keep to myself , and I 'm doing it now .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 12]: I could n't , if I went down there with you .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 7]: I 'd be swallowed into it .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 22]: I do n't care for money enough to -- '' `` No , '' his father interrupted , still dangerously quiet .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 10]: `` You 've never had to earn a living .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 9]: Anybody could tell that by what you say .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 33]: Now , let me remind you : you 're sleepin ' in a pretty good bed ; you 're eatin ' pretty fair food ; you 're wearin ' pretty fine clothes .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 24]: Just suppose one o ' these noisy housekeepers -- me , for instance -- decided to let you do your own housekeepin ' .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 10]: May I ask what your proposition would be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 15]: `` I 'm earning nine dollars a week , '' said Bibbs , sturdily .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 5]: `` It 's enough .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 8]: I should n't mind at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 13]: `` Who 's payin ' you that nine dollars a week ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 5]: `` My work ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 3]: Bibbs answered .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 27]: `` And I 've done so well on that clipping-machine I believe I could work up to fifteen or even twenty a week at another job .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 15]: I could be a fair plumber in a few months , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 17]: I 'd rather have a trade than be in business -- I should , infinitely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 14]: `` You better set about learnin ' one pretty dam ' quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 15]: But Sheridan struggled with his temper and again was partially successful in controlling it .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 33]: `` You better learn a trade over Sunday , because you 're either goin ' down with me to my office Monday morning -- or -- you can go to plumbing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 10]: `` All right , '' said Bibbs , gently .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 7]: `` I can get along . ''
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 10]: Sheridan raised his hands sardonically , as in prayer .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 35]: `` O God , '' he said , `` this boy was crazy enough before he began to earn his nine dollars a week , and now his money 's gone to his head !
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 10]: Ca n't You do nothin ' for him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 17]: Then he flung his hands apart , palms outward , in a furious gesture of dismissal .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 8]: `` Get out o ' this room !
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 23]: You got a skull that 's thicker 'n a whale 's thigh-bone , but it 's cracked spang all the way across !
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 52]: You hated the machine-shop so bad when I sent you there , you went and stayed sick for over two years -- and now , when I offer to take you out of it and give you the mint , you holler for the shop like a calf for its mammy !
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 4]: You 're cracked !
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 10]: Oh , but I got a fine layout here !
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 13]: One son died , one quit , and one 's a loon !
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 8]: The loon 's all I got left !
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 20]: H. P. Ellersly 's wife had a crazy brother , and they undertook to keep him at the house .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 18]: First morning he was there he walked straight though a ten-dollar plate-glass window out into the yard .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 13]: He says , ` Oh , look at the pretty dandelion ! '
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 8]: That 's what you 're doin ' !
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 19]: You want to spend your life sayin ' , ` Oh , look at the pretty dandelion ! '
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 14]: and you do n't care a tinker 's dam ' what you bust !
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 66]: Well , mister , loon or no loon , cracked and crazy or whatever you are , I 'll take you with me Monday morning , and I 'll work you and learn you -- yes , and I 'll lam you , if I got to -- until I 've made something out of you that 's fit to be called a business man !
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 39]: I 'll keep at you while I 'm able to stand , and if I have to lay down to die I 'll be whisperin ' at you till they get the embalmin ' - fluid into me !
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 35]: Now go on , and do n't let me hear from you again till you can come and tell me you 've waked up , you poor , pitiful , dandelion-pickin ' SLEEP-WALKER ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 7]: Bibbs gave him a queer look .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 30]: There was something like reproach in it , for once ; but there was more than that -- he seemed to be startled by his father 's last word .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 44]: CHAPTER XXV There was sleet that evening , with a whopping wind , but neither this storm nor that other which so imminently threatened him held place in the consciousness of Bibbs Sheridan when he came once more to the presence of Mary .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 20]: All was right in his world as he sat with her , reading Maurice Maeterlinck 's Alladine and Palomides .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 31]: The sorrowful light of the gas-jet might have been May morning sunshine flashing amber and rose through the glowing windows of the Sainte-Chapelle , it was so bright for Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 34]: And while the zinc-eater held out to bring him such golden nights as these , all the king 's horses and all the king 's men might not serve to break the spell .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 35]: Bibbs read slowly , but in a reasonable manner , as if he were talking ; and Mary , looking at him steadily from beneath her curved fingers , appeared to discover no fault .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 17]: It had grown to be her habit to look at him whenever there was an opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 27]: It may be said , in truth , that while they were together , and it was light , she looked at him all the time .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 39]: When he came to the end of Alladine and Palomides they were silent a little while , considering together ; then he turned back the pages and said : `` There 's something I want to read over .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 54]: This : '' You would think I threw a window open on the dawn ... She has a soul that can be seen around her -- that takes you in its arms like an ailing child and without saying anything to you consoles you for everything ... I shall never understand it all .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 31]: I do not know how it can all be , but my knees bend in spite of me when I speak of it ... He stopped and looked at her .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 5]: `` You boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 7]: said Mary , not very clearly .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 8]: `` Oh yes , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 11]: `` But it 's true -- especially my knees ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 5]: `` You boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 7]: she murmured again , blushing charmingly .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 8]: `` You might read another line over .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 17]: The first time I ever saw you , Bibbs , you were looking into a mirror .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 4]: Do it again .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 29]: But you need n't read it -- I can give it to you : ' A little Greek slave that came from the heart of Arcady ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 3]: `` I !
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 27]: I 'm one of the hands at the Pump Works -- and going to stay one , unless I have to decide to study plumbing . ''
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 5]: She shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 29]: `` You love and want what 's beautiful and delicate and serene ; it 's really art that you want in your life , and have always wanted .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 28]: You seemed to me , from the first , the most wistful person I had ever known , and that 's what you were wistful for . ''
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 24]: Bibbs looked doubtful and more wistful than ever ; but after a moment or two the matter seemed to clarify itself to him .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 18]: `` Why , no , '' he said ; `` I wanted something else more than that .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 5]: I wanted you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 7]: `` And here I am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 6]: she laughed , completely understanding .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 15]: `` I think we 're like those two in The Cloister and the Hearth .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 26]: I 'm just the rough Burgundian cross-bow man , Denys , who followed that gentle Gerard and told everybody that the devil was dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 34]: `` He is n't , though , '' said Bibbs , as a hoarse little bell in the next room began a series of snappings which proved to be ten , upon count .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 13]: `` He gets into the clock whenever I 'm with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 9]: And , sighing deeply he rose to go .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 11]: `` You 're always very prompt about leaving me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 12]: `` I -- I try to be , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 22]: `` It is n't easy to be careful not to risk everything by giving myself a little more at a time .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 15]: If I ever saw you look tired -- '' `` Have you ever ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 4]: `` Not yet .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 13]: You always look -- you always look -- '' `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 3]: `` Care-free .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 4]: That 's it .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 17]: Except when you feel sorry for me about something , you always have that splendid look .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 9]: It puts courage into people to see it .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 21]: If I had a struggle to face I 'd keep remembering that look -- and I 'd never give up !
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 36]: It 's a brave look , too , as though gaiety might be a kind of gallantry on your part , and yet I do n't quite understand why it should be , either . ''
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 9]: He smiled quizzically , looking down upon her .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 16]: `` Mary , you have n't a ` secret sorrow , ' have you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 6]: For answer she only laughed .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 20]: `` No , '' he said ; `` I ca n't imagine you with a care in the world .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 38]: I think that 's why you were so kind to me -- you have nothing but happiness in your own life , and so you could spare time to make my troubles turn to happiness , too .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 16]: But there 's one little time in the twenty-four hours when I 'm not happy .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 12]: It 's now , when I have to say good night .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 62]: I feel dismal every time it comes -- and then , when I 've left the house , there 's a bad little blankness , a black void , as though I were temporarily dead ; and it lasts until I get it established in my mind that I 'm really beginning another day that 's to end with YOU again .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 5]: Then I cheer up .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 21]: But now 's the bad time -- and I must go through it , and so -- good night . ''
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 20]: And he added with a pungent vehemence of which he was little aware , `` I hate it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 5]: `` Do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 12]: she said , rising to go to the door with him .
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 10]: But he stood motionless , gazing at her wonderingly .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 3]: `` Mary !
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 9]: Your eyes are so -- '' He stopped .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 4]: `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 6]: But she looked quickly away .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 10]: `` I do n't know , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 14]: `` I thought just then -- '' `` What did you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 24]: `` I do n't know -- it seemed to me that there was something I ought to understand -- and did n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 10]: She laughed and met his wondering gaze again frankly .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 10]: `` My eyes are pleased , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 15]: `` I 'm glad that you miss me a little after you go . ''
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 19]: `` But to-morrow 's coming faster than other days if you 'll let it , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 5]: She inclined her head .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 9]: I 'll -- ` let it ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 9]: `` Going to church , '' said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 13]: `` It IS going to church when I go with you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 15]: She went to the front door with him ; she always went that far .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 27]: They had formed a little code of leave-taking , by habit , neither of them ever speaking of it ; but it was always the same .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 29]: She always stood in the doorway until he reached the sidewalk , and there he always turned and looked back , and she waved her hand to him .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 34]: Then he went on , halfway to the New House , and looked back again , and Mary was not in the doorway , but the door was open and the light shone .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 44]: It was as if she meant to tell him that she would never shut him out ; he could always see that friendly light of the open doorway -- as if it were open for him to come back , if he would .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 21]: He could see it until a wing of the New House came between , when he went up the path .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 29]: The open doorway seemed to him the beautiful symbol of her friendship -- of her thought of him ; a symbol of herself and of her ineffable kindness .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 36]: And she kept the door open -- even to-night , though the sleet and fine snow swept in upon her bare throat and arms , and her brown hair was strewn with tiny white stars .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 31]: His heart leaped as he turned and saw that she was there , waving her hand to him , as if she did not know that the storm touched her .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 48]: When he had gone on , Mary did as she always did -- she went into an unlit room across the hall from that in which they had spent the evening , and , looking from the window , watched him until he was out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 34]: The storm made that difficult to-night , but she caught a glimpse of him under the street-lamp that stood between the two houses , and saw that he turned to look back again .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 20]: Then , and not before , she looked at the upper windows of Roscoe 's house across the street .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 4]: They were dark .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 19]: Mary waited , but after a little while she closed the front door and returned to her window .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 26]: A moment later two of the upper windows of Roscoe 's house flashed into light and a hand lowered the shade of one of them .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 28]: Mary felt the cold then -- it was the third night she had seen those windows lighted and the shade lowered , just after Bibbs had gone .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 12]: But Bibbs had no glance to spare for Roscoe 's windows .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 46]: He stopped for his last look back at the open door , and , with a thin mantle of white already upon his shoulders , made his way , gasping in the wind , to the lee of the sheltering wing of the New House .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 21]: A stricken George , muttering hoarsely , admitted him , and Bibbs became aware of a paroxysm within the house .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 59]: Terrible sounds came from the library : Sheridan cursing as never before ; his wife sobbing , her voice rising to an agonized squeal of protest upon each of a series of muffled detonations -- the outrageous thumping of a bandaged hand upon wood ; then Gurney , sharply imperious , `` Keep your hand in that sling !
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 11]: Keep your hand in that sling , I say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 4]: `` LOOK ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 40]: George gasped , delighted to play herald for so important a tragedy ; and he renewed upon his face the ghastly expression with which he had first beheld the ruins his calamitous gesture laid before the eyes of Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 9]: `` Look at ` at lamidal statue ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 44]: Gazing down the hall , Bibbs saw heroic wreckage , seemingly Byzantine -- painted colossal fragments of the shattered torso , appallingly human ; and gilded and silvered heaps of magnificence strewn among ruinous palms like the spoil of a barbarians ' battle .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 19]: There had been a massacre in the oasis -- the Moor had been hurled headlong from his pedestal .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 13]: `` He hit ` at ole lamidal statue , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 4]: `` POW ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 5]: `` My father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 3]: `` YESsuh !
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 2]: POW !
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 5]: he hit ` er !
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 29]: An ' you ' ma run tell me git doctuh quick 's I kin telefoam -- she sho ' you ' pa goin ' bus ' a blood-vessel .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 10]: He ai n't takin ' on ` tall NOW .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 15]: He ai n't nothin ' ` tall to what he was ` while ago .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 10]: You done miss ' it , Mist ' Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 13]: Doctuh got him all quiet ' down , to what he was .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 2]: POW !
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 5]: he hit ` er !
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 3]: Yessuh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 12]: He took Bibbs 's coat and proffered a crumpled telegraph form .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 9]: `` Here what come , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 15]: `` I pick ` er up when he done stompin ' on ` er .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 27]: You read ` er , Mist ' Bibbs -- you ' ma tell me tuhn ` er ovuh to you soon 's you come in . ''
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 6]: Bibbs read the telegram quickly .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 11]: It was from New York and addressed to Mrs. Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 80]: Sure you will all approve step have taken as was so wretched my health would probably suffered severely Robert and I were married this afternoon thought best have quiet wedding absolutely sure you will understand wisdom of step when you know Robert better am happiest woman in world are leaving for Florida will wire address when settled will remain till spring love to all father will like him too when knows him like I do he is just ideal .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 3]: Edith Lamhorn .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 17]: CHAPTER XXVI George departed , and Bibbs was left gazing upon chaos and listening to thunder .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 39]: He could not reach the stairway without passing the open doors of the library , and he was convinced that the mere glimpse of him , just then , would prove nothing less than insufferable for his father .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 31]: For that reason he was about to make his escape into the gold-and-brocade room , intending to keep out of sight , when he heard Sheridan vociferously demanding his presence .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 8]: `` Tell him to come in here !
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 5]: He 's out there .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 8]: I heard George just let him in .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 6]: Now you 'll SEE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 16]: And tear-stained Mrs. Sheridan , looking out into the hall , beckoned to her son .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 8]: Bibbs went as far as the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 45]: Gurney sat winding a strip of white cotton , his black bag open upon a chair near by ; and Sheridan was striding up and down , his hand so heavily wrapped in fresh bandages that he seemed to be wearing a small boxing-glove .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 29]: His eyes were bloodshot ; his forehead was heavily bedewed ; one side of his collar had broken loose , and there were blood-stains upon his right cuff .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 8]: `` THERE 'S our little sunshine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 7]: he cried , as Bibbs appeared .
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 16]: `` THERE 'S the hope o ' the family -- my lifelong pride and joy !
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 18]: I want -- '' `` Keep you hand in that sling , '' said Gurney , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 12]: Sheridan turned upon him , uttering a sound like a howl .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 11]: `` For God 's sake , sing another tune ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 45]: `` You said you ` came as a doctor but stay as a friend , ' and in that capacity you undertake to sit up and criticize ME -- '' `` Oh , talk sense , '' said the doctor , and yawned intentionally .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 10]: `` What do you want Bibbs to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 23]: `` You were sittin ' up there tellin ' me I got ` hysterical ' -- ` hysterical , ' oh Lord !
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 16]: You sat up there and told me I got ` hysterical ' over nothin ' !
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 21]: You sat up there tellin ' me I did n't have as heavy burdens as many another man you knew .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 8]: I just want you to hear THIS .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 4]: Now listen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 11]: He swung toward the quiet figure waiting in the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 28]: `` Bibbs , will you come down-town with me Monday morning and let me start you with two vice-presidencies , a directorship , stock , and salaries ?
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 5]: I ask you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 11]: `` No , father , '' said Bibbs , gently .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 12]: Sheridan looked at Gurney and then faced his son once more .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 29]: `` Bibbs , you want to stay in the shop , do you , at nine dollars a week , instead of takin ' up my offer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 39]: `` And I 'd like the doctor to hear : What 'll you do if I decide you 're too high-priced a workin ' - man either to live in my house or work in my shop ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 9]: `` Find other work , '' said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 7]: You hear him for yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 3]: Sheridan cried .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 14]: `` You hear what -- '' `` Keep you hand in that sling !
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 7]: Yes , I hear him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 28]: Sheridan leaned over Gurney and shouted , in a voice that cracked and broke , piping into falsetto : `` He thinks of bein ' a PLUMBER !
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 7]: He wants to be a PLUMBER !
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 25]: He told me he could n't THINK if he went into business -- he wants to be a plumber so he can THINK ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 17]: He fell back a step , wiping his forhead with the back of his left hand .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 5]: That 's my son !
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 9]: That 's the only son I got now !
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 23]: That 's my chance to live , '' he cried , with a bitterness that seemed to leave ashes in his throat .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 19]: `` That 's my one chance to live -- that thing you see in the doorway yonder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 20]: Dr. Gurney thoughtfully regarded the bandage strip he had been winding , and tossed it into the open bag .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 14]: `` What 's the matter with giving Bibbs a chance to live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 5]: he said , coolly .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 8]: `` I would if I were you .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 10]: You 've had TWO that went into business . ''
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 10]: Sheridan 's mouth moved grotesquely before he could speak .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 34]: `` Joe Gurney , '' he said , when he could command himself so far , `` are you accusin ' me of the responsibility for the death of my son James ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 12]: `` I accuse you of nothing , '' said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 28]: `` But just once I 'd like to have it out with you on the question of Bibbs -- and while he 's here , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 20]: He got up , walked to the fire , and stood warming his hands behind his back and smiling .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 16]: `` Look here , old fellow , let 's be reasonable , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 38]: `` You were bound Bibbs should go to the shop again , and I gave you and him , both , to understand pretty plainly that if he went it was at the risk of his life .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 7]: Well , what did he do ?
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 7]: He said he wanted to go .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 12]: And he did go , and he 's made good there .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 9]: Now , see : Is n't that enough ?
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 8]: Ca n't you let him off now ?
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 23]: He wants to write , and how do you know that he could n't do it if you gave him a chance ?
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 26]: How do you know he has n't some message -- something to say that might make the world just a little bit happier or wiser ?
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 15]: He MIGHT -- in time -- it 's a possibility not to be denied .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 24]: Now he ca n't deliver any message if he goes down there with you , and he wo n't HAVE any to deliver .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 32]: I do n't say going down with you is likely to injure his health , as I thought the shop would , and as the shop did , the first time .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 10]: I 'm not speaking as doctor now , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 49]: But I tell you one thing I know : if you take him down there you 'll kill something that I feel is in him , and it 's finer , I think , than his physical body , and you 'll kill it deader than a door-nail !
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 8]: And so why not let it live ?
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 14]: You 've about come to the end of your string , old fellow .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 14]: Why not stop this perpetual devilish fighting and give Bibbs his chance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 7]: Sheridan stood looking at him fixedly .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 7]: `` What ` fighting ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 7]: `` Yours -- with nature . ''
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 11]: Gurney sustained the daunting gaze of his fierce antagonist equably .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 17]: `` You do n't seem to understand that you 've been struggling against actual law . ''
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 5]: `` What law ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 8]: `` Natural law , '' said Gurney .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 10]: `` What do you think beat you with Edith ?
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 8]: Did Edith , herself , beat you ?
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 13]: Did n't she obey without question something powerful that was against you ?
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 42]: EDITH was n't against you , and you were n't against HER , but you set yourself against the power that had her in its grip , and it shot out a spurt of flame -- and won in a walk !
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 7]: What 's taken Roscoe from you ?
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 36]: Timbers bear just so much strain , old man ; but YOU wanted to send the load across the broken bridge , and you thought you could bully or coax the cracked thing into standing .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 6]: Well , you could n't !
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 5]: Now here 's Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 20]: There are thousands of men fit for the life you want him to lead -- and so is he .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 25]: It would n't take half of Bibbs 's brains to be twice as good a business man as Jim and Roscoe put together . ''
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 4]: `` WHAT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 8]: Sheridan goggled at him like a zany .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 40]: `` Your son Bibbs , '' said the doctor , composedly , `` Bibbs Sheridan has the kind and quantity of ` gray matter ' that will make him a success in anything -- if he ever wakes up !
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 9]: Personally I should prefer him to remain asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 6]: I like him that way .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 28]: But the thousands of men fit for the life you want him to lead are n't fit to do much with the life he OUGHT to lead .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 37]: Blindly , he 's been fighting for the chance to lead it -- he 's obeying something that begs to stay alive within him ; and , blindly , he knows you 'll crush it out .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 9]: You 've set your will to do it .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 7]: Let me tell you something more .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 30]: You do n't know what you 've become since Jim 's going thwarted you -- and that 's what was uppermost , a bafflement stronger than your normal grief .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 31]: You 're half mad with a consuming fury against the very self of the law -- for it was the very self of the law that took Jim from you .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 10]: That was a law concerning the cohesion of molecules .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 32]: The very self of the law took Roscoe from you and gave Edith the certainty of beating you ; and the very self of the law makes Bibbs deny you to-night .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 5]: The LAW beats you .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 7]: Have n't you been whipped enough ?
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 43]: But you want to whip the law -- you 've set yourself against it , to bend it to your own ends , to wield it and twist it -- '' The voice broke from Sheridan 's heaving chest in a shout .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 8]: And by God , I will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 11]: `` So Ajax defied the lightning , '' said Gurney .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 19]: `` I 've heard that dam ' - fool story , too , '' Sheridan retorted , fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 8]: `` That 's for chuldern and niggers .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 11]: It ai n't twentieth century , let me tell you !
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 12]: ` Defied the lightning , ' did he , the jackass !
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 17]: If he 'd been half a man he 'd ` a ' got away with it .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 26]: WE do n't go showin ' off defyin ' the lightning -- we hitch it up and make it work for us like a black-steer !
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 16]: A man nowadays would just as soon think o ' defyin ' a wood-shed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 8]: `` Well , what about Bibbs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 3]: said Gurney .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 23]: `` Will you be a really big man now and -- '' `` Gurney , you know a lot about bigness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 18]: Sheridan began to walk to and fro again , and the doctor returned gloomily to his chair .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 26]: He had shot his bolt the moment he judged its chance to strike center was best , but the target seemed unaware of the marksman .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 44]: `` I 'm tryin ' to make a big man out o ' that poor truck yonder , '' Sheridan went on , `` and you step in , beggin ' me to let him be Lord knows what -- I do n't !
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 20]: I suppose you figure it out that now I got a SON-IN-LAW , I might n't need a son !
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 12]: Yes , I got a son-in-law now -- a spender ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 9]: `` Oh , put your hand back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 5]: said Gurney , wearily .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 9]: There was a bronze inkstand upon the table .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 34]: Sheridan put his right hand in the sling , but with his left he swept the inkstand from the table and half-way across the room -- a comet with a destroying black tail .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 8]: Mrs. Sheridan shrieked and sprang toward it .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 6]: `` Let it lay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 5]: he shouted , fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 6]: `` Let it lay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 7]: And , weeping , she obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 25]: `` Yes , sir , '' he went on , in a voice the more ominous for the sudden hush he put upon it .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 9]: `` I got a spender for a son-in-law !
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 9]: It 's wonderful where property goes , sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 19]: There was ole man Tracy -- you remember him , Doc -- J. R. Tracy , solid banker .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 31]: He went into the bank as messenger , seventeen years old ; he was president at forty-three , and he built that bank with his life for forty years more .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 23]: He was down there from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon the day before he died -- over eighty !
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 6]: Gilt edge , that bank ?
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 5]: It was diamond edge !
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 30]: He used to eat a bag o ' peanuts and an apple for lunch ; but he was n't stingy -- he was just livin ' in his business .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 14]: He did n't care for pie or automobiles -- he had his bank .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 24]: It was an institution , and it come pretty near bein ' the beatin ' heart o ' this town in its time .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 22]: Well , that ole man used to pass one o ' these here turned-up-nose and turned-up-pants cigarette boys on the streets .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 9]: Never spoke to him , Tracy did n't .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 4]: Speak to him ?
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 2]: God !
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 10]: he would n't ` a ' coughed on him !
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 15]: He would n't ` a ' let him clean the cuspidors at the bank !
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 29]: Why , if he 'd ` a ' just seen him standin ' in FRONT the bank he 'd ` a ' had him run off the street .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 20]: And yet all Tracy was doin ' every day of his life was workin ' for that cigarette boy !
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 34]: Tracy thought it was for the bank ; he thought he was givin ' his life and his life-blood and the blood of his brain for the bank , but he was n't .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 39]: It was every bit -- from the time he went in at seventeen till he died in harness at eighty-three -- it was every last lick of it just slavin ' for that turned-up-nose , turned-up-pants cigarette boy .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 9]: AND TRACY DID N'T EVEN KNOW HIS NAME !
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 23]: He died , not ever havin ' heard it , though he chased him off the front steps of his house once .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 22]: The day after Tracy died his old-maid daughter married the cigarette -- and there AI N'T any Tracy bank any more !
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 19]: And now '' -- his voice rose again -- `` and now I got a cigarette son-in-law ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 20]: Gurney pointed to the flourishing right hand without speaking , and Sheridan once more returned it to the sling .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 13]: `` My son-in-law likes Florida this winter , '' Sheridan went on .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 24]: `` That 's good , and my son-in-law better enjoy it , because I do n't think he 'll be there next winter .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 20]: They got twelve-thousand dollars to spend , and I hear it can be done in Florida by rich sons-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 36]: When Roscoe 's woman got me to spend that much on a porch for their new house , Edith would n't give me a minute 's rest till I turned over the same to her .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 16]: And she 's got it , besides what I gave her to go East on .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 31]: It 'll be gone long before this time next year , and when she comes home and leaves the cigarette behind -- for good -- she 'll get some more .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 22]: MY name ai n't Tracy , and there ai n't goin ' to be any Tracy business in the Sheridan family .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 31]: And there ai n't goin ' to be any college foundin ' and endowin ' and trusteein ' , nor God-knows-what to keep my property alive when I 'm gone !
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 53]: Edith 'll be back , and she 'll get a girl 's share when she 's through with that cigarette , but -- '' `` By the way , '' interposed Gurney , `` did n't Mrs. Sheridan tell me that Bibbs warned you Edith would marry Lamhorn in New York ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 18]: Sheridan went completely to pieces : he swore , while his wife screamed and stopped her ears .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 41]: And as he swore he pounded the table with his wounded hand , and when the doctor , after storming at him ineffectively , sprang to catch and protect that hand , Sheridan wrenched it away , tearing the bandage .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 8]: He hammered the table till it leaped .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 4]: `` Fool ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 5]: he panted , choking .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 30]: `` If he 's shown gumption enough to guess right the first time in his life , it 's enough for me to begin learnin ' him on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 23]: And , struggling with the doctor , he leaned toward Bibbs , thrusting forward his convulsed face , which was deathly pale .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 12]: `` My name ai n't Tracy , I tell you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 5]: he screamed , hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 9]: `` You give in , you stubborn fool !
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 20]: I 've had my way with you before , and I 'll have my way with you now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 46]: Bibbs 's face was as white as his father 's , but he kept remembering that `` splendid look '' of Mary 's which he had told her would give him courage in a struggle , so that he would `` never give up . ''
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 11]: You ca n't have your way , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 21]: And then , obeying a significant motion of Gurney 's head , he went out quickly , leaving them struggling .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 31]: CHAPTER XXVII Mrs. Sheridan , in a wrapper , noiselessly opened the door of her husband 's room at daybreak the next morning , and peered within the darkened chamber .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 49]: At the `` old '' house they had shared a room , but the architect had chosen to separate them at the New , and they had not known how to formulate an objection , although to both of them something seemed vaguely reprehensible in the new arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 18]: Sheridan did not stir , and she was withdrawing her head from the aperture when he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 7]: `` Oh , I 'm AWAKE !
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 14]: Come in , if you want to , and shut the door . ''
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 8]: She came and sat by the bed .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 13]: `` I woke up thinkin ' about it , '' she explained .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 62]: `` And the more I thought about it the surer I got I must be right , and I knew you 'd be tormentin ' yourself if you was awake , so -- well , you got plenty other troubles , but I 'm just sure you ai n't goin ' to have the worry with Bibbs it looks like . ''
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 8]: `` You BET I ai n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 3]: he grunted .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 18]: `` Look how biddable he was about goin ' back to the Works , '' she continued .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 24]: `` He 's a right good-hearted boy , really , and sometimes I honestly have to say he seems right smart , too .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 11]: Now and then he 'll say something sounds right bright .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 48]: ` Course , most always it does n't , and a good deal of the time , when he says things , why , I have to feel glad we have n't got company , because they 'd think he did n't have any gumption at all .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 16]: Yet , look at the way he did when Jim -- when Jim got hurt .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 8]: He took right hold o ' things .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 64]: ` Course he 'd been sick himself so much and all -- and the rest of us never had , much , and we were kind o ' green about what to do in that kind o ' trouble -- still , he did take hold , and everything went off all right ; you 'll have to say that much , papa .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 25]: And Dr. Gurney says he 's got brains , and you ca n't deny but what the doctor 's right considerable of a man .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 29]: He acts sleepy , but that 's only because he 's got such a large practice -- he 's a pretty wide-awake kind of a man some ways .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 37]: Well , what he says last night about Bibbs himself bein ' asleep , and how much he 'd amount to if he ever woke up -- that 's what I got to thinkin ' about .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 36]: You heard him , papa ; he says , ` Bibbs 'll be a bigger business man than what Jim and Roscoe was put together -- if he ever wakes up , ' he says .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 9]: Was n't that exactly what he says ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 14]: `` I suppose so , '' said Sheridan , without exhibiting any interest .
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 25]: `` Gurney 's crazier 'n Bibbs , but if he was n't -- if what he says was true -- what of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 5]: `` Listen , papa .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 12]: Just suppose Bibbs took it into his mind to get married .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 18]: You know where he goes all the time -- '' `` Oh , Lord , yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 25]: Sheridan turned over in the bed , his face to the wall , leaving visible of himself only the thick grizzle of his hair .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 8]: `` You better go back to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 15]: He runs over there -- every minute she 'll let him , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 5]: Go back to bed .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 8]: There 's nothin ' in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 7]: `` WHY ai n't there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 3]: she urged .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 10]: `` I know better -- there is , too !
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 5]: You wait and see .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 44]: There 's just one thing in the world that 'll wake the sleepiest young man alive up -- yes , and make him JUMP up -- and I do n't care who he is or how sound asleep it looks like he is .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 27]: That 's when he takes it into his head to pick out some girl and settle down and have a home and chuldern of his own .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 13]: THEN , I guess , he 'll go out after the money !
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 4]: You 'll see .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 57]: I 've known dozens o ' cases , and so 've you -- moony , no - ` count young men , all notions and talk , goin ' to be ministers , maybe or something ; and there 's just this one thing takes it out of 'em and brings 'em right down to business .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 59]: Well , I never could make out just what it is Bibbs wants to be , really ; does n't seem he wants to be a minister exactly -- he 's so far-away you ca n't tell , and he never SAYS -- but I know this is goin ' to get him right down to common sense .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 43]: Now , I do n't say that Bibbs has got the idea in his head yet -- ' r else he would n't be talkin ' that fool-talk about nine dollars a week bein ' good enough for him to live on .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 21]: But it 's COMIN ' , papa , and he 'll JUMP for whatever you want to hand him out .
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 3]: He will !
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 34]: And I can tell you this much , too : he 'll want all the salary and stock he can get hold of , and he 'll hustle to keep gettin ' more .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 17]: That girl 's the kind that a young husband just goes crazy to give things to !
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 30]: She 's pretty and fine-lookin ' , and things look nice on her , and I guess she 'd like to have 'em about as well as the next .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 24]: And I guess she is n't gettin ' many these days , either , and she 'll be pretty ready for the change .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 38]: I saw her with her sleeves rolled up at the kitchen window the other day , and Jackson told me yesterday their cook left two weeks ago , and they have n't tried to hire another one .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 27]: He says her and her mother been doin ' the housework a good while , and now they 're doin ' the cookin , ' too .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 44]: ` Course Bibbs would n't know that unless she 's told him , and I reckon she would n't ; she 's kind o ' stiffish-lookin ' , and Bibbs is too up in the clouds to notice anything like that for himself .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 27]: They 've never asked him to a meal in the house , but he would n't notice that , either -- he 's kind of innocent .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 49]: Now I was thinkin ' -- you know , I do n't suppose we 've hardly mentioned the girl 's name at table since Jim went , but it seems to me maybe if -- '' Sheridan flung out his arms , uttering a sound half-groan , half-yawn .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 10]: `` You 're barkin ' up the wrong tree !
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 9]: Go on back to bed , mamma ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 6]: `` Why am I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 5]: she demanded , crossly .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 12]: `` Why am I barkin ' up the wrong tree ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 5]: `` Because you are .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 8]: There 's nothin ' in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 26]: `` I 'll bet you , '' she said , rising -- `` I 'll bet you he goes to church with her this morning .
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 7]: What you want to bet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 10]: `` Go back to bed , '' he commanded .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 22]: `` I KNOW what I 'm talkin ' about ; there 's nothin ' in it , I tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 6]: She shook her head perplexedly .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 21]: `` You think because -- because Jim was runnin ' so much with her it would n't look right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 8]: Nothin ' to do with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 17]: `` Then -- do you know something about it that you ai n't told me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 10]: `` Yes , I do , '' he grunted .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 5]: `` Now go on .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 8]: Maybe I can get a little sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 8]: I ai n't had any yet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 14]: `` Well -- '' She went to the door , her expression downcast .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 12]: `` I thought maybe -- but -- '' She coughed prefatorily .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 13]: `` Oh , papa , something else I wanted to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 36]: I was talkin ' to Roscoe over the ` phone last night when the telegram came , so I forgot to tell you , but -- well , Sibyl wants to come over this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 12]: Roscoe says she has something she wants to say to us .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 33]: It 'll be the first time she 's been out since she was able to sit up -- and I reckon she wants to tell us she 's sorry for what happened .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 33]: They expect to get off by the end o ' the week , and I reckon she wants to feel she 's done what she could to kind o ' make up .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 8]: Anyway , that 's what he said .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 60]: I ` phoned him again about Edith , and he said it would n't disturb Sibyl , because she 'd been expectin ' it ; she was sure all along it was goin ' to happen ; and , besides , I guess she 's got all that foolishness pretty much out of her , bein ' so sick .
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 41]: But what I thought was , no use bein ' rough with her , papa -- I expect she 's suffered a good deal -- and I do n't think we 'd ought to be , on Roscoe 's account .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 20]: You 'll -- you 'll be kind o ' polite to her , wo n't you , papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 16]: He mumbled something which was smothered under the coverlet he had pulled over his head .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 5]: she said , timidly .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 21]: `` I was just sayin ' I hoped you 'd treat Sibyl all right when she comes , this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 10]: You will , wo n't you , papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 7]: He threw the coverlet off furiously .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 6]: `` I presume so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 3]: he roared .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 4]: She departed guiltily .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 26]: But if he had accepted her proffered wager that Bibbs would go to church with Mary Vertrees that morning , Mrs. Sheridan would have lost .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 22]: Nevertheless , Bibbs and Mary did certainly set out from Mr. Vertrees 's house with the purpose of going to church .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 11]: That was their intention , and they had no other .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 7]: They meant to go to church .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 57]: But it happened that they were attentively preoccupied in a conversation as they came to the church ; and though Mary was looking to the right and Bibbs was looking to the left , Bibbs 's leftward glance converged with Mary 's rightward glance , and neither was looking far beyond the other at this time .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 54]: It also happened that , though they were a little jostled among groups of people in the vicinity of the church , they passed this somewhat prominent edifice without being aware of their proximity to it , and they had gone an incredible number of blocks beyond it before they discovered their error .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 24]: However , feeling that they might be embarrassingly late if they returned , they decided that a walk would make them as good .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 17]: It was a windless winter morning , with an inch of crisp snow over the ground .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 34]: So they walked , and for the most part they were silent , but on their way home , after they had turned back at noon , they began to be talkative again .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 18]: `` Mary , '' said Bibbs , after a time , `` am I a sleep-walker ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 9]: She laughed a little , then looked grave .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 9]: `` Does your father say you are ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 13]: `` Yes -- when he 's in a mood to flatter me .
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 6]: Other times , other names .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 7]: He has quite a list . ''
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 12]: `` You must n't mind , '' she said , gently .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 10]: `` He 's been getting some pretty severe shocks .
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 14]: What you 've told me makes me pretty sorry for him , Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 11]: I 've always been sure he 's very big . ''
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 5]: Big and -- blind .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 24]: He 's like a Hercules without eyes and without any consciousness except that of his strength and of his purpose to grow stronger .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 4]: Stronger for what ?
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 4]: For nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 7]: `` Are you sure , Bibbs ?
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 24]: It CA N'T be for nothing ; it must be stronger for something , even though he does n't know what it is .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 29]: Perhaps what he and his kind are struggling for is something so great they COULD N'T see it -- so great none of us could see it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 36]: `` No , he 's just like some blind , unconscious thing heaving underground -- '' `` Till he breaks through and leaps out into the daylight , '' she finished for him , cheerily .
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 9]: `` Into the smoke , '' said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 19]: `` Look at the powder of coal-dust already dirtying the decent snow , even though it 's Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 18]: That 's from the little pigs ; the big ones are n't so bad , on Sunday !
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 10]: There 's a fleck of soot on your cheek .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 19]: Some pig sent it out into the air ; he might as well have thrown it on you .
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 25]: It would have been braver , for then he 'd have taken his chance of my whipping him for it if I could . ''
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 18]: `` IS there soot on my cheek , Bibbs , or were you only saying so rhetorically ?
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 4]: IS there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 4]: `` Is there ?
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 14]: There ARE soot on your cheeks , Mary -- a fleck on each .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 9]: One landed since I mentioned the first . ''
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 25]: She halted immediately , giving him her handkerchief , and he succeeded in transferring most of the black from her face to the cambric .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 7]: They were entirely matter-of-course about it .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 31]: An elderly couple , it chanced , had been walking behind Bibbs and Mary for the last block or so , and passed ahead during the removal of the soot .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 5]: said the elderly wife .
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 12]: `` You 're always wrong when you begin guessing about strangers .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 17]: Those two young people are n't honeymooners at all -- they 've been married for years .
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 8]: A blind man could see that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 29]: `` I wish I did know who threw that soot on you , '' said Bibbs , looking up at the neighboring chimneys , as they went on .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 37]: `` They arrest children for throwing snowballs at the street-cars , but -- '' `` But they do n't arrest the street-cars for shaking all the pictures in the houses crooked every time they go by .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 7]: Nor for the uproar they make .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 17]: I wonder what 's the cost in nerves for the noise of the city each year .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 25]: Yes , we pay the price for living in a ` growing town , ' whether we have money to pay or none . ''
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 9]: `` Who is it gets the pay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 3]: said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 5]: `` Not I ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 3]: she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 5]: `` Nobody gets it .
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 11]: There is n't any pay ; there 's only money .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 12]: And only some of the men down-town get much of that .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 11]: That 's what my father wants me to get . ''
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 14]: `` Yes , '' she said , smiling to him , and nodding .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 16]: `` And you do n't want it , and you do n't need it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 14]: `` But you do n't think I 'm a sleep-walker , Mary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 27]: He had told her of his father 's new plans for him , though he had not described the vigor and picturesqueness of their setting forth .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 8]: `` You think I 'm right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 6]: `` A thousand times ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 26]: `` There are n't so many happy people in this world , I think -- and you say you 've found what makes you happy .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 10]: If it 's a dream -- keep it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 24]: `` The thought of going down there -- into the money shuffle -- I hate it as I never hated the shop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 5]: `` I hate it !
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 19]: And the city itself , the city that the money shuffle has made -- just look at it !
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 6]: Look at it in winter .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 47]: The snow 's tried hard to make the ugliness bearable , but the ugliness is winning ; it 's making the snow hideous ; the snow 's getting dirty on top , and it 's foul underneath with the dirt and disease of the unclean street .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 37]: And the dirt and the ugliness and the rush and the noise are n't the worst of it ; it 's what the dirt and ugliness and rush and noise MEAN -- that 's the worst !
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 33]: The outward things are insufferable , but they 're only the expression of a spirit -- a blind embryo of a spirit , not yet a soul -- oh , just greed !
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 8]: And this ` go ahead ' nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 9]: Ought n't it all to be a fellowship ?
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 26]: I should n't want to get ahead if I could -- I 'd want to help the other fellow to keep up with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 17]: `` I read something the other day and remembered it for you , '' said Mary .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 107]: `` It was something Burne-Jones said of a picture he was going to paint : ` In the first picture I shall make a man walking in the street of a great city , full of all kinds of happy life : children , and lovers walking , and ladies leaning from the windows all down great lengths of a street leading to the city walls ; and there the gates are wide open , letting in a space of green field and cornfield in harvest ; and all round his head a great rain of swirling autumn leaves blowing from a little walled graveyard . ''
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 118]: `` And if I painted , '' Bibbs returned , `` I 'd paint a lady walking in the street of a great city , full of all kinds of uproarious and futile life -- children being taught only how to make money , and lovers hurrying to get richer , and ladies who 'd given up trying to wash their windows clean , and the gates of the city wide open , letting in slums and slaughter-houses and freight-yards , and all round this lady 's head a great rain of swirling soot -- '' He paused , adding , thoughtfully : `` And yet I believe I 'm glad that soot got on your cheek .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 24]: It was just as if I were your brother -- the way you gave me your handkerchief to rub it off for you .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 12]: Still , Edith never -- '' `` Did n't she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 8]: said Mary , as he paused again .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 18]: And I -- '' He contented himself with shaking his head instead of offering more definite information .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 16]: Then he realized that they were passing the New House , and he sighed profoundly .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 10]: `` Mary , our walk 's almost over . ''
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 5]: She looked as blank .
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 8]: `` So it is , Bibbs . ''
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 11]: They said no more until they came to her gate .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 28]: As they drifted slowly to a stop , the door of Roscoe 's house opened , and Roscoe came out with Sibyl , who was startlingly pale .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 24]: She seemed little enfeebled by her illness , however , walking rather quickly at her husband 's side and not taking his arm .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 25]: The two crossed the street without appearing to see Mary and her companion , and entering the New House , were lost to sight .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 18]: Mary gazed after them gravely , but Bibbs , looking at Mary , did not see them .
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 13]: `` Mary , '' he said , `` you seem very serious .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 6]: Is anything bothering you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 6]: `` No , Bibbs . ''
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 16]: And she gave him a bright , quick look that made him instantly unreasonably happy .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 13]: `` I know you want to go in -- '' he began .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 7]: I do n't want to . ''
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 68]: `` I must n't keep you standing here , and I must n't go in with you -- but -- I just wanted to say -- I 've seemed very stupid to myself this morning , grumbling about soot and all that -- while all the time I -- Mary , I think it 's been the very happiest of all the hours you 've given me .
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 3]: I do .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 24]: And -- I do n't know just why -- but it 's seemed to me that it was one I 'd always remember .
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 19]: And you , '' he added , falteringly , `` you look so -- so beautiful to-day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 14]: `` It must have been the soot on my cheek , Bibbs . ''
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 10]: `` Mary , will you tell me something ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 7]: `` I think I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 21]: `` It 's something I 've had a lot of theories about , but none of them ever just fits .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 30]: You used to wear furs in the fall , but now it 's so much colder , you do n't -- you never wear them at all any more .
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 6]: Why do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 12]: Her eyes fell for a moment , and she grew red .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 6]: Then she looked up gaily .
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 20]: `` Bibbs , if I tell you the answer will you promise not to ask any more questions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 8]: Why did you stop wearing them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 12]: `` Because I found I 'd be warmer without them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 23]: She caught his hand quickly in her own for an instant , laughed into his eyes , and ran into the house .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 39]: CHAPTER XXVIII It is the consoling attribute of unused books that their decorative warmth will so often make even a ready-made library the actual `` living-room '' of a family to whom the shelved volumes are indeed sealed .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 48]: Thus it was with Sheridan , who read nothing except newspapers , business letters , and figures ; who looked upon books as he looked upon bric-a-brac or crocheting -- when he was at home , and not abed or eating , he was in the library .
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 33]: He stood in the many-colored light of the stained-glass window at the far end of the long room , when Roscoe and his wife came in , and he exhaled a solemnity .
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 56]: His deference to the Sabbath was manifest , as always , in the length of his coat and the closeness of his Saturday-night shave ; and his expression , to match this religious pomp , was more than Sabbatical , but the most dismaying of his demonstrations was his keeping his hand in his sling .
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 37]: Sibyl advanced to the middle of the room and halted there , not looking at him , but down at her muff , in which , it could be seen , her hands were nervously moving .
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 12]: Roscoe went to a chair in another part of the room .
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 6]: There was a deadly silence .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 31]: But Sibyl found a shaky voice , after an interval of gulping , though she was unable to lift her eyes , and the darkling lids continued to veil them .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 25]: She spoke hurriedly , like an ungifted child reciting something committed to memory , but her sincerity was none the less evident for that .
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 36]: `` Father Sheridan , you and mother Sheridan have always been so kind to me , and I would hate to have you think I do n't appreciate it , from the way I acted .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 76]: I 've come to tell you I am sorry for the way I did that night , and to say I know as well as anybody the way I behaved , and it will never happen again , because it 's been a pretty hard lesson ; and when we come back , some day , I hope you 'll see that you 've got a daughter-in-law you never need to be ashamed of again .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 39]: I want to ask you to excuse me for the way I did , and I can say I have n't any feelings toward Edith now , but only wish her happiness and good in her new life .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 48]: I thank you for all your kindness to me , and I know I made a poor return for it , but if you can overlook the way I behaved I know I would feel a good deal happier -- and I know Roscoe would , too .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 41]: I wish to promise not to be as foolish in the future , and the same error would never occur again to make us all so unhappy , if you can be charitable enought to excuse it this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 36]: He looked steadily at her without replying , and she stood before him , never lifting her eyes ; motionless , save where the moving fur proved the agitation of her hands within the muff .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 10]: `` All right , '' he said at last .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 21]: She looked up then with vast relief , though there was a revelation of heavy tears when the eyelids lifted .
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 8]: `` Thank you , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 29]: `` There 's something else -- about something different -- I want to say to you , but I want mother Sheridan to hear it , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 12]: `` She 's up-stairs in her room , '' said Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 7]: `` Roscoe -- '' Sibyl interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 32]: She had just seen Bibbs pass through the hall and begin to ascend the stairs ; and in a flash she instinctively perceived the chance for precisely the effect she wanted .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 11]: `` No , let me go , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 14]: `` I want to speak to her a minute first , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 25]: And she went away quickly , gaining the top of the stairs in time to see Bibbs enter his room and close the door .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 39]: Sibyl knew that Bibbs , in his room , had overheard her quarrel with Edith in the hall outside ; for bitter Edith , thinking the more to shame her , had subsequently informed her of the circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 42]: Sibyl had just remembered this , and with the recollection there had flashed the thought -- out of her own experience -- that people are often much more deeply impressed by words they overhear than by words directly addressed to them .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 12]: Sibyl intended to make it impossible for Bibbs not to overhear .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 36]: She did not hesitate -- her heart was hot with the old sore , and she believed wholly in the justice of her cause and in the truth of what she was going to say .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 19]: Fate was virtuous at times ; it had delivered into her hands the girl who had affronted her .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 8]: Mrs. Sheridan was in her own room .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 60]: The approach of Sibyl and Roscoe had driven her from the library , for she had miscalculated her husband 's mood , and she felt that if he used his injured hand as a mark of emphasis again , in her presence , she would -LRB- as she thought of it -RRB- `` have a fit right there . ''
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 20]: She heard Sibyl 's step , and pretended to be putting a touch to her hair before a mirror .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 16]: `` I was just coming down , '' she said , as the door opened .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 12]: `` Yes , he wants you to , '' said Sibyl .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 9]: `` It 's all right , mother Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 6]: He 's forgiven me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 8]: Mrs. Sheridan sniffed instantly ; tears appeared .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 25]: She kissed her daughter-in-law 's cheek ; then , in silence , regarded the mirror afresh , wiped her eyes , and applied powder .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 24]: `` And I hope Edith will be happy , '' Sibyl added , inciting more applications of Mrs. Sheridan 's handkerchief and powder .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 11]: `` Yes , yes , '' murmured the good woman .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 11]: `` We must n't make the worst of things . ''
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 26]: `` Well , there was something else I had to say , and he wants you to hear it , too , '' said Sibyl .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 10]: `` We better go down , mother Sheridan . ''
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 26]: She led the way , Mrs. Sheridan following obediently , but when they came to a spot close by Bibbs 's door , Sibyl stopped .
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 16]: `` I want to tell you about it first , '' she said , abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 35]: `` It is n't a secret , of course , in any way ; it 's something the whole family has to know , and the sooner the whole family knows it the better .
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 24]: It 's something it would n't be RIGHT for us ALL not to understand , and of course father Sheridan most of all .
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 28]: But I want to just kind of go over it first with you ; it 'll kind of help me to see I got it all straight .
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 36]: I have n't got any reason for saying it except the good of the family , and it 's nothing to me , one way or the other , of course , except for that .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 45]: I ought n't to 've behaved the way I did that night , and it seems to me if there 's anything I can do to help the family , I ought to , because it would help show I felt the right way .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 24]: Well , what I want to do is to tell this so 's to keep the family from being made a fool of .
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 49]: I do n't want to see the family just made use of and twisted around her finger by somebody that 's got no more heart than so much ice , and just as sure to bring troubles in the long run as -- as Edith 's mistake is .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 11]: Well , then , this is the way it is .
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 23]: I 'll just tell you how it looks to me and see if it do n't strike you the same way . ''
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 16]: Within the room , Bibbs , much annoyed , tapped his ear with his pencil .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 17]: He wished they would n't stand talking near his door when he was trying to write .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 45]: He had just taken from his trunk the manuscript of a poem begun the preceding Sunday afternoon , and he had some ideas he wanted to fix upon paper before they maliciously seized the first opportunity to vanish , for they were but gossamer .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 33]: Bibbs was pleased with the beginnings of his poem , and if he could carry it through he meant to dare greatly with it -- he would venture it upon an editor .
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 65]: For he had his plan of life now : his day would be of manual labor and thinking -- he could think of his friend and he could think in cadences for poems , to the crashing of the strong machine -- and if his father turned him out of home and out of the Works , he would work elsewhere and live elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 26]: His father had the right , and it mattered very little to Bibbs -- he faced the prospect of a working-man 's lodging-house without trepidation .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 41]: He could find a washstand to write upon , he thought ; and every evening when he left Mary he would write a little ; and he would write on holidays and on Sundays -- on Sundays in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 35]: In a lodging-house , at least he would n't be interrupted by his sister-in-law 's choosing the immediate vicinity of his door for conversations evidently important to herself , but merely disturbing to him .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 19]: He frowned plaintively , wishing he could think of some polite way of asking her to go away .
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 19]: But , as she went on , he started violently , dropping manuscript and pencil upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 53]: `` I do n't know whether you heard it , mother Sheridan , '' she said , `` but this old Vertrees house , next door , had been sold on foreclosure , and all THEY got out of it was an agreement that let 's 'em live there a little longer .
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 43]: Roscoe told me , and he says he heard Mr. Vertrees has been up and down the streets more 'n two years , tryin ' to get a job he could call a ` position , ' and could n't land it .
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 10]: You heard anything about it , mother Sheridan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 23]: `` Well , I DID know they been doin ' their own house-work a good while back , '' said Mrs. Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 14]: `` And now they 're doin ' the cookin ' , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 11]: Sibyl sent forth a little titter with a sharp edge .
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 9]: `` I hope they find something to cook !
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 11]: She sold her piano mighty quick after Jim died ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 4]: Bibbs jumped up .
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 35]: He was trembling from head to foot and he was dizzy -- of all the real things he could never have dreamed in his dream the last would have been what he heard now .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 17]: He felt that something incredible was happening , and that he was powerless to stop it .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 38]: It seemed to him that heavy blows were falling on his head and upon Mary 's ; it seemed to him that he and Mary were being struck and beaten physically -- and that something hideous impended .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 24]: He wanted to shout to Sibyl to be silent , but he could not ; he could only stand , swallowing and trembling .
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 20]: `` What I think the whole family ought to understand is just this , '' said Sibyl , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 24]: `` Those people were so hard up that this Miss Vertrees started after Bibbs before they knew whether he was INSANE or not !
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 38]: They 'd got a notion he might be , from his being in a sanitarium , and Mrs. Vertrees ASKED me if he was insane , the very first day Bibbs took the daughter out auto-riding ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 14]: She paused a moment , looking at Mrs. Sheridan , but listening intently .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 9]: There was no sound from within the room .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 4]: exclaimed Mrs. Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 12]: `` It 's the truth , '' Sibyl declared , loudly .
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 15]: `` Oh , of course we were all crazy about that girl at first .
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 30]: We were pretty green when we moved up here , and we thought she 'd get us IN -- but it did n't take ME long to read her !
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 27]: Her family were down and out when it came to money -- and they had to go after it , one way or another , SOMEHOW !
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 29]: So she started for Roscoe ; but she found out pretty quick he was married , and she turned right around to Jim -- and she landed him !
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 39]: There 's no doubt about it , she had Jim , and if he 'd lived you 'd had another daughter-in-law before this , as sure as I stand here telling you the God 's truth about it !
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 20]: Well -- when Jim was left in the cemetery she was waiting out there to drive home with Bibbs !
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 30]: Jim was n't COLD -- and she did n't know whether Bibbs was insane or not , but he was the only one of the rich Sheridan boys left .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 7]: She had to get him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 41]: The texture of what was the truth made an even fabric with what was not , in Sibyl 's mind ; she believed every word that she uttered , and she spoke with the rapidity and vehemence of fierce conviction .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 23]: `` What I feel about it is , '' she said , `` it ought n't to be allowed to go on .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 5]: It 's too mean !
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 34]: I like poor Bibbs , and I do n't want to see him made such a fool of , and I do n't want to see the family made such a fool of !
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 39]: I like poor Bibbs , but if he 'd only stop to think a minute himself he 'd have to realize he is n't the kind of man ANY girl would be apt to fall in love with .
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 25]: He 's better-looking lately , maybe , but you know how he WAS -- just kind of a long white rag in good clothes .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 17]: And girls like men with some SO to 'em -- SOME sort of dashingness , anyhow !
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 17]: Nobody ever looked at poor Bibbs before , and neither 'd she -- no , SIR !
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 11]: not till she 'd tried both Roscoe and Jim first !
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 29]: It was only when her and her family got desperate that she -- '' Bibbs -- whiter than when he came from the sanitarium -- opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 11]: He stepped across its threshold and stook looking at her .
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 4]: Both women screamed .
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 7]: `` Oh , good heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 3]: cried Sibyl .
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 6]: `` Were you in THERE ?
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 20]: Oh , I would n't -- '' She seized Mrs. Sheridan 's arm , pulling her toward the stairway .
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 8]: `` Come on , mother Sheridan ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 24]: she urged , and as the befuddled and confused lady obeyed , Sibyl left a trail of noisy exclamations : `` Good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 9]: Oh , I would n't -- too bad !
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 8]: I did n't DREAM he was there !
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 7]: I would n't hurt his feelings !
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 5]: Not for the world !
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 9]: Of course he had to know SOME time !
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 45]: But , good heavens -- '' She heard his door close as she and Mrs. Sheridan reached the top of the stairs , and she glanced over her shoulder quickly , but Bibbs was not following ; he had gone back into his room .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 12]: `` He -- he looked -- oh , terrible bad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 4]: stammered Mrs. Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 25]: `` I -- I wish -- '' `` Still , it 's a good deal better he knows about it , '' said Sibyl .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 16]: `` I should n't wonder it might turn out the very best thing could happened .
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 4]: Come on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 19]: And completing their descent to the library , the two made their appearance to Roscoe and his father .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 37]: Sibyl at once gave a full and truthful account of what had taken place , repeating her own remarks , and omitting only the fact that it was through her design that Bibbs had overheard them .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 33]: `` But as I told mother Sheridan , '' she said , in conclusion , `` it might turn out for the very best that he did hear -- just that way .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 10]: Do n't you think so , father Sheridan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 28]: He merely grunted in reply , and sat rubbing the thick hair on the top of his head with his left hand and looking at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 45]: He had given no sign of being impressed in any manner by her exposure of Mary Vertrees 's character ; but his impassivity did not dismay Sibyl -- it was Bibbs whom she desired to impress , and she was content in that matter .
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 15]: `` I 'm sure it was all for the best , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 13]: `` It 's over now , and he knows what she is .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 49]: In one way I think it was lucky , because , just hearing a thing that way , a person can tell it 's SO -- and he knows I have n't got any ax to grind except his own good and the good of the family . ''
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 16]: Mrs. Sheridan went nervously to the door and stood there , looking toward the stairway .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 18]: `` I wish -- I wish I knew what he was doin ' , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 7]: `` He did look terrible bad .
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 18]: It was like something had been done to him that was -- I do n't know what .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 9]: I never saw anybody look like he did .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 6]: He looked -- so queer .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 17]: It was like you 'd -- '' She called down the hall , `` George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 5]: `` Yes 'm ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 13]: `` Were you up in Mr. Bibbs 's room just now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 4]: `` Yes 'm .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 13]: He ring bell ; tole me make him fiah in his grate .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 8]: I done buil ' him nice fiah .
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 10]: I reckon he ain ' feelin ' so well .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 4]: Yes 'm . ''
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 3]: He departed .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 12]: `` What do you expect he wants a fire for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 8]: she asked , turning toward her husband .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 23]: `` The house is warm as can be , I do wish I -- '' `` Oh , quit frettin ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 3]: said Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 18]: `` Well , I -- I kind o ' wish you had n't said anything , Sibyl .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 44]: I know you meant it for the best and all , but I do n't believe it would been so much harm if -- '' `` Mother Sheridan , you do n't mean you WANT that kind of a girl in the family ?
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 22]: Why , she -- '' `` I do n't know , I do n't know , '' the troubled woman quavered .
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 15]: `` If he liked her it seems kind of a pity to spoil it .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 14]: He 's so queer , and he has n't ever taken much enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 28]: And besides , I believe the way it was , there was more chance of him bein ' willin ' to do what papa wants him to .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 16]: If she wants to marry him -- '' Sheridan interrupted her with a hooting laugh .
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 6]: `` She do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 12]: `` You 're barkin ' up the wrong tree , Sibyl .
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 10]: She ai n't that kind of a girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 16]: `` But , father Sheridan , did n't she -- '' He cut her short .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 5]: `` That 's enough .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 11]: You may mean all right , but you guess wrong .
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 7]: So do you , mamma . ''
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 7]: Sibyl cried out , `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 21]: But just LOOK how she ran after Jim -- '' `` She did not , '' he said , curtly .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 7]: `` She would n't take Jim .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 7]: She turned him down cold . ''
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 12]: `` But that 's impossi -- '' `` It 's not .
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 6]: I KNOW she did . ''
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 5]: Sibyl looked flatly incredulous .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 16]: `` And YOU need n't worry , '' he said , turning to his wife .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 22]: `` This wo n't have any effect on your idea , because there was n't any sense to it , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 18]: D'you think she 'd be very likely to take Bibbs -- after she would n't take JIM ?
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 70]: She 's a good-hearted girl , and she lets Bibbs come to see her , but if she 'd ever given him one sign of encouragement the way you women think , he would n't of acted the stubborn fool he has -- he 'd ` a ' been at me long ago , beggin ' me for some kind of a job he could support a wife on .
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 40]: There 's nothin ' in it -- and I 've got the same old fight with him on my hands I 've had all his life -- and the Lord knows what he wo n't do to balk me !
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 20]: What 's happened now 'll probably only make him twice as stubborn , but -- '' `` SH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 12]: Mrs. Sheridan , still in the doorway , lifted her hand .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 13]: `` That 's his step -- he 's comin ' down-stairs . ''
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 16]: She shrank away from the door as if she feared to have Bibbs see her .
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 28]: `` I -- I wonder -- '' she said , almost in a whisper -- `` I wonder what he 'd goin ' -- to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 9]: Her timorousness had its effect upon the others .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 26]: Sheridan rose , frowning , but remained standing beside his chair ; and Roscoe moved toward Sibyl , who stared uneasily at the open doorway .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 15]: They listened as the slow steps descended the stairs and came toward the library .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 29]: Bibbs stopped upon the threshold , and with sick and haggard eyes looked slowly from one to the other until at last his gaze rested upon his father .
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 8]: Then he came and stood before him .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 19]: `` I 'm sorry you 've had so much trouble with me , '' he said , gently .
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 8]: `` You wo n't , any more .
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 10]: I 'll take the job you offered me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 36]: Sheridan did not speak -- he stared , astounded and incredulous ; and Bibbs had left the room before any of its occupants uttered a sound , though he went as slowly as he came .
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 8]: Mrs. Sheridan was the first to move .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 15]: She went nervously back to the doorway , and then out into the hall .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 7]: Bibbs had gone from the house .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 34]: Bibbs 's mother had a feeling about him then that she had never known before ; it was indefinite and vague , but very poignant -- something in her mourned for him uncomprehendingly .
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 21]: She felt that an awful thing had been done to him , though she did not know what it was .
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 7]: She went up to his room .
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 18]: The fire George had built for him was almost smothered under thick , charred ashes of paper .
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 29]: The lid of his trunk stood open , and the large upper tray , which she remembered to have seen full of papers and note-books , was empty .
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 28]: And somehow she understood that Bibbs had given up the mysterious vocation he had hoped to follow -- and that he had given it up for ever .
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 34]: She thought it was the wisest thing he could have done -- and yet , for an unknown reason , she sat upon the bed and wept a little before she went down-stairs .
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 11]: So Sheridan had his way with Bibbs , all through .
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 53]: CHAPTER XXIX As Bibbs came out of the New House , a Sunday trio was in course of passage upon the sidewalk : an ample young woman , placid of face ; a black-clad , thin young man , whose expression was one of habitual anxiety , habitual wariness and habitual eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 28]: He propelled a perambulator containing the third -- and all three were newly cleaned , Sundayfied , and made fit to dine with the wife 's relatives .
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 16]: `` How 'd you like for me to be THAT young fella , mamma ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 4]: the husband whispered .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 18]: `` He 's one of the sons , and there ai n't but two left now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 7]: The wife stared curiously at Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 12]: `` Well , I do n't know , '' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 13]: `` He looks to me like he had his own troubles . ''
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 33]: `` I expect he has , like anybody else , '' said the young husband , `` but I guess we could stand a good deal if we had his money . ''
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 24]: `` Well , maybe , if you keep on the way you been , baby 'll be as well fixed as the Sheridans .
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 6]: You ca n't tell . ''
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 11]: She glanced back at Bibbs , who had turned north .
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 13]: `` He walks kind of slow and stooped over , like . ''
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 25]: `` So much money in his pockets it makes him sag , I guess , '' said the young husband , with bitter admiration .
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 26]: Mary , happening to glance from a window , saw Bibbs coming , and she started , clasping her hands together in a sudden alarm .
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 7]: She met him at the door .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 4]: `` Bibbs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 6]: `` What is the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 28]: I saw something was terribly wrong when I -- You look -- '' She paused , and he came in , not lifting his eyes to hers .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 20]: Always when he crossed that threshold he had come with his head up and his wistful gaze seeking hers .
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 7]: `` Ah , poor boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 11]: she said , with a gesture of understanding and pity .
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 8]: `` I know what it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 17]: He followed her into the room where they always sat , and sank into a chair .
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 11]: `` You need n't tell me , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 8]: `` They 've made you give up .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 14]: Your father 's won -- you 're going to do what he wants .
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 6]: You 've given up . ''
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 13]: Still without looking at her , he inclined his head in affirmation .
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 15]: She gave a little cry of compassion , and came and sat near him .
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 7]: `` Bibbs , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 14]: `` I can be glad of one thing , though it 's selfish .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 10]: I can be glad you came straight to me .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 17]: It 's more to me than even if you 'd come because you were happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 26]: She did not speak again for a little while ; then she said : `` Bibbs -- dear -- could you tell me about it ?
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 6]: Do you want to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 33]: Still he did not look up , but in a voice , shaken and husky he asked her a question so grotesque that at first she thought she had misunderstood his words .
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 14]: `` Mary , '' he said , `` could you marry me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 9]: `` What did you say , Bibbs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 5]: she asked , quietly .
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 8]: His tone and attitude did not change .
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 7]: `` Will you marry me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 16]: Both of her hands leaped to her cheeks -- she grew red and then white .
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 38]: She rose slowly and moved backward from him , staring at him , at first incredulously , then with an intense perplexity more and more luminous in her wide eyes ; it was like a spoken question .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 19]: The room filled with strangeness in the long silence -- the two were so strange to each other .
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 13]: At last she said : `` What made you say that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 5]: He did not answer .
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 8]: `` Bibbs , look at me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 7]: Her voice was loud and clear .
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 7]: `` What made you say that ?
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 5]: Look at me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 13]: He could not look at her , and he could not speak .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 9]: `` What was it that made you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 9]: `` I want you to tell me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 18]: She went closer to him , her eyes ever brighter and wider with that intensity of wonder .
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 30]: `` You 've given up -- to your father , '' she said , slowly , `` and then you came to ask me -- '' She broke off .
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 12]: `` Bibbs , do you want me to marry you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 10]: `` Yes , '' he said , just audibly .
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 5]: `` You do not .
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 7]: Then what made you ask me ?
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 8]: What is it that 's happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 4]: `` Nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 7]: `` Wait , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 5]: `` Let me think .
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 20]: It 's something that happened since our walk this morning -- yes , since you left me at noon .
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 19]: Something happened that -- '' She stopped abruptly , with a tremulous murmur of amazement and dawning comprehension .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 11]: She remembered that Sibyl had gone to the New House .
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 29]: Bibbs swallowed painfully and contrived to say , `` I do -- I do want you to -- marry me , if -- if -- you could . ''
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 11]: She looked at him , and slowly shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 21]: `` Bibbs , do you -- '' Her voice was as unsteady as his -- little more than a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 13]: `` Do you think I 'm -- in love with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 7]: `` No , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 33]: Somewhere in the still air of the room there was a whispered word ; it did not seem to come from Mary 's parted lips , but he was aware of it .
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 22]: `` I 've had nothing but dreams , '' Bibbs said , desolately , `` but they were n't like that .
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 10]: Sibyl said no girl could care about me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 13]: He smiled faintly , though still he did not look at Mary .
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 23]: `` And when I first came home Edith told me Sibyl was so anxious to marry that she 'd have married ME .
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 12]: She meant it to express Sibyl 's extremity , you see .
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 11]: But I hardly needed either of them to tell me .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 16]: I had n't thought of myself as -- well , not as particularly captivating ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 12]: Oddly enough , Mary 's pallor changed to an angry flush .
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 5]: `` Those two ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 15]: she exclaimed , sharply ; and then , with thoroughgoing contempt : `` Lamhorn !
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 6]: That 's like them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 18]: She turned away , went to the bare little black mantel , and stood leaning upon it .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 22]: Presently she asked : `` WHEN did Mrs. Roscoe Sheridan say that ` no girl ' could care about you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 4]: `` To-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 6]: Mary drew a deep breath .
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 13]: `` I think I 'm beginning to understand -- a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 19]: She bit her lip ; there was anger in good truth in her eyes and in her voice .
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 10]: `` Answer me once more , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 15]: `` Bibbs , do you know now why I stopped wearing my furs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 5]: `` I thought so !
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 10]: Your sister-in-law told you , did n't she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 20]: `` I -- I heard her say -- '' `` I think I know what happened , now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 15]: Mary 's breath came fast and her voice shook , but she spoke rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 11]: `` You ` heard her say ' more than that .
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 49]: You ` heard her say ' that we were bitterly poor , and on that account I tried first to marry your brother -- and then -- '' But now she faltered , and it was only after a convulsive effort that she was able to go on .
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 12]: `` And then -- that I tried to marry -- you !
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 88]: You ` heard her say ' that -- and you believe that I do n't care for you and that ` no girl ' could care for you -- but you think I am in such an ` extremity , ' as Sibyl was -- that you -- And so , not wanting me , and believing that I could not want you -- except for my ` extremity ' -- you took your father 's offer and then came to ask me -- to marry you !
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 38]: What had I shown you of myself that could make you -- '' Suddenly she sank down , kneeling , with her face buried in her arms upon the lap of a chair , tears overwhelming her .
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 6]: `` Mary , Mary ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 5]: he cried , helplessly .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 12]: `` Oh NO -- you -- you do n't understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 7]: `` I do , though ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 3]: she sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 5]: `` I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 7]: He came and stood beside her .
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 6]: `` You kill me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 8]: `` I ca n't make it plain .
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 14]: From the first of your loveliness to me , I was all self .
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 11]: It was always you that gave and I that took .
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 13]: I was the dependent -- I did nothing but lean on you .
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 10]: We always talked of me , not of you .
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 10]: It was all about my idiotic distresses and troubles .
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 21]: I thought of you as a kind of wonderful being that had no mortal or human suffering except by sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 18]: You seemed to lean down -- out of a rosy cloud -- to be kind to me .
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 10]: I never dreamed I could do anything for YOU !
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 15]: I never dreamed you could need anything to be done for you by anybody .
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 31]: And to-day I heard that -- that you -- '' `` You heard that I needed to marry -- some one -- anybody -- with money , '' she sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 22]: `` And you thought we were so -- so desperate -- you believed that I had -- '' `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 5]: he said , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 17]: `` I did n't believe you 'd done one kind thing for me -- for that .
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 6]: No , no , no !
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 14]: I knew you 'd NEVER thought of me except generously -- to give .
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 10]: I said I could n't make it plain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 5]: he cried , despairingly .
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 4]: `` Wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 16]: She lifted her head and extended her hands to him unconsciously , like a child .
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 8]: `` Help me up , Bibbs . ''
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 47]: Then , when she was once more upon her feet , she wiped her eyes and smiled upon him ruefully and faintly , but reassuringly , as if to tell him , in that way , that she knew he had not meant to hurt her .
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 27]: And that smile of hers , so lamentable , but so faithfully friendly , misted his own eyes , for his shamefacedness lowered them no more .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 16]: `` Let me tell you what you want to tell me , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 29]: `` You ca n't , because you ca n't put it into words -- they are too humiliating for me and you 're too gentle to say them .
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 10]: Tell me , though , is n't it true ?
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 21]: You did n't believe that I 'd tried to make you fall in love with me -- '' `` Never !
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 6]: Never for an instant ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 25]: `` You did n't believe I 'd tried to make you want to marry me -- '' `` No , no , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 7]: `` I believe it , Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 30]: You thought that I was fond of you ; you knew I cared for you -- but you did n't think I might be -- in love with you .
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 58]: But you thought that I might marry you without being in love with you because you did believe I had tried to marry your brother , and -- '' `` Mary , I only knew -- for the first time -- that you -- that you were -- '' `` Were desperately poor , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 8]: `` You ca n't even say that !
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 17]: Bibbs , it was true : I did try to make Jim want to marry me .
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 4]: I did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 12]: And she sank down into the chair , weeping bitterly again .
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 4]: Bibbs was agonized .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 17]: `` Mary , '' he groaned , `` I did n't know you COULD cry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 7]: `` Listen , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 13]: `` Listen till I get through -- I want you to understand .
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 12]: We were poor , and we were n't fitted to be .
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 14]: We never had been , and we did n't know what to do .
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 52]: We 'd been almost rich ; there was plenty , but my father wanted to take advantage of the growth of the town ; he wanted to be richer , but instead -- well , just about the time your father finished building next door we found we had n't anything .
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 38]: People say that , sometimes , meaning that they have n't anything in comparison with other people of their own kind , but we really had n't anything -- we had n't anything at all , Bibbs !
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 7]: And we could n't DO anything .
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 42]: You might wonder why I did n't ` try to be a stenographer ' -- and I wonder myself why , when a family loses its money , people always say the daughters ` ought to go and be stenographers . '
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 4]: It 's curious !
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 14]: -- as if a wave of the hand made you into a stenographer .
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 24]: No , I 'd been raised to be either married comfortably or a well-to-do old maid , if I chose not to marry .
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 27]: The poverty came on slowly , Bibbs , but at last it was all there -- and I did n't know how to be a stenographer .
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 28]: I did n't know how to be anything except a well-to-do old maid or somebody 's wife -- and I could n't be a well-to-do old maid .
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 17]: Then , Bibbs , I did what I 'd been raised to know how to do .
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 10]: I went out to be fascinating and be married .
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 16]: I did it openly , at least , and with a kind of decent honesty .
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 33]: I told your brother I had meant to fascinate him and that I was not in love with him , but I let him think that perhaps I meant to marry him .
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 9]: I think I did mean to marry him .
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 26]: I had never cared for anybody , and I thought it might be there really WAS N'T anything more than a kind of excited fondness .
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 42]: I ca n't be sure , but I think that though I did mean to marry him I never should have done it , because that sort of a marriage is -- it 's sacrilege -- something would have stopped me .
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 12]: Something did stop me ; it was your sister-in-law , Sibyl .
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 30]: She meant no harm -- but she was horrible , and she put what I was doing into such horrible words -- and they were the truth -- oh !
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 4]: I SAW myself !
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 39]: She was proposing a miserable compact with me -- and I could n't breathe the air of the same room with her , though I 'd so cheapened myself she had a right to assume that I WOULD .
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 5]: But I could n't !
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 16]: I left her , and I wrote to your brother -- just a quick scrawl .
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 23]: I told him just what I 'd done ; I asked his pardon , and I said I would not marry him .
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 11]: I posted the letter , but he never got it .
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 8]: That was the afternoon he was killed .
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 6]: That 's all , Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 14]: Now you know what I did -- and you know -- ME ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 20]: She pressed her clenched hands tightly against her eyes , leaning far forward , her head bowed before him .
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 13]: Bibbs had forgotten himself long ago ; his heart broke for her .
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 17]: `` Could n't you -- Is n't there -- Wo n't you -- '' he stammered .
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 9]: `` Mary , I 'm going with father .
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 22]: Is n't there some way you could use the money without -- without -- '' She gave a choked little laugh .
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 13]: `` You gave me something to live for , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 18]: `` You kept me alive , I think -- and I 've hurt you like this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 8]: `` Not you -- oh no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 9]: `` You could forgive me , Mary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 8]: `` Oh , a thousand times ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 19]: Her right hand went out in a faltering gesture , and just touched his own for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 9]: `` But there 's nothing to forgive . ''
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 19]: `` And you ca n't -- you ca n't -- '' `` Ca n't what , Bibbs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 11]: `` You could n't -- '' `` Marry you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 5]: she said for him .
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 8]: `` No , no , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 31]: She sprang up , facing him , and , without knowing what she did , she set her hands upon his breast , pushing him back from her a little .
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 9]: `` I ca n't , I ca n't !
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 6]: Do n't you SEE ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 9]: `` Mary -- '' `` No , no !
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 30]: And you must go now , Bibbs ; I ca n't bear any more -- please -- '' `` MARY -- '' `` Never , never , never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 9]: she cried , in a passion of tears .
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 8]: `` You must n't come any more .
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 8]: I ca n't see you , dear !
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 7]: Never , never , never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 24]: Somehow , in helpless , stumbling obedience to her beseeching gesture , he got himself to the door and out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 19]: CHAPTER XXX Sibyl and Roscoe were upon the point of leaving when Bibbs returned to the New House .
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 19]: He went straight to Sibyl and spoke to her quietly , but so that the others might hear .
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 38]: `` When you said that if I 'd stop to think , I 'd realize that no one would be apt to care enough about me to marry me , you were right , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 18]: `` I thought perhaps you were n't , and so I asked Miss Vertrees to marry me .
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 16]: It proved what you said of me , and disproved what you said of her .
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 4]: She refused . ''
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 18]: And , having thus spoken , he quitted the room as straightforwardly as he had entered it .
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 7]: `` He 's SO queer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 4]: Mrs. Sheridan gasped .
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 13]: `` Who on earth would thought of his doin ' THAT ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 12]: `` I told you , '' said her husband , grimly .
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 24]: `` You did n't tell us he 'd go over there and -- '' `` I told you she would n't have him .
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 14]: I told you she would n't have JIM , did n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 6]: Sibyl was altogether taken aback .
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 8]: `` Do you supose it 's true ?
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 8]: Do you suppose she WOULD N'T ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 26]: `` He did n't look exactly like a young man that had just got things fixed up fine with his girl , '' said Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 10]: `` Not to me , he did n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 27]: `` But why would -- '' `` I told you , '' he interrupted , angrily , `` she ai n't that kind of a girl !
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 42]: If you got to have proof , well , I 'll tell you and get it over with , though I 'd pretty near just as soon not have to talk a whole lot about my dead boy 's private affairs .
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 21]: She wrote to Jim she could n't take him , and it was a good , straight letter , too .
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 12]: It came to Jim 's office ; he never saw it .
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 10]: She wrote it the afternoon he was hurt . ''
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 19]: `` I remember I saw her put a letter in the mail-box that afternoon , '' said Roscoe .
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 8]: `` Do n't you remember , Sibyl ?
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 23]: I told you about it -- I was waiting for you while you were in there so long talking to her mother .
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 21]: It was just before we saw that something was wrong over here , and Edith came and called me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 9]: Sibyl shook her head , but she remembered .
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 43]: And she was not cast down , for , although some remnants of perplexity were left in her eyes , they were dimmed by an increasing glow of triumph ; and she departed -- after some further fragmentary discourse -- visibly elated .
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 29]: After all , the guilty had not been exalted ; and she perceived vaguely , but none the less surely , that her injury had been copiously avenged .
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 21]: She bestowed a contented glance upon the old house with the cupola , as she and Roscoe crossed the street .
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 38]: When they had gone , Mrs. Sheridan indulged in reverie , but after a while she said , uneasily , `` Papa , you think it would be any use to tell Bibbs about that letter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 16]: `` I do n't know , '' he answered , walking moodily to the window .
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 9]: `` I been thinkin ' about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 6]: He came to a decision .
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 7]: `` I reckon I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 9]: And he went up to Bibbs 's room .
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 13]: `` Well , you goin ' back on what you said ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 11]: he inquired , brusquely , as he opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 16]: `` You goin ' to take it back and lay down on me again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 16]: `` Well , perhaps I did n't have any call to accuse you of that .
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 29]: I do n't know as you ever did go back on anything you said , exactly , though the Lord knows you 've laid down on me enough .
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 5]: You certainly have ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 4]: Sheridan was baffled .
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 34]: This was not what he wished to say , but his words were unmanageable ; he found himself unable to control them , and his querulous abuse went on in spite of him .
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 48]: `` I ca n't say I expect much of you -- not from the way you always been , up to now -- unless you turn over a new leaf , and I do n't see any encouragement to think you 're goin ' to do THAT !
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 25]: If you go down there and show a spark o ' real GIT-up , I reckon the whole office 'll fall in a faint .
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 26]: But if you 're ever goin ' to show any , you better begin right at the beginning and begin to show it to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 8]: `` Yes -- I 'll try . ''
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 11]: `` You better , if it 's in you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 5]: Sheridan was sheerly nonplussed .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 19]: He had always been able to say whatever he wished to say , but his tongue seemed bewitched .
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 31]: He had come to tell Bibbs about Mary 's letter , and to his own angry astonishment he found it impossible to do anything except to scold like a drudge-driver .
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 41]: `` You better come down there with your mind made up to hustle harder than the hardest workin ' - man that 's under you , or you 'll not get on very good with me , I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 37]: The way to get ahead -- and you better set it down in your books -- the way to get ahead is to do ten times the work of the hardest worker that works FOR you .
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 11]: But you do n't know what work is , yet .
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 31]: All you 've ever done was just stand around and feed a machine a child could handle , and then come home and take a bath and go callin ' .
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 81]: I tell you you 're up against a mighty different proposition now , and if you 're worth your salt -- and you never showed any signs of it yet -- not any signs that stuck out enough to bang somebody on the head and make 'em sit up and take notice -- well , I want to say , right here and now -- and you better listen , because I want to say just what I DO say .
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 11]: I say -- '' He meandered to a full stop .
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 13]: His mouth hung open , and his mind was a hopeless blank .
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 11]: Bibbs looked up patiently -- an old , old look .
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 10]: `` Yes , father ; I 'm listening . ''
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 12]: `` That 's all , '' said Sheridan , frowning heavily .
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 20]: `` That 's all I came to say , and you better see ' t you remember it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 19]: He shook his head warningly , and went out , closing the door behind him with a crash .
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 10]: However , no sound of footsteps indicated his departure .
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 15]: He stopped just outside the door , and stood there a minute or more .
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 18]: Then abruptly he turned the knob and exhibited to his son a forehead liberally covered with perspiration .
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 10]: `` Look here , '' he said , crossly .
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 19]: `` That girl over yonder wrote Jim a letter -- '' `` I know , '' said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 6]: `` She told me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 49]: `` Well , I thought you need n't feel so much upset about it -- '' The door closed on his voice as he withdrew , but the conclusion of the sentence was nevertheless audible -- `` if you knew she would n't have Jim , either . ''
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 26]: And he stamped his way down-stairs to tell his wife to quit her frettin ' and not bother him with any more fool 's errands .
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 24]: She was about to inquire what Bibbs `` said , '' but after a second thought she decided not to speak at all .
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 22]: She merely murmured a wordless assent , and verbal communication was given over between them for the rest of that afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 22]: Bibbs and his father were gone when Mrs. Sheridan woke , the next morning , and she had a dreary day .
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 19]: She missed Edith woefully , and she worried about what might be taking place in the Sheridan Building .
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 36]: She felt that everything depended on how Bibbs `` took hold , '' and upon her husband 's return in the evening she seized upon the first opportunity to ask him how things had gone .
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 4]: He was non-committal .
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 9]: What could anybody tell by the first day ?
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 18]: He 'd seen plenty go at things well enough right at the start and then blow up .
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 13]: Pretty near anybody could show up fair the first day or so .
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 7]: There was a big job ahead .
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 48]: This material , such as it was -- Bibbs , in fact -- had to be broken in to handling the work Roscoe had done ; and then , at least as an overseer , he must take Jim 's position in the Realty Company as well .
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 11]: He told her to ask him again in a month .
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 47]: But during the course of dinner she gathered from some disjointed remarks of his that he and Bibbs had lunched together at the small restaurant where it had been Sheridan 's custom to lunch with Jim , and she took this to be an encouraging sign .
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 24]: Bibbs went to his room as soon as they left the table , and her husband was not communicative after reading his paper .
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 41]: She became an anxious spectator of Bibbs 's progress as a man of business , although it was a progress she could glimpse but dimly and only in the evening , through his remarks and his father 's at dinner .
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 37]: Usually Bibbs was silent , except when directly addressed , but on the first evening of the third week of his new career he offered an opinion which had apparently been the subject of previous argument .
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 29]: `` I 'd like you to understand just what I meant about those storage-rooms , father , '' he said , as Jackson placed his coffee before him .
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 15]: `` Abercrombie agreed with me , but you would n't listen to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 36]: `` You can talk , if you want to , and I 'll listen , '' Sheridan returned , `` but you ca n't show me that Jim ever took up with a bad thing .
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 18]: The roof fell because it had n't had time to settle and on account of weather conditions .
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 13]: I want that building put just the way Jim planned it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 11]: `` You ca n't have it , '' said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 22]: `` You ca n't , because Jim planned for the building to stand up , and it wo n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 25]: The other one -- the one that did n't fall -- is so shot with cracks we have n't dared use it for storage .
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 6]: It wo n't stand weight .
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 22]: There 's only one thing to do : get both buildings down as quickly as we can , and build over .
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 15]: Brick 's the best and cheapest in the long run for that type . ''
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 4]: Sheridan looked sarcastic .
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 3]: `` Fine !
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 22]: What we goin ' to do for storage-rooms while we 're waitin ' for those few bricks to be laid ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 9]: `` Rent , '' Bibbs returned , promptly .
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 32]: `` We 'll lose money if we do n't rent , anyhow -- they were waiting so long for you to give the warehouse matter your attention after the roof fell .
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 19]: You do n't know what an amount of stuff they 've got piled up on us over there .
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 29]: We 'd have to rent until we could patch up those process perils -- and the Krivitch Manufacturing Company 's plant is empty , right across the street .
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 12]: I took an option on it for us this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 6]: Sheridan 's expression was queer .
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 5]: `` Look here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 5]: he said , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 12]: `` Did you go and do that without consulting me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 11]: `` It did n't cost anything , '' said Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 11]: `` It 's only until to-morrow afternoon at two o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 9]: I undertook to convince you before then . ''
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 7]: `` Oh , you did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 6]: Sheridan 's tone was sardonic .
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 12]: `` Well , just suppose you could n't convince me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 17]: `` I can , though -- and I intend to , '' said Bibbs , quietly .
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 18]: `` I do n't think you understand the condition of those buildings you want patched up . ''
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 24]: `` Now , see here , '' said Sheridan , with slow emphasis ; `` suppose I had my mind set about this .
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 28]: JIM thought they 'd stand , and suppose it was -- well , kind of a matter of sentiment with me to prove he was right . ''
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 6]: Bibbs looked at him compassionately .
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 18]: `` I 'm sorry if you have a sentiment about it , father , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 13]: `` But whether you have or not ca n't make a difference .
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 18]: You 'll get other people hurt if you trust that process , and that wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 18]: And if you want a monument to Jim , at least you want one that will stand .
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 19]: Besides , I do n't think you can reasonably defend sentiment in this particular kind of affair . ''
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 8]: `` Oh , you do n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 17]: `` No , but I 'm sorry you did n't tell me you felt it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 9]: Sheridan was puzzled by his son 's tone .
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 9]: `` Why are you ` sorry ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 5]: he asked , curiously .
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 28]: `` Because I had the building inspector up there , this noon , '' said Bibbs , `` and I had him condemn both those buildings . ''
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 25]: `` He 'd been afraid to do it before , until he heard from us -- afraid you 'd see he lost his job .
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 16]: But he ca n't un-condemn them -- they 've got to come down now . ''
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 13]: Sheridan gave him a long and piercing stare from beneath lowered brows .
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 19]: Finally he said , `` How long did they give you on that option to convince me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 8]: `` Until two o'clock to-morrow afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 11]: `` All right , '' said Sheridan , not relaxing .
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 6]: `` I 'm convinced . ''
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 4]: Bibbs jumped up .
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 7]: `` I thought you would be .
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 7]: I 'll telephone the Krivitch agent .
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 20]: He gave me the option until to-morrow , but I told him I 'd settle it this evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 33]: Sheridan gazed after him as he left the room , and then , though his expression did not alter in the slightest , a sound came from him that startled his wife .
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 32]: It had been a long time since she had heard anything resembling a chuckle from him , and this sound -- although it was grim and dry -- bore that resemblance .
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 4]: She brightened eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 16]: `` Looks like he was startin ' right well do n't it , papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 4]: `` Startin ' ?
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 2]: Lord !
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 7]: He got me on the hip !
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 35]: Why , HE knew what I wanted -- that 's why he had the inspector up there , so ' t he 'd have me beat before we even started to talk about it .
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 6]: And did you hear him ?
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 8]: ` Ca n't reasonably defend SENTIMENT ! '
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 17]: And the way he says ` Us ' : ` Took an option for Us ' !
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 9]: ` Stuff piled up on Us ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 9]: There was always an alloy for Mrs. sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 16]: `` I do n't just like the way he looks , though , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 10]: `` Oh , there 's got to be something !
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 17]: Only one chick left at home , so you start to frettin ' about IT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 4]: He 's changed .
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 34]: There 's kind of a settish look to his face , and -- '' `` I guess that 's the common sense comin ' out on him , then , '' said Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 18]: `` You 'll see symptoms like that in a good many business men , I expect . ''
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 18]: `` Well , and he do n't have as good color as he was gettin ' before .
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 53]: And he 'd begun to fill out some , but -- '' Sheridan gave forth another dry chuckle , and , going round the table to her , patted her upon the shoulder with his left hand , his right being still heavily bandaged , though he no longer wore a sling .
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 28]: `` That 's the way it is with you , mamma -- got to take your frettin ' out one way if you do n't another ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 6]: He do n't look well .
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 32]: It ai n't exactly the way he looked when he begun to get sick that time , but he kind o ' seems to be losin ' , some way . ''
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 15]: `` Yes , he may ` a ' lost something , '' said Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 31]: `` I expect he 's lost a whole lot o ' foolishness besides his God-forsaken notions about writin ' poetry and -- '' `` No , '' his wife persisted .
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 8]: `` I mean he looks right peakid .
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 19]: And yesterday , when he was settin ' with us , he kept lookin ' out the window .
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 7]: He was n't readin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 13]: `` Well , why should n't he look out the window ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 8]: `` He was lookin ' over there .
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 14]: He never read a word all afternoon , I do n't believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 6]: `` Look , here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 3]: said Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 37]: `` Bibbs might ` a ' kept goin ' on over there the rest of his life , moonin ' on and on , but what he heard Sibyl say did one big thing , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 9]: It woke him up out of his trance .
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 45]: Well , he had to go and bust clean out with a bang ; and that stopped his goin ' over there , and it stopped his poetry , but I reckon he 's begun to get pretty fair pay for what he lost .
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 57]: I guess a good many young men have had to get over worries like his ; they got to lose SOMETHING if they 're goin ' to keep ahead o ' the procession nowadays -- and it kind o ' looks to me , mamma , like Bibbs might keep quite a considerable long way ahead .
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 23]: Why , a year from now I 'll bet you he wo n't know there ever WAS such a thing as poetry !
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 6]: And ai n't he funny ?
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 15]: He wanted to stick to the shop so 's he could ` think ' !
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 10]: What he meant was , think about something useless .
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 18]: Well , I guess he 's keepin ' his mind pretty occupied the other way these days .
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 26]: Yes , sir , it took a pretty fair-sized shock to get him out of his trance , but it certainly did the business . ''
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 22]: He patted his wife 's shoulder again , and then , without any prefatory symptoms , broke into a boisterous laugh .
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 12]: `` Honest , mamma , he works like a gorilla ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 16]: CHAPTER XXI And so Bibbs sat in the porch of the temple with the money-changers .
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 29]: But no one came to scourge him forth , for this was the temple of Bigness , and the changing of money was holy worship and true religion .
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 59]: The priests wore that `` settish '' look Bibbs 's mother had seen beginning to develop about his mouth and eyes -- a wary look which she could not define , but it comes with service at the temple ; and it was the more marked upon Bibbs for his sharp awakening to the necessities of that service .
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 18]: He did as little `` useless '' thinking as possible , giving himself no time for it .
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 28]: He worked continuously , keeping his thoughts still on his work when he came home at night ; and he talked of nothing whatever except his work .
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 8]: But he did not sing at it .
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 18]: He was often in the streets , and people were not allowed to sing in the streets .
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 76]: They might make any manner of hideous uproar -- they could shake buildings ; they could out-thunder the thunder , deafen the deaf , and kill the sick with noise ; or they could walk the streets or drive through them bawling , squawking , or screeching , as they chose , if the noise was traceably connected with business ; though street musicians were not tolerated , being considered a nuisance and an interference .
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 49]: A man or woman who went singing for pleasure through the streets -- like a crazy Neopolitan -- would have been stopped , and belike locked up ; for Freedom does not mean that a citizen is allowed to do every outrageous thing that comes into his head .
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 14]: The streets were dangerous enough , in all conscience , without any singing !
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 30]: and the Motor Federation issued public warnings declaring that the pedestrian 's life was in his own hands , and giving directions how to proceed with the least peril .
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 16]: However , Bibbs Sheridan had no desire to sing in the streets , or anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 30]: He had gone to his work with an energy that , for the start , at least , was bitter , and there was no song left in him .
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 8]: He began to know his active fellow-citizens .
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 71]: Here and there among them he found a leisurely , kind soul , a relic of the old period of neighborliness , `` pioneer stock , '' usually ; and there were men -- particularly among the merchants and manufacturers -- `` so honest they leaned backward '' ; reputations sometimes attested by stories of heroic sacrifices to honor ; nor were there lacking some instances of generosity even nobler .
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 22]: Here and there , too , were book-men , in their little leisure ; and , among the Germans , music-men .
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 45]: And these , with the others , worshiped Bigness and the growth , each man serving for his own sake and for what he could get out of it , but all united in their faith in the beneficence and glory of their god .
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 35]: To almost all alike that service stood as the most important thing in life , except on occasion of some such vital , brief interregnum as the dangerous illness of a wife or child .
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 57]: In the way of `` relaxation '' some of the servers took golf ; some took fishing ; some took `` shows '' -- a mixture of infantile and negroid humor , stockings , and tin music ; some took an occasional debauch ; some took trips ; some took cards ; and some took nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 17]: The high priests were vigilant to watch that no `` relaxation '' should affect the service .
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 30]: When a man attended to anything outside his business , eyes were upon him ; his credit was in danger -- that is , his life was in danger .
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 31]: And the old priests were as ardent as the young ones ; the million was as eager to be bigger as the thousand ; seventy was as busy as seventeen .
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 25]: They strove mightily against one another , and the old priests were the most wary , the most plausible , and the most dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 21]: Bibbs learned he must walk charily among these -- he must wear a thousand eyes and beware of spiders indeed !
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 51]: And outside the temple itself were the pretenders , the swarming thieves and sharpers and fleecers , the sly rascals and the open rascals ; but these were feeble folk , not dangerous once he knew them , and he had a good guide to point them out to him .
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 23]: They were useful sometimes , he learned , and many of them served as go-betweens in matters where business must touch politics .
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 26]: He learned also how breweries and `` traction '' companies and banks and other institutions fought one another for the political control of the city .
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 51]: The newspapers , he discovered , had lost their ancient political influence , especially with the knowing , who looked upon them with a skeptical humor , believing the journals either to be retained partisans , like lawyers , or else striving to forward the personal ambitions of their owners .
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 27]: The control of the city lay not with them , but was usually obtained by giving the hordes of negroes gin-money , and by other largesses .
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 25]: The revenues of the people were then distributed as fairly as possible among a great number of men who had assisted the winning side .
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 40]: Names and titles of offices went with many of the prizes , and most of these title-holders were expected to present a busy appearance at times ; and , indeed , some among them did work honestly and faithfully .
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 6]: Bibbs had been very ignorant .
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 58]: All these simple things , so well known and customary , astonished him at first , and once -- in a brief moment of forgetting that he was done with writing -- he thought that if he had known them and written of them , how like a satire the plainest relation of them must have seemed !
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 12]: Strangest of all to him was the vehement and sincere patriotism .
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 34]: On every side he heard it -- it was a permeation ; the newest school-child caught it , though just from Hungary and learning to stammer a few words of the local language .
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 21]: Everywhere the people shouted of the power , the size , the riches , and the growth of their city .
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 30]: Not only that , they said that the people of their city were the greatest , the `` finest , '' the strongest , the Biggest people on earth .
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 19]: They cited no authorities , and felt the need of none , being themselves the people thus celebrated .
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 60]: And if the thing was questioned , or if it was hinted that there might be one small virtue in which they were not perfect and supreme , they wasted no time examining themselves to see if what the critic said was true , but fell upon him and hooted him and cursed him , for they were sensitive .
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 24]: So Bibbs , learning their ways and walking with them , harkened to the voice of the people and served Bigness with them .
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 13]: For the voice of the people is the voice of their god .
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 33]: Sheridan had made the room next to his own into an office for Bibbs , and the door between the two rooms usually stood open -- the father had established that intimacy .
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 23]: One morning in February , when Bibbs was alone , Sheridan came in , some sheets of typewritten memoranda in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 49]: `` Bibbs , '' he said , `` I do n't like to butt in very often this way , and when I do I usually wish I had n't -- but for Heaven 's sake what have you been buying that ole busted inter-traction stock for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 7]: Bibbs leaned back from his desk .
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 8]: `` For eleven hundred and fifty-five dollars .
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 7]: That 's all it cost . ''
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 13]: `` Well , it ai n't worth eleven hundred and fifty-five cents .
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 6]: You ought to know that .
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 7]: I do n't get your idea .
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 10]: That stuff 's deader 'n Adam 's cat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 11]: `` It might be worth something -- some day . ''
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 21]: `` It might n't be so dead -- not if we went into it , '' said Bibbs , coolly .
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 18]: Sheridan considered this musingly ; then he said , `` Who 'd you buy it from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 7]: `` A broker -- Fansmith . ''
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 26]: `` Well , he must ` a ' got it from one o ' the crowd o ' poor ninnies that was soaked with it .
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 9]: Do n't you know who owned it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 7]: `` Yes , I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 8]: `` Ai n't sayin ' , though ?
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 3]: That it ?
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 6]: What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 19]: `` It belonged to Mr. Vertrees , '' said Bibbs , shortly , applying himself to his desk .
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 4]: `` So ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 10]: Sheridan gazed down at his son 's thin face .
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 8]: `` Excuse me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 5]: `` Your business . ''
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 9]: And he went back to his own room .
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 7]: But presently he looked in again .
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 41]: `` I reckon you wo n't mind lunchin ' alone to-day '' -- he was shuffling himself into his overcoat -- `` because I just thought I 'd go up to the house and get THIS over with mamma . ''
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 17]: He glanced apologetically toward his right hand as it emerged from the sleeve of the overcoat .
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 28]: The bandages had been removed , finally , that morning , revealing but three fingers -- the forefinger and the finger next to it had been amputated .
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 20]: `` She 's bound to make an awful fuss , and better to spoil her lunch than her dinner .
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 8]: I 'll be back about two . ''
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 38]: But he calculated the time of his arrival at the New House so accurately that Mrs. Sheridan 's lunch was not disturbed , and she was rising from the lonely table when he came into the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 19]: He had left his overcoat in the hall , but he kept his hands in his trousers pockets .
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 9]: `` What 's the matter , papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 5]: she asked , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 6]: `` Has anything gone wrong ?
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 6]: You ai n't sick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 4]: `` Me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 4]: He laughed loudly .
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 5]: `` Me SICK ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 6]: `` You had lunch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 7]: `` Did n't want any to-day .
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 13]: You can give me a cup o ' coffee , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 30]: She rang , and told George to have coffee made , and when he had withdrawn she said querulously , `` I just know there 's something wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 23]: `` Nothin ' in the world , '' he responded , heartily , taking a seat at the head of the table .
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 19]: `` I thought I 'd talk over a notion o ' mine with you , that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 16]: It 's more women-folks ' business than what it is man 's , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 5]: `` What about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 23]: `` Why , ole Doc Gurney was up at the office this morning awhile -- '' `` To look at your hand ?
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 10]: How 's he say it 's doin ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 3]: `` Fine !
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 18]: Well , he went in and sat around with Bibbs awhile -- '' Mrs. Sheridan nodded pessimistically .
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 12]: `` I guess it 's time you had him , too .
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 14]: I KNEW Bibbs -- '' `` Now , mamma , hold your horses !
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 13]: I wanted him to look Bibbs over BEFORE anything 's the matter .
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 18]: You do n't suppose I 'm goin ' to take any chances with BIBBS , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 19]: Well , afterwards , I shut the door , and I an ' ole Gurney had a talk .
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 27]: He 's a mighty disagreeable man ; he rubbed it in on me what he said about Bibbs havin ' brains if he ever woke up .
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 23]: Then I thought he must want to get something out o ' me , he go so flattering -- for a minute !
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 20]: ` Bibbs could n't help havin ' business brains , ' he says , ` bein ' YOUR son .
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 25]: Do n't be surprised , ' he says -- ` do n't be surprised at his makin ' a success , ' he says .
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 26]: ` He could n't get over his heredity ; he could n't HELP bein ' a business success -- once you got him into it .
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 6]: It 's in his blood .
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 54]: Yes , sir ' he says , ` it does n't need MUCH brains , ' he says , ` an only third-rate brains , at that , ' he says , ` but it does need a special KIND o ' brains , ' he says , ` to be a millionaire .
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 16]: I mean , ' he says , ` when a man 's given a start .
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 24]: If nobody gives him a start , why , course he 's got to have luck AND the right kind o ' brains .
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 36]: The only miracle about Bibbs , ' he says , ` is where he got the OTHER kind o ' brains -- the brains you made him quit usin ' and throw away . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 11]: `` But what 'd he say about his health ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 17]: Mrs. Sheridan demanded , impatiently , as George placed a cup of coffee before her husband .
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 15]: Sheridan helped himself to cream and sugar , and began to sip the coffee .
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 14]: `` I 'm comin ' to that , '' he returned , placidly .
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 16]: `` See how easy I manage this cup with my left hand , mamma ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 9]: `` You been doin ' that all winter .
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 26]: What did -- '' `` It 's wonderful , '' he interrupted , admiringly , `` what a fellow can do with his left hand .
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 18]: I can sign my name with mine now , well 's I ever could with my right .
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 22]: It came a little hard at first , but now , honest , I believe I RATHER sign with my left .
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 15]: That 's all I ever have to write , anyway -- just the signature .
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 7]: Rest 's all dictatin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 10]: He blew across the top of the cup unctuously .
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 6]: `` Good coffee , mamma !
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 5]: Well , about Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 76]: Ole Gurney says he believes if Bibbs could somehow get back to the state o ' mind he was in about the machine-shop -- that is , if he could some way get to feelin ' about business the way he felt about the shop -- not the poetry and writin ' part , but -- '' He paused , supplementing his remarks with a motion of his head toward the old house next door .
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 43]: `` He says Bibbs is older and harder 'n what he was when he broke down that time , and besides , he ai n't the kind o ' dreamy way he was then -- and I should say he AI N'T !
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 16]: I 'd like 'em to show ME anybody his age that 's any wider awake !
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 20]: But he says Bibbs 's health never need bother us again if -- '' Mrs. Sheridan shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 10]: `` I do n't see any help THAT way .
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 10]: You know yourself she would n't have Jim . ''
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 11]: `` Who 's talkin ' about her havin ' anybody ?
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 5]: But , my Lord !
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 8]: she might let him LOOK at her !
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 29]: She need n't ` a ' got so mad , just because he asked her , that she wo n't let him come in the house any more .
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 84]: He 's a mighty funny boy , and some ways I reckon he 's pretty near as hard to understand as the Bible , but Gurney kind o ' got me in the way o ' thinkin ' that if she 'd let him come back and set around with her an evening or two sometimes -- not reg ` lar , I do n't mean -- why -- Well , I just thought I 'd see what YOU 'D think of it .
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 76]: There ai n't any way to talk about it to Bibbs himself -- I do n't suppose he 'd let you , anyhow -- but I thought maybe you could kind o ' slip over there some day , and sort o ' fix up to have a little talk with her , and kind o ' hint around till you see how the land lays , and ask her -- '' `` ME ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 8]: Mrs. Sheridan looked both helpless and frightened .
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 6]: She shook her head decidedly .
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 9]: `` It would n't do any good . ''
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 8]: `` You wo n't try it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 15]: `` I wo n't risk her turnin ' me out o ' the house .
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 19]: Some way , that 's what I believe she did to Sibyl , from what Roscoe said once .
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 19]: No , I CA N'T -- and , what 's more , it 'd only make things worse .
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 33]: If people find out you 're runnin ' after 'em they think you 're cheap , and then they wo n't do as much for you as if you let 'em alone .
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 20]: I do n't believe it 's any use , and I could n't do it if it was . ''
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 5]: He sighed with resignation .
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 6]: `` All right , mamma .
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 5]: That 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 22]: Then , in a livelier tone , he said : `` Ole Gurney took the bandages off my hand this morning .
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 4]: All healed up .
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 10]: Says I do n't need 'em any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 10]: `` Why , that 's splendid , papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 5]: she cried , beaming .
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 10]: `` I was afraid -- Let 's see . ''
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 17]: She came toward him , but he rose , still keeping his hand in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 11]: `` Wait a minute , '' he said , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 66]: `` Now it may give you just a teeny bit of a shock , but the fact is -- well , you remember that Sunday when Sibyl came over here and made all that fuss about nothin ' -- it was the day after I got tired o ' that statue when Edith 's telegram came -- '' `` Let me see your hand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 5]: `` Now wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 13]: he said , laughing and pushing her away with his left hand .
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 56]: `` The truth is , mamma , that I kind o ' slipped out on you that morning , when you was n't lookin ' , and went down to ole Gurney 's office -- he 'd told me to , you see -- and , well , it does n't AMOUNT to anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 13]: And he held out , for her inspection , the mutilated hand .
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 37]: `` You see , these days when it 's all dictatin ' , anyhow , nobody 'd mind just a couple o ' -- '' He had to jump for her -- she went over backward .
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 11]: For the second time in her life Mrs. Sheridan fainted .
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 48]: CHAPTER XXXII It was a full hour later when he left her lying upon a couch in her own room , still lamenting intermittently , though he assured her with heat that the `` fuss '' she was making irked him far more than his physical loss .
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 48]: He permitted her to think that he meant to return directly to his office , but when he came out to the open air he told the chauffeur in attendance to await him in front of Mr. Vertrees 's house , whither he himself proceeded on foot .
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 32]: Mr. Vertrees had taken the sale of half of his worthless stock as manna in the wilderness ; it came from heaven -- by what agency he did not particularly question .
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 38]: The broker informed him that `` parties were interested in getting hold of the stock , '' and that later there might be a possible increase in the value of the large amount retained by his client .
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 28]: It might go `` quite a ways up '' within a year or so , he said , and he advised `` sitting tight '' with it .
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 7]: Mr. Vertrees went home and prayed .
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 16]: He rose from his knees feeling that he was surely coming into his own again .
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 45]: It was more than a mere gasp of temporary relief with him , and his wife shared his optimism ; but Mary would not let him buy back her piano , and as for furs -- spring was on the way , she said .
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 20]: But they paid the butcher , the baker , and the candlestick-maker , and hired a cook once more .
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 23]: It was this servitress who opened the door for Sheridan and presently assured him that Miss Vertrees would `` be down . ''
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 32]: He was not the man to conceal admiration when he felt it , and he flushed and beamed as Mary made her appearance , almost upon the heels of the cook .
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 43]: She had a look of apprehension for the first fraction of a second , but it vanished at the sight of him , and its place was taken in her eyes by a soft brilliance , while color rushed in her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 10]: `` Do n't be surprised , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6367 len. 18]: `` Truth is , in a way it 's sort of on business I looked in here .
Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 11]: It 'll only take a minute , I expect . ''
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 9]: `` I 'm sorry , '' said Mary .
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 12]: `` I hoped you 'd come because we 're neighbors . ''
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 3]: He chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 3]: `` Neighbors !
Parsing [sent. 6373 len. 16]: Sometimes people do n't see so much o ' their neighbors as they used to .
Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 10]: That is , I hear so -- lately . ''
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 15]: `` You 'll stay long enough to sit down , wo n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 10]: `` I guess I could manage that much . ''
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 13]: And they sat down , facing each other and not far apart .
Parsing [sent. 6378 len. 20]: `` Of course , it could n't be called business , exactly , '' he said , more gravely .
Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 8]: `` Not at all , I expect .
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 37]: But there 's something o ' yours it seemed to me I ought to give you , and I just thought it was better to bring it myself and explain how I happened to have it .
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 12]: It 's this -- this letter you wrote my boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 21]: He extended the letter to her solemnly , in his left hand , and she took it gently from him .
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 12]: `` It was in his mail , after he was hurt .
Parsing [sent. 6384 len. 11]: You knew he never got it , I expect . ''
Parsing [sent. 6385 len. 12]: `` Yes , '' she said , in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 6386 len. 3]: He sighed .
Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 8]: `` I 'm glad he did n't .
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 20]: Not , '' he added , quickly -- `` not but what you did just right to send it .
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 3]: You did .
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 15]: You could n't acted any other way when it came right down TO it .
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 17]: There ai n't any blame comin ' to you -- you were above-board all through . ''
Parsing [sent. 6392 len. 20]: Mary said , `` Thank you , '' almost in a whisper , and with her head bowed low .
Parsing [sent. 6393 len. 12]: `` You 'll have to excuse me for readin ' it .
Parsing [sent. 6394 len. 32]: I had to take charge of all his mail and everything ; I did n't know the handwritin ' , and I read it all -- once I got started . ''
Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 8]: `` I 'm glad you did . ''
Parsing [sent. 6396 len. 20]: `` Well '' -- he leaned forward as if to rise -- `` I guess that 's about all .
Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 10]: I just thought you ought to have it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 8]: `` Thank you for bringing it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 21]: He looked at her hopefully , as if he thought and wished that she might have something more to say .
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 22]: But she seemed not to be aware of this glance , and sat with her eyes fixed sorrowfully upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 22]: `` Well , I expect I better be gettin ' back to the office , '' he said , rising desperately .
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 35]: `` I told -- I told my partner I 'd be back at two o'clock , and I guess he 'll think I 'm a poor business man if he catches me behind time .
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 23]: I got to walk the chalk a mighty straight line these days -- with THAT fellow keepin ' tabs on me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 5]: Mary rose with him .
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 12]: `` I 've always heard YOU were the hard driver . ''
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 4]: He guffawed derisively .
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 3]: `` Me ?
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 11]: I 'm nothin ' to that partner o ' mine .
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 23]: You could n't guess to save your life how he keeps after me to hold up my end o ' the job .
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 23]: I should n't be surprised he 'd give me the grand bounce some day , and run the whole circus by himself .
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 14]: You know how he is -- once he goes AT a thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 7]: `` No , '' she smiled .
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 10]: `` I did n't know you had a partner .
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 14]: I 'd always heard -- '' He laughed , looking away from her .
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 21]: `` It 's just my way o ' speakin ' o ' that boy o ' mine , Bibbs . ''
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 18]: He stood then , expectant , staring out into the hall with an air of careless geniality .
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 16]: He felt that she certainly must at least say , `` How IS Bibbs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 16]: but she said nothing at all , though he waited until the silence became embarrassing .
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 20]: `` Well , I guess I better be gettin ' down there , '' he said , at last .
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 6]: `` He might worry . ''
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 11]: `` Good-by -- and thank you , '' said Mary .
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 5]: `` For what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 6]: `` For the letter . ''
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 9]: `` Oh , '' he said , blankly .
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 5]: `` You 're welcome .
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 3]: Good-by . ''
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 6]: Mary put out her hand .
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 4]: `` Good-by . ''
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 14]: `` You 'll have to excuse my left hand , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 12]: `` I had a little accident to the other one . ''
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 9]: She gave a pitying cry as she saw .
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 8]: `` Oh , poor Mr. Sheridan ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 6]: `` Nothin ' at all !
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 7]: Dictate everything nowadays , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 4]: He laughed jovially .
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 10]: `` Did anybody tell you how it happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 16]: `` I heard you hurt your hand , but no -- not just how . ''
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 21]: `` It was this way , '' he began , and both , as if unconsciously , sat down again .
Parsing [sent. 6439 len. 44]: `` You may not know it , but I used to worry a good deal about the youngest o ' my boys -- the one that used to come to see you sometimes , after Jim -- that is , I mean Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 40]: He 's the one I spoke of as my partner ; and the truth is that 's what it 's just about goin ' to amount to , one o ' these days -- if his health holds out .
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 41]: Well , you remember , I expect , I had him on a machine over at a plant o ' mine ; and sometimes I 'd kind o ' sneak in there and see how he was gettin ' along .
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 18]: Take a doctor with me sometimes , because Bibbs never WAS so robust , you might say .
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 11]: Ole Doc Gurney -- I guess maybe you know him ?
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 13]: Tall , thin man ; acts sleepy -- '' `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 29]: `` Well , one day I an ' ole Doc Gurney , we were in there , and I undertook to show Bibbs how to run his machine .
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 49]: He told me to look out , but I would n't listen , and I did n't look out -- and that 's how I got my hand hurt , tryin ' to show Bibbs how to do something he knew how to do and I did n't .
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 37]: Made me so mad I just would n't even admit to myself it WAS hurt -- and so , by and by , ole Doc Gurney had to take kind o ' radical measures with me .
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 9]: He 's a right good doctor , too .
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 10]: Do n't you think so , Miss Vertrees ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 8]: `` Yes , he is so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 18]: Sheridan now had the air of a rambling talker and gossip with all day on his hands .
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 8]: `` Take him on Bibbs 's case .
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 13]: I was talkin ' about Bibbs 's case with him this morning .
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 15]: Well , you 'd laugh to hear the way ole Gurney talks about THAT !
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 30]: ` Course he IS just as much a friend as he is doctor -- and he takes as much interest in Bibbs as if he was in the family .
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 48]: He says Bibbs is n't anyways bad off YET ; and he thinks he could stand the pace and get fat on it if -- well , this is what 'd made YOU laugh if you 'd been there , Miss Vertrees -- honest it would ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 12]: He paused to chuckle , and stole a glance at her .
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 26]: She was gazing straight before her at the wall ; her lips were parted , and -- visibly -- she was breathing heavily and quickly .
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 32]: He feared that she was growing furiously angry ; but he had led to what he wanted to say , and he went on , determined now to say it all .
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 38]: He leaned forward and altered his voice to one of confidential friendliness , though in it he still maintained a tone which indicated that ole Doc Gurney 's opinion was only a joke he shared with her .
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 13]: `` Yes , sir , you certainly would ` a ' laughed !
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 14]: Why , that ole man thinks YOU got something to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 25]: You 'll have to blame it on him , young lady , if it makes you feel like startin ' out to whip somebody !
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 34]: He 's actually got THIS theory : he says Bibbs got to gettin ' better while he worked over there at the shop because you kept him cheered up and feelin ' good .
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 40]: And he says if you could manage to just stand him hangin ' around a little -- maybe not much , but just SOMEtimes -- again , he believed it 'd do Bibbs a mighty lot o ' good .
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 11]: ` Course , that 's only what the doctor said .
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 37]: Me , I do n't know anything about that ; but I can say this much -- I never saw any such a MENTAL improvement in anybody in my life as I have lately in Bibbs .
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 74]: I expect you 'd find him a good deal more entertaining than what he used to be -- and I know it 's a kind of embarrassing thing to suggest after the way he piled in over here that day to ask you to stand up before the preacher with him , but accordin ' to ole Doc GURNEY , he 's got you on his brain so bad -- '' Mary jumped .
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 5]: `` Mr. Sheridan ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 4]: He sighed profoundly .
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 8]: I noticed you were gettin ' mad .
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 13]: I did n't -- '' `` No , no , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 14]: `` But I do n't understand -- and I think you do n't .
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 10]: What is it you want me to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 10]: He sighed again , but this time with relief .
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 6]: `` Well , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 5]: `` You 're right .
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 8]: It 'll be easier to talk plain .
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 13]: I ought to known I could with you , all the time .
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 17]: I just hoped you 'd let that boy come and see you sometimes , once more .
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 4]: Could you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 7]: `` You do n't understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 10]: She clasped her hands together in a sorrowful gesture .
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 8]: `` Yes , we must talk plain .
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 37]: Bibbs heard that I 'd tried to make your oldest son care for me because I was poor , and so Bibbs came and asked me to marry him -- because he was sorry for me .
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 15]: And I CA N'T see him any more , '' she cried in distress .
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 6]: `` I CA N'T ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 6]: Sheridan cleared his throat uncomfortably .
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 11]: `` You mean because he thought that about you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 5]: `` No , no !
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 7]: What he thought was TRUE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 52]: `` Well -- you mean he was so much in -- you mean he thought so much of you -- '' The words were inconceivably awkward upon Sheridan 's tongue ; he seemed to be in doubt even about pronouncing them , but after a ghastly pause he bravely repeated them .
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 19]: `` You mean he thought so much of you that you just could n't stand him around ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 3]: `` NO !
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 6]: He was sorry for me .
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 20]: He cared for me ; he was fond of me ; and he 'd respected me -- too much !
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 36]: In the finest way he loved me , if you like , and he 'd have done anything on earth for me , as I would for him , and as he knew I would .
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 11]: It was beautiful , Mr. Sheridan , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 28]: `` But the cheap , bad things one has done seem always to come back -- they wait , and pull you down when you 're happiest .
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 22]: Bibbs found me out , you see ; and he was n't ` in love ' with me at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 5]: `` He was n't ?
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 51]: Well , it seems to me he gave up everything he wanted to do -- it was fool stuff , but he certainly wanted it mighty bad -- he just threw it away and walked right up and took the job he swore he never would -- just for you .
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 27]: And it looks to me as if a man that 'd do that must think quite a heap o ' the girl he does it for !
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 27]: You say it was only because he was sorry , but let me tell you there 's only ONE girl he could feel THAT sorry for !
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 5]: Yes , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 9]: `` No , no , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 16]: `` Bibbs is n't like other men -- he would do anything for anybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 3]: Sheridan grinned .
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 15]: `` Perhaps not so much as you think , nowadays , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 21]: `` For instance , I got kind of a suspicion he does n't believe in ` sentiment in business . '
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 8]: But that 's neither here nor there .
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 16]: What he wanted was , just plain and simple , for you to marry him .
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 27]: Well , I was afraid his thinkin ' so much OF you had kind o ' sickened you of him -- the way it does sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 16]: But from the way you talk , I understand that ai n't the trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 10]: He coughed , and his voice trembled a little .
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 83]: `` Now here , Miss Vertrees , I do n't have to tell you -- because you see things easy -- I know I got no business comin ' to you like this , but I had to make Bibbs go my way instead of his own -- I had to do it for the sake o ' my business and on his own account , too -- and I expect you got some idea how it hurt him to give up .
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 7]: Well , he 's made good .
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 17]: He did n't come in half-hearted or mean ; he came in -- all the way !
Parsing [sent. 6524 len. 31]: But there is n't anything in it to him ; you can see he 's just shut his teeth on it and goin ' ahead with dust in his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 20]: You see , one way of lookin ' at it , he 's got nothin ' to work FOR .
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 26]: And it seems to me like it cost him your friendship , and I believe -- honest -- that 's what hurt him the worst .
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 8]: Now you said we 'd talk plain .
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 10]: Why ca n't you let him come back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 9]: She covered her face desperately with her hands .
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 6]: `` I ca n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 9]: He rose , defeated , and looking it .
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 15]: `` Well , I must n't press you , '' he said , gently .
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 17]: At that she cried out , and dropped her hands and let him see her face .
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 8]: He was only sorry for me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 6]: He gazed at her intently .
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 24]: Mary was proud , but she had a fatal honesty , and it confessed the truth of her now ; she was helpless .
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 18]: It was so clear that even Sheridan , marveling and amazed , was able to see it .
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 17]: Then a change came over him ; gloom fell from him , and he grew radiant .
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 4]: `` Do n't !
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 6]: Do n't '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 21]: `` You must n't -- '' `` I wo n't tell him , '' said Sheridan , from the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 9]: `` I wo n't tell anybody anything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 21]: CHAPTER XXXIII There was a heavy town-fog that afternoon , a smoke-mist , densest in the sanctuary of the temple .
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 56]: The people went about in it , busy and dirty , thickening their outside and inside linings of coal-tar , asphalt , sulphurous acid , oil of vitriol , and the other familiar things the men liked to breathe and to have upon their skins and garments and upon their wives and babies and sweethearts .
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 17]: The growth of the city was visible in the smoke and the noise and the rush .
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 34]: There was more smoke than there had been this day of February a year earlier ; there was more noise ; and the crowds were thicker -- yet quicker in spite of that .
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 68]: The traffic policeman had a hard time , for the people were independent -- they retained some habits of the old market-town period , and would cross the street anywhere and anyhow , which not only got them killed more frequently than if they clung to the legal crossings , but kept the motormen , the chauffeurs , and the truck-drivers in a stew of profane nervousness .
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 47]: So the traffic policemen led harried lives ; they themselves were killed , of course , with a certain periodicity , but their main trouble was that they could not make the citizens realize that it was actually and mortally perilous to go about their city .
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 44]: It was strange , for there were probably no citizens of any length of residence who had not personally known either some one who had been killed or injured in an accident , or some one who had accidentally killed or injured others .
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 36]: And yet , perhaps it was not strange , seeing the sharp preoccupation of the faces -- the people had something on their minds ; they could not stop to bother about dirt and danger .
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 17]: Mary Vertrees was not often down-town ; she had never seen an accident until this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 38]: She had come upon errands for her mother connected with a timorous refurbishment ; and as she did these , in and out of the department stores , she had an insistent consciousness of the Sheridan Building .
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 31]: From the street , anywhere , it was almost always in sight , like some monstrous geometrical shadow , murk-colored and rising limitlessly into the swimming heights of the smoke-mist .
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 32]: It was gaunt and grimy and repellent ; it had nothing but strength and size -- but in that consciousness of Mary 's the great structure may have partaken of beauty .
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 16]: Sheridan had made some of the things he said emphatic enough to remain with her .
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 26]: She went over and over them -- and they began to seem true : `` Only ONE girl he could feel THAT sorry for ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 26]: `` Gurney says he 's got you on his brain so bad -- '' The man 's clumsy talk began to sing in her heart .
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 11]: The song was begun there when she saw the accident .
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 34]: She was directly opposite the Sheridan Building then , waiting for the traffic to thin before she crossed , though other people were risking the passage , darting and halting and dodging parlously .
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 16]: Two men came from the crowd behind her , talking earnestly , and started across .
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 22]: Both wore black ; one was tall and broad and thick , and the other was taller , but noticeably slender .
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 14]: And Mary caught her breath , for they were Bibbs and his father .
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 29]: They did not see her , and she caught a phrase in Bibbs 's mellow voice , which had taken a crisper ring : `` Sixty-eight thousand dollars ?
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 6]: Not sixty-eight thousand buttons ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 26]: It startled her queerly , and as there was a glimpse of his profile she saw for the first time a resemblance to his father .
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 4]: She watched them .
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 21]: In the middle of the street Bibbs had to step ahead of his father , and the two were separated .
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 43]: But the reckless passing of a truck , beyond the second line of rails , frightened a group of country women who were in course of passage ; they were just in front of Bibbs , and shoved backward upon him violently .
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 40]: To extricate himself from them he stepped back , directly in front of a moving trolley-car -- no place for absent-mindedness , but Bibbs was still absorbed in thoughts concerned with what he had been saying to his father .
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 30]: There were shrieks and yells ; Bibbs looked the wrong way -- and then Mary saw the heavy figure of Sheridan plunge straight forward in front of the car .
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 33]: With absolute disregard of his own life , he hurled himself at Bibbs like a football-player shunting off an opponent , and to Mary it seemed that they both went down together .
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 18]: But that was all she could see -- automobiles , trucks , and wagons closed in between .
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 57]: She made out that the trolley-car stopped jerkily , and she saw a policeman breaking his way through the instantly condensing crowd , while the traffic came to a standstill , and people stood up in automobiles or climbed upon the hubs and tires of wheels , not to miss a chance of seeing anything horrible .
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 10]: Mary tried to get through ; it was impossible .
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 21]: Other policemen came to help the first , and in a minute or two the traffic was in motion again .
Parsing [sent. 6577 len. 20]: The crowd became pliant , dispersing -- there was no figure upon the ground , and no ambulance came .
Parsing [sent. 6578 len. 17]: But one of the policemen was detained by the clinging and beseeching of a gloved hand .
Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 9]: `` What IS the matter , lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 6]: `` Where are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 3]: Mary cried .
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 3]: `` Who ?
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 4]: Ole man Sheridan ?
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 9]: I reckon HE was n't much hurt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6585 len. 14]: `` His SON -- '' `` Was that who the other one was ?
Parsing [sent. 6586 len. 19]: I seen him knock him -- oh , he 's not bad off , I guess , lady .
Parsing [sent. 6587 len. 12]: The ole man got him out of the way all right .
Parsing [sent. 6588 len. 18]: The fender shoved the ole man around some , but I reckon he only got shook up .
Parsing [sent. 6589 len. 12]: They both went on in the Sheridan Building without any help .
Parsing [sent. 6590 len. 6]: Excuse me , lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 6591 len. 17]: Sheridan and Bibbs , in fact , were at that moment in the elevator , ascending .
Parsing [sent. 6592 len. 12]: `` Whisk-broom up in the office , '' Sheridan was saying .
Parsing [sent. 6593 len. 15]: `` You got to look out on those corners nowadays , I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 6594 len. 22]: I do n't know I got any call to blow , though -- because I tried to cross after you did .
Parsing [sent. 6595 len. 10]: That 's how I happened to run into you .
Parsing [sent. 6596 len. 12]: Well , you want to remember to look out after this .
Parsing [sent. 6597 len. 17]: We were talkin ' about Murtrie 's askin ' sixty-eight thousand flat for that ninety-nine-year lease .
Parsing [sent. 6598 len. 42]: It 's his lookout if he 'd rather take it that way , and I do n't know but -- '' `` No , '' said Bibbs , emphatically , as the elevator stopped ; `` he wo n't get it .
Parsing [sent. 6599 len. 15]: Not from us , he wo n't , and I 'll show you why .
Parsing [sent. 6600 len. 9]: I can convince you in five minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 6601 len. 13]: He followed his father into the office anteroom -- and convinced him .
Parsing [sent. 6602 len. 23]: Then , having been diligently brushed by a youth of color , Bibbs went into his own room and closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 6603 len. 24]: He was more shaken than he had allowed his father to perceive , and his side was sore where Sheridan had struck him .
Parsing [sent. 6604 len. 23]: He desired to be alone ; he wanted to rub himself and , for once , to do some useless thinking again .
Parsing [sent. 6605 len. 45]: He knew that his father had not `` happened '' to run into him ; he knew that Sheridan had instantly -- and instinctively -- proved that he held his own life of no account whatever compared to that of his son and heir .
Parsing [sent. 6606 len. 44]: Bibbs had been unable to speak of that , or to seem to know it ; for Sheridan , just as instinctively , had swept the matter aside -- as of no importance , since all was well -- reverting immediately to business .
Parsing [sent. 6607 len. 9]: Bibbs began to think intently of his father .
Parsing [sent. 6608 len. 52]: He perceived , as he had never perceived before , the shadowing of something enormous and indomitable -- and lawless ; not to be daunted by the will of nature 's very self ; laughing at the lightning and at wounds and mutilation ; conquering , irresistible -- and blindly noble .
Parsing [sent. 6609 len. 21]: For the first time in his life Bibbs began to understand the meaning of being truly this man 's son .
Parsing [sent. 6610 len. 27]: He would be the more truly his son henceforth , though , as Sheridan said , Bibbs had not come down-town with him meanly or half-heartedly .
Parsing [sent. 6611 len. 21]: He had given his word because he had wanted the money , simply , for Mary Vertrees in her need .
Parsing [sent. 6612 len. 40]: And he shivered with horror of himself , thinking how he had gone to her to offer it , asking her to marry him -- with his head on his breast in shameful fear that she would accept him !
Parsing [sent. 6613 len. 43]: He had not known her ; the knowing had lost her to him , and this had been his real awakening ; for he knew now how deep had been that slumber wherein he dreamily celebrated the superiority of `` friendship '' !
Parsing [sent. 6614 len. 19]: The sleep-walker had wakened to bitter knowledge of love and life , finding himself a failure in both .
Parsing [sent. 6615 len. 21]: He had made a burnt offering of his dreams , and the sacrifice had been an unforgivable hurt to Mary .
Parsing [sent. 6616 len. 38]: All that was left for him was the work he had not chosen , but at least he would not fail in that , though it was indeed no more than `` dust in his mouth . ''
Parsing [sent. 6617 len. 30]: If there had been anything `` to work for -- '' He went to the window , raised it , and let in the uproar of the streets below .
Parsing [sent. 6618 len. 34]: He looked down at the blurred , hurrying swarms and he looked across , over the roofs with their panting jets of vapor , into the vast , foggy heart of the smoke .
Parsing [sent. 6619 len. 34]: Dizzy traceries of steel were rising dimly against it , chattering with steel on steel , and screeching in steam , while tiny figures of men walked on threads in the dull sky .
Parsing [sent. 6620 len. 6]: Buildings would overtop the Sheridan .
Parsing [sent. 6621 len. 5]: Bigness was being served .
Parsing [sent. 6622 len. 4]: But what for ?
Parsing [sent. 6623 len. 11]: The old question came to Bibbs with a new despair .
Parsing [sent. 6624 len. 27]: Here , where his eyes fell , had once been green fields and running brooks , and how had the kind earth been despoiled and disfigured !
Parsing [sent. 6625 len. 43]: The pioneers had begun the work , but in their old age their orators had said for them that they had toiled and risked and sacrificed that their posterity might live in peace and wisdom , enjoying the fruits of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 6626 len. 13]: Well , their posterity was here -- and there was only turmoil .
Parsing [sent. 6627 len. 6]: Where was the promised land ?
Parsing [sent. 6628 len. 47]: It had been promised by the soldiers of all the wars ; it had been promised to this generation by the pioneers ; but here was the very posterity to whom it had been promised , toiling and risking and sacrificing in turn -- for what ?
Parsing [sent. 6629 len. 35]: The harsh roar of the city came in through the open window , continuously beating upon Bibbs 's ear until he began to distinguish a pulsation in it -- a broken and irregular cadence .
Parsing [sent. 6630 len. 27]: It seemed to him that it was like a titanic voice , discordant , hoarse , rustily metallic -- the voice of the god , Bigness .
Parsing [sent. 6631 len. 12]: And the voice summoned Bibbs as it summoned all its servants .
Parsing [sent. 6632 len. 6]: `` Come and work ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6633 len. 5]: it seemed to yell .
Parsing [sent. 6634 len. 10]: `` Come and work for Me , all men !
Parsing [sent. 6635 len. 10]: By your youth and your hope I summon you !
Parsing [sent. 6636 len. 23]: By your age and your despair I summon you to work for Me yet a little , with what strength you have .
Parsing [sent. 6637 len. 9]: By your love of home I summon you !
Parsing [sent. 6638 len. 9]: By your love of woman I summon you !
Parsing [sent. 6639 len. 9]: By your hope of children I summon you !
Parsing [sent. 6640 len. 20]: `` You shall be blind slaves of Mine , blind to everything but Me , your Master and Driver !
Parsing [sent. 6641 len. 11]: For your reward you shall gaze only upon my ugliness .
Parsing [sent. 6642 len. 21]: You shall give your toil and your lives , you shall go mad for love and worship of my ugliness !
Parsing [sent. 6643 len. 18]: You shall perish still worshipping Me , and your children shall perish knowing no other god ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6644 len. 41]: And then , as Bibbs closed the window down tight , he heard his father 's voice booming in the next room ; he could not distinguish the words but the tone was exultant -- and there came the THUMP !
Parsing [sent. 6645 len. 2]: THUMP !
Parsing [sent. 6646 len. 5]: of the maimed hand .
Parsing [sent. 6647 len. 18]: Bibbs guessed that Sheridan was bragging of the city and of Bigness to some visitor from out-of-town .
Parsing [sent. 6648 len. 13]: And he thought how truly Sheridan was the high priest of Bigness .
Parsing [sent. 6649 len. 14]: But with the old , old thought again , `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6650 len. 10]: Bibbs caught a glimmer of far , faint light .
Parsing [sent. 6651 len. 34]: He saw that Sheridan had all his life struggled and conquered , and must all his life go on struggling and inevitably conquering , as part of a vast impulse not his own .
Parsing [sent. 6652 len. 10]: Sheridan served blindly -- but was the impulse blind ?
Parsing [sent. 6653 len. 19]: Bibbs asked himself if it was not he who had been in the greater hurry , after all .
Parsing [sent. 6654 len. 23]: The kiln must be fired before the vase is glazed , and the Acropolis was not crowned with marble in a day .
Parsing [sent. 6655 len. 28]: Then the voice came to him again , but there was a strain in it as of some high music struggling to be born of the turmoil .
Parsing [sent. 6656 len. 24]: `` Ugly I am , '' it seemed to say to him , `` but never forget that I AM a god ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6657 len. 10]: And the voice grew in sonorousness and in dignity .
Parsing [sent. 6658 len. 23]: `` The highest should serve , but so long as you worship me for my own sake I will not serve you .
Parsing [sent. 6659 len. 14]: It is man who makes me ugly , by his worship of me .
Parsing [sent. 6660 len. 14]: If man would let me serve him , I should be beautiful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6661 len. 52]: Looking once more from the window , Bibbs sculptured for himself -- in the vague contortions of the smoke and fog above the roofs -- a gigantic figure with feet pedestaled upon the great buildings and shoulders disappearing in the clouds , a colossus of steel and wholly blackened with soot .
Parsing [sent. 6662 len. 92]: But Bibbs carried his fancy further -- for there was still a little poet lingering in the back of his head -- and he thought that up over the clouds , unseen from below , the giant labored with his hands in the clean sunshine ; and Bibbs had a glimpse of what he made there -- perhaps for a fellowship of the children of the children that were children now -- a noble and joyous city , unbelievably white -- It was the telephone that called him from his vision .
