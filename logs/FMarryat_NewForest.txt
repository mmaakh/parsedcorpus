Parsing [sent. 1 len. 11]: The Children of the New Forest , by Captain Marryat .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 15]: Captain Frederick Marryat was born July 10 1792 , and died August 8 1848 .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 16]: He retired from the British navy in 1828 in order to devote himself to writing .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 31]: In the following 20 years he wrote 26 books , many of which are among the very best of English literature , and some of which are still in print .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 14]: Marryat had an extraordinary gift for the invention of episodes in his stories .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 24]: He says somewhere that when he sat down for the day 's work , he never knew what he was going to write .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 7]: He certainly was a literary genius .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 33]: `` The Children of the New Forest '' was published in 1847 , the twenty-fourth book to flow from Marryat 's pen , and the last published whilst he was still alive .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 22]: It was written for children , and has been phenomenally succesful : it is still in print over 150 years later .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 21]: This e-text was transcribed in 1998 by Nick Hodson , and was reformatted in 2003 , and again in 2005 .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 12]: THE CHILDREN OF THE NEW FOREST , BY CAPTAIN FREDERICK MARRYAT .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 3]: CHAPTER ONE .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 19]: The circumstances which I am about to relate to my juvenile readers took place in the year 1647 .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 51]: By referring to the history of England of that date they will find that King Charles the First , against whom the Commons of England had rebelled , after a civil war of nearly five years , had been defeated , and was confined as a prisoner at Hampton Court .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 33]: The Cavaliers , or the party who fought for King Charles , had all been dispersed , and the Parliamentary army under the command of Cromwell were beginning to control the Commons .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 52]: It was in the month of November in this year that King Charles , accompanied by Sir John Berkely Ashburnham and Legg , made his escape from Hampton Court , and rode as fast as the horses could carry them towards that part of Hampshire which led to the New Forest .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 25]: The king expected that his friends had provided a vessel in which he might escape to France ; but in this he was disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 31]: There was no vessel ready , and after riding for some time along the shore he resolved to go to Titchfield , a seat belonging to the Earl of Southampton .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 48]: After a long consultation with those who attended him , he yielded to their advice , which was , to trust to Colonel Hammond , who was governor of the Isle of Wight for the Parliament , but who was supposed to be friendly to the king .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 43]: Whatever might be the feelings of commiseration of Colonel Hammond towards a king so unfortunately situated , he was firm in his duties towards his employers , and the consequence was that King Charles found himself again a prisoner in Carisbrook Castle .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 19]: But we must now leave the king , and retrace history to the commencement of the civil war .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 61]: A short distance from the town of Lymington , which is not far from Titchfield , where the king took shelter , but on the other side of the Southampton Water , and south of the New Forest , to which it adjoins , was a property called Arnwood , which belonged to a Cavalier of the name of Beverley .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 44]: It was at that time a property of considerable value , being very extensive , and the park ornamented with valuable timber ; for it abutted on the New Forest , and might have been supposed to have been a continuation of it .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 40]: This Colonel Beverley , as we must call him , for he rose to that rank in the king 's army , was a valued friend and companion of Prince Rupert 's , and commanded several troops of cavalry .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 29]: He was ever at his side in the brilliant charges made by this gallant prince , and at last fell in his arms at the battle of Naseby .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 61]: Colonel Beverley had married into the family of the Villiers , and the issue of his marriage was two sons and two daughters ; but his zeal and sense of duty had induced him , at the commencement of the war , to leave his wife and family at Arnwood , and he was fated never to meet them again .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 77]: The news of his death had such an effect upon Mrs Beverley , already worn with anxiety on her husband 's account , that a few months afterwards she followed him to an early tomb , leaving the four children under the charge of an elderly relative till such time as the family of the Villiers could protect them ; but , as will appear by our history , this was not at that period possible .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 37]: The life of a king and many other lives were in jeopardy , and the orphans remained at Arnwood , still under the care of their elderly relation , at the time that our history commences .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 70]: The New Forest , my readers are perhaps aware , was first enclosed by William the Conqueror as a royal forest for his own amusement , for in those days most crowned heads were passionately fond of the chase ; and they may also recollect that his successor , William Rufus , met his death in this forest by the glancing of an arrow shot by Sir Walter Tyrrell .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 14]: Since that time to the present day it has continued a royal domain .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 30]: At the period of which we are writing it had an establishment of verderers and keepers , paid by the Crown , amounting to some forty or fifty men .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 86]: At the commencement of the civil war they remained at their posts , but soon found , in the disorganised state of the country , that their wages were no longer to be obtained ; and then , when the king had decided upon raising an army , Beverley , who held a superior office in the forest , enrolled all the young and athletic men who were employed in the forest , and marched them away with him to join the king 's army .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 52]: Some few remained , their age not rendering their services of value , and among them was an old and attached servant of Beverley 's , a man above sixty years of age , whose name was Jacob Armitage , and who had obtained the situation through Colonel Beverley 's interest .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 34]: Those who remained in the forest lived in cottages many miles asunder , and indemnified themselves for the non-payment of their salaries by killing the deer for sale and for their own subsistence .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 96]: The cottage of Jacob Armitage was situated on the skirts of the New Forest , about a mile and a half from the mansion of Arnwood ; and when Colonel Beverley went to join the king 's troops , feeling how little security there would be for his wife and children in those troubled times , he requested the old man , by his attachment to the family , not to lose sight of Arnwood , but to call there as often as possible to see if he could be of service to Mrs Beverley .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 25]: The colonel would have persuaded Jacob to have altogether taken up his residence at the mansion ; but to this the old man objected .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 20]: He had been all his life under the greenwood tree , and could not bear to leave the forest .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 26]: He promised the colonel that he would watch over his family , and ever be at hand when required ; and he kept his word .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 60]: The death of Colonel Beverley was a heavy blow to the old forester , and he watched over Mrs Beverley and the orphans with the greatest solicitude ; but when Mrs Beverley followed her husband to the tomb he then redoubled his attentions , and was seldom more than a few hours at a time away from the mansion .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 27]: The two boys were his inseparable companions , and he instructed them , young as they were , in all the secrets of his own calling .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 33]: Such was the state of affairs at the time that King Charles made his escape from Hampton Court ; and I now shall resume my narrative from where it was broken off .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 45]: As soon as the escape of Charles the First was made known to Cromwell and the Parliament , troops of horse were despatched in every direction to the southward , towards which the prints of the horses ' hoofs proved that he had gone .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 61]: As they found that he had proceeded in the direction of the New Forest , the troops were subdivided and ordered to scour the forest , in parties of twelve to twenty , while others hastened down to Southampton , Lymington , and every other seaport or part of the coast from which the king might be likely to embark .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 64]: Old Jacob had been at Arnwood on the day before , but on this day he had made up his mind to procure some venison , that he might not go there again empty-handed ; for Miss Judith Villiers was very partial to venison , and was not slow to remind Jacob if the larder was for many days deficient in that meat .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 68]: Jacob had gone out accordingly ; he had gained his leeward position of a fine buck , and was gradually nearing him by stealth , now behind a huge oak-tree , and then crawling through the high fern , so as to get within shot unperceived , when on a sudden the animal , which had been quietly feeding , bounded away and disappeared in the thicket .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 23]: At the same time Jacob perceived a small body of horse galloping through the glen in which the buck had been feeding .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 61]: Jacob had never yet seen the Parliamentary troops , for they had not during the war been sent into that part of the country , but their iron skull-caps , their buff accoutrements , and dark habiliments , assured him that such these must be ; so very different were they from the gaily-equipped Cavalier cavalry commanded by Prince Rupert .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 81]: At the time that they advanced , Jacob had been lying down in the fern near to some low black-thorn-bushes ; not wishing to be perceived by them , he drew back between the bushes , intending to remain concealed until they should gallop out of sight ; for Jacob thought , `` I am a king 's forester , and they may consider me as an enemy ; and who knows how I may be treated by them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 88]: But Jacob was disappointed in his expectations of the troops riding past him ; on the contrary , as soon as they arrived at an oak-tree within twenty yards of where he was concealed , the order was given to halt and dismount ; the sabres of the horsemen clattered in their iron sheaths as the order was obeyed , and the old man expected to be immediately discovered ; but one of the thorn-bushes was directly between him and the troopers , and effectually concealed him .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 42]: At last Jacob ventured to raise his head and peep through the bush ; and he perceived that the men were loosening the girths of their black horses , or wiping away the perspiration from their sides with handfuls of fern .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 40]: A powerfully-framed man , who appeared to command the others , was standing with his hand upon the arched neck of his steed , which appeared as fresh and vigorous as ever , although covered with foam and perspiration .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 34]: `` Spare not to rub down , my men , '' said he , `` for we have tried the mettle of our horses , and have now but one half-hour 's breathing-time .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 16]: We must be on , for the work of the Lord must be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 66]: `` They say that this forest is many miles in length and breadth , '' observed another of the men , `` and we may ride many a mile to no purpose ; but here is James Southwold , who once was living in it as a verderer ; nay , I think that he said that he was born and bred in these woods .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 9]: Was it not so , James Southwold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 35]: `` It is even as you say , '' replied an active-looking young man ; `` I was born and bred in this forest , and my father was a verderer before me . ''
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 17]: Jacob Armitage , who listened to the conversation , immediately recognised the young man in question .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 19]: He was one of those who had joined the king 's army with the other verderers and keepers .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 101]: It pained him much to perceive that one who had always been considered a frank , true-hearted young man , and who left the forest to fight in defence of his king , was now turned a traitor , and had joined the ranks of the enemy ; and Jacob thought how much better it had been for James Southwold if he had never quitted the New Forest , and had not been corrupted by evil company : `` He was a good lad , '' thought Jacob , `` and now he is a traitor and a hypocrite . ''
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 31]: `` If born and bred in this forest , James Southwold , '' said the leader of the troop , `` you must fain know all its mazes and paths .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 27]: Now call to mind , are there no secret hiding-places in which people may remain concealed ; no thickets which may cover both man and horse ?
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 17]: Peradventure thou mayst point out the very spot where this man Charles may be hidden . ''
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 34]: `` I do know one dell , within a mile of Arnwood , '' replied James Southwold , `` which might cover double our troop from the eyes of the most wary . ''
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 13]: `` We will ride there , then , '' replied the leader .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 6]: `` Arnwood , sayest thou ?
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 20]: Is not that the property of the Malignant , Cavalier Beverley , who was shot down at Naseby ? ''
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 52]: `` Even so , '' replied Southwold ; `` and many is the time -- that is , in the olden time , before I was regenerated -- many is the day of revelry that I have passed there ; many the cup of good ale that I have quaffed . ''
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 13]: `` And thou shalt quaff it again , '' replied the leader .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 17]: `` Good ale was not intended only for Malignants , but for those who serve diligently .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 22]: After we have examined the dell which thou speakest of , we will direct our horses ' heads towards Arnwood . ''
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 18]: `` Who knows but what the man Charles may be concealed in the Malignant 's house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 3]: observed another .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 46]: `` In the day , I should say no , '' replied the leader ; `` but in the night the Cavaliers like to have a roof over their heads ; and therefore at night , and not before , will we proceed thither . ''
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 21]: `` I have searched many of their abodes , '' observed another ; `` but search is almost in vain .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 26]: What with their spring panels and secret doors , their false ceilings and double walls , one may ferret for ever and find nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 48]: `` Yes , '' replied the leader , `` their abodes are full of these Popish abominations ; but there is one way which is sure ; and if the man Charles be concealed in any house , I venture to say that I will find him .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 43]: Fire and smoke will bring him forth ; and to every Malignant 's house within twenty miles will I apply the torch ; but it must be at night , for we are not sure of his being housed during the day .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 12]: James Southwold , thou knowest well the mansion of Arnwood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 41]: `` I know well my way to all the offices below -- the buttery , the cellar , and the kitchen ; but I can not say that I have ever been into the apartments of the upper house . ''
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 22]: `` That it needeth not ; if thou canst direct us to the lower entrance , it will be sufficient . ''
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 25]: `` That can I , Master Ingram , '' replied Southwold , `` and to where the best ale used to be found . ''
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 16]: `` Enough , Southwold , enough ; our work must be done , and diligently .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 55]: Now , my men , tighten your girths ; we will just ride to the dell : if it conceals not whom we seek , it shall conceal us till night , and then the country shall be lighted up with the flames of Arnwood , while we surround the house and prevent escape .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 6]: Levellers , to horse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 20]: The troopers sprang upon their saddles , and went off at a hard trot , Southwold leading the way .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 17]: Jacob remained among the fern until they were out of sight , and then rose up .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 64]: He looked for a short time in the direction in which the troopers had gone , stooped down again to take up his gun , and then said , `` There 's providence in this ; yes , and there 's providence in my not having my dog with me , for he would not have remained quiet for so long a time .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 14]: Who would ever have thought that James Southwold would have turned a traitor !
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 28]: More than traitor , for he is now ready to bite the hand that has fed him , to burn the house that has ever welcomed him .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 18]: This is a bad world , and I thank heaven that I have lived in the woods .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 30]: But there is no time to lose ; '' and the old forester threw his gun over his shoulder and hastened away in the direction of his own cottage .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 26]: `` And so the king has escaped , '' thought Jacob , as he went along , `` and he may be in the forest !
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 20]: Who knows but he may be at Arnwood , for he must hardly know where to go for shelter ?
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 9]: I must haste and see Miss Judith immediately .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 7]: ` Levellers , to horse ! '
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 4]: the fellow said .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 6]: What 's a Leveller ? ''
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 3]: thought Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 55]: As perhaps my readers may ask the same question , they must know that a large proportion of the Parliamentary army had at this time assumed the name of Levellers , in consequence of having taken up the opinion that every man should be on an equality , and property should be equally divided .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 64]: The hatred of these people to any one above them in rank or property , especially towards those of the king 's party , which mostly consisted of men of rank and property , was unbounded , and they were merciless and cruel to the highest degree ; throwing off much of hat fanatical bearing and language which had before distinguished the Puritans .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 22]: Cromwell had great difficulty in eventually putting them down , which he did at last accomplish by hanging and slaughtering many .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 32]: Of this Jacob knew nothing ; all he knew was , that Arnwood was to be burnt down that night , and that it would be necessary to remove the family .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 16]: As for obtaining assistance to oppose the troopers , that he knew to be impossible .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 32]: As he thought of what must take place , he thanked God for having allowed him to gain the knowledge of what was to happen , and hastened on his way .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 17]: He had been about eight miles from Arnwood when he had concealed himself in the fern .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 22]: Jacob first went to his cottage to deposit his gun , saddled his forest pony , and set off for Arnwood .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 46]: In less than two hours the old man was at the door of the mansion ; it was then about three o'clock in the afternoon , and being in the month of November , there was not so much as two hours of daylight remaining .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 48]: `` I shall have a difficult job with the stiff old lady , '' thought Jacob , as he rang the bell ; `` I do n't believe that she would rise out of her high chair for old Noll and his whole army at his back .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 6]: But we shall see . ''
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWO .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 23]: Before Jacob is admitted to the presence of Miss Judith Villiers , we must give some account of the establishment at Arnwood .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 55]: With the exception of one male servant , who officiated in the house and stable as his services might be required , every man of the household of Colonel Beverley had followed the fortunes of their master , and as none had returned , they , in all probability , had shared his fate .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 15]: Three female servants , with the man above mentioned , composed the whole household .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 26]: Indeed , there was every reason for not increasing the establishment ; for the rents were either paid in part or not paid at all .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 59]: It was generally supposed that the property , now that the Parliament had gained the day , would be sequestrated , although such was not yet the case ; and the tenants were unwilling to pay , to those who were not authorised to receive , the rents which they might be again called upon to make good .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 54]: Miss Judith Villiers , therefore , found it difficult to maintain the present household ; and although she did not tell Jacob Armitage that such was the case , the fact was , that very often the venison which he brought to the mansion was all the meat that was in the larder .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 35]: The three female servants held the offices of cook , attendant upon Miss Villiers , and housemaid ; the children being under the care of no particular servant , and left much to themselves .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 100]: There had been a chaplain in the house , but he had quitted before the death of Mrs Beverley , and the vacancy had not been filled up ; indeed , it could not well be , for the one who left had not received his salary for many months , and Miss Judith Villiers , expecting every day to be summoned by her relations to bring the children and join them , sat in her high chair waiting for the arrival of this summons , which , from the distracted state of the times , had never come .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 25]: As we have before said , the orphans were four in number ; the two eldest were boys , and the youngest were girls .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 31]: Edward , the eldest boy , was between thirteen and fourteen years old ; Humphrey , the second , was twelve ; Alice , eleven ; and Edith , eight .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 44]: As it is the history of these young persons which we are about to narrate , we shall say little about them at present , except that for many months they had been under little or no restraint , and less attended to .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 29]: Their companions were Benjamin , the man who remained in the house , and old Jacob Armitage , who passed all the time he could spare with them .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 17]: Benjamin was rather weak in intellect , and was a source of amusement rather than otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 32]: As for the female servants , one was wholly occupied with her attendance on Miss Judith , who was very exacting , and had a high notion of her own consequence .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 27]: The other two had more than sufficient employment ; as , when there is no money to pay with , everything must be done at home .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 42]: That , under such circumstances , the boys became boisterous and the little girls became romps , is not to be wondered at ; but their having become so was the cause of Miss Judith seldom admitting them into her room .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 34]: It is true that they were sent for once a day , to ascertain if they were in the house or in existence , but soon dismissed and left to their own resources .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 12]: Such was the neglect to which these young orphans were exposed .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 39]: It must , however , be admitted , that this very neglect made them independent and bold , full of health from constant activity , and more fitted for the change which was so soon to take place .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 25]: `` Benjamin , '' said Jacob , as the other came to the door , `` I must speak with the old lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 10]: `` Have you brought any venison , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 19]: said Benjamin , grinning ; `` else , I reckon , you 'll not be over welcome . ''
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 22]: `` No , I have not ; but it is an important business , so send Agatha to her directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 15]: `` I will ; and I 'll not say anything about the venison . ''
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 17]: In a few minutes Jacob was ushered up by Agatha into Miss Judith Villiers 's apartment .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 44]: The old lady was about fifty years of age , very prim and starched , sitting in a high-backed chair , with her feet upon a stool , and her hands crossed before her , her black mittens reposing upon her snow-white apron .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 7]: The old forester made his obeisance .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 17]: `` You have important business with us , I am told , '' observed Miss Judith .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 10]: `` Most important , madam , '' replied Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 26]: `` In the first place , it is right that you should be informed that his Majesty King Charles has escaped from Hampton Court . ''
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 6]: `` His majesty escaped ! ''
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 4]: replied the lady .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 14]: `` Yes ; and is supposed to be secreted somewhere in this neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 14]: His majesty is not in this house , madam , I presume ? ''
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 36]: `` Jacob , his majesty is not in this house ; if he were , I would suffer my tongue to be torn out sooner than I would confess it , even to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 13]: `` But I have more for your private ear , madam . ''
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 24]: `` Agatha , retire ; and Agatha , be mindful that you go downstairs , and do not remain outside the door . ''
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 26]: Agatha , with this injunction , bounced out of the room , slamming-to the door so as to make Miss Judith start from her seat .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 5]: `` Ill-mannered girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 4]: exclaimed Miss Judith .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 11]: `` Now , Jacob Armitage , you may proceed . ''
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 37]: Jacob then entered into the detail of what he had overheard that morning , when he fell in with the troopers , concluding with the information that the mansion would be burnt down that very night .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 22]: He then pointed out the necessity of immediately abandoning the house , as it would be impossible to oppose the troopers .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 12]: `` And where am I to go to , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 5]: said Miss Judith calmly .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 28]: `` I hardly know , madam ; there is my cottage , it is but a poor place , and not fit for one like you . ''
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 16]: `` So I should presume , Jacob Armitage ; neither shall I accept your offer .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 23]: It would ill befit the dignity of a Villiers to be frightened out of her abode by a party of rude soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 19]: Happen what will , I shall not stir from this -- no , not even from this chair .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 12]: Neither do I consider the danger so great as you suppose .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 14]: Let Benjamin saddle , and be prepared to ride over to Lymington immediately .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 18]: I will give him a letter to the magistrate there , who will send us protection . ''
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 12]: `` But , madam , the children can not remain here .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 7]: I will not leave them here .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 23]: I promised the colonel -- '' `` Will the children be in more danger than I shall be , Jacob Armitage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 6]: replied the old lady stiffly .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 52]: `` They dare not ill-treat me -- they may force the buttery and drink the ale -- they may make merry with that and the venison which you have brought with you , I presume ; but they will hardly venture to insult a lady of the house of Villiers . ''
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 10]: `` I fear they will venture anything , madam .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 23]: At all events , they will frighten the children , and for one night they will be better in my cottage . ''
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 25]: `` Well , then , be it so ; take them to your cottage , and take Martha to attend upon the Miss Beverleys .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 23]: Go down now , and desire Agatha to come to me , and Benjamin to saddle as fast as he can . ''
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 14]: Jacob left the room , satisfied with the permission to remove the children .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 23]: He knew that it was useless to argue with Miss Judith , who was immovable when once she had declared her intentions .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 83]: He was debating in his own mind whether he should acquaint the servants with the threatened danger ; but he had no occasion to do so , for Agatha had remained at the door while Jacob was communicating the intelligence , and as soon as he had arrived at that portion of it by which she learnt that the mansion was to be burnt down that night , had run off to the kitchen to communicate the intelligence to the other servants .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 21]: `` I 'll not stay to be burnt to death , '' exclaimed the cook , as Jacob came in .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 14]: `` Well , Mr Armitage , this is pretty news you have brought .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 7]: What does my lady say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 28]: `` She desires that Benjamin saddles immediately , to carry a letter to Lymington ; and you , Agatha , are to go upstairs to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 9]: `` But what does she mean to do ?
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 7]: Where are we to go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 3]: exclaimed Agatha .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 11]: `` Miss Judith intends to remain where she is . ''
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 20]: `` Then she will remain alone for me , '' exclaimed the housemaid , who was admired by Benjamin .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 39]: `` It 's bad enough to have little victuals and no wages ; but as for being burnt to death -- Benjamin , put a pillion behind your saddle , and I 'll go to Lymington with you .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 11]: I wo n't be long in getting my bundle . ''
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 31]: Benjamin , who was in the kitchen with the maids at the time that Jacob entered , made a sign significant of consent , and went away to the stable .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 23]: Agatha went up to her mistress in a state of great perturbation , and the cook also hurried away to her bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 30]: `` They 'll all leave her , '' thought Jacob ; `` well , my duty is plain ; I 'll not leave the children in the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 16]: Jacob then went in search of them , and found them playing in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 15]: He called the two boys to him , and told them to follow him .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 21]: `` Now , Mr Edward , '' said he , `` you must prove yourself your father 's own son .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 38]: We must leave this house immediately ; come up with me to your rooms , and help me to pack up yours and your sisters ' clothes , for we must go to my cottage this night .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 9]: There is no time to be lost . ''
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 12]: `` But why , Jacob ; I must know why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 13]: `` Because the Parliamentary troopers will burn it down this night . ''
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 5]: `` Burn it down !
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 11]: Why , the house is mine , is it not ?
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 9]: Who dares to burn down this house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 12]: `` They will dare it , and will do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 37]: `` But we will fight them , Jacob ; we can bolt and bar ; I can fire a gun , and hit too , as you know ; then there 's Benjamin and you . ''
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 19]: `` And what can you and two men do against a troop of horse , my dear boy ?
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 25]: If we could defend the place against them , Jacob Armitage would be the first ; but it is impossible , my dear boy .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 4]: Recollect your sisters .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 14]: Would you have them burnt to death , or shot by these wretches ?
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 19]: No , no , Mr Edward ; you must do as I say , and lose no time .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 40]: Let us pack up what will be most useful , and load White Billy with the bundles ; then you must all come to the cottage with me , and we will make it out how we can . ''
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 7]: `` That will be jolly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 9]: said Humphrey ; `` come , Edward . ''
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 33]: But Edward Beverley required more persuasion to abandon the house ; at last old Jacob prevailed , and the clothes were put up in bundles as fast as they could collect them .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 43]: `` Your aunt said Martha was to go with your sisters , but I doubt if she will , '' observed Jacob , `` and I think we shall have no room for her , for the cottage is small enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 29]: `` Oh no , we do n't want her , '' said Humphrey ; `` Alice always dresses Edith and herself too , ever since mamma died . ''
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 25]: `` Now we will carry down the bundles , and you make them fast on the pony while I go for your sisters . ''
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 9]: `` But where does Aunt Judith go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 3]: inquired Edward .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 22]: `` She will not leave the house , Master Edward ; she intends to stay and speak to the troopers . ''
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 22]: `` And so an old woman like her remains to face the enemy , while I run away from them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 3]: replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 7]: `` I will not go . ''
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 70]: `` Well , Master Edward , '' replied Jacob , `` you must do as you please ; but it will be cruel to leave your sisters here ; they and Humphrey must come with me , and I can not manage to get them to the cottage without you go with us ; it is not far , and you can return in a very short time . ''
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 5]: To this Edward consented .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 25]: The pony was soon loaded , and the little girls , who were still playing in the garden , were called in by Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 22]: They were told that they were going to pass the night in the cottage , and were delighted at the idea .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 26]: `` Now , Master Edward , '' said Jacob , `` will you take your sisters by the hand and lead them to the cottage ?
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 67]: Here is the key of the door ; Master Humphrey can lead the pony ; and Master Edward , '' continued Jacob , taking him aside , `` I 'll tell you one thing which I will not mention before your brother and sisters : the troopers are all about the New Forest , for King Charles has escaped , and they are seeking for him .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 15]: You must not , therefore , leave your brother and sisters till I return .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 10]: Lock the cottage-door as soon as it is dark .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 24]: You know where to get a light , over the cupboard ; and my gun is loaded , and hangs above the mantelpiece .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 28]: You must do your best , if they attempt to force an entrance ; but above all , promise me not to leave them till I return .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 29]: I will remain here to see what I can do with your aunt ; and when I come back , we can then decide how to act . ''
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 8]: This latter ruse of Jacob 's succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 29]: Edward promised that he would not leave his sisters , and it wanted but a few minutes of twilight when the little party quitted the mansion of Arnwood .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 34]: As they went out of the gates , they were passed by Benjamin , who was trotting away with Martha behind him on a pillion , holding a bundle as large as herself .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 16]: Not a word was exchanged , and Benjamin and Martha were soon out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 10]: `` Why , where can Martha be going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 3]: said Alice .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 12]: `` Will she be back when we come home to-morrow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 31]: Edward made no reply , but Humphrey said , `` Well , she has taken plenty of clothes in that huge bundle , for one night , at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 37]: Jacob , as soon as he had seen the children on their way , returned to the kitchen , where he found Agatha and the cook collecting their property , evidently bent upon a hasty retreat .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 10]: `` Have you seen Miss Judith , Agatha ? ''
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 38]: `` Yes ; and she told me that she should remain , and that I should stand behind her chair , that she might receive the troopers with dignity ; but I do n't admire the plan .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 19]: They might leave her alone , but I am sure that they will be rude to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 11]: `` When did Benjamin say he would be back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 8]: `` He do n't intend coming back .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 33]: He said he would not , at all events , till to-morrow morning , and then he would ride out this way , to ascertain if the report was false or true .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 8]: But Martha has gone with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 19]: `` I wish I could persuade the old lady to leave the house , '' said Jacob thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 15]: `` I fear they will not pay her the respect that she calculates upon .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 15]: Go up , Agatha , and say I wish to speak with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 18]: `` No , not I ; I must be off , for it is dark already . ''
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 10]: `` And where are you going , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 6]: `` To Gossip Allwood 's .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 15]: It 's a good mile , and I have to carry my things . ''
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 25]: `` Well , Agatha , if you 'll take me up to the old lady , I 'll carry your things for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 27]: Agatha consented , and as soon as she had taken up the lamp , for it was now quite dark , Jacob was once more introduced .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 24]: `` I wish , madam , '' said Jacob , `` you would be persuaded to leave the house for this night . ''
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 24]: `` Jacob Armitage , leave this house I will not , if it were filled with troopers ; I have said so . ''
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 24]: `` But , madam -- '' `` No more , sir ; you are too forward , '' replied the old lady haughtily .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 19]: `` But , madam -- '' `` Leave my presence , Jacob Armitage , and never appear again .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 10]: Quit the room , and send Agatha here . ''
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 30]: `` She has left , madam , and so has the cook , and Martha went away behind Benjamin ; when I leave , you will be alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 8]: `` They have dared to leave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 9]: `` They dared not stay , madam . ''
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 17]: `` Leave me , Jacob Armitage , and shut the door when you go out . ''
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 4]: Jacob still hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 35]: `` Obey me instantly , '' said the old lady ; and the forester , finding all remonstrance useless , went out , and obeyed her last commands by shutting the door after him .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 39]: Jacob found Agatha and the other maid in the courtyard ; he took up their packages , and , as he promised , accompanied them to Gossip Allwood , who kept a small ale-house about a mile distant .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 7]: `` But , mercy on us !
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 8]: What will become of the children ? ''
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 26]: said Agatha , as they walked along , her fears for herself having , up to this time , made her utterly forgetful of them .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 4]: `` Poor things !
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 7]: And Martha has left them . ''
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 14]: `` Yes , indeed ; what will become of the dear babes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 6]: said the cook , half-crying .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 44]: Now Jacob , knowing that the children of such a Malignant as Colonel Beverley would have sorry treatment if discovered , and knowing also that women were not always to be trusted , determined not to tell them how they were disposed of .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 14]: He therefore replied : `` Who would hurt such young children as those ?
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 17]: No , no , they are safe enough ; even the troopers would protect them . ''
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 10]: `` I should hope so , '' replied Agatha .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 18]: `` You may be sure of that ; no man would hurt babies , '' replied Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 14]: `` The troopers will take them with them to Lymington , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 21]: I 've no fear for them ; it 's the proud old lady whom they will be uncivil to . ''
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 15]: The conversation here ended , and in due time they arrived at the inn .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 20]: Jacob had just put the bundles down on the table when the clattering of horses ' hoofs was heard .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 15]: Shortly afterwards the troopers pulled their horses up at the door , and dismounted .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 16]: Jacob recognised the party he had met in the forest , and among them Southwold .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 31]: The troopers called for ale , and remained some time in the house , talking and laughing with the women , especially Agatha , who was a very good-looking girl .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 23]: Jacob would have retreated quietly , but he found a sentinel posted at the door to prevent the egress of any person .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 26]: He reseated himself , and while he was listening to the conversation of the troopers , he was recognised by Southwold , who accosted him .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 31]: Jacob did not pretend not to know him , as it would have been useless ; and Southwold put many questions to him as to who were resident at Arnwood .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 37]: Jacob replied that the children were there , and a few servants , and he was about to mention Miss Judith Villiers , when a thought struck him , -- he might save the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 26]: `` You are going to Arnwood , I know , '' said Jacob , `` and I have heard who you are in search of .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 11]: Well , Southwold , I 'll give you a hint .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 46]: I may be wrong ; but if you should fall in with an old lady , or something like one , when you go to Arnwood , mount her on your crupper , and away with her to Lymington as fast as you can ride .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 5]: You understand me . ''
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 10]: Southwold nodded significantly , and squeezed Jacob 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 30]: `` One word , Jacob Armitage ; if I succeed in the capture by your means , it is but fair that you should have something for your hint .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 11]: Where can I find you the day after to-morrow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 14]: `` I am leaving the country this night , and go I must .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 22]: I am in trouble , that 's the fact ; when all is blown over , I will find you out .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 11]: Do n't speak to me any more just now . ''
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 11]: Southwold again squeezed Jacob 's hand , and left him .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 15]: Shortly afterwards the order was given to mount , and the troopers set off .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 6]: Armitage followed slowly and unobserved .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 9]: They arrived at the mansion and surrounded it .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 55]: Shortly afterwards he perceived the glare of torches , and in a quarter of an hour more thick smoke rose up in the dark but clear sky ; at last the flames burst forth from the lower windows of the mansion , and soon afterwards they lighted up the country round to some distance .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 58]: `` It is done , '' thought Jacob , and he turned to bend his hasty steps towards his own cottage , when he heard the galloping of a horse and violent screams ; a minute afterwards James Southwold passed him with the old lady tied behind him , kicking and struggling as hard as she could .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 51]: Jacob smiled , as he thought that he had by his little stratagem saved the old woman 's life , for that Southwold imagined that she was King Charles dressed up as an old woman was evident ; and he then returned as fast as he could to the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 43]: In half an hour Jacob had passed through the thick woods which were between the mansion and his own cottage , occasionally looking back , as the flames of the mansion rose higher and higher , throwing their light far and wide .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 33]: He knocked at the cottage-door ; Smoker , a large dog , cross-bred between the fox and bloodhound , growled till Jacob spoke to him , and then Edward opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 38]: `` My sisters are in bed and fast asleep , Jacob , '' said Edward , `` and Humphrey has been nodding this half-hour ; had he not better go to bed before we go back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 17]: `` Come out , Master Edward , '' -- replied Jacob , `` and look . ''
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 15]: Edward beheld the flames and fierce light between the trees , and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 47]: `` I told you that it would be so , and you would all have been burnt in your beds , for they did not enter the house to see who was in it , but fired it as soon as they had surrounded it . ''
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 6]: `` And my aunt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 7]: exclaimed Edward , clasping his hands .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 15]: `` Is safe , Master Edward , and by this time at Lymington . ''
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 9]: `` We will go to her to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 15]: `` I fear not ; you must not risk so much , Master Edward .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 23]: These Levellers spare nobody , and you had better let it be supposed that you are all burnt in the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 11]: `` But my aunt knows the contrary , Jacob . ''
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 10]: `` Very true ; I quite forgot that . ''
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 5]: And so Jacob had .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 41]: He expected that the old woman would have been burnt , and then nobody would have known of the existence of the children ; he forgot when he planned to save her , that she knew where the children were .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 46]: `` Well , Master Edward , I will go to Lymington to-morrow and see the old lady ; but you must remain here , and take charge of your sisters till I come back , and then we will consider what is to be done .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 11]: The flames are not so bright as they were . ''
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 19]: It is my house that these Roundheads have burned down , '' said Edward , shaking his fist .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 27]: `` It was your house , Master Edward , and it was your property ; but how long it will be so remains to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 8]: I fear it will be forfeited . ''
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 33]: `` Woe to the people who dare take possession of it , '' cried Edward ; `` I shall , if I live , be a man one of these days . ''
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 22]: `` Yes , Master Edward , and then you will reflect more than you do now , and not be rash .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 25]: Let us go into the cottage , for it 's no use remaining out in the cold ; the frost is sharp to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 8]: Edward slowly followed Jacob into the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 6]: His little heart was full .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 65]: He was a proud boy and a good boy , but the destruction of the mansion had raised up evil thoughts in his heart -- hatred to the Covenanters , who had killed his father and now burnt the property -- revenge upon them -LRB- how , he knew not -RRB- ; but his hand was ready to strike , young as he was .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 13]: He lay down on the bed , but he could not sleep .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 18]: He turned and turned again , and his brain was teeming with thoughts and plans of vengeance .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 30]: Had he said his prayers that night , he would have been obliged to repeat , `` Forgive us , as we forgive them who trespass against us . ''
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 29]: At last he fell fast asleep , but his dreams were wild , and he often called out during the night , and woke his brother and sisters .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 3]: CHAPTER THREE .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 21]: The next morning , as soon as Jacob had given the children their breakfast , he set off towards Arnwood .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 35]: He knew that Benjamin had stated his intention to return with the horse and see what had taken place , and he knew him well enough to feel sure that he would do so .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 19]: He thought it better to see him , if possible , and ascertain the fate of Miss Judith .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 85]: Jacob arrived at the still smoking ruins of the mansion , and found several people there , mostly residents within a few miles , some attracted by curiosity , others busy in collecting the heavy masses of lead which had been melted from the roof , and appropriating them to their own benefit ; but much of it was still too hot to be touched , and they were throwing snow on it to cool it , for it had snowed during the night .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 19]: At last Jacob perceived Benjamin on horseback riding leisurely towards him , and immediately went up to him .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 11]: `` Well , Benjamin , this is a woeful sight .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 8]: What is the news from Lymington ? ''
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 18]: `` Lymington is full of troopers , and they are not over civil , '' replied Benjamin .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 11]: `` And the old lady -- where is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 21]: `` Ah , that 's a sad business , '' replied Benjamin , `` and the poor children , too .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 4]: Poor Master Edward !
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 9]: He would have made a brave gentleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 12]: `` But the old lady is safe , '' rejoined Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 7]: `` Did you see her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 21]: `` Yes , I saw her ; they thought she _ was _ King Charles -- poor old soul . ''
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 13]: `` But they have found out their mistake by this time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 28]: `` Yes , and James Southwold has found it out too , '' replied Benjamin ; `` to think of the old lady breaking his neck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 5]: `` Breaking his neck ?
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 6]: You do n't say so !
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 5]: How was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 67]: `` Why , it seems that Southwold thought that she was King Charles dressed up as an old woman , so he seized her and strapped her fast behind him , and galloped away with her to Lymington ; but she struggled and kicked so manfully , that he could not hold on , and off they went together , and he broke his neck . ''
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 3]: `` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 14]: -- a judgment -- a judgment upon a traitor , '' said Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 23]: `` They were picked up , strapped together as they were , by the other troopers , and carried to Lymington . ''
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 12]: `` Well , and where is the old lady , then ?
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 9]: Did you see and speak to her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 15]: `` I saw her , Jacob , but I did not speak to her .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 20]: I forgot to say , that when she broke Southwold 's neck , she broke her own too . ''
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 9]: `` Then the old lady is dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 18]: `` Yes , that she is , '' replied Benjamin ; `` but who cares about her ?
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 9]: It 's the poor children that I pity .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 8]: Martha has been crying ever since . ''
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 7]: `` I do n't wonder . ''
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 32]: `` I was at the ` Cavalier , ' and the troopers were there , and they were boasting of what they had done , and called it a righteous work .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 26]: I could not stand that , and I asked one of them if it were a righteous work to burn poor children in their beds ?
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 30]: So he turned round , and struck his sword upon the floor , and asked me whether I was one of them -- ` Who are you then ? '
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 19]: and I -- all my courage went away , and I answered , I was a poor rat-catcher .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 7]: ` A rat-catcher , are you ?
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 28]: Well then , Mr Rat-catcher , when you are killing rats , if you find a nest of young ones , do n't you kill them too ?
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 15]: Or do you leave them to grow , and become mischievous , eh ? '
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 27]: -- ` I kill the young ones , of course , ' replied I. ` Well , so do we Malignants whenever we find them . '
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 22]: I did n't say a word more , so I went out of the house as fast as I could . ''
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 10]: `` Have you heard anything about the king ? ''
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 3]: inquired Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 25]: `` No , nothing ; but the troopers are all out again , and , I hear , are gone to the forest . ''
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 26]: `` Well , Benjamin , good-bye ; I shall be off from this part of the country -- it 's no use my staying here .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 7]: Where 's Agatha and cook ? ''
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 10]: `` They came to Lymington early this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 10]: `` Wish them good-bye for me , Benjamin . ''
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 8]: `` Where are you going then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 13]: `` I ca n't exactly say , but I think London way .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 25]: I only stayed here to watch over the children ; and now that they are gone , I shall leave Arnwood for ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 37]: Jacob , who was anxious , on account of the intelligence he had received of the troopers being in the forest , to return to the cottage , shook hands with Benjamin , and hastened away .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 35]: `` Well , '' thought Jacob , as he wended his way , `` I 'm sorry for the poor old lady ; but still , perhaps , it 's all for the best .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 10]: Who knows what they might do with these children ?
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 21]: -- Destroy the nest as well as the rats , indeed : -- they must find the nest first . ''
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 11]: And the old forester continued his journey in deep thought .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 65]: We may here observe that , bloodthirsty as many of the Levellers were , we do not think that Jacob Armitage had grounds for the fears which he expressed and felt that is to say , we believe that he might have made known the existence of the children to the Villiers family , and that they would never have been harmed by anybody .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 124]: That by the burning of the mansion they might have perished in the flames , had they been in bed , as they would have been at that hour , had he not obtained intelligence of what was about to be done , is true ; but that there was any danger to them on account of their father having been such a staunch supporter of the king 's cause , is very unlikely , and not borne out by the history of the times ; but the old forester thought otherwise ; he had a hatred of the Puritans , and their deeds had been so exaggerated by rumour that he fully believed that the lives of the children were not safe .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 39]: Under this conviction , and feeling himself bound by his promise to Colonel Beverley to protect them , Jacob resolved that they should live with him in the forest , and be brought up as his own grandchildren .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 59]: He knew that there could be no better place for concealment ; for , except the keepers , few people knew where his cottage was ; and it was so out of the usual paths , and so embosomed in lofty trees , that there was little chance of its being seen , or being known to exist .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 35]: He resolved , therefore , that they should remain with him till better times ; and then he would make known their existence to the other branches of the family , but not before .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 46]: `` I can hunt for them , and provide for them , '' thought he , `` and I have a little money , when it is required ; and I will teach them to be useful ; they must learn to provide for themselves .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 25]: There 's the garden , and the patch of land : in two or three years the boys will be able to do something .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 16]: I ca n't teach them much ; but I can teach them to fear God .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 23]: We must get on how we can , and put our trust in Him who is a Father to the fatherless . ''
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 26]: With such thoughts running in his head , Jacob arrived at the cottage , and found the children outside the door , watching for him .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 18]: They all hastened to him , and the dog rushed before them , to welcome his master .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 8]: `` Down , Smoker , good dog .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 14]: Well , Mr Edward , I have been as quick as I can .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 9]: How have Mr Humphrey and your sisters behaved ?
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 21]: But we must not remain outside to-day , for the troopers are scouring the forest , and may see you .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 18]: Let us come in directly ; for it would not do that they should come here . ''
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 9]: `` Will they burn the cottage down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 10]: inquired Alice , as she took Jacob 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 33]: `` Yes , my dear , I think they would , if they found that you and your brothers were in it : but we must not let them see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 22]: They all entered the cottage , which consisted of one large room in front , and two back rooms for bedrooms .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 23]: There was also a third bedroom , which was behind the other two , but which had not any furniture in it .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 33]: `` Now let 's see what we can have for dinner -- there 's venison left , I know , '' said Jacob : `` come , we must all be useful .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 6]: Who will be cook ? ''
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 19]: `` I will be cook , '' said Alice , `` if you will show me how . ''
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 20]: `` So you shall , my dear , '' said Jacob , `` and I will show you how .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 31]: There 's some potatoes in the basket in the corner -- and some onions hanging on the string -- we must have some water -- who will fetch it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 20]: `` I will , '' said Edward ; who took up a pail and went out to the spring .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 44]: The potatoes were peeled and washed by the children -- Jacob and Edward cut the venison into pieces -- the iron pot was cleaned -- and then the meat and potatoes put with water into the pot , and placed on the fire .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 19]: `` Now I 'll cut , up the onions , for they will make your eyes water . ''
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 22]: `` I do n't care , '' said Humphrey ; `` I 'll cut and cry at the same time . ''
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 27]: And Humphrey took up a knife , and cut away most manfully , although he was obliged to wipe his eyes with his sleeve very often .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 13]: `` You are a fine fellow , Humphrey , '' said Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 17]: `` Now we 'll put the onions in , and let it all boil up together .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 17]: Now , you see you have cooked your own dinner ; ai n't that pleasant ? ''
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 24]: `` Yes , '' cried they all ; `` and we will eat our own dinners as soon as it is ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 31]: `` Then , Humphrey , you must get some of the platters down which are on the dresser ; and Alice , you will find some knives in the drawer .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 11]: And let me see , what can little Edith do ?
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 13]: Oh , she can go to the cupboard and find the salt-cellar .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 18]: Edward , just look-out , and if you see anybody coming or passing , let me know .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 14]: We must put you on guard till the troopers leave the forest . ''
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 26]: The children set about their tasks , and Humphrey cried out , as he very often did , `` Now , this is jolly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 30]: While the dinner was cooking Jacob amused the children by showing them how to put things in order ; the floor was swept , the hearth was made tidy .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 18]: He showed Alice how to wash out a cloth , and Humphrey how to dust the chairs .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 14]: They all worked merrily , while little Edith stood and clapped her hands .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 22]: But just before dinner was ready Edward came in and said , `` Here are troopers galloping in the forest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 21]: Jacob went out , and observed that they were coming in a direction that would lead near to the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 44]: He walked in , and after a moment 's thought , he said , `` My dear children , those men may come and search the cottage ; you must do as I tell you , and mind that you are very quiet .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 18]: Humphrey , you and your sisters must go to bed , and pretend to be very ill .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 15]: Edward , take off your coat and put on this old hunting-frock of mine .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 13]: You must be in the bedroom attending your sick brother and sisters .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 20]: Come , Edith dear , you must play at going to bed , and have your dinner afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 75]: Jacob took the children into the bedroom , and removing the upper dress , which would have betrayed that they were not the children of poor people , put them in bed , and covered them up to the chins with the clothes Edward had put on the old hunting-shirt , which came below his knees , and stood with a mug of water in his hand by the bedside of the two girls .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 41]: Jacob went to the outer room , to remove the platters laid out for dinner ; and he had hardly done so , when he heard the noise of the troopers , and soon afterwards a knock at the cottage-door .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 8]: `` Come in , '' said Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 9]: `` Who are you , my friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 11]: said the leader of the troop , entering the door .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 17]: `` A poor forester , sir , '' replied Jacob , `` under great trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 8]: `` What trouble , my man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 13]: `` I have the children all in bed with the smallpox . ''
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 10]: `` Nevertheless , we must search your cottage . ''
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 23]: `` You are welcome , '' replied Jacob ; `` only do n't frighten the children if you can help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 14]: The man , who was now joined by others , commenced his search .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 14]: Jacob opened all the doors of the rooms , and they passed through .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 21]: Little Edith shrieked when she saw them ; but Edward patted her , and told her not to be frightened .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 25]: The troopers , however , took no notice of the children ; they searched thoroughly , and then came back to the front room .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 15]: `` It 's no use remaining here , '' said one of the troopers .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 6]: `` Shall we be off ?
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 10]: I 'm tired and hungry with the ride . ''
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 17]: `` So am I ; and there 's something that smells well , '' said another .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 21]: `` What 's this , my good man , '' continued he , taking off the lid of the pot .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 11]: `` My dinner for a week , '' replied Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 21]: `` I have no one to cook for me now , and ca n't light a fire every day . ''
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 23]: `` Well , you appear to live well , if you have such a mess as that every day in the week .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 11]: I should like to try a spoonful or two . ''
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 20]: `` And welcome , sir , '' replied Jacob ; `` I will cook some more for myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 27]: The troopers took him at his word ; they sat down to the table , and very soon the whole contents of the kettle had disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 37]: Having satisfied themselves , they got up , told him that his rations were so good that they hoped to call again ; and , laughing heartily , they mounted their horses , and rode away .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 26]: `` Well , '' said Jacob , `` they are very welcome to the dinner ; I little thought to get off so cheap . ''
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 25]: As soon as they were out of sight Jacob called to Edward and the children to get up again , which they soon did .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 20]: Alice put on Edith 's frock , Humphrey put on his jacket , and Edward pulled off the hunting-shirt .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 16]: `` They 're gone now , '' said Jacob , coming in from the door .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 20]: `` And our dinners are gone , '' said Humphrey , looking at the empty pot and dirty platters .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 23]: `` Yes ; but we can cook another : and that will be more play , you know , '' said Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 35]: `` Edward , go for the water ; Humphrey , cut the onions ; Alice , wash the potatoes ; and Edith , help everybody , while I cut up some more meat . ''
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 22]: `` I hope it will be as good , '' observed Humphrey ; `` that other did smell so nice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 32]: `` Quite as good , if not better ; for we shall improve by practice , and we shall have a better appetite to eat it with , '' said Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 11]: `` Nasty men eat our dinner , '' said Edith .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 7]: `` Sha n't have any more .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 5]: Eat this ourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 21]: And so they did as soon as it was cooked ; but they were very hungry before they sat down .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 6]: `` This is jolly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 8]: said Humphrey , with his mouth full .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 6]: `` Yes , Master Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 13]: I doubt if King Charles gets so good a dinner this day .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 11]: Mr Edward , you are very grave and silent . ''
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 8]: `` Yes , I am , Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 5]: Have I not cause ?
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 10]: If I could but have mauled those troopers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 15]: `` But you could not ; so you must make the best of it .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 23]: They say that every dog has his day , and who knows but King Charles may be on the throne again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 21]: There were no more visits to the cottage that day , and they all went to bed and slept soundly .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 38]: The next morning Jacob , who was most anxious to learn the news , saddled the pony , having first given his injunctions to Edward how to behave in case any troopers should come to the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 23]: He told him to pretend that the children were in bed with the smallpox , as they had done the day before .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 44]: Jacob then travelled to Gossip Allwood 's , and he there learnt that King Charles had been taken prisoner , and was at the Isle of Wight , and that the troopers were all going back to London as fast as they came .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 25]: Feeling that there was now no more danger to be apprehended from them , Jacob set off as fast as he could for Lymington .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 31]: He went to one shop and purchased two peasant dresses which he thought would fit the two boys , and at another he bought similar apparel for the two girls .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 66]: Then with several other ready-made articles , and some other things which were required for the household , he made a large package , which he put upon the pony , and taking the bridle , set off home , and arrived in time to superintend the cooking of the dinner , which was this day venison-steaks fried in a pan , and boiled potatoes .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 56]: When dinner was over he opened his bundle , and told the little ones that now they were to live in a cottage they ought to wear cottage clothes , and that he had brought them some to put on , which they might rove about the woods in , and not mind tearing them .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 26]: Alice and Edith went into the bedroom , and Alice dressed Edith and herself , and came out quite pleased with their change of dress .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 26]: Humphrey and Edward put theirs on in the sitting-room , and they all fitted pretty well , and certainly were very becoming to the children .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 35]: `` Now , recollect , you are all my grandchildren , '' said Jacob ; `` for I shall no longer call you Miss and Master -- that we never do in a cottage .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 10]: You understand me , Edward , of course ? ''
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 3]: added Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 36]: Edward nodded his head , and Jacob telling the children that they might now go out of the cottage and play , they all set off quite delighted with clothes which procured them their liberty .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 20]: We must now describe the cottage of Jacob Armitage , in which the children have in future to dwell .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 74]: As we said before , it contained a large sitting-room , or kitchen , in which were a spacious hearth and chimney , table , stools , cupboards , and dressers ; the two bedrooms which adjoined it were now appropriated , one for Jacob and the other for the two boys ; the third , or inner bedroom , was arranged for the two girls , as being more retired and secure .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 97]: But there were outhouses belonging to it : a stall , in which White Billy , the pony , lived during the winter ; a shed and pigsty rudely constructed , with an enclosed yard attached to them ; and it had , moreover , a piece of ground of more than an acre , well fenced in to keep out the deer and game , the largest portion of which was cultivated as a garden and potato-ground , and the other , which remained in grass , contained some fine old apple and pear trees .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 31]: Such was the domicile ; the pony , a few fowls , a sow and two young pigs , and the dog Smoker , were the animals on the establishment .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 27]: Here Jacob Armitage had been born -- for the cottage had been built by his grandfather -- but he had not always remained at the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 24]: When young , he felt an inclination to see more of the world , and had for several years served in the army .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 21]: His father and brother had lived in the establishment at Arnwood , and he was constantly there as a boy .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 23]: The chaplain of Arnwood had taken a fancy to him , and taught him to read -- writing he had not acquired .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 61]: As soon as he grew up he served , as we have said , in the troop commanded by Colonel Beverley 's father ; and after his death , Colonel Beverley had procured him the situation of forest ranger , which had been held by his father , who was then alive , but too aged to do the duty .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 52]: Jacob Armitage married a good and devout young woman , with whom he lived several years , when she died , without bringing him any family ; after which , his father being also dead , Jacob Armitage had lived alone until the period at which we have commenced this history .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 48]: The old forester lay awake the whole of this night , reflecting how he should act relative to the children ; he felt the great responsibility that he had incurred , and was alarmed when he considered what might be the consequences if his days were shortened .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 34]: What would become of them -- living in so sequestered a spot that few knew even of its existence -- totally shut out from the world , and left to their own resources ?
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 40]: He had no fear , if his life was spared , that they would do well ; but if he should be called away before they had grown up and were able to help themselves , they might perish .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 40]: Edward was not fourteen years old ; it was true that he was an active , brave boy , and thoughtful for his years ; but he had not yet strength or skill sufficient for what would be required .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 16]: Humphrey , the second , also promised well ; but still they were all children .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 67]: `` I must bring them up to be useful -- to depend upon themselves ; there is not a moment to be lost , and not a moment shall be lost ; I will do my best , and trust to God ; I ask but two or three years , and by that time I trust that they will be able to do without me .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 12]: They must commence to-morrow the life of foresters ' children . ''
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 82]: Acting upon this resolution , Jacob , as soon as the children were dressed and in the sitting-room , opened his Bible , which he had put on the table , and said : `` My dear children , you know that you must remain in this cottage , that the wicked troopers may not find you out ; they killed your father , and if I had not taken you away , they would have burnt you in your beds .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 73]: You must therefore live here as my children , and you must call yourselves by the name of Armitage , and not that of Beverley ; and you must dress like children of the forest , as you do now , and you must do as children of the forest do ; that is , you must do everything for yourselves , for you can have no servants to wait upon you .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 27]: We must all work ; but you will like to work if you all work together , for then the work will be nothing but play .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 51]: Now , Edward is the oldest , and he must go out with me in the forest , and I must teach him to kill deer and other game for our support ; and when he knows how , then Humphrey shall come out and learn how to shoot . ''
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 14]: `` Yes , '' said Humphrey , `` I 'll soon learn . ''
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 72]: `` But not yet , Humphrey , for you must do some work in the meantime ; you must look after the pony and the pigs , and you must learn to dig in the garden with Edward and me when we do not go out to hunt ; and sometimes I shall go by myself , and leave Edward to work with you when there is work to be done .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 21]: Alice , dear , you must , with Humphrey , light the fire and clean the house in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 55]: Humphrey will go to the spring for water , and do all the hard work ; and you must learn to wash , my dear Alice -- I will show you how ; and you must learn to get dinner ready with Humphrey , who will assist you ; and to make the beds .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 28]: And little Edith shall take care of the fowls , and feed them every morning , and look for the eggs -- will you , Edith ? ''
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 26]: `` Yes , '' replied Edith , `` and feed all the little chickens when they are hatched , as I did at Arnwood . ''
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 12]: `` Yes , dear , and you 'll be very useful .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 13]: Now you know that you can not do all this at once .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 23]: You will have to try and try again ; but very soon you will , and then it will be all play .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 23]: I must teach you all , and every day you will do it better , till you want no teaching at all .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 22]: And now , my dear children , as there is no chaplain here , we must read the Bible every morning .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 13]: Edward can read , I know ; can you , Humphrey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 10]: `` Yes , all except the big words . ''
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 11]: `` Well , you will learn them by and by .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 22]: And Edward and I will teach Alice and Edith to read in the evenings , when we have nothing to do .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 6]: It will be an amusement .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 15]: Now tell me , do you all like what I have told you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 32]: `` Yes , '' they all replied ; and then Jacob Armitage read a chapter in the Bible , after which they all knelt down and said the Lord 's Prayer .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 17]: As this was done every morning and every evening , I need not repeat it again .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 80]: Jacob then showed them again how to clean the house , and Humphrey and Alice soon finished their work under his directions ; and then they all sat down to breakfast , which was a very plain one , being generally cold meat , and cakes baked on the embers , at which Alice was soon very expert ; and little Edith was very useful in watching them for her , while she busied herself about her other work .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 26]: But the venison was nearly all gone ; and after breakfast Jacob and Edward , with the dog Smoker , went out into the woods .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 42]: Edward had no gun , as he only went out to be taught how to approach the game , which required great caution ; indeed Jacob had no second gun to give him , if he had wished so to do .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 35]: `` Now , Edward , we are going after a fine stag , if we can find him -- which I doubt not -- but the difficulty is to get within shot of him .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 42]: Recollect that you must always be hid , for his sight is very quick ; never be heard , for his ear is sharp ; and never come down to him with the wind , for his scent is very fine .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 12]: Then you must hunt according to the hour of the day .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 20]: At this time he is feeding ; two hours hence he will be lying down in the high fern .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 20]: The dog is of no use unless the stag is badly wounded , when the dog will take him .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 16]: Smoker knows his duty well , and will hide himself as close as we do .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 55]: We are now going into the thick wood ahead of us , as there are many little spots of cleared ground in it where we may find the deer ; but we must keep more to the left , for the wind is to the eastward , and we must walk up against it .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 32]: And now that we are coming into the wood , recollect , not a word must be said , and you must walk as quietly as possible , keeping behind me .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 6]: Smoker , to heel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 47]: They proceeded through the wood for more than a mile , when Jacob made a sign to Edward , and dropped down into the fern , crawling along to an open spot , where , at some distance , were a stag and three deer grazing .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 34]: The deer grazed quietly , but the stag was ever and anon raising up his head and snuffing the air as he looked round , evidently acting as a sentinel for the females .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 20]: The stag was perhaps a long quarter of a mile from where they had crouched down in the fern .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 36]: Jacob remained immovable till the animal began to feed again , and then he advanced crawling through the fern , followed by Edward and the dog , who dragged himself on his stomach after Edward .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 34]: This tedious approach was continued for some time , and they had neared the stag to within half the original distance , when the animal again lifted up his head and appeared uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 7]: Jacob stopped and remained without motion .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 45]: After a time the stag walked away , followed by the does , to the opposite side of the clear spot on which they had been feeding , and , to Edward 's annoyance , the animal was now half a mile from them .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 40]: Jacob turned round and crawled into the wood , and when he knew that they were concealed he rose on his feet and said : `` You see , Edward , that it requires patience to stalk a deer .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 5]: What a princely fellow !
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 14]: But he has probably been alarmed this morning , and is very uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 23]: Now we must go through the woods till we come to the lee of him on the other side of the dell .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 33]: You see he has led the does close to the thicket , and we shall have a better chance when we get there , if we are only quiet and cautious . ''
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 10]: `` What startled him , do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 3]: said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 31]: `` I think , when you were crawling through the fern after me , you broke a piece of rotten stick that was under you , did you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 11]: `` Yes , but that made but little noise . ''
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 24]: `` Quite enough to startle a red deer , Edward , as you will find out before you have been long a forester .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 26]: These checks will happen , and have happened to me a hundred times , and then all the work is to be done over again .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 15]: Now then to make the circuit -- we had better not say a word .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 16]: If we get safe now to the other side we are sure of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 25]: They proceeded at a quick walk through the forest , and in half an hour had gained the side where the deer were feeding .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 72]: When about three hundred yards from the game , Jacob again sank down on his hands and knees , crawling from bush to bush , stopping whenever the stag raised his head , and advancing again when it resumed feeding ; at last they came to the fern at the side of the wood , and crawled through it as before , but still more cautiously as they approached the stag .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 41]: In this manner they arrived at last to within eighty yards of the animal , and then Jacob advanced his gun ready to put it to his shoulder , and as he cocked the lock , raised himself to fire .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 78]: The click occasioned by the cocking of the lock roused up the stag instantly , and he turned his head in the direction from whence the noise proceeded ; as he did so Jacob fired , aiming behind the animal 's shoulder : the stag made a bound , came down again , dropped on his knees , attempted to run , and fell dead , while the does fled away with the rapidity of the wind .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 12]: Edward started up on his legs with a shout of exultation .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 22]: Jacob commenced reloading his gun , and stopped Edward as he was about to run up to where the animal lay .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 39]: `` Edward , you must learn your craft , '' said Jacob ; `` never do that again ; never shout in that way -- on the contrary , you should have remained still in the fern . ''
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 4]: `` Why so ?
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 6]: The stag is dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 47]: `` Yes , my dear boy , that stag is dead ; but how do you know but what there may be another lying down in the fern close to us , or at some distance from us , which you have alarmed by your shout ?
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 65]: Suppose that we both had had guns , and that the report of mine had started another stag lying in the fern within shot , you would have been able to shoot it ; or if a stag was lying at a distance , the report of the gun might have startled him so as to induce him to move his head without rising .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 27]: I should have seen his antlers move and have marked his lair , and we should then have gone after him and stalked him too . ''
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 22]: `` I see , '' replied Edward , `` I was wrong ; but I shall know better another time . ''
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 24]: `` That 's why I tell you , my boy , '' replied Jacob ; `` now let us go to our quarry .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 10]: Ay , Edward , this is a noble beast .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 15]: I thought that he was a hart royal , and so he is . ''
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 10]: `` What is a hart royal , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 42]: `` Why , a stag is called a brocket until he is three years old ; at four years he is a staggart ; at five years a warrantable stag ; and after five years he becomes a hart royal . ''
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 10]: `` And how do you know his age ? ''
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 52]: `` By his antlers : you see that this stag has nine antlers ; now , a brocket has but two antlers , a staggart three , and a warrantable stag but four ; at six years old , the antlers increase in number until they sometimes have twenty or thirty .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 15]: This is a fine beast , and the venison is now getting very good .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 13]: Now you must see me do the work of my craft . ''
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 22]: Jacob then cut the throat of the animal , and afterwards cut off its head , and took out its bowels .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 8]: `` Are you tired , Edward ? ''
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 15]: said Jacob , as he wiped his hunting-knife on the coat of the stag .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 8]: `` No , not the least . ''
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 22]: `` Well , then , we are now , I should think , about four or five miles from the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 7]: Could you find your way home ?
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 17]: But that is of no consequence , Smoker will lead you home by the shortest path .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 25]: I will stay here , and you can saddle White Billy and come back with him , for he must carry the venison back .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 23]: It 's more than we can manage -- indeed , as much as we can manage with White Billy to help us .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 17]: There 's more than twenty stone of venison lying there , I can tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 26]: Edward immediately assented , and Jacob desiring Smoker to go home , set about flaying and cutting up the animal for its more convenient transportation .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 29]: In an hour and a half Edward , attended by Smoker , returned with the pony , on whose back the chief portion of the venison was packed .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 35]: Jacob took a large piece on his own shoulders , and Edward carried another , and Smoker , after regaling himself with a portion of the inside of the animal , came after them .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 29]: During the walk home Jacob initiated Edward into the terms of venery and many other points connected with deer-stalking , with which we shall not trouble our readers .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 39]: As soon as they arrived at the cottage the venison was hung up , the pony put in the stable , and then they sat down to dinner with an excellent appetite after their long morning 's walk .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 36]: Alice and Humphrey had cooked the dinner themselves , and it was in the pot , smoking hot , when they returned ; and Jacob declared he never ate a better mess in his life .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 22]: Alice was not a little proud of this , and of the praises she received from Edward and the old forester .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 32]: The next day Jacob stated his intention of going to Lymington to dispose of a large portion of the venison , and bring back a sack of oatmeal for their cakes .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 40]: Edward asked to accompany him , but Jacob replied : `` Edward , you must not think of showing yourself at Lymington , or anywhere else , for a long while , until you are grown out of memory .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 25]: It would be folly , and you would risk your sisters ' and brother 's lives , perhaps , as well as your own .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 26]: Never mention it again : the time will come when it will be necessary , perhaps ; if so , it can not be helped .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 8]: At present you would be known immediately .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 65]: No , Edward , I tell you what I do mean to do : I have a little money left , and I intend to buy you a gun , that you may learn to stalk deer yourself without me : for recollect , if any accident should happen to me , who is there but you to provide for your brother and sisters ?
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 51]: At Lymington I am known to many ; but out of all who know me , there is not one who knows where my cottage is ; they know that I live in the New Forest , and that I supply them venison , and purchase other articles in return .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 15]: That is all that they know ; and I may therefore go without fear .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 54]: I shall sell the venison to-morrow , and bring you back a good gun ; and Humphrey shall have the carpenters ' tools which he wishes for -- for I think , by what he does with his knife , that he has a turn that way , and it may be useful .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 47]: I must also get some other tools for Humphrey and you , as we shall then be able to work all together ; and some threads and needles for Alice , for she can sew a little , and practice will make her more perfect . ''
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 69]: Jacob went off to Lymington as he had proposed , and returned late at night with White Billy well loaded ; he had a sack of oatmeal , some spades and hoes , a saw and chisels , and other tools ; two scythes and two three-pronged forks ; and when Edward came to meet him he put into his hand a gun with a very long barrel .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 23]: `` I believe , Edward , that you will find that a good one , for I know where it came from .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 18]: It belonged to one of the rangers , who was reckoned the best shot in the forest .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 28]: I know the gun , for I have seen it on his arm , and have taken it in my hand to examine it more than once .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 13]: He was killed at Naseby , with your father , poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 12]: And his widow sold the gun to meet her wants . ''
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 38]: replied Edward , `` I thank you much , Jacob , and I will try if I can not kill as much venison as will pay back the purchase-money -- I will , I assure you . ''
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 40]: `` I shall be glad if you do , Edward ; not because I want the money back , but because then I shall be more easy in my mind about you all , if anything happens to me .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 29]: As soon as you are perfect in your woodcraft , I shall take Humphrey in hand , for there is nothing like having two strings to your bow .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 30]: To-morrow we will not go out : we have meat enough for three weeks or more ; and now the frost has set in , it will keep well .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 32]: You shall practise at a mark with your gun , that you may be accustomed to it : for all guns , even the best , require a little humouring . ''
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 42]: Edward , who had often fired a gun before , proved the next morning that he had a very good eye ; and after two or three hours ' practice , hit the mark at a hundred yards almost every time .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 21]: `` I wish you would let me go out by myself , '' said Edward , overjoyed at his success .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 13]: `` You would bring home nothing , boy , '' replied Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 43]: `` No , no , you have a great deal to learn yet ; but I tell you what you shall do : any time that we are not in great want of venison , you shall have the first fire . ''
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 11]: `` Well , that will do , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 17]: The winter now set in with great severity , and they remained almost altogether within doors .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 18]: Jacob and the boys went out to get firewood , and dragged it home through the snow .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 52]: `` I wish , Jacob , '' said Humphrey , `` that I was able to build a cart , for it would be very useful , and White Bill would then have something to do ; but I ca n't make the wheels , and there is no harness . ''
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 23]: `` That 's not a bad idea of yours , Humphrey , '' replied Jacob ; `` we will think about it .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 14]: If you ca n't build a cart , perhaps I can buy one .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 37]: It would be useful if it were only to take the dung out of the yard on the potato-ground ; for I have hitherto carried it out in baskets , and it 's hard work . ''
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 41]: `` Yes , and we might saw the wood into billets , and carry it home in the cart instead of dragging it this way : my shoulder is quite sore with the rope , it cuts me so . ''
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 54]: `` Well , when the weather breaks up , I will see what I can do , Humphrey ; but just now the roads are so blocked up , that I do not think we could get a cart from Lymington to the cottage , although we can a horse , perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 15]: But if they remained indoors during the inclement weather , they were not idle .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 11]: Jacob took this opportunity to instruct the children in everything .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 10]: Alice learnt how to wash and how to cook .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 53]: It is true that sometimes she scalded herself a little , sometimes burnt her fingers ; and other accidents did occur , from the articles employed being too heavy for them to lift by themselves ; but practice and dexterity compensated for want of strength , and fewer accidents happened every day .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 41]: Humphrey had his carpenters ' tools ; and although at first he had many failures , and wasted nails and wood , by degrees he learnt to use his tools with more dexterity , and made several little useful articles .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 31]: Little Edith could now do something , for she made and baked all the oatmeal cakes , which saved Alice a good deal of time and trouble in watching them .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 30]: It was astonishing how much the children could do , now that there was no one to do it for them ; and they had daily instruction from Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 31]: In the evening Alice sat down with her needle and thread to mend the clothes ; at first they were not very well done ; but she improved every day .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 49]: Edith and Humphrey learnt to read while Alice worked , and then Alice learnt ; and thus passed the winter away so rapidly , that although they had been five months at the cottage , it did not appear as if they had been there as many weeks .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 43]: All were happy and contented , with the exception , perhaps , of Edward , who had fits of gloominess , and occasionally showed signs of impatience as to what was passing in the world , of which he remained in ignorance .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 13]: That Edward Beverley had fits of gloominess and impatience is not surprising .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 34]: Edward had been brought up as the heir of Arnwood ; and a boy at a very early age imbibes notions of his position , if it promises to be a high one .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 15]: He was not two miles from that property which by right was his own .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 26]: His own mansion had been reduced to ashes -- he himself was hidden in the forest , and he could not but feel his position .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 32]: He sighed for the time when the king 's cause should be again triumphant , and his arrival at that age when he could in person support and uphold the cause .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 39]: He longed to be in command as his father had been -- to lead his men on to victory -- to recover his property , and to revenge himself on those who had acted so cruelly towards him .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 75]: This was human nature ; and much as Jacob Armitage would expostulate with him , and try to divert his feelings into other channels ; long as he would preach to him about forgiveness of injuries , and patience until better times should come , Edward could not help brooding over these thoughts , and if ever there was a breast animated with intense hatred against the Puritans it was that of Edward Beverley .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 19]: Although this was to be lamented , it could not create surprise or wonder in the old forester .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 42]: All he could do was , as much as possible to reason with him , to soothe his irritated feelings , and by constant employment try to make him forget for a time the feelings of ill-will which he had conceived .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 94]: One thing was , however , sufficiently plain to Edward , which was , that whatever might be his wrongs , he had not the power at present to redress them ; and this feeling , perhaps , more than any other , held him in some sort of check ; and as the time when he might have an opportunity appeared far distant , even to his own sanguine imagination , so by degrees did he contrive to dismiss from his thoughts what it was no use to think about at present .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 34]: As we have before said , time passed rapidly ; with the exception of one or two excursions after venison , they remained in the cottage , and Jacob never went to Lymington .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 19]: The frost had broken up , the snow had long disappeared , and the trees began to bud .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 19]: The sun became powerful , and in the month of May the forest began again to look green .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 52]: `` And now , Edward , '' said Jacob Armitage , one day at breakfast , `` we will try for venison again to sell at Lymington , for I must purchase Humphrey 's cart and harness ; so let us get our guns , and go out this fine morning .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 19]: The stags are mostly by themselves at this season , for the does are with their young calves .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 42]: We must find the slot of a deer , and track him to his lair , and you shall have the first shot if you like ; but that , however , depends more upon the deer than upon me . ''
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 43]: They had walked four or five miles when they came upon the slot or track of a deer , but Jacob 's practised eye pointed out to Edward that it was the slot of a young one , and not worth following .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 54]: He explained to Edward the difference in the hoof-marks and other signs by which this knowledge was gained , and they proceeded onwards until they found another slot , which Jacob declared to be that of a warrantable stag -- that is , one old enough to kill and to be good venison .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 13]: `` We must now track him to his lair , Edward . ''
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 23]: This took them about a mile farther , when they arrived at a small thicket of thorns about an acre in extent .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 20]: `` Here he is , you see , Edward ; let me now see if he is harboured . ''
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 35]: They walked round the thicket , and could not find any slot or track by which the stag had left the covert , and Jacob pronounced that the animal must be hid in it .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 49]: `` Now , Edward , do you stay here while I go back to the lee side of the covert : I will enter it with Smoker , and the stag will , in all probability , when he is roused , come out to breast the wind .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 82]: You will then have a good shot at him ; recollect to fire so as to hit him behind the shoulder : if he is moving quick , fire a little before the shoulders ; if slow , take aim accurately ; but recollect , if I come upon him in the covert , I shall kill him if I can , for we want the venison , and then we will go after another to give you a chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 23]: Jacob then left Edward , and went down to the lee side of the covert , where he entered it with Smoker .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 27]: Edward was stationed behind a thorn-bush , which grew a few yards clear of the covert , and he soon heard the creaking of the branches .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 35]: A short time elapsed , and a fine stag came out at a trot ; he turned his head , and was just bounding away , when Edward fired , and the animal fell .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 29]: Remembering the advice of Jacob , Edward remained where he was , in silence reloading his piece , and was soon afterwards joined by Jacob and the dog .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 7]: `` Well done , Edward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 39]: said the forester in a low voice , and covering his forehead to keep off the glare of the sun , he looked earnestly at a high brake between some thorn-trees , about half a mile to windward .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 19]: `` I think I see something there -- look , Edward , your eyes are younger than mine .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 17]: Is that the branch of a tree in the fern , or is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 11]: `` I see what you mean , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 9]: `` It is not , it moves . ''
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 17]: `` I thought so , but my eyes are not so good as they once were .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 16]: It 's another stag , depend upon it ; but how to get near him ?
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 15]: We never can get across this patch of clear grass without being seen . ''
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 72]: `` No , we can not get at him from this spot , '' replied Edward ; `` but if we were to fall back to leeward , and gain the forest again , I think that there are thorns sufficient from the forest to where he lies , to creep from behind one to the other , so as to get a shot at him ; do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 19]: `` It will require care and patience to manage that ; but I think it might be done .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 13]: I will try ; it is my turn now , you know .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 20]: You had better stay here with the dog , for only one can hide from thorn to thorn . ''
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 11]: Jacob , ordering Smoker to remain , then set off .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 48]: He had to make a circuit of three miles to get to the spot where the thorns extended from the forest , and Edward saw no more of him , although he strained his eyes , until the stag sprung out , and the gun was discharged .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 23]: Edward perceived that the stag was not killed , but severely wounded , running towards the covert near which he was hid .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 15]: `` Down , Smoker , '' said he , as he cocked his gun .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 18]: The stag came within shot , and was coming nearer when , seeing Edward , it turned .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 25]: Edward fired , and then cheered on the dog , who sprang after the wounded animal , giving tongue , as he followed him .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 12]: Edward , perceiving Jacob hastening towards him , waited for him .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 30]: `` He 's hard hit , Edward , '' cried Jacob , `` and Smoker will have him ; but we must follow as fast as we can . ''
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 29]: They both caught up their guns and ran as fast as they could , when , as they entered the wood , they heard the dog at bay .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 24]: `` We sha n't have far to go , Edward ; the animal is done up , Smoker has him at bay . ''
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 31]: They hastened on another quarter of a mile , when they found that the stag had fallen on his knees , and had been seized by the throat by Smoker .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 28]: `` Mind , Edward , now , how I go up to him , for the wound from the horn of the deer is very dangerous . ''
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 15]: Jacob advanced from behind the stag , and cut his throat with his hunting-knife .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 29]: `` He is a fine beast , and we have done well to-day ; but we shall have two journeys to make to get all this venison home .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 23]: I could not get a fair shot at him -- and see , I have hit him here in the flank . ''
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 14]: `` And here is my ball in his throat , '' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 5]: `` So it is .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 22]: Then it was a good shot that you made , and you are master of the hunt this day , Edward .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 21]: Now , I 'll remain , and you go home for White Billy ; Humphrey is right about the cart .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 33]: If we had one , we could have carried all home at once ; but I must go now and cut the throat of the other stag which you killed so cleverly .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 13]: You will be a good hunter one of these days , Edward .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 30]: A little more knowledge , and a little more practice , and I will leave it all to you , and hang my gun up over the chimney . ''
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 32]: It was late in the evening before they had made their two trips and taken all the venison home , and very tired were they before it was all safely housed .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 16]: Edward was delighted with his success , but not more so than was old Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 40]: The next morning Jacob set off for Lymington , with the pony loaded with venison , which he sold , as well as two more loads which he promised to bring the next day , and the day after .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 41]: He then looked out for a cart , and was fortunate in finding a small one just fitted to the size of the pony , who was not tall , but very strong , as all New Forest ponies are .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 84]: He also procured harness , and then put Billy in the cart to draw him home ; but Billy did not admire being put in a cart , and for some time was very restive , and backed and reared , and went every way but the right ; but by dint of coaxing and leading , he at last submitted , and went straight on : but then the noise of the cart behind him frightened him , and he ran away .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 41]: At last , having tired himself out , he thought that he might as well go quietly in harness , as he could not get out of it ; and he did so , and arrived safe at the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 20]: Humphrey was delighted at the sight of the cart , and said that now they should get on well .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 52]: The next day Jacob contrived to put all the remainder of the venison in the cart , and White Billy made no more difficulty ; he dragged it all to Lymington , and returned with the cart as quietly and cleverly as if he had been in harness all his life .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 39]: `` Well , Edward , the venison paid for the cart , at all events , '' said Jacob , `` and now , I will tell you all the news I collected while I was at Lymington .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 28]: Captain Burly , who attempted to incite the people to rescue the king , has been hung , drawn , and quartered , as a traitor . ''
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 14]: `` They are traitors who condemned him , '' replied Edward in wrath .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 27]: `` Yes , so they are ; but there is better news , which is , that the Duke of York has escaped to Holland . ''
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 13]: `` Yes , that is good news ; and the king ? ''
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 10]: `` He is still a prisoner in Carisbrook Castle .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 40]: There are many rumours and talks , but no one knows what is true and what is false ; but depend upon it , this can not last long , and the king will have his rights yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 8]: Edward remained very grave for some time .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 21]: `` I trust in heaven we all shall have our rights yet , Jacob , '' said he at last .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 9]: `` I wish I was a man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 11]: Here the conversation ended , and they went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 10]: This was now a busy time at the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 38]: The manure had to be got out of the stable and pigsties , and carried out to the potato-ground and garden ; the crops had to be put in ; and the cart was now found valuable .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 28]: After the manure had been carried out and spread , Edward and Humphrey helped Jacob to dig the ground , and then to put in the seed .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 17]: The cabbage-plants of last year were then put out , and the turnips and carrots sown .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 24]: Before the month was over the garden and potato-field were cropped , and Humphrey took upon himself to weed and keep it clean .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 48]: Little Edith had also employment now ; for the hens began to lay eggs , and as soon as she heard them cackling , she ran for the eggs and brought them in ; and before the month was over Jacob had set four hens upon eggs .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 25]: Billy , the pony , was now turned out to graze in the forest ; he came home every night of his own accord .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 29]: `` I 'll tell you what we want , '' said Humphrey , who took the command altogether over the farm ; `` we want a cow . ''
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 22]: `` Oh yes , a cow , '' cried Alice ; `` I have plenty of time to milk her . ''
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 14]: `` Whose cows are those which I see in the forest sometimes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 5]: said Humphrey to Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 40]: `` If they belong to anybody , they belong to the king , '' replied Jacob ; `` but they are cattle which have strayed and found their way to the forest , and have remained here ever since .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 27]: They are rather wild and savage , and you must be careful how you go too near them , as the bulls will run at you .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 26]: They increase very fast : there were but six a few years ago , and now there are at least fifty in the herd . ''
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 18]: `` Well , I 'll try and get one , if I can , '' said Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 28]: `` You will be puzzled to do that , boy , '' replied Jacob , `` and as I said before , beware of the bulls . ''
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 32]: `` I do n't want a bull , '' replied Humphrey ; `` but a cow would give us milk , and then we should have more manure for the garden .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 9]: My garden will then grow more potatoes . ''
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 37]: `` Well , Humphrey , if you can catch a cow , no one will interfere ; but I think you will not find it very easy , and you may find it very dangerous . ''
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 14]: `` I 'll look-out for one , '' replied Humphrey , `` anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 16]: Alice , if we only had a cow , would n't that be jolly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 24]: The crops were now all up , and as the days began to be long , the work became comparatively light and easy .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 46]: Humphrey was busy making a little wheelbarrow for Edith , that she might barrow away the weeds as he hoed them up ; and at last this great performance was completed , much to the admiration of all , and much to his own satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 63]: Indeed , when it is recollected that Humphrey had only the hand-saw and axe , and that he had to cut down the tree , and then to saw it into plank , it must be acknowledged that it required great patience and perseverance even to make a wheelbarrow ; but Humphrey was not only persevering , but was full of invention .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 35]: He had built up a hen-house with fir poles , and made the nests for the hens to lay and hatch in , and they now had between forty and fifty chickens running about .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 33]: He had also divided the pigsty , so that the sow might be kept apart from the other pigs ; and they expected very soon to have a litter of young pigs .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 72]: He had transplanted the wild strawberries from the forest , and had by manure made them large and good ; and he had also a fine crop of onions in the garden , from seed which Jacob had bought at Lymington ; now Humphrey was very busy cutting down some poles in the forest to make a cow-house , for he declared that he would have a cow somehow or another .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 25]: June arrived , and it was time to mow down grass to make into hay for the winter , and Jacob had two scythes .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 51]: He showed the boys how to use them , and they soon became expert ; and as there was plenty of long grass at this time of the year , and they could mow when they pleased , they soon had White Billy in full employment carrying the hay home .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 16]: The little girls helped to make it , for Humphrey had made them two rakes .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 27]: Jacob thought that there was hay enough made , but Humphrey said that there was enough for the pony , but not enough for the cow .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 13]: `` But where is the cow to come from , Humphrey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 19]: `` Where the venison comes from , '' replied he , -- `` out of the forest . ''
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 18]: So Humphrey continued to mow and make hay , while Edward and Jacob went out for venison .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 40]: After all the hay was made and stacked , Humphrey found out a method of thatching with fern , which Jacob had never thought of ; and when that was done , they commenced cutting down fern for fodder .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 23]: Here again Humphrey would have twice as much as Jacob had ever cut before , because he wanted litter for the cow .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 38]: At last it became quite a joke between him and Edward , who , when he brought home more venison than would keep in the hot weather , told Humphrey that the remainder was for the cow .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 56]: Still Humphrey would not give up the point , and every morning and evening he would be certain to be absent an hour or two , and it was found out he was watching the herd of wild cattle who were feeding : sometimes they were very near , at others a long way off .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 22]: He used to get up into the trees , and examine them as they passed under him , without perceiving him .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 17]: One night Humphrey returned very late , and the next morning he was off before daylight .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 22]: Breakfast was over , and Humphrey did not make his appearance , and they could not tell what was the matter .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 30]: Jacob felt uneasy , but Edward laughed , and said : `` Oh , depend upon it , he 'll come back and bring the cow with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 14]: Hardly had Edward said these words when in came Humphrey red with perspiration .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 29]: `` Now then , Jacob and Edward , come with me ; we must put Billy in the cart , and take Smoker and a rope with us .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 11]: Take your guns too , for fear of accident . ''
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 9]: `` Why , what 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 29]: `` I 'll tell you as we go along , but I must put Billy in the cart , for there is no time to be lost . ''
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 16]: Humphrey disappeared , and Jacob said to Edward , `` What can it be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 18]: `` It can be nothing but the cow he is so mad about , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 28]: `` However , when he comes with the pony , we shall know ; let us take our guns and the dog Smoker as he wishes . ''
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 14]: Humphrey now drove up the pony and cart , and they set off .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 17]: `` Well , I suppose you 'll tell us now what we are going for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 3]: said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 6]: `` Yes , I will .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 19]: You know I 've been watching the cattle for a long while , because I wanted a cow .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 30]: I have been in a tree when they have passed under me several times , and I observed that one or two of the heifers were very near calving .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 42]: Yesterday evening I thought one could not help calving very soon indeed , and as I was watching I saw that she was uneasy , and that she at last left the herd and went into a little copse of wood .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 17]: I remained three hours to see if she came out again , and she did not .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 12]: It was dark when I came home , as you know .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 11]: This morning I went before daylight and found the herd .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 49]: She is very remarkable , being black and white spotted ; and , after close examination , I found that she was not with the herd , so I am sure that she went into the copse to calve , and that she has calved before this . ''
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 25]: `` Well , that may be , '' replied Jacob ; `` but now I do not understand what we are to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 8]: `` Nor I , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 14]: `` Well then , I 'll tell you what I hope to do .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 27]: I have got the pony and cart to take the calf home with us , if we can get it -- which I think we can .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 52]: I have got Smoker to worry the heifer and keep her employed while we put the calf in the cart ; a rope that we may tie the cow , if we can ; and you with your guns must keep off the herd , if they come to her assistance .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 8]: Now do you understand my plan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 28]: `` Yes , and I think it very likely to succeed , Humphrey , '' replied Jacob , `` and I give you credit for the scheme .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 8]: We will help you all we can .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 6]: Where is the copse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 11]: `` Not half a mile farther , '' replied Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 8]: `` We shall soon be there . ''
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 24]: On their arrival they found that the herd were feeding at a considerable distance from the copse , which was perhaps as well .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 26]: `` Now , '' said Jacob , `` I and Edward will enter into the copse with Smoker , and you follow us , Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 29]: I will make Smoker seize the heifer if necessary ; at all events , he will keep her at bay -- that is , if she is here .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 22]: First let us walk round the copse and find her _ slot _ as we call the track of a deer .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 7]: See , here is her footing .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 7]: Now let us go in . ''
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 21]: They advanced cautiously into the thicket , following the track of the heifer , and at last came upon her .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 23]: Apparently she had not calved more than an hour , and was licking the calf which was not yet on its legs .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 39]: As soon as the animal perceived Jacob and Edward , she shook her head , and was about to run at them ; but Jacob told Smoker to seize her , and the dog flew at her immediately .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 42]: The attack of the dog drove back the heifer quite into the thicket , and as the dog bounded round her , springing this way and that way to escape her horns , the heifer was soon separated from the calf .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 34]: `` Now then , Edward and Humphrey , '' said Jacob , advancing between the heifer and the calf , `` lift up the calf between you and put it in the cart .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 10]: Leave Smoker and me to manage the mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 17]: The boys put their arms under the stomach of the calf , and carried it away .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 48]: The heifer was at first too busy defending herself against the dog to perceive that the calf was gone ; when she did Jacob called Smoker to him , so as to bring him between the heifer and where the boys were going out of the thicket .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 38]: At last the heifer gave a loud bellow , and rushed out of the thicket in pursuit of her calf checked by Smoker , who held on to her ear , and sometimes stopped her from advancing .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 19]: `` Hold her , Smoker , '' said Jacob , who now went back to help the boys .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 6]: `` Hold her , boy .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 8]: Is the calf in the cart ? ''
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 21]: `` Yes , and tied fast , '' replied Edward , `` and we are in the cart too . ''
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 9]: `` That 's right , '' replied Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 14]: `` Now I 'll get in too , and let us drive off .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 9]: She 'll follow us , depend upon it .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 4]: Here , Smoker !
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 2]: Smoker !
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 5]: Let her alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 22]: Smoker , at this command , came bounding out of the copse , followed by the heifer , lowing most anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 20]: Her lowing was responded to by the calf in the cart , and she ran wildly up to it .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 37]: `` Drive off , Humphrey , '' said Jacob ; `` I think I heard the lowing of the heifer answered by some of the herd , and the sooner we are off the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 69]: Humphrey , who had the reins , drove off ; the heifer followed , at one time running at the dog , at another putting her head almost into the hind part of the cart ; but the lowing of the heifer was now answered by deeper tones , and Jacob said : `` Edward , get your gun ready , for I think the herd is following .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 11]: Do not fire , however , till I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 7]: We must be governed by circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 25]: It wo n't do to lose the pony , or to run any serious risk , for the sake of the heifer and calf .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 6]: Drive fast , Humphrey . ''
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 55]: A few minutes afterwards they perceived at about a quarter of a mile behind them , not the whole herd , but a single bull , who was coming up at a fast trot , with his tail in the air , and tossing his head , lowing deeply in answer to the heifer .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 22]: `` There 's only one , after all , '' said Jacob ; `` I suppose the heifer is his favourite .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 7]: Well , we can manage him .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 5]: Smoker , come in .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 22]: Come in , sir , directly , '' cried Jacob , perceiving that the dog was about to attack the bull .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 15]: Smoker obeyed , and the bull advanced till he was within a hundred yards .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 15]: `` Now , Edward , do you fire first -- aim for his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 6]: Humphrey , pull up . ''
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 25]: Humphrey stopped the pony , and the bull continued to advance , but seemed puzzled who to attack , unless it was the dog .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 29]: As soon as the bull was within sixty yards , Edward fired , and the animal fell down on its knees , tearing the ground with its horns .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 28]: `` That will do , '' said Jacob ; `` drive on again , Humphrey ; we will have a look at that fellow by and by .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 13]: At present we had better get home , as others may come .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 12]: He 's up again , but he is at a standstill .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 11]: I have an idea that he is hit hard . ''
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 29]: The cart drove on , followed by the heifer ; but no more of the wild herd made their appearance , and they very soon gained the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 11]: `` Now , then , what shall we do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 3]: said Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 21]: `` Come , Humphrey , you have had all the ordering of this , and have done it well . ''
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 29]: `` Well , Jacob , we must now drive the cart into the yard , and shut the gate upon the cow , till I am ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 31]: `` That 's easy done , by setting Smoker at her , '' replied Jacob ; `` but , mercy on us , there 's Alice and Edith running out !
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 7]: -- the heifer may kill them .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 20]: Go back , Alice , run quite into the cottage , and shut the door till we come . ''
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 22]: Alice and Edith hearing this , and Edward also crying out to them , made a hasty retreat to the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 32]: Humphrey then backed the cart against the paling of the yard , so as to enable Edward to get on the other side of it , ready to open the gate .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 41]: Smoker was set at the heifer , and , as before , soon engaged her attention ; so that the gate was opened and the cart drove in , and the gate closed again , before the heifer could follow .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 9]: `` Well , Humphrey , what next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 15]: `` Why , now lift the calf out and put it into the cow-house .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 50]: I will go into the cow-house with a rope and a slip-knot at the end of it , get upon the beam above , and drop it over her horns as she 's busy with the calf , which she will be as soon as you let her in .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 35]: I shall pass the end of the rope outside , for you to haul up when I am ready , and then we shall have her fast , till we can secure her properly .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 18]: When I call out ` ready , ' do you open the gate and let her in .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 43]: You can do that and jump into the cart afterwards , for fear she may run at you ; but I do n't think that she will , for it 's the calf she wants , and not either of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 46]: As soon as Humphrey was ready with the rope he gave the word , and the gate was opened ; the cow ran in immediately , and hearing her calf bleat , went into the cow-house , the door of which was shut upon her .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 18]: A minute afterwards Humphrey cried out to them to haul upon the rope , which they did .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 27]: `` That will do , '' said Humphrey from the inside ; `` now make the rope fast , and then you may come in . ''
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 32]: They went in , and found the heifer drawn close to the side of the cow-house by the rope which was round her horns , and unable to move her head .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 19]: `` Well , Humphrey , that 's very clever ; but now what 's to be done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 28]: `` First I 'll saw off the tips of her horns , and then if she does run at us , she wo n't hurt us much .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 9]: Wait till I go for the saw . ''
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 57]: As soon as the ends of her horns were sawed off , Humphrey took another piece of rope , which he fastened securely round her horns , and then made the other end fast to the side of the building , so that the animal could move about a little and eat out of the crib .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 17]: `` There , '' said Humphrey , `` now time and patience must do the rest .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 15]: We must coax her and handle her , and we soon shall tame her .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 10]: At present let us leave her with the calf .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 27]: She has a yard of rope , and that is enough for her to lick her calf , which is all that she requires at present .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 10]: To-morrow we will cut some grass for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 10]: They then went out , shutting the cow-house door .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 26]: `` Well , Humphrey , you 've beat us after all , and have the laugh on your side now , '' said Jacob . ''
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 78]: ` Where there 's a will , there 's a way , ' that 's certain ; and I assure you , that when you were making so much hay , and gathering so much litter , and building a cow-house , I had no more idea that we should have a cow than that we should have an elephant ; and I will say that you deserve great credit for your way of obtaining it . ''
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 10]: `` That he certainly does , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 11]: `` You have more genius than I have , brother .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 13]: But dinner must be ready , if Alice has done her duty .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 18]: What think you , Jacob , shall we after dinner go and look after that bull ? ''
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 7]: `` Yes , by all means .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 21]: He will not be had eating , and I can sell all I can carry in the cart at Lymington .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 9]: Besides , the skin is worth money . ''
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIX .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 41]: Alice and Edith were very anxious to see the cow , and especially to see the calf ; but Humphrey told them that they must not go near till he went with them , and then they should see it .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 24]: After dinner was over , Jacob and Edward took their guns , and Humphrey put Billy in the cart , and followed them .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 37]: They found the bull where they left him , standing quite still ; he tossed his head when they approached him , which they did carefully , but he did not attempt to run at them .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 26]: `` It 's my idea that he has nearly bled to death , '' said Jacob ; `` but there 's nothing like making sure .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 20]: Edward , put a bullet just three inches behind his shoulder , and that will make all safe . ''
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 10]: Edward did so , and the animal fell dead .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 17]: They went up to the carcass , which they estimated to weigh at least fifty stone .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 23]: `` It is a noble beast , '' said Edward ; `` I wonder we never thought of killing one before . ''
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 12]: `` They ai n't game , Edward , '' replied Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 36]: `` No , they are not now , Jacob , '' said Humphrey ; `` as you and Edward claim all the game , I shall claim the cattle as my portion of the forest .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 17]: Recollect , there are more , and I mean to have more of them yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 19]: `` Well , Humphrey , I give you up all my rights , if I have any . ''
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 10]: `` And I all mine , '' added Edward .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 5]: `` Be it so .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 14]: Some day you 'll see what I shall do , '' replied Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 29]: `` Recollect , I am to sell the cattle for my own self-advantage until I buy a gun , and one or two things which I want . ''
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 22]: `` I agree to that too , Humphrey , '' replied Jacob ; `` and now to skin the beast . ''
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 22]: The skinning and quartering took up the whole afternoon , and Billy was heavily laden when he drew his cart home .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 27]: The next day Jacob went to Lymington to sell the bull and the skin , and returned home well satisfied with the profit he had made .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 29]: He had procured , as Humphrey requested , some milk-pans , a small churn , and milk-pail , out of the proceeds , and had still money left .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 21]: Humphrey told them that he had not been to see the heifer yet , as he thought it better not .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 16]: `` She will be tame to-morrow morning , depend upon it , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 17]: `` But if you give her nothing to eat , will not the calf die ? ''
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 9]: `` Oh no , I should think not .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 20]: I shall not starve her , but I will make her thankful for her food before she gets it .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 10]: I shall cut her some grass to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 17]: We may as well here say that the next morning Humphrey went in to the heifer .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 10]: At first she tossed about and was very unruly .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 28]: He gave her some grass , and patted her and coaxed her for a long while , till at last she allowed him to touch her gently .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 36]: Every day for a fortnight he brought her her food , and she became quieter every day , till at last , if he went up to her , she never pushed with her horns .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 23]: The calf became quite tame , and as the heifer perceived that the calf was quiet , she became more quiet herself .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 46]: After the fortnight , Humphrey would not allow the heifer to receive anything except from the hand of Alice , that the animal might know her well ; and when the calf was a month old , Humphrey made the first attempt to milk her .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 21]: This was resisted at first by kicking , but in the course of ten days she gave down her milk .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 43]: Humphrey then let her loose for a few days to run about the yard , still keeping the calf in the cow-house , and putting the heifer in to her at night , milking her before the calf was allowed to suck .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 25]: After this , he adventured upon the last experiment , which was to turn her out of the yard to graze into the forest .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 30]: She went away to some distance , and he was fearful that she would join the herd , but in the evening she came back again to her calf .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 22]: After this he was satisfied , and turned her out every day , and they had no further trouble with her .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 27]: He would not , however , wean the calf till the winter time , when she was shut up in the yard and fed on hay .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 21]: He then weaned the calf , which was a cow-calf , and they had no more trouble with the mother .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 15]: Alice soon learnt to milk her , and she became very tractable and good-tempered .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 11]: Such was the commencement of the dairy at the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 17]: `` Jacob , '' said Humphrey , `` when do you go to Lymington again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 8]: `` Why , I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 39]: The end of August , as it is now , and the month of September , is not good for venison ; and , therefore , I do not see what I shall have to go for . ''
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 23]: `` Well , I wish , when you do go , you would get something for Alice and something for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 10]: `` And what is it that Alice wants ? ''
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 7]: `` She wants a kitten . ''
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 10]: `` Well , I think I may find that .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 9]: And what do you want , Humphrey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 6]: `` I want a dog .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 21]: Smoker is yours altogether ; I want a dog for myself , to bring up after my own fashion . ''
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 35]: `` Well , I ought to look-out for another dog : although Smoker is not old , yet one ought to have two dogs to one 's gun , in case of accident . ''
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 29]: `` I think so too , '' replied Edward ; `` see if you can get two puppies , one for Humphrey , and one for myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 12]: `` Well , I must not go to Lymington for them .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 39]: I must cross the forest , to see some friends of mine whom I have not seen for a long while , and I may get some of the right sort of puppies there , just like Smoker .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 25]: I 'll do that at once , as I may have to wait for them , even if I do have the promise . ''
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 10]: `` May I go with you , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 3]: said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 14]: `` Why , I would rather not ; they may ask questions . ''
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 19]: `` And so would I rather he would not , for he will shirk his work here . ''
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 12]: `` Why , what is there to do , Humphrey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 30]: `` Plenty to do , and hard work , Edward ; the acorns are fit for beating down , and we want a great many bushels for the pigs .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 15]: We have to fatten three , and to feed the rest during the winter .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 30]: I can not get on well with only Alice and Edith ; so if you are not very lazy , you will stay with us and help us . ''
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 14]: `` Humphrey , you think of nothing but your pigs and farm-yard . ''
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 50]: `` And you are too great a hunter to think of anything but a stag ; but a bird in the hand 's worth two in the bush , in my opinion ; and I 'll make more by my farm-yard than you ever will by the forest . ''
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 17]: `` Humphrey has nothing to do with the poultry and eggs , has he , Edward ?
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 41]: They belong to Edith and me and Jacob shall take them to Lymington and sell them for us , and get us some new clothes for Sunday , for these begin to look rather worn -- and no wonder . ''
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 36]: `` No , dearest , the poultry are yours , and I will sell them for you as soon as you please , and buy what you wish with the money , '' replied Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 14]: `` Let Humphrey make all the money he can with his pigs . ''
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 19]: `` Yes ; and the butter belongs to me , if I make it , '' said Alice .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 25]: `` No , no , '' replied Humphrey , `` that 's not fair ; I find cows , and get nothing for them .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 8]: We must go halves , Alice . ''
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 24]: `` Well , I have no objection to that , '' said Alice , `` because you find the cows and feed them .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 24]: I made a pound of butter yesterday , just to try what I could do ; but it 's not firm , Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 5]: How is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 24]: `` I have seen the women make butter , and know how , Alice ; so next time I will be with you .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 19]: I suppose you did not wash your butter-milk well out , nor put any salt in it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 11]: `` I did not put any salt in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 13]: `` But you must , or the butter will not keep . ''
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 41]: It was arranged that Edward should stay at home to assist in collecting the acorns for the pigs , and that Jacob should cross the forest alone to see after the puppies ; and he set off the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 81]: He was away two days , and then returned ; said that he had a promise of two puppies , and that he had chosen them ; they were of the same breed as Smoker , but they were only a fortnight old , and could not be taken from the mother yet awhile , so that he had arranged to call again when they were three or four months old , and able to follow him across the forest .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 55]: Jacob also said that he was very near being hurt by a stag that had made at him -- for at that season of the year the stags were very dangerous and fierce -- but that he had fired , and struck off one of the animal 's horns , which made it turn .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 17]: `` You must be careful , Edward , how you go about the forest now . ''
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 33]: `` I have no wish to go , '' replied Edward ; `` as we can not hunt , it is no use ; but in November we shall begin again . ''
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 14]: `` Yes , '' replied Jacob , `` that will be soon enough .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 31]: To-morrow I will help you with the acorns , and the day afterwards , if I am spared , I will take Alice 's poultry to Lymington for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 27]: `` Yes , and when you come back you will help me to churn , for then I shall have a good deal of cream . ''
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 16]: `` And do n't forget to buy the kitten , Jacob , '' said Edith .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 10]: `` What 's the good of a kitten ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 34]: said Humphrey , who was very busy making a bird-cage for Edith , having just finished one for Alice ; `` she will only steal your cream and eat up your birds . ''
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 42]: `` No , she wo n't ; for we 'll shut the door fast where the milk and cream is , and we 'll hang the cages so high that Miss Puss wo n't be able to get at them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 26]: `` Well , then , a kitten will be useful , '' said Edward , `` for she will teach you to be careful . ''
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 18]: `` My coat is a little the worse for wear , and so is yours , Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 19]: We must try if we can not , like Alice , find means to pay for another . ''
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 30]: `` Humphrey , '' said Jacob , `` I 'll buy all you want , and trust to you for paying me again as soon as you can . ''
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 12]: `` That 's just what I want , '' replied Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 52]: `` Then you must buy me a gun and a new suit of clothes first ; when I 've paid for them I shall want some more tools , and some nails and screws , and two or three other things ; but I will say nothing about them just now .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 25]: Get me my gun , and I 'll try what the forest will do for me -- especially after I have my dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 39]: `` Well , we shall see ; perhaps you 'll like to come out with me sometimes and learn woodcraft , for Edward knows as much as I do now , and can go out by himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 15]: `` Of course I will , Jacob ; I want to learn everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 22]: `` Well , there 's a little money left in the bag yet , and I will go to Lymington to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 29]: Now I think it is time that we went to bed ; and if you are all as tired as I am , you will sleep soundly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 30]: Jacob put into the cart the next day about forty of the chickens which Alice had reared ; the others were kept to increase the number in the poultry-yard .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 52]: They had cost little or nothing bringing up ; for when quite young they only had a little oatmeal cake , and afterwards , with the potatoes which were left , they found themselves , as fowls can always do when they have a great range of ground to go over .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 11]: Jacob came back at sunset , with all the articles .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 40]: He brought a new suit for Alice and Edith , with some needles and thread and worsted , and gave her some money which was left from the sale of the chickens , after he had made the purchases .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 52]: He also bought a new suit for Edward and Humphrey , and a gun , which was much approved of by Humphrey , as it had a larger bore and carried a heavier bullet than either Jacob 's or Edward 's and there was a white kitten for Alice and Edith .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 41]: There was no news , only that the Levellers had opposed Cromwell , and he had put them down with the other troops , and Jacob said that it appeared that they were all squabbling and fighting with each other .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 76]: Time passed ; the month of November came on without anything to disturb the daily employments of the family in the forest : when one evening Jacob , who had returned from hunting with Edward -LRB- the first time they had been out since the season commenced -RRB- , told Alice that she must do all she could to give them a good dinner the next day , as it was to be a feast .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 7]: `` Why so , Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 21]: `` If you can not guess , I wo n't tell you till the time comes , '' replied Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 22]: `` Well then , Humphrey must help us , '' replied Alice , `` and we will do what we can .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 18]: I will try , now that we have some meat , to make a grand dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 45]: Alice made all the preparations , and had for dinner the next day a piece of baked venison , a venison stew , a pair of roast chickens , and an apple-pie -- which , for them , was a very grand dinner indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 24]: And it was very well-dressed ; for Jacob had taught her to cook , and by degrees she improved upon Jacob 's instruction .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 33]: Humphrey was quite as clever at it as she was ; and little Edith was very useful , as she plucked the fowls , and watched the things while they were cooking .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 27]: `` And now I 'll tell you , '' said Jacob , after saying grace , `` why I asked you for a feast this day .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 16]: It is because exactly on this day twelvemonth I brought you all to the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 5]: Now you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 19]: `` I did not know it certainly , but I daresay you are right , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 42]: `` And now , children , tell me , '' said Jacob , `` has not this year passed very quickly and very happily -- quite as quickly and quite as happily as if you had been staying at Arnwood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 41]: `` Yes , more so , '' replied Humphrey ; `` for then very often I did not know what to do to amuse myself , and since I have been here the days have always been too short . ''
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 10]: `` I agree with Humphrey , '' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 42]: `` And I am sure I do , '' replied Alice ; `` I 'm always busy , and always happy , and I 'm never scolded about dirtying my clothes or tearing them , as I used to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 9]: `` And what does little Edith say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 20]: `` I like to help Alice , and I like to play with the kitten , '' replied Edith .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 38]: `` Well , my children , '' said Jacob , `` depend upon it , you are most happy when your days pass quickest , and that is only the case when you have plenty to do .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 19]: Here you are in peace and safety ; and may it please God that you may continue so !
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 27]: We want very few things in this world -- that is , we really want very few things , although we wish and sigh for many .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 14]: You have health and spirits , which are the greatest blessings in life .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 23]: Who would believe , to look at you all , that you were the same children that I brought away from Arnwood ?
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 11]: You were then very different from what you are now .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 17]: You are strong and healthy , rosy and brown , instead of being fair and delicate .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 35]: Look at your sisters , Edward , do you think that any of your former friends -- do you think that Martha , who had the care of them , would know them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 16]: Edward smiled and said , `` Certainly not ; especially in their present dresses . ''
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 12]: `` Nor would , I think , Humphrey be known again .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 31]: You , Edward , were always a stout boy ; and , except that you have grown very much , and are more brown , there is no great difference .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 98]: You would be known again , even in your present forester 's dress ; but what I say is , that we ought to be thankful to the Almighty that you , instead of being burnt in your beds , have found health and happiness and security in a forester 's hut ; and I ought to be , and am , most thankful to heaven that it has pleased it to spare my life , and enable me to teach you all to the present how to gain your own livelihoods after I am called away .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 48]: I have been able so far to fulfil my promise to your noble father ; and you know not what a heavy load on my mind is every day lessened , as I see each day that you are more and more able to provide for yourselves .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 47]: God bless you , dear children , and may you live to see many returns , and happy returns , of the day ; '' and Jacob was so much moved as he said this , that a tear was seen rolling down his furrowed cheek .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 7]: The second winter now came on .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 33]: Jacob and Edward went out hunting usually about twice a week ; for the old forester complained of stiffness and rheumatism , and not feeling so active as he used to be .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 40]: Humphrey now accompanied Edward perhaps one day in the week , but not more , and they seldom returned without having procured venison , for Edward knew his business well , and no longer needed the advice of Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 11]: As the winter advanced Jacob gave up going out altogether .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 50]: He went to Lymington to sell the venison and procure what was necessary for the household ; such as oatmeal and flour , which were the principal wants ; but even these journeys fatigued him , and it was evident that the old man 's constitution was breaking fast .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 5]: Humphrey was always busy .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 11]: One evening he was making something which puzzled them all .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 15]: They asked him what it was for , but he would not tell them .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 22]: `` It 's an experiment that I am trying , '' said he , as he was bending a hazel stick .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 24]: `` If it answers , you shall know : if it does not , I 've only had a little trouble for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 36]: Jacob , I hope you will not forget the salt to-morrow when you go to Lymington , for my pigs are ready for killing , and we must salt the greatest part of the pork .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 35]: After the legs and shoulders have lain long enough in salt , I mean to try if I can not smoke them , and if I do , I 'll then smoke some bacon .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 8]: Wo n't that be jolly , Alice ?
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 49]: Wo n't you like to have a great piece of bacon hanging up there , and only to have to get on a stool to cut off what you want , when Edward and I come home hungry and you 've nothing to give us to eat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 25]: `` I shall be very glad to have it , and I think so will you too , by the way you talk . ''
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 8]: `` I shall , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 17]: Jacob , did n't you say the ash-sticks were the best to smoke bacon with ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 18]: `` Yes , boy : when you are ready , I 'll tell you how to manage .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 14]: My poor mother used to smoke very well up this very chimney . ''
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 34]: `` I think that will do , '' said Humphrey , letting his hazel stick spring up , after he had bent it down , `` but to-morrow I shall find out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 10]: `` But what is it for , Humphrey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 3]: said Edith .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 52]: `` Go away , puss , and play with your kitten , '' replied Humphrey , putting away his tools and his materials in a corner ; `` I 've a great deal on my hands now , but I must kill my pigs before I think of anything else . ''
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 20]: The next day Jacob took the venison into Lymington , and brought back the salt and other articles required .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 48]: The pigs were then killed , and salted down under Jacob 's directions ; his rheumatism did not allow him to assist , but Humphrey and Edward rubbed in the salt , and Alice took the pieces of pork away to the tub when they were finished .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 18]: Humphrey had been out the day before with the unknown article he had been so long about .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 29]: The next morning he went out early before breakfast , and when he returned he brought a hare in his hand , which he laid on the table .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 21]: `` There , '' said he , `` my springe has answered , and this is the fruits of it .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 21]: Now I 'll make some more , and we will have something by way of a change for dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 20]: They were very much pleased with Humphrey 's success , and he was not a little proud of it .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 12]: `` How did you find out how to make it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 48]: `` Why , I read in the old book of travels which Jacob brought home with him last summer , of people catching rabbits and hares in some way like this ; I could not make it out exactly , but it gave me the idea . ''
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 75]: We ought to have told the reader that Jacob had more than once brought home an old book or two which he had picked up , or had given him , and that these had been occasionally looked into by Humphrey and Edward , but only now and then , as they had too much to do to find much time for reading , although sometimes in the evening they did take them up .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 25]: When it is considered how young they were , and what a practical and busy life they led , this can not be surprising .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 7]: Humphrey was now after something else .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 16]: He had made several traps , and brought in rabbits and hares almost every day .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 30]: He had also made some bird traps , and had caught two gold-finches for Alice and Edith , which they put in the cages he had made for them .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 57]: But , as we said , Humphrey was about something else ; he was out early in the morning , and in the evening , when the moon was up , he came home late , long after they had all gone to bed ; but they never knew why , nor would he tell them .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 16]: A heavy fall of snow took place , and Humphrey was more out than ever .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 62]: At last , about a week after the snow had lain on the ground , one morning he came in with a hare and rabbit in his hand , and said : `` Edward , I have caught something larger than a hare or a rabbit , and you must come and help me , and we must take our guns .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 16]: Jacob , I suppose your rheumatism is too bad to let you come too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 9]: `` No ; I think I can manage .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 10]: It 's the damp that hurts me so much .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 10]: This frosty air will do me good , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 10]: I have been much better since the snow fell .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 13]: Now , then , let us see what you have caught . ''
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 18]: `` You will have to walk two miles , '' said Humphrey , as they went out .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 14]: `` I can manage it , Humphrey ; so lead the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 40]: Humphrey went on till they came close to a clump of large trees , and then brought them to a pit-fall which he had dug , about six feet wide and eight feet long , and nine feet deep .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 22]: `` There 's my large trap , '' said Humphrey , `` and see what I have caught in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 14]: They looked down into the pit and perceived a young bull in it .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 14]: Smoker , who was with them , began to bark furiously at it .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 9]: `` Now , what are we to do ?
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 8]: I do n't think it is hurt .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 7]: Can we get it out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 3]: said Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 7]: `` No , not very well .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 40]: If it was a calf we might ; but it is too heavy ; and if we were to get it out alive , we must kill it afterwards , so we had better shoot it at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 9]: `` So I think , '' replied Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 9]: `` But how did you catch him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 3]: said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 21]: `` I read of it in the same book I did about the traps for hares , '' replied Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 20]: `` I dug out the pit and covered it with brambles , and then put snow at the top .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 36]: This is the thicket that the herd comes to chiefly in winter time ; it is large and dry , and the large trees shelter it ; so that is why I chose this spot .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 58]: I took a large bundle of hay , put some on the snow about the pit , and then strewed some more about in small handfuls , so that the cattle must find it and pick it up , which I knew they would be glad to do , now that the snow is on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 11]: And now , you see , I have succeeded . ''
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 17]: `` Well , Humphrey , you beat us , I will say , '' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 7]: `` Shall I shoot him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 11]: `` Yes , now that he is looking up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 65]: Edward shot his ball through the forehead of the animal , which fell dead ; but they were then obliged to go home for the pony and cart , and ropes to get the animal out of the pit , and a hard job they had of it too ; but the pony helped them , and they did get it out at last .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 13]: `` I will do it easier next time , '' said Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 33]: `` I will make a windlass as soon as I can , and we will soon hoist out another , like they turn a bucket of water up from a well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 28]: `` It 's nice young meat , '' said Jacob , who was skinning the bull , `` not above eighteen months old , I should think .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 30]: Had it been a full-grown one , like that we shot , it must have remained where it was , for we never could have got it out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 43]: `` Yes , Jacob , we should ; for I should have gone down and cut it up in the pit , so that we would have handed it out by bits , if we could not have managed him whole . ''
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 18]: They loaded the cart with the skin and quarters of the animal , and then drove home .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 27]: `` This will go far to pay for the gun , Humphrey , '' said Jacob , `` if it do n't pay for more . ''
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 26]: `` I 'm glad of it , '' said Humphrey ; `` but I hope it will not be the last which I take . ''
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 58]: `` That reminds me , Humphrey , of one thing ; I think you must come back with the cart and carry away all the entrails of the beast , and remove all the blood which is on the snow , for I 've observed that cattle are very scared with the smell and sight of blood .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 56]: I found that out by once or twice seeing them come to where I have cut the throat of a stag , and as soon as they have put their noses down to where the blood was on the ground they have put their tails up and galloped away , bellowing at a terrible rate .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 42]: Indeed I 've heard say that if a murder has been committed in a wood , and you want to find the body , that a herd of cattle drove into it will serve you better than even a bloodhound . ''
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 29]: `` Thank you for telling me that , Jacob , for I should never have supposed it ; and I 'll tell you what I 'll also do .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 42]: I 'll load the cart with fern litter , and put it at the bottom of the pit ; so that if I could get a heifer or calf worth taking , it may not be hurt by the fall . ''
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 17]: `` It must have taken you a long while to dig that pit , Humphrey . ''
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 31]: `` Yes , it did , and as I got deeper the work was harder , and then I had to carry away all the earth and scatter it about .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 52]: I was more than a month about it from the time that I began till it was finished , and I had a ladder to go up and down by at last , and carried the baskets of earth up , for it was too deep to throw it out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 9]: `` Nothing like patience and perseverance , Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 8]: You 've more than I have . ''
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 24]: `` I 'm sure he has more than I have , or shall ever have , I 'm afraid , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 17]: During this winter , which passed rapidly away , very few circumstances of any consequence occurred .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 25]: Old Jacob was more or less confined to the cottage by the rheumatism , and Edward hunted either by himself or occasionally with Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 55]: Humphrey was fortunate enough to take a bull and cow-calf in his pit-fall , both of them about a year or fifteen months old , and by a rude invention of his , by way of windlass , contrived , with the assistance of Edward , to hoist them uninjured out of the pit .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 32]: They were put into the yard , and after having been starved till they were tamed , they followed the example of the heifer and calf , and became quite tame .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 15]: These were an important addition to their stock , as may well be imagined .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 60]: The only mishap under which they laboured was , old Jacob 's confinement to the cottage , which , as the winter advanced , prevented him from going to Lymington ; they could not therefore sell any venison , and Humphrey , by way of experiment , smoked some venison hams , which he hung up with the others .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 51]: There was another point on which they felt anxiety , which was , that Jacob could not cross the forest to get the puppies which had been promised them , and the time was past , for it was now January , when he was to have called for them .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 34]: Edward and Humphrey pressed the old man very hard to let one of them go ; but the only answer they could obtain was , `` that he 'd be better soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 19]: At last , finding that he got worse instead of better , he consented that Edward should go .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 41]: He gave directions how to proceed , the way he was to take , and a description of the keeper 's lodge ; cautioned him to call himself by the name of Armitage , and describe himself as his grandson .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 36]: Edward promised to obey Jacob 's directions , and the next morning he set off , mounted upon White Billy , with a little money in his pocket , in case he should want it .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 23]: `` I wish I was going with you , '' said Humphrey , as he walked by the side of the pony .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 24]: `` I wish you were , Humphrey : for my part , I feel as if I were a slave set at liberty .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 53]: I do justice to old Jacob 's kindness and good-will , and acknowledge how much we are indebted to him ; but still , to be housed up here in the forest , never seeing or speaking to any one , shut out from the world , does not suit Edward Beverley .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 47]: Our father was a soldier , and a right good one ; and if I were old enough I think even now I should escape and join the royal party , broken as it may be , and by all accounts is , at this moment .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 14]: Deer-stalking is all very well , but I fly at higher game . ''
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 42]: `` I feel the same as you do , '' replied Humphrey ; `` but recollect , Edward , that the old man 's very infirm , and what would become of our sisters if we were to leave them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 42]: `` I know that well , Humphrey ; I have no idea of leaving them , you may be sure ; but I wish they were with our relations in safety , and then we should be free to act . ''
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 37]: `` Yes , we should , Edward ; but recollect that we are not yet men , and boys of fifteen and thirteen can not do much , although they may wish to do much . ''
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 26]: `` It 's true that I am only fifteen , '' replied Edward , `` but I am strong enough , and so are you .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 30]: I think if I had a fair cut at a man 's head , I would make him stagger under it , were he as big as a buffalo .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 36]: As young as I have been to the wars , that I know well ; and I recollect my father promising me that I should go with him as soon as I was fifteen . ''
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 25]: `` What puzzles me , '' replied Humphrey , `` is the fear that old Jacob has of our being seen at Lymington . ''
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 9]: `` Why , what fear is there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 22]: `` I can not tell more than you ; in my opinion , the rear is only in his own imagination .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 27]: They surely would not hurt us -LRB- if we walked about without arms like other people -RRB- , because our father had fought for the king ?
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 28]: That they have beheaded some people is true ; but then they were plotting in the king 's favour , or in other ways opposed to Parliament .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 23]: This I have gathered from Jacob : but I can not see what we have to fear , if we remain quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 29]: But now comes the question , Edward ; for Jacob has , I believe , said more to me on this one subject than he has to you .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 20]: Suppose you were to leave the forest , what would be the first step which you would take ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 28]: `` I should of course state who I was , and take possession of my father 's property at Arnwood , which is mine by descent . ''
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 48]: `` Exactly ; so Jacob thinks , and he says that would be your ruin , for the property is sequestered , as they call it , or forfeited to the Parliament , in consequence of your father having fought against it on the king 's side .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 38]: It no longer belongs to you , and you would not be allowed to take it : on the contrary , you would in all probability be imprisoned , and who knows what might then take place ?
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 7]: You see there is danger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 9]: `` Did Jacob say this to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 105]: `` Yes , he did : he told me he dare not speak to you on the subject , you were so fiery ; and if you heard that the property was confiscated you would certainly do some rash act , and that anything of the kind would be a pretence for laying hold of you ; and then he said that he did not think that he would live long , for he was weaker every day ; and that he only hoped his life would be spared another year or two , that he might keep you quiet till better times came .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 62]: He said that if they supposed that we were all burnt in the house when it was fired , it would give them a fair opportunity of calling you an impostor , and treating you accordingly ; and that there were so many anxious to have a gift of the property that you would have thousands of people compassing your death .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 127]: He said that your making known yourself and claiming your property would be the very conduct that your enemies would wish you to follow , and would be attended with most fatal consequences ; for he said , to prove that you were Edward Beverley , you must declare that I and your sisters were in the forest with him , and this disclosure would put the whole family in the power of their bitterest enemies ; and what would become of your sisters , it would be impossible to say ; but most likely they would be put under the charge of some Puritan family , who would have a pleasure in ill-treating and humiliating the daughters of such a man as Colonel Beverley . ''
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 12]: `` And why did he not tell me all this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 67]: `` He was afraid to say anything to you ; he thought that you would be so mad at the idea of this injustice that you would do something rash : and he said , ` I pray every night that my otherwise useless life may be spared ; for , were I to die , I know that Edward would quit the forest . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 29]: `` Never , while my sisters are under my protection , '' replied Edward ; `` were they safe , I would be out of it to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 63]: `` I think , Edward , that there is great truth in what Jacob says ; you could do no good -LRB- for they would not restore your property -RRB- , by making your seclusion known at present , and you might do a great deal of harm -- ` bide your time ' -- is good advice in such troubled times .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 44]: I therefore think that I should be very wary if I were you ; but I still think that there is no fear of either you or I going out of the forest in our present dresses and under the name of Armitage .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 45]: No one would recognise us ; you are grown tall , and so am I , and we are so tanned and sunburnt with air and exercise that we do look more like children of the forest than the sons of Colonel Beverley . ''
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 14]: `` Humphrey , you speak very sensibly , and I agree with you .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 36]: I am not quite so fiery as the old man thinks ; and if my bosom burns with indignation , at all events I have sufficient power to conceal my feelings when it is necessary .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 28]: I can oppose art to art , if it becomes requisite , and which , from what you have said , I believe now is really so .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 47]: One thing is certain , that while King Charles is a prisoner , as he now is , and his party dispersed or gone abroad , I can do nothing , and to make myself known would only be to injure myself and all of us .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 40]: Keep quiet , therefore , I certainly shall , and also remain as I am now under a false name ; but still I must and will mix up with other people , and know what is going on .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 40]: I am willing to live in this forest and protect my sisters as long as it is necessary so to do ; but although I will reside here , I will not be confined to the forest altogether . ''
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 27]: `` That 's exactly what I think too , Edward , what I wish myself : but let us not be too hasty even in this .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 37]: And now , I will wish you a pleasant ride ; and , Edward , if you can , procure of the keepers some small shot for me ; I much wish to have some . ''
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 11]: `` I will not forget ; good-bye , brother . ''
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 17]: Humphrey returned home to attend his farm-yard , while Edward continued his journey through the forest .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 17]: Some estimate of the character of the two boys may be formed from the above conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 17]: Edward was courageous and impetuous -- hasty in his resolves , but still open to conviction .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 62]: Brought up as the heir to the property , he felt , more than Humphrey could be expected to do , the mortification of being left a pauper , after such high prospects in his early days : his vindictive feelings against the opposite party were therefore more keen , and his spirit mounted more under the conviction which he laboured .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 33]: His disposition was naturally warlike , and this disposition had been fostered by his father when he was a child -- still a kinder heart or a more generous lad never existed .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 65]: Humphrey was of a much more subdued and philosophical temperament , not perhaps so well calculated to lead as to advise ; there was great prudence in him united with courage ; but his was a passive courage rather than an active one -- a courage which if assailed would defend itself valiantly , but would be wary and reflective before it would attack .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 11]: Humphrey had not that spirit of chivalry possessed by Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 32]: He was a younger son , and had to earn , in a way , his own fortune , and he felt that his inclinations were more for peace than strife .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 33]: Moreover , Humphrey had talents which Edward had not -- a natural talent for mechanics , and an inquisitive research into science , as far as his limited education would permit him .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 39]: He was more fitted for an engineer or an agriculturist than for a soldier , although there is no doubt that he would have made a very brave soldier , if such was to have become his avocation .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 54]: For kindness and generosity of nature he was equal to his brother , and this was the reason why an angry word never passed between them ; for the question between them was , not which should have his way , but which should give up most to the wishes of the other .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 24]: We hardly need say , that there never were two brothers who were more attached , and who so mutually respected each other .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 22]: Edward put the pony to a trot , and in two hours was on the other side of the New Forest .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 28]: The directions given to him by Jacob were not forgotten , and before it was noon he found himself at the gate of the keeper 's house .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 43]: Dismounting , and hanging the bridle of the pony over the rail he walked through a small garden , neatly kept but , so early in the year , not over gay , except that the crocus and snow drops were peeping .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 24]: He rapped at the door with his knuckles , and a girl of about fourteen , very neatly dressed , answered the summons .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 10]: `` Is Oswald Partridge at home , maiden ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 3]: said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 10]: `` No , young man , he is not .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 7]: He is in the forest . ''
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 7]: `` When will he return ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 17]: `` Towards the evening is his time , unless he is more than usually successful . ''
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 26]: `` I have come some distance to find him , '' replied Edward ; `` and it would vex me to return without seeing him .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 15]: Has he a wife , or any one that I could speak to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 16]: `` He has no wife ; but I am willing to deliver a message . ''
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 45]: `` I am come about some dogs which he promised to Jacob Armitage , my relation ; but the old man is too unwell , and has been for some time , to come himself for them , and he has sent me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 28]: `` There are dogs , young and old , large and small , in the kennels ; so far do I know , and no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 15]: `` I fear then I must wait till his return , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 23]: `` I will speak to my father , '' replied the young girl , `` if you will wait one moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 27]: In a minute or two the girl returned , saying that her father begged that he would walk in , and he would speak with him .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 34]: Edward bowed , and followed the young girl , who led the way to a room , in which was seated a man dressed after the fashion of the Roundheads of the day .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 14]: His steeple-crowned hat lay on the chair , with his sword beneath it .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 10]: He was sitting at a table covered with papers .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 33]: `` Here is the youth , father , '' said the girl ; and having said this , she crossed the room and took a seat by the side of the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 71]: The man , or we should rather say gentleman -- for he had the appearance of one , notwithstanding the sombre and peculiar dress he wore , continued to read a letter which he had just opened ; and Edward , who feared himself the prisoner of a Roundhead when he only expected to meet a keeper , was further irritated by the neglect shown towards him by the party .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 34]: Forgetting that he was , by his own assertion , not Edward Beverley , but the relative of one Jacob Armitage , he coloured up with anger as he stood at the door .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 61]: Fortunately the time that it took the other party to read through the letter gave Edward also time for recollecting the disguise under which he appeared ; the colour subsided from his cheeks , and he remained in silence , occasionally meeting the look of the little girl , who , when their eyes met , immediately withdrew her glance .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 10]: `` What is your business , young man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 9]: at last said the gentleman at the table .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 33]: `` I came , sir , on private business with the keeper , Oswald Partridge , to obtain two young hounds , which he promised to my grandfather , Jacob Armitage . ''
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 4]: `` Armitage ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 29]: said the other party , referring to a list on the table ; `` Armitage -- Jacob -- yes -- I see he is one of the verderers .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 12]: Why has he not been here to call upon me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 13]: `` For what reason should he call upon you , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 3]: replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 21]: `` Simply , young man , because the New Forest is , by the Parliament , committed to my charge .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 34]: Notice has been given for all those who were employed to come here , that they might be permitted to remain , or he discharged , as I may deem most advisable . ''
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 15]: `` Jacob Armitage has heard nothing of this , sir , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 47]: `` He was a keeper , appointed under the king ; for two or three years his allowances have never been paid , and he has lived in his own cottage , which was left to him by his father , being his own property . ''
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 19]: `` And pray , may I ask , young man , do you live with Jacob Armitage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 12]: `` I have done so for more than a year . ''
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 27]: `` And as your relation has received no pay and allowances , as you state , pray , by what means has he maintained himself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 10]: `` How have the other keepers maintained themselves ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 3]: replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 24]: `` Do not put questions to me , sir , '' replied the gentleman ; `` but be pleased to reply to mine .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 12]: What has been the means of subsistence of Jacob Armitage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 21]: `` If you think he has no means of subsistence , sir , you are mistaken , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 29]: `` We have land of our own , which we cultivate ; we have our pony and our cart ; we have our pigs and our cows . ''
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 8]: `` And they have been sufficient ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 7]: `` Had the patriarchs more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 3]: replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 55]: `` You are pithy at reply , young man ; but I know something of Jacob Armitage , and we know , '' continued he , putting his finger close to some writing opposite the name on the list , `` with whom he has been associated , and with whom he has served .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 8]: Now allow me to put one question .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 12]: You have come , you say , for two young hounds .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 21]: Are their services required for your pigs and cows , and to what use are they to be put ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 34]: `` We have as good a dog as there is in the forest , '' replied Edward , `` but we wish to have others , in case we should lose him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 15]: `` As good a dog as in the forest -- good for what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 5]: `` For hunting . ''
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 10]: `` Then you acknowledge that you do hunt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 38]: `` I acknowledge nothing for Jacob Armitage , he may answer for himself , '' replied Edward ; `` but allow me to assure you that if he has killed venison no one can blame him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 8]: `` Perhaps you will explain why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 6]: `` Nothing is more easy .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 22]: Jacob Armitage served King Charles , who employed him as a verderer in the forest , and paid him his wages .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 27]: Those who should not have done so rebelled against the king , took his authority from him , and the means of paying those he employed .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 62]: They were still servants of the king , for they were not dismissed ; and , having no other means of support , they considered that their good master would be but too happy that they should support themselves by killing , for their subsistence , that venison which they could no longer preserve for him without eating some themselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 16]: `` Then you admit that Jacob Armitage has killed the deer in the forest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 9]: `` I admit nothing for Jacob Armitage . ''
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 11]: `` You admit that you have killed it yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 43]: `` I shall not answer that question , sir ; in the first place , I am not here to criminate myself ; and , in the next , I must know by what authority you have the right to inquire . ''
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 77]: `` Young man , '' replied the other in a severe tone , `` if you wish to know my authority , malapert as you are -LRB- at this remark Edward started , yet , recollecting himself he compressed his lips and stood still -RRB- , this is my commission , appointing me the agent of Parliament to take charge and superintend the New Forest , with power to appoint and dismiss those whom I please .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 19]: I presume you must take my word for it , as you can not read and write . ''
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 18]: Edward stepped up to the table , and very quietly took up the paper and read it .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 39]: `` You have stated what is correct , sir , '' said he , laying it down ; `` and the date of it is , I perceive , on the 20th of the last month of December .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 11]: It is , therefore , but eighteen days old . ''
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 14]: `` And what inference would you draw from that , young man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 12]: replied the gentleman , looking up to him with some astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 31]: `` Simply this , sir -- that Jacob Armitage has been laid up with the rheumatism for three months , during which time he certainly has not killed any venison .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 56]: Now , sir , until the Parliament took the forest into their hands , it undoubtedly belonged to his majesty , if it does not now ; therefore Jacob Armitage , for whatever slaughter he may have committed , is , up to the present , only answerable to his sovereign , King Charles . ''
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 50]: `` It is easy to perceive the school in which you have been brought up , young man , even if there was not evidence on this paper that your forefather served under the Cavalier Colonel Beverley , and has brought you up to his way of thinking . ''
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 22]: `` Sir , it is a base dog that bites the hand that feeds him , '' replied Edward with warmth .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 61]: `` Jacob Armitage , and his father before him , were retainers in the family of Colonel Beverley ; they were indebted to him for the situation they now hold in the forest ; indebted to him for everything ; they revere his name , they uphold the cause for which he fell , as I _ do _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 103]: `` Young man , if you do not speak advisedly , at all events you speak gratefully ; neither have I a word of disrespect to offer to the memory of Colonel Beverley , who was a gallant man , and true to the cause which he espoused , although it was not a holy one ; but in my position , I can not , in justice to those whom I serve , give places and emolument to those who have been , and still are , as I may judge by your expressions , adverse to the present government . ''
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 109]: `` Sir , '' replied Edward , `` your language , with respect to Colonel Beverley , has made me feel respect for you , which I confess I did not at first ; what you say is very just ; not that I think you harm Jacob Armitage ; as , in the first place , I know that he would not serve under you ; and , in the next , that he is too old and infirm to hold the situation ; neither has he occasion for it , as his cottage and land are his own , and you can not remove him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 10]: `` He has the title , I presume ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 4]: replied the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 34]: `` He has the title given to his grandfather , long before King Charles was born , and I presume the Parliament do not intend to invalidate the acts of former kings . ''
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 13]: `` May I inquire what relation you are to Jacob Armitage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 13]: `` I believe , I have before said , his grandson . ''
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 7]: `` You live with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 5]: `` I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 14]: `` And if the old man dies , will inherit his property ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 32]: Edward smiled , and looking at the young girl , said , `` Now , I ask you , maiden , if your father does not presume upon his office ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 15]: The young girl laughed , and said , `` He is in authority . ''
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 20]: `` Not over me , certainly , and not over my grandfather , for he has dismissed him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 13]: `` Were you brought up at the cottage , young man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 12]: `` No , sir , I was brought up at Arnwood .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 12]: I was a playmate of the children of Colonel Beverley . ''
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 6]: `` Educated with them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 24]: `` Yes , for , as far as my wilfulness would permit , the chaplain was always ready to give me instruction . ''
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 11]: `` Where were you when Arnwood was burnt down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 21]: `` I was at the cottage at that time , '' replied Edward , grinding his teeth and looking wildly .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 32]: `` Nay , nay , I can forgive any expression of feeling on your part , my young man , when that dreadful and disgraceful deed is brought to your memory .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 27]: It was a stain that can never be effaced -- a deed most diabolical , and what we thought would call down the vengeance of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 19]: If prayers could avert , or did avert it , they were not wanting on our side . ''
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 19]: Edward remained silent : this admission on the part of the Roundhead prevented an explosion on his part .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 13]: He felt that all were not so bad as he had imagined .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 44]: After a long pause , he said , `` When I came here , sir , it was to seek Oswald Partridge , and obtain the hounds which he had promised us ; but I presume that my journey is now useless . ''
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 5]: `` Why so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 36]: `` Because you have the control of the forest , and will not permit dogs for the chase to be given away to those who are not employed by the powers that now govern . ''
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 104]: `` You have judged correctly , in so far that my duty is to prevent it ; but as the promise was made previous to the date of my commission , I presume , '' said he , smiling , `` you think I have no right to interfere , as it will be an _ ex post facto _ case , if I do : I shall not therefore interfere , only I must point out to you that the laws are still the same relative to those who take the deer in the forest by stealth -- you understand me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 25]: `` Yes , sir , I do ; and if you will not be offended , I will give you a candid reply . ''
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 5]: `` Speak then . ''
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 29]: `` I consider that the deer in this forest belong to King Charles , who is my lawful sovereign , and I own no authority but from him .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 31]: I hold myself answerable to him alone for any deer I may kill , and I feel sure of his permission and full forgiveness for what I may do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 47]: `` That may be your opinion , my good sir , but it will not be the opinion of the ruling powers ; but if caught , you will be punished , and that by me , in pursuance of the authority vested in me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 12]: `` Well , sir ; if so , so be it .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 30]: You have dismissed the Armitages on account of their upholding the king , and you can not , therefore , be surprised that they uphold him more than ever .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 14]: Nor can you be surprised if a dismissed verderer becomes a poacher . ''
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 23]: `` Nor can you be surprised if a poacher is caught , that he incurs the penalty , '' replied the Roundhead .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 11]: `` So now there 's an end of our argument .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 34]: If you go into the kitchen , you will find wherewithal to refresh the outward man , and if you wish to remain till Oswald Partridge comes home , you are welcome . ''
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 27]: Edward , who felt indignant at being dismissed to the kitchen , nodded his head and smiled upon the little girl , and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 29]: `` Well , '' thought he , as he went along the passage , `` I came here for two puppies , and I have found a Roundhead .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 23]: I do n't know how it is , but I am not so angry with him as I thought I should be .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 16]: That little girl had a nice smile -- she was quite handsome when she smiled .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 39]: Oh , this is the kitchen , to which , '' thought he , `` the Lord of Arnwood is dismissed by a Covenanter and Roundhead , probably a tradesman or outlaw , who has served the cause .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 18]: Well , be it so ; as Humphrey says , ` I 'll bide my time . '
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 34]: But there is no one here , so I 'll try if there is a stable for White Billy , who is tired , I presume , of being at the gate . ''
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 37]: Edward returned by the way he came , went out of the front door , and through the garden to where the pony was made fast , and led him away in search of a stable .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 47]: He found one behind the house , and filling the rack with hay , returned to the house , and seated himself at a porch which was at the door which led to the back premises , for the keeper 's house was large and commodious .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 55]: Edward was in deep thought , when he was roused by the little girl , the daughter of the newly-appointed Intendant of the forest , who said : `` I am afraid , young sir , you have had but sorry welcome in the kitchen , as there was no one to receive you .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 10]: I was not aware that Phoebe had gone out .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 17]: If you will come with me , I may , perhaps , find you refreshment . ''
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 19]: `` Thanks , maiden , you are kind and considerate to an avowed poacher , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 34]: `` Oh , but you will not poach , I 'm sure ; and if you do , I 'll beg you off if I can , '' replied the girl , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 38]: Edward followed her into the kitchen , and she soon produced a cold fowl and a venison pasty , which she placed on the table ; she then went out and returned with a jug of ale .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 23]: `` There , '' said she , putting it on the table , `` that is all that I can find . ''
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 11]: `` Your father 's name is Heatherstone , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 8]: It was so on the warrant . ''
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 7]: `` Yes , it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 5]: `` And yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 13]: `` The same as my father 's , I should presume . ''
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 9]: `` Yes , but your baptismal name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 24]: `` You ask strange questions , young sir ; but still I will answer you that : my baptismal name is Patience . ''
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 12]: `` I thank you for your condescension , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 6]: `` You live here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 15]: `` For the present , good sir ; and now I leave you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 30]: `` That 's a nice little girl , '' thought Edward , `` although she is the daughter of a Roundhead ; and she calls me ` sir . '
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 18]: I can not , therefore , look like Jacob 's grandson , and must be careful . ''
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 43]: Edward then set to with a good appetite at the viands which had been placed before him , and had just finished a hearty meal when Patience Heatherstone again came in and said : `` Oswald Partridge is now coming home . ''
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 11]: `` I thank you , maiden , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 9]: `` May I ask a question of you ?
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 7]: Where is the king now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 49]: `` I have heard that he resides at Hurst Castle , '' replied the girl ; `` but , '' added she in a low tone , `` all attempts to see him would be useless , and only hurt him and those who made the attempt . ''
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 8]: Having said this she left the room .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINE .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 48]: Edward , having finished his meal , and had a good pull at the jug of ale , which was a liquor he had not tasted for a long while , rose from the table and went out of the back door and found there Oswald Partridge .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 14]: He accosted him , stating the reason for his coming over to him .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 22]: `` I did not know that Jacob had a grandson ; indeed , I never knew that he had a son .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 9]: Have you been living with him long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 22]: `` More than a year , '' replied Edward ; `` before that I was in the household at Arnwood . ''
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 14]: `` Then you are of the king 's side , I presume ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 3]: replied Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 15]: `` To death , '' replied Edward , `` when the time comes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 25]: `` And I am also ; that you may suppose , for never would I give a hound to any one that was not .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 20]: But we had better go to the kennels ; dogs may hear , but they ca n't repeat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 38]: `` I little thought to have met any one but you here when I came , '' said Edward ; `` and I will now tell you all that passed between me and the new Intendant . ''
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 6]: Edward then related the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 43]: `` You have been bold , '' said Oswald -- `` but perhaps it is all the better -- I am to retain my situation , and so are two others : but there are many new hands coming in as rangers .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 40]: I know nothing of them but that they are little fitted for their places ; and rail against the king all day long , which I suppose is their chief merit in the eyes of those who appoint them .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 43]: However , one thing is certain , that if those fellows can not stalk a deer themselves , they will do all they can to prevent others ; so you must be on the alert , for the punishment is severe . ''
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 30]: `` I fear them not ; the only difficulty is , that we shall not be able to find a sale for the venison now , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 38]: `` Oh , never fear that ; I will give you the names of those who will take all your venison off your hands without any risk on your part , except in the killing of it .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 18]: They will meet you in the park , lay down ready money , and take it away .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 32]: I do n't know , but I have an idea that this new Intendant , or what you may call him , is not so severe as he pretends to be .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 34]: Indeed , his permitting you to say what he did , and his own words relative to the colonel , convince me that I am right in the opinion that I formed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 9]: `` Do you know who he is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 46]: `` Not much about him , but he is a great friend of General Cromwell 's , and they say has done good service to the Parliamentary cause ; but we shall meet again , for the forest is free , at all events . ''
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 26]: `` If you come here , '' continued Oswald , `` do not carry your gun , and see that you are not watched home .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 8]: There are the dogs for your grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 20]: Why , how old must you be , for Jacob is not more than sixty , or thereabout ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 9]: `` I am fifteen past , nevertheless . ''
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 14]: `` I should have put you down for eighteen or nineteen at least .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 9]: You are well grown indeed for that age .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 15]: Well , nothing like a forest life to turn a boy into a man !
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 7]: Can you stalk a deer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 11]: `` I seldom go out without bringing one down . ''
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 3]: `` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 11]: That Jacob is a master of his craft is certain .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 11]: But you are young to have learnt it so soon .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 13]: Can you tell the slot of a brocket from a stag ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 14]: `` Yes , and the slot of a brocket from a doe . ''
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 4]: `` Better still .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 56]: We must go out together ; and besides , I must know where the old man 's cottage is -LRB- for I do not exactly -RRB- ; in the first place , because I may want to come to you , and in the next , that I may put others on a false scent .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 18]: -- Do you know the clump of large oaks , which they call the Clump Royal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 7]: `` Yes , I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 16]: `` Will you meet me there the day after to-morrow , at early dawn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 9]: `` If I live and do well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 5]: `` That 's enough .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 13]: Take the dogs in the leashes , and go away now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 19]: `` Many thanks ; but I must not leave the pony ; he is in the stable . ''
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 19]: The keeper nodded adieu to Edward , who left him to go to the stable for the pony .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 21]: Edward saddled White Billy , and rode away across the forest with the dogs trotting at the pony 's heels .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 14]: Edward had much to reflect upon as he rode back to the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 13]: He felt that his position was one of more difficulty than before .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 30]: That old Jacob Armitage would not last much longer he was convinced ; even now the poor old man was shrunk away to a skeleton with pain and disease .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 56]: That the livelihood to be procured from the forest would be attended with peril , now that order had been restored and the forest was no longer neglected , was certain ; and he rejoiced that Humphrey had , by his assiduity and intelligence , made the farm so profitable as it promised to be .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 30]: Indeed he felt that , if necessary , they could live upon the proceeds of the farm , and not run the risk of imprisonment by stalking the deer .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 42]: But he had told the intendant that he considered the game as the king 's property , and he was resolved that he would at all events run the risk , although he would no longer permit Humphrey so to do .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 59]: `` If anything happens to me , '' thought Edward , `` Humphrey will still be at the cottage to take care of my sisters ; and if I am obliged to fly the country , it will suit well my feelings , as I can then offer my services to those who still support the king . ''
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 24]: With these thoughts , and many others , he amused himself until , late in the evening , he arrived at the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 24]: He found all in bed except Humphrey , who had waited for him , and to whom he narrated all that had passed .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 18]: Humphrey said little in reply ; he wished to think it over before he gave any opinion .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 29]: He told Edward that Jacob had been very ill the whole of the day , and had requested Alice to read the Bible to him during the evening .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 35]: The next morning Edward went to Jacob , who for the last ten days had altogether kept his bed , and gave him the detail of what had happened at the keeper 's lodge .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 27]: `` You have been more bold than prudent , Edward , '' replied Jacob ; `` but I could not expect you to have spoken otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 21]: You are too proud and too manly to tell a lie , and I am glad that it is so .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 77]: As for your upholding the king , although he is now a prisoner in their hands , they can not blame you or punish you for that , as long as you have not weapons in your hands ; but now that they have taken the forest under their jurisdiction , you must be careful , for they are the ruling powers at present , and must be obeyed , or the forfeit must be paid .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 38]: Still I do not ask you to promise me this or that ; I only point out to you that your sisters will suffer by any imprudence on your part ; and for their sakes be careful .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 27]: I say this , Edward , because I feel that my days are numbered , and that in a short time I shall be called away .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 17]: You will then have all the load on your shoulders which has been latterly on mine .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 73]: I have no fear for the result , if you are prudent ; these few months past , during which I have only been a burden to you , have proved that you and Humphrey can find a living here for yourselves and your sisters ; and it is fortunate , now that the forest laws are about to be put in force , that you have made the farm so profitable .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 104]: If I might advise , let your hunting in the forest be confined to the wild cattle ; they are not game , and the forest laws do not extend to them , and the meat is as valuable as venison ; that is to say , it does not sell so dear , but there is more of it ; but stick to the farm as much as you can ; for you see , Edward , you do not look like a low-born forester , nor ought you to do so ; and the more quiet you keep , the better .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 35]: As for Oswald Partridge , you may trust him ; I know him well , and he will prove your friend for my sake , as soon as he hears that I am dead .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 14]: Leave me now , I will talk to you again in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 10]: Send Alice to me , my dear boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 16]: Edward was much distressed to perceive the change which had taken place in old Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 17]: He was evidently much worse ; but Edward had no idea how much worse he was .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 35]: Edward assisted Humphrey in the farm , and in the evening again went to Jacob , and then told him of the arrangement he had made to meet Oswald Partridge on the following morning .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 63]: `` Go , my boy , '' said Jacob ; `` be as intimate with him as you can , and make a friend of him -- nay , if it should be necessary , you may tell him who you are ; I did think of telling him myself , as it might be important to you one day as evidence .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 29]: I think you had better bring him here to-morrow night , Edward ; tell him I am dying , and wish to speak to him before I go .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 19]: Alice will read the Bible to me now , and I will talk with you another time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 15]: Early the next morning Edward set off to the appointed rendezvous with Oswald Partridge .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 60]: The Clump Royal , as it was called , from the peculiar size and beauty of the oaks , was about seven miles from the cottage ; and at the hour and time indicated Edward , with his gun in his hand , and Smoker lying beside him , was leaning against one of those monarchs of the forest .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 6]: He did not wait long .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 17]: Oswald Partridge , similarly provided , made his appearance , and Edward advanced to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 9]: `` Welcome , Oswald , '' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 15]: `` And welcome to you also , my fine lad , '' replied Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 48]: `` I have been hard questioned about you since we parted -- first , by the Roundhead Heatherstone , who plied me in all manner of ways to find out whether you are what you assert , the grandson of Jacob , -- or some other person .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 27]: I really believe that he fancies you are the Duke of York -- but he could not get any more from me than what I knew .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 55]: I told him that your grandfather 's cottage was his own property , and a grant to his forefathers : that you were brought up at Arnwood , and had joined your grandfather after the death of the colonel , and the murderous burning of the house and all within it by his party .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 10]: But the pretty little daughter was more curious still .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 51]: She cross-questioned me in every way when her father was not present , and at last begged me as a favour to tell you not to take the deer , as her father was very strict in his duty , and , if caught , you would be imprisoned . ''
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 44]: `` Many thanks to her for her caution , but I hope to take one to-day , nevertheless , '' replied Edward ; `` a hart royal is not meat for Roundheads , although the king 's servants may feast on them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 6]: `` That 's truly said .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 9]: Well , now I must see your woodcraft .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 10]: You shall be the leader of the chase . ''
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 12]: `` Think you we can harbour a stag about here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 11]: `` Yes , in this month , no doubt . ''
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 10]: `` Let us walk on , '' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 35]: `` The wind is fresh from the eastern quarter : we will face it , if you please -- or rather , keep it blowing on our right cheek for the present . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 17]: 'T is well , '' replied Oswald ; and they walked for about half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 35]: `` This is the slot of a doe , '' said Edward , in a low voice , pointing to the marks ; `` yonder thicket is a likely harbour for the stag . ''
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 18]: They proceeded , and Edward pointed out to Oswald the slot of the stag into the thicket .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 17]: They then walked round , and found no marks of the animal having left his lair .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 29]: `` He is here , '' whispered Edward ; and Oswald made a sign for Edward to enter the thicket , while he walked to the other side .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 6]: Edward entered the thicket cautiously .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 30]: In the centre he perceived , through the trees , a small cleared spot , covered with high fern , and felt certain that the stag was lying there .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 23]: He forced his way on his knees till he had a better view of the place , and then cocked his gun .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 15]: The noise induced the stag to move his antlers , and discover his lair .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 28]: Edward could just perceive the eye of the animal through the heath ; he waited till the beast settled again , took steady aim , and fired .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 14]: At the report of the gun another stag sprung up and burst away .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 17]: Oswald fired and wounded it , but the animal made off , followed by the dogs .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 49]: Edward , who hardly knew whether he had missed or not , but felt almost certain that he had not , hastened out of the thicket to join in the chase ; and , as he passed through the fern patch , perceived that his quarry lay dead .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 26]: He then followed the chase , and , being very fleet of foot , soon came up with Oswald , and passed him without speaking .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 22]: The stag made for a swampy ground , and finally took to the water beyond it , and stood at bay .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 12]: Edward then waited for Oswald , who came up with him .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 21]: `` He has soiled , '' said Edward , `` and now you may go in and kill him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 30]: Oswald , eager in the chase , hastened up to where the dogs and stag were in the water , and put a bullet through the animal 's head .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 31]: Edward went to him , assisted him to drag the stag out of the water , and then Oswald cut its throat , and proceeded to perform the usual offices .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 10]: `` How did you happen to miss him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 11]: said Oswald , `` for these are my shots ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 29]: `` Because I never fired at him , '' said Edward ; `` my quarry lies dead in the fern -- and a fine fellow he is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 11]: `` This is a warrantable stag , '' said Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 20]: `` Yes , but mine is a hart royal , as you will see when we go back . ''
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 26]: As soon as Oswald had done his work , he hung the quarters of the animal on an oak-tree , and went back with Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 10]: `` Where did you hit him , Edward ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 8]: said Oswald , as they walked along .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 20]: `` I could only see his eye through the fern , and I must have hit him thereabouts . ''
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 22]: On their arrival at the spot Oswald found that Edward had put the ball right into the eye of the stag .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 37]: `` Well , '' said he , `` you made me suppose that you knew something of our craft , but I did not believe that you were so apt as you thought yourself to be .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 23]: I now confess that you are a master , as far as I can see , in all branches of the craft .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 9]: This is , indeed , a hart royal .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 7]: Twenty-five antlers , as I live !
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 28]: Come , out with your knife , and let us finish ; for if we are to go to the cottage we have no time to lose .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 10]: It will be dark in half an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 50]: They hung all the quarters of the stag as before , and then set off for Jacob 's cottage ; Edward proposing that Oswald should take the cart and pony to carry the meat home the next morning , and that he would accompany him to bring it back .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 31]: `` That will do capitally , '' said Oswald ; `` and here we are , if I recollect right , and I hope there is something to eat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 17]: `` No fear of that -- Alice will be prepared for us , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 13]: Their dinner was ready for them ; and Oswald praised the cooking .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 12]: He was much surprised to find that Jacob had four grandchildren .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 18]: After dinner he went into Jacob 's room , and remained with him more than an hour .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 31]: During this conference Jacob confided to Oswald that the four children were the sons and daughters of Colonel Beverley , supposed to have been burnt in the firing of Arnwood .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 22]: Oswald came out , much surprised as well as pleased with the information , and with the confidence reposed in him .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 42]: He saluted Edward and Humphrey respectfully , and said , `` I was not aware with whom I was in company , sir , as you may well imagine ; but the knowledge of it has made my heart glad . ''
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 29]: `` Nay , Oswald , '' replied Edward , `` remember that I am still Edward Armitage , and that we are the grandchildren of old Jacob . ''
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 26]: `` Certainly , sir , I will , for your own sake , not forget that such is to be supposed to be the case .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 28]: I assure you I think it very fortunate that Jacob has confided the secret to me , as it may be in my power to be useful .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 20]: I little thought that I should ever have had my dinner cooked by a daughter of Colonel Beverley . ''
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 33]: They then entered into a long conversation , during which Oswald expressed his opinion that the old man was sinking fast , and would not last more than three or four days .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 57]: Oswald had a bed made up for him on the floor of the room where Edward and Humphrey slept , and the next morning they set off , at an early hour , with the pony and cart , loaded it with the venison , and took it across the forest to the keeper 's lodge .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 24]: It was so late when they arrived that Edward consented to pass the night there , and return home on the following morning .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 25]: Oswald went into the sitting-room to speak with the Intendant of the forest , leaving Edward in the kitchen with Phoebe , the maidservant .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 20]: He told the Intendant that he had brought home some fine venison , and wished his orders about it .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 74]: He also stated that he had been assisted by Edward Armitage , who had brought the venison home for him in his cart , and who was now in the kitchen , as he would be obliged to pass the night there ; and , on being questioned , he was lavish in his praises of Edward 's skill and knowledge of woodcraft , which he declared to be superior to his own .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 23]: `` It proves that the young man has had much practice , at all events , '' replied Mr Heatherstone , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 25]: `` He has been living at the king 's expense , but he must not follow it up at the cost of the Parliament .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 42]: It would be well to take this young man as a ranger if we could ; for although he is opposed to us , yet , if he once took our service , he would be faithful , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 9]: You can propose it to him , Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 38]: The haunches of that hart royal must be sent up to General Cromwell to-morrow : the remainder we will give directions for as soon as I have made up my mind how to dispose of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 11]: Oswald left the room , and came back to Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 37]: `` General Cromwell is to have the haunches of your stag , '' said he to Edward , smiling ; `` and the Intendant proposes that you should take service as one of the rangers . ''
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 45]: `` I thank you , '' replied Edward , `` but I 've no fancy to find venison for General Cromwell and his Roundheads ; and so you may tell the Intendant , with many thanks for his good-will towards me , nevertheless . ''
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 17]: `` I thought as much ; but the man meant kindly , that I really think .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 18]: Now , Phoebe , what can you give us to eat , for we are hungry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 11]: `` You shall be served directly , '' replied Phoebe .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 10]: `` I have some steaks on the fire . ''
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 14]: `` And you must find a bed for my young friend here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 20]: `` I have none in the house , but there is plenty of good straw over the stables . ''
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 16]: `` That will do , '' replied Edward ; `` I 'm not particular . ''
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 5]: `` I suppose not .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 6]: Why should you be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 11]: replied Phoebe , who was rather old and rather cross .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 30]: `` If you mount the ladder that you will see against the wall , you will find a good bed when you are at the top of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 19]: Oswald was about to remonstrate , but Edward held up his finger , and no more was said .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 17]: As soon as they had finished their supper Phoebe proposed that they should go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 12]: It was late , and she would sit up no longer .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 44]: Edward rose and went out , followed by Oswald , who had given up the keeper 's house to the intendant and his daughter , and slept in the cottage of one of the rangers , about a quarter of a mile off .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 25]: After some conversation they shook hands and parted , as Edward intended returning very early the next morning , being anxious about old Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 9]: Edward went up the ladder into the loft .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 30]: There was no door to shut out the wind , which blew piercingly cold , and after a time he found himself so chilled that he could not sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 53]: He rose to see if he could not find some protection from the wind by getting more into a corner ; for although Phoebe had told him that there was plenty of straw , it proved that there was very little indeed in the loft , barely enough to lie down upon .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 27]: Edward , after a time , descended the ladder to walk in the yard , that by exercise he might recover the use of his limbs .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 32]: At last , turning to and fro , he cast his eyes up to the window of the bedroom above the kitchen , where he perceived a light was still burning .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 103]: He thought it was Phoebe , the maid , going to bed ; and with no very gracious feelings towards her for having deprived him of his own night 's rest , he was wishing that she might have the toothache or something else to keep her awake , when suddenly through the white window curtain he perceived a broad light in the room -- it increased every moment -- and he saw the figure of a female rush past it , and attempt to open the window -- the drawing of the curtains showed him that the room was on fire .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 27]: A moment 's thought , and he ran for the ladder by which he had ascended to the loft , and placed it against the window .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 26]: The flames were less bright , and he could not see the female who had been at the window when he went for the ladder .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 59]: He ascended quickly , and burst open the casement -- the smoke poured out in such volumes that it nearly suffocated him , but he went in ; and as soon as he was inside , he stumbled against the body of the person who had attempted to open the window , but who had fallen down senseless .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 59]: As he raised the body , the fire , which had been smothered from want of air when all the windows and doors were closed , now burst out , and he was scorched before he could get on the ladder again , with the body in his arms ; but he succeeded in getting it down safe .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 39]: Perceiving that the clothes were on fire , he held them till they were extinguished , and then , for the first time , discovered that he had brought down the daughter of the intendant of the forest .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 40]: There was no time to be lost , so Edward carried her into the stable and left her there , still insensible , upon the straw , in a spare stall ; while he hastened to alarm the house .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 37]: The watering-butt for the horses was outside the stable ; Edward caught up the pail , filled it , and hastening up the ladder , threw it into the room , and then descended for more .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 11]: By this time Edward 's continual calls of `` Fire !
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 3]: Fire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 15]: had aroused the people of the house , and also of the cottages adjacent .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 14]: Mr Heatherstone came out half dressed , and with horror on his countenance .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 14]: Phoebe followed screaming , and the other people now hastened from the cottages .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 4]: `` Save her !
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 8]: My daughter is in the room ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 4]: exclaimed Mr Heatherstone .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 13]: `` Oh , save her , or let me do so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 28]: cried the poor man in agony ; but the fire burst out of the window in such force , that any attempt would have been in vain .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 24]: `` Oswald , '' cried Edward to him , `` let the people pass the water up to me as fast as possible .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 10]: They can do no good by looking on . ''
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 24]: Oswald set the men to the work , and Edward was now supplied with water so fast that the fire began to diminish .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 31]: The window was now approachable , and a few more buckets enabled him to put one foot into the room , and then every moment the flames and smoke decreased .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 34]: Meanwhile it would be impossible to describe the agony of the intendant , who would have rushed up the ladder into the flames had he not been held by some of the men .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 4]: `` My daughter !
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 3]: My child !
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 8]: -- burnt -- burnt to death ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 7]: exclaimed he , clasping his hands .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 20]: At that moment a voice in the crowd called out , `` There were four burnt at Arnwood ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 6]: `` God of heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 21]: exclaimed Mr Heatherstone , falling down into a swoon , in which state he was carried to a neighbouring cottage .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 59]: Meanwhile the supply of water enabled Edward to put out the fire altogether ; the furniture of the room was burnt , but the fire had extended no farther ; and when Edward was satisfied that there was no more danger , he descended the ladder , and left it to others to see that all was safe .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 18]: He then called Oswald to him , and desired that he would accompany him to the stable .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 13]: `` Oh sir , '' replied Oswald , `` this is dreadful !
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 9]: And such a sweet young lady too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 19]: `` She is safe and well , '' replied Edward ; `` I think so , at least .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 21]: I brought her down the ladder and put her in the stable before I attempted to put out the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 15]: See , there she is ; she has not recovered yet from her swoon .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 4]: Bring some water .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 3]: She breathes !
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 3]: Thank God !
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 12]: There , that will do , Oswald , she is recovering .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 17]: Now let us cover her up in your cloak , and carry her to your cottage .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 7]: We will recover her there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 23]: Oswald folded up the still unconscious girl in his cloak , and carried her away in his arms , followed by Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 37]: As soon as they arrived at the cottage , the inmates of which were all busy at the keeper 's lodge , they put her on a bed , and very soon restored her to consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 7]: `` Where is my father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 11]: cried Patience , as soon as she was sufficiently recovered .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 13]: `` He is safe and well , miss , '' replied Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 8]: `` Is the house burnt down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 8]: The fire is all out again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 5]: `` Who saved me ?
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 4]: Tell me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 7]: `` Young Armitage , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 5]: `` Who is he ?
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 14]: Oh , I recollect now ; but I must go to my father .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 5]: Where is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 9]: `` In the other cottage , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 23]: Patience attempted to stand , but found that she was too much exhausted , and she fell back again on the bed .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 10]: `` I ca n't stand , '' said she .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 8]: `` Bring my father to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 10]: `` I will , miss , '' replied Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 9]: `` Will you stay here , Edward ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 17]: He went out of the cottage-door , and remained there while Oswald went to Mr Heatherstone .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 15]: Oswald found him sensible , but in deep distress , as may be imagined .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 13]: `` The fire is all out , sir , '' said Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 7]: `` I care not for that .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 7]: My poor , poor child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 12]: `` Your child is safe , sir , '' replied Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 8]: `` Safe , did you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 7]: cried Mr Heatherstone , starting up .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 6]: `` Safe ; where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 5]: `` In my cottage .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 8]: She has sent me for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 28]: Mr Heatherstone rushed out , passed by Edward , who was standing at the door of the other cottage , and was in his daughter 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 21]: Oswald came out to Edward , who then detailed to him the way in which he had saved the girl .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 35]: `` Had it not been for the ill-nature of that girl Phoebe , in sending me to sleep where there was no straw , they would all have been burnt , '' observed Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 16]: `` She gave you an opportunity of rewarding good for evil , '' observed Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 17]: `` Yes , but I am burnt very much in my arm , '' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 12]: `` Have you anything that will be good for it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 13]: `` Yes , I think I have : wait a moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 27]: Oswald went into the cottage and returned with some salve , with which he dressed Edward 's arm , which proved to be very severely burnt .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 19]: `` How grateful the Intendant ought to be -- and will be , I have no doubt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 3]: observed Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 37]: `` And for that very reason I shall saddle my pony and ride home as fast as I can ; and , do you hear , Oswald , do not show him where I live . ''
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 16]: `` I hardly know how I can refuse him , if he requires it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 6]: `` But you must not .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 25]: He will be offering me a situation in the forest , by way of showing his gratitude ; and I will accept of none .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 44]: I have no objection to save his daughter , as I would save the daughter of my worst enemy , or my worst enemy himself , from such a dreadful death ; but I do not want their thanks or offers of service .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 33]: I will accept nothing from a Roundhead ; and as for the venison in the forest , it belongs to the king , and I shall help myself whenever I think proper .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 16]: Good-bye , Oswald , you will call and see us when you have time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 20]: `` I will be with you before the week is out , depend upon it , '' replied Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 35]: Edward then asked Oswald to saddle his pony for him , as his arm prevented him from doing it himself , and as soon as it was done he rode away for the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 31]: Edward rode fast , for he was anxious to get home and ascertain the state of poor old Jacob ; and , moreover , his burnt arm was very painful .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 39]: He was met by Humphrey about a mile from the cottage , who told him that he did not think that the old man could last many hours , and that he was very anxious to see him .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 34]: As the pony was quite tired with the fast pace that Edward had ridden , Edward pulled up to a walk , and as they went along acquainted Humphrey with what had passed .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 8]: `` Is your arm very painful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 20]: `` Yes , it is indeed , '' replied Edward ; `` but it ca n't be helped . ''
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 15]: `` No , of course not , but it may be made more easy .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 34]: I know what will do it some good ; for I recollect when Benjamin burnt his hand at Arnwood , what they applied to it , and it gave him great relief . ''
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 22]: `` Yes , very likely ; but I am not aware that we have any drugs or medicine in the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 22]: But here we are : will you take Billy to the stable , while I go on to old Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 44]: `` Thank God that you are come , Edward , '' said the old forester , `` for I was anxious to see you before I die ; and something tells me that I have but a short time to remain here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 7]: `` Why should you say so !
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 8]: -- do you feel very ill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 15]: `` No , not ill ; but I feel that I am sinking fast .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 11]: Recollect that I am an old man , Edward . ''
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 21]: `` Not so very old , Jacob ; Oswald said that you were not more than sixty years old . ''
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 7]: `` Oswald knows nothing about it .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 36]: I am past seventy six , Edward ; and you know , Edward , the Bible says that the days of men are threescore years and ten ; so that I am beyond the mark .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 13]: And now , Edward , I have but few words to say .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 18]: Be careful -- if not for your own sake , at least for your little sisters ' .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 23]: You are young , but you are strong and powerful above your years , and can better protect them than I could .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 22]: I see darker days yet coming -- but it is His will , and who shall doubt that that is right ?
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 57]: I pray you not to make your birth and lineage known as yet -- it can do no good , and it may do harm -- and if you can be persuaded to live in the cottage , and to live on the farm , which will now support you all , it will be better .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 17]: Do not get into trouble about the venison , which they now claim as their own .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 40]: You will find some money in the bag in my chest , sufficient to buy all you want for a long while -- but take care of it ; for there is no saying but you may require it .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 20]: And now , Edward , call your brother and sisters to me , that I may bid them farewell .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 22]: I am , as we all are , sinful , but I trust in the mercy of God through Jesus Christ .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 55]: Edward , I have done my duty towards you , as well as I have been able ; but promise me one thing -- that you will read the Bible and prayers every morning and evening , as I have always done , after I am gone ; promise me that , Edward . ''
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 27]: `` I promise you that it shall be done , Jacob , '' replied Edward , `` and I will not forget your other advice . ''
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 7]: `` God bless you , Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 6]: Now call the children . ''
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 7]: Edward summoned his sisters and Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 35]: `` Humphrey , my good boy , '' said Jacob , `` recollect that in the midst of life we are in death ; and that there is no security for young or old .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 22]: You or your brother may be cut off in your youth ; one may be taken , and the other left .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 38]: Recollect , your sisters depend upon you , and do not therefore be rash : I fear that you will run too much risk after the wild cattle , for you are always scheming after taking them .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 12]: Be careful , Humphrey , for you can ill be spared .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 15]: Hold to the farm as it now is ; it will support you all .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 23]: My dear Alice and Edith , I am dying ; very soon I shall be laid by your brothers in my grave .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 13]: Be good children , and look up to your brothers for everything .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 33]: And now , kiss me , Alice : you have been a great comfort to me , for you have read the Bible to me when I could no longer read myself .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 26]: May your deathbed be as well attended as mine has been , and may you live happily , and die the death of a Christian !
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 8]: Good-bye , and may God bless you .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 19]: Bless you , Edith ; may you grow up as good and as innocent as you are now .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 19]: Farewell , Humphrey -- farewell , Edward -- my eyes are dim -- pray for me , children .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 19]: O God of mercy -- pardon my many sins , and receive my soul , through Jesus Christ .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 5]: Amen , amen . ''
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 11]: These were the last words spoken by the old forester .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 30]: The children , who were kneeling by the side of the bed , praying as he had requested , when they rose up , found that he was dead .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 14]: They all wept bitterly , for they dearly loved the good old man .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 25]: Alice remained sobbing in Edward 's arms , and Edith in Humphrey 's , and it was long before the brothers could console them .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 24]: Humphrey at last said to Alice , `` You hurt poor Edward 's arm -- you do n't know how painful it is !
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 22]: Come , dears , let us go into the other room , and get something to take the pain away . ''
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 26]: These requests diverted the attention at the same time that it roused fresh sympathy in the little girls -- they all went into the sitting-room .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 29]: Humphrey gave his sisters some potatoes to scrape upon a piece of linen , while he took off Edward 's coat , and turned up his shirt sleeves .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 19]: The scraped potatoes were then laid on the burn , and Edward said they gave him great relief .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 21]: Some more were then scraped by the little girls , who could not , however , repress their occasional sobs .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 21]: Humphrey then told them that Edward had had nothing to eat , and that they must get him some supper .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 22]: This again occupied them for some time ; and when the supper was ready , they all sat down to it .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 40]: They went to bed early , but not before Edward had read a chapter out of the Bible , and the prayers , as old Jacob had always done ; and this again caused their tears to flow afresh .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 18]: `` Come , Alice dear , you and Edith must go to bed , '' said Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 36]: The little girls threw themselves into their brothers ' arms ; and having wept for some time , Alice raised herself , and taking Edith by the hand , led her away to the bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 3]: CHAPTER TEN .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 17]: `` Humphrey , '' said Edward , `` the sooner all this is over the better .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 23]: As long as poor Jacob 's body remains in the cottage there will be nothing but distress with the poor girls . ''
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 18]: `` I agree with you , '' replied Humphrey ; `` where shall we bury him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 17]: `` Under the great oak-tree , at the back of the cottage , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 26]: `` One day the old man said to me that he should like to be buried under one of the oaks of the forest . ''
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 33]: `` Well then , I will go and dig his grave to-night , '' replied Humphrey ; `` the moon is bright , and I shall have it finished before morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 14]: `` I am sorry that I can not help you , Humphrey . ''
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 17]: `` I am sorry that you are hurt ; but I want no help , Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 16]: If you will lie down a little , perhaps you will be able to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 12]: Let us change the potato poultice before you go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 28]: Humphrey put the fresh dressing on Edward 's arm ; and Edward , who was very much exhausted , lay down in his clothes on the bed .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 25]: Humphrey went out , and having found his tools , set to his task ; he worked hard , and before morning had finished .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 25]: He then went in , and took his place on the bed by the side of Edward , who was in a sound sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 9]: At daylight Humphrey rose , and waked Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 29]: `` All is ready , Edward ; but I fear you must help me to put poor Jacob in the cart ; do you think you can ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 22]: `` Oh yes ; my arm is much easier , and I feel very different from what I did last night .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 20]: If you will go and get the cart I will see what I can do in the meantime . ''
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 28]: When Humphrey returned he found Edward had selected a sheet to wind the body in , but could not do more till Humphrey came to help him .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 23]: They then wrapped it round the body , and carried it out of the cottage , and put it into the cart .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 12]: `` Now , Edward , shall we call our sisters ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 25]: `` No , not yet ; let us have the body laid in the grave first , and then we will call them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 30]: They dragged the body on the cart to the grave , and laid it in it , and then returned back and put the pony in the stable again .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 13]: `` Are there not prayers proper for reading over the dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 3]: said Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 29]: `` I believe that there are , but they are not in the Bible ; so we must read some portion of the Bible , '' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 58]: `` Yes , I think there is one of the Psalms which it would be right to read , Edward , '' said Humphrey , turning over the leaves ; `` here it is , the ninetieth , in which you recollect it says ` that the days of man are threescore years and ten . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 21]: `` Yes , '' replied Edward , `` and we will read this one also , -- the 146th . ''
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 11]: `` Are our sisters risen , do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 21]: `` I am sure that they are , '' replied Humphrey , `` and I will go to them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 21]: Humphrey went to the door , and said , `` Alice -- Alice and Edith -- come out immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 6]: They were both ready dressed .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 14]: Edward took the Bible under his arm , and Alice by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 25]: Humphrey led Edith until they arrived at the grave , when the two little girls saw the covered body of Jacob lying in it .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 12]: `` Kneel down , '' said Edward , opening the Bible .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 9]: And they all knelt down by the grave .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 12]: Edward read the two Psalms , and then closed the book .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 20]: The little girls took one last look at the body , and then turned away weeping to the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 15]: Edward and Humphrey filled up the grave , and then followed their sisters home .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 16]: `` I 'm glad it 's over , '' said Humphrey , wiping his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 5]: `` Poor old Jacob !
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 10]: I 'll put a paling round his grave . ''
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 10]: `` Come in , Humphrey , '' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 17]: Edward sat down upon old Jacob 's chair , and took Alice and Edith to him .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 38]: Putting his arm round each , he said : `` Alice and Edith , my dear little sisters , we have lost a good friend , and one to whose memory we can not be too grateful .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 24]: He saved us from perishing in the flames which burnt down our father 's house , and has protected us here ever since .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 48]: He is gone ; for it has pleased God to summon him to Him , and we must bow to the will of Heaven ; and here we are , brothers and sisters , orphans , and with no one to look to for protection but Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 17]: Here we are , away from the rest of the world , living for one another .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 6]: What then must we do ?
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 12]: We must love one another dearly , and help one another .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 26]: I will do my part , if my life is spared , and so will Humphrey , and so will you , my dear sisters .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 6]: I can answer for all .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 49]: Now it is no use to lament -- we must all work , and work cheerfully ; and we will pray every morning and every night that God will bless our endeavours , and enable us to provide for ourselves , and live here in peace and safety .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 17]: Kiss me , dear Alice and Edith , and kiss Humphrey , and kiss one another .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 30]: Let these kisses be the seals to our bond ; and let us put our trust in Him who only is a father to the widow and the orphan .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 7]: And now let us pray . ''
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 15]: Edward and the children repeated the Lord 's Prayer , and then rose up .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 39]: They went to their respective employments , and the labour of the day soon made them composed , although then , for many days afterwards , it was but occasionally that a smile was seen upon their lips .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 36]: Thus passed a week , by which time Edward 's arm was so far well that it gave him no pain , and he was able to assist Humphrey in the work on the farm .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 23]: The snow had disappeared , and the spring , although it had been checked for a time , now made rapid advances .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 59]: Constant occupation and the return of fine weather both had the effect of restoring the serenity of their minds ; and while Humphrey was preparing the paling to fix round the grave of old Jacob , Alice and Edith collected the wild violets which now peeped forth on sheltered spots , and planted the roots over the grave .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 61]: Edward also procured all the early flowers he could collect , and assisted his sisters in their task ; and thus , in planting it , and putting up the paling , the grave of the old man became their constant work-ground ; and when their labour was done , they would still remain there and talk over his worth .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 84]: The Sunday following the burial , the weather being fine and warm , Edward proposed that they should read the usual service , which had been selected by old Jacob , at the grave , and not in the cottage , as formerly ; and this they continued afterwards to do , whenever the weather would permit ; thus did old Jacob 's resting-placing become their church , and overpower them with those feelings of love and devotion which give efficacy to prayer .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 29]: As soon as the paling was finished Humphrey put up a board against the oak-tree , with the simple words carved on it , `` Jacob Armitage . ''
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 40]: Edward had every day expected that Oswald Partridge would have called upon him , as he had promised to do before the week was out ; but Oswald had not made his appearance , much to Edward 's surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 19]: A month passed away ; Edward 's arm was now quite well , and still Oswald came not .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 55]: One morning Humphrey and Edward were conversing upon many points -- the principal of which was upon Edward going to Lymington , for they were now in want of flour and meal -- when Edward thought of what old Jacob had told him relative to the money that he would find in his chest .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 60]: He went into Jacob 's room and opened the chest , at the bottom of which , under the clothes , he found a leather bag , which he brought out to Humphrey ; on opening it , they were much surprised to find in it more than sixty gold pieces , besides a great deal of silver coin .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 14]: `` Surely this is a great sum of money , '' observed Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 27]: `` I do n't know what is the price of things but it appears to me that it ought to last us a long while . ''
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 10]: `` I think so too , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 17]: `` I wish Oswald Partridge would come , for I want to ask him many questions .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 28]: I do n't know the price of flour or anything else we have to purchase , nor do I know what ought to be paid for venison .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 17]: I do n't like to go to Lymington till I see him , for that reason .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 18]: If he does not come soon I shall ride over and see what is the matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 26]: Edward then replaced the money in the chest , and he and Humphrey then went out to the farm-yard to go on with their work .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 19]: It was not until six weeks after the death of old Jacob that Oswald Partridge made his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 10]: `` How is the old man , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 5]: was his first question .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 15]: `` He was buried a few days after you left , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 11]: `` I expected as much , '' said the forester .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 12]: `` Peace be with him -- he was a good man .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 7]: And how is your arm ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 8]: `` Nearly well , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 38]: `` Now , sit down , Oswald , for I have a great deal to say to you ; and first let me ask you what has detained you from coming here according to your promise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 11]: `` Simply , and in few words -- murder . ''
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 4]: `` Murder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 3]: exclaimed Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 25]: `` Yes , deliberate murder , sir ; in short , they have beheaded the king -- beheaded King Charles , our sovereign . ''
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 9]: `` Have they dared to do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 8]: `` They have , '' replied Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 34]: `` We know little that is going on in the forest ; but when I saw you last I heard that he was then in London , and was to be tried . ''
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 4]: `` Tried ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 3]: exclaimed Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 8]: `` How could they try a king ?
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 22]: By the laws of our country a man must be tried by his equals ; and where were his equals ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 21]: `` Majesty becomes nought , I suppose , '' replied Oswald ; `` but still it is as I say .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 43]: Two days after you left the Intendant hastened up to London ; and from what I have understood , he was strongly opposed to the deed , and did all he could to prevent it , but it was of no use .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 57]: When he left he gave me strict injunctions not to go away from the cottage for an hour , as his daughter was left alone , and as I promised , I could not come to you ; but , nevertheless , Patience received letters from him , and told me what I tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 9]: `` You have not dined , Oswald ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 3]: said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 9]: `` No , that I have not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 12]: `` Alice , dear , get some dinner , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 17]: And Oswald , while you dine , excuse me if I leave you for a while .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 30]: Your intelligence has so astounded me that I can listen to nothing else till I have had a little while to commune with myself and subdue my feelings . ''
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 13]: Edward was indeed in a state of mind which required calming down .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 17]: He quitted the cottage and walked out for some distance into the forest in deep thought .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 6]: `` Murdered at last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 3]: exclaimed he .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 30]: `` Yes , well may it be called murder , and no one to save him -- not a blow struck in his defence -- not an arm raised .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 10]: How much gallant blood has been shed in vain !
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 18]: Spirit of my fathers -- didst thou leave none of thy mettle and thy honour behind thee ?
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 7]: Or has all England become craven ?
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 34]: Well , the time will come ; and if I can no longer hope to fight for my king , at all events I can fight against those who have murdered him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 58]: Such were Edward 's thoughts as he wandered through the forest , and more than an hour elapsed before his impetuous blood could return to its usual flow ; at last , more calm , he returned to the cottage , and listened to the details which Oswald now gave to him of what he had heard .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 14]: When Oswald had finished , Edward asked him whether the Intendant had returned .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 15]: `` Yes , or I should not have been here , '' replied Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 25]: `` He came back yesterday , looking most disconsolate and grave , and I hear that he returns to London in a few days .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 20]: Indeed , he told me so himself , for I requested permission to come over to see your grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 20]: He said that I might go , but must return soon , as he must go back to London .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 64]: I believe , from what Miss Patience told me , and what I have seen myself , that he is sincerely amazed and vexed at what has taken place ; and so indeed are many more , who , although opposed to the king 's method of government , never had an idea that things should have turned out as they have done .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 35]: I have a message from him to you , which is , that he begs you will come to see him , that he may thank you for the preservation of his child . ''
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 26]: `` I will take his thanks from you , Oswald : that will do as well as if he gave them me in person . ''
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 23]: `` Yes , perhaps so ; but I have another message from another party , which is , the young lady herself .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 53]: She desires me to tell you that she will never be happy till she has seen you , and thanked you for your courage and kindness ; and that you have no right to put her under such an obligation , and not give her an opportunity of expressing what she feels .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 30]: Now , Mr Edward , I am certain that she is earnest in what she says , and she made me promise that I would persuade you to come .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 50]: I could not refuse her , for she is a dear little creature ; as her father will go to London in a few days , you may ride over and see her without any fear of being affronted by any offers which he may make to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 42]: `` Well , '' replied Edward , `` I have no great objection to see her again , for she was very kind to me ; and as you say that the Intendant will not be there I perhaps may come .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 12]: But now I must talk to you about other matters . ''
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 26]: Edward then put many questions to Oswald relative to the value of various articles , and to the best method of disposing of his venison .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 16]: Oswald answered all his questions , and Edward took down notes and directions on paper .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 34]: Oswald remained with them for two days , and then bade them farewell , exacting a promise from Edward that he would come to the ranger 's cottage as soon as he could .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 43]: `` Should the Intendant come back before he is expected , I will come over and let you know ; but I think , from what I heard him say , he expected to be at least a month in London . ''
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 21]: Edward promised that Oswald should see him in less than ten days , and Oswald set out on his journey .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 27]: `` Humphrey , '' said Edward , as soon as Oswald was gone , `` I have made up my mind to go to Lymington to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 22]: We must have some flour , and many other articles , which Alice says she can no longer do without . ''
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 11]: `` Why should we not both go , Edward ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 3]: replied Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 11]: `` No , not this time , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 33]: `` I have to find out many things and many people , and I had rather go by myself ; besides , I can not allow my sisters to be left alone .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 19]: I do not consider there is any danger , I admit ; but something might happen to them .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 6]: I should never forgive myself .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 31]: Still , it is necessary that you should go to Lymington with me some time or another , that you may know where to purchase and sell , if required .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 20]: What I propose is , that I will ask Oswald to come and stay here a couple of days .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 18]: We will then leave him in charge of our sisters , and go to Lymington together . ''
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 15]: `` You are right , Edward ; that will be the best plan . ''
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 11]: As Humphrey made this remark , Oswald re-entered the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 17]: `` I will tell you why I have returned , Mr Edward , '' said Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 13]: `` It is of no consequence whether I return now or to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 25]: It is now early , and as you intend going to Lymington , it occurred to me that I had better go with you .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 20]: I can then show you all you want , which will be much better than going by yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 17]: `` Thank you , Oswald , I am much obliged to you , '' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 17]: `` Humphrey , we will get the cart out immediately , or we shall be late .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 7]: Will you get it , Humphrey ?
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 14]: For I must go for some money , and speak to Alice . ''
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 61]: Humphrey went immediately to put the pony in the cart , when Edward said : `` Oswald , you must not call me Mr Edward , even when we are alone ; if you do , you will be calling me so before other people , and , therefore , recollect in future , it must be plain Edward . ''
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 33]: `` Since you wish it , certainly , '' replied Oswald ; `` indeed it would be better ; for a slip of the tongue before other people might create suspicion . ''
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 29]: The pony and cart were soon at the door , and Edward , having received further instructions from Alice , set off for Lymington , accompanied by Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 3]: CHAPTER ELEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 11]: `` Could you have found your way to Lymington ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 9]: said Oswald , as the pony trotted along .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 21]: `` Yes , I think so , '' replied Edward ; `` but I must have first gone to Arnwood .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 23]: Indeed , had I been alone , I should have done so ; but we have made a much shorter cut . ''
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 22]: `` I did not think that you would have liked to have seen the ruins of Arnwood , '' replied Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 15]: `` Not a day passes without my thinking of them , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 8]: `` I should like to see them .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 23]: I should like to see if any one has taken possession of the property ; for they say it is confiscated . ''
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 32]: `` I heard that it was to be ; but not that it was yet , '' said Oswald : `` but we shall know more when we get to Lymington .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 11]: I have not seen it for more than a year .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 11]: I hardly think that any one will recognise you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 14]: `` I should think not ; but I care little if they do .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 10]: Indeed , who is there to know me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 30]: `` Well , my introduction of you will save some surmises , probably ; and I shall not take you among those who may be inclined to ask questions .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 21]: See , there is the steeple ; we have not more than a quarter of an hour 's drive . ''
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 26]: As soon as they arrived at Lymington , Oswald directed the way to a small hostelrie , to which the keepers and verderers usually resorted .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 22]: In fact , the landlord was the party who took all the venison off their hands , and disposed of it .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 41]: They drove into the yard , and , giving the pony and cart in charge of the hostler , went into the inn , where they found the landlord , and one or two other people , who were drinking .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 11]: `` Well , Master Andrew , how fare you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 3]: said Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 41]: `` Let me see , '' said the corpulent landlord , throwing back his head , and putting out his stomach , as he peered at Oswald ; `` why , Oswald Partridge , as I am a born man .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 10]: Where have you been this many a day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 18]: `` In the forest , Master Andrew , where there are no few chops and changes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 25]: `` Yes , I heard you have a sort of Parliamentary keeper , I 'm told ; and who is this with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 19]: `` The grandson of an old friend of yours , now dead , poor old Jacob Armitage . ''
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 7]: `` Jacob dead , poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 15]: As true as flint was Jacob Armitage , as I 'm a born man !
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 6]: And so he is dead !
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 9]: Well , we all owe heaven a death .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 14]: Foresters and landlords , as well as kings , all must die ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 17]: `` I have brought Edward Armitage over here to introduce him to you , Master Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 18]: Now that the old man is dead , you must look to him for forest meat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 12]: `` Oh , well , well , it is scarce now .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 9]: I have not had any for some time .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 7]: Old Jacob brought me the last .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 15]: You are not one of the Parliamentary foresters , then , I presume ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 8]: continued the landlord , turning to Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 16]: `` No , '' replied Edward , `` I kill no venison for Roundheads . ''
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 11]: `` Right , my sapling ; right and well said .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 26]: The Armitages were all good men and true , and followed the fortunes of the Beverleys ; but there are no Beverleys to follow now .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 11]: Cut off root and branch -- more 's the pity .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 6]: That was a sad business .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 31]: But come in ; we must not talk here , for walls have ears , they say , and one never knows who one dares to speak before now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 81]: Oswald and Edward then entered with the landlord , and arrangements were made between Master Andrew and the latter for a regular supply of venison during the season at a certain price ; but as it would now be dangerous to bring it into the town , it was agreed that when there was any ready , Edward should come to Lymington and give notice , and the landlord would send out people to bring it in during the night .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 24]: This bargain concluded , they took a glass with the landlord , and then went into the town to make the necessary purchases .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 46]: Oswald took Edward to all the shops where the articles he required were to be purchased ; some they carried away with them ; others , which were too heavy , they left , to be called for with the cart as they went away .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 24]: Among other articles , Edward required powder and lead , and they went to a gunsmith 's where it was to be procured .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 27]: While making his purchases , Edward perceived a sword , which he thought he had seen before , hanging up against the wall among other weapons .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 7]: `` What sword is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 12]: said he to the man who was measuring out the powder .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 30]: `` It 's not my sword , exactly , '' replied the man ; `` and yet I can not return it to its owner or to the family .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 31]: It was brought me to be cleaned by one of Colonel Beverley 's people , and before it was called for the house was burnt , and every soul perished .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 25]: It was one of the colonel 's swords , I am sure , as there is E.B. on a silver plate engraved on it .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 43]: I have a bill owing me for work done at Arnwood , and I have no chance of its being paid now ; so , whether I am to sell the sword , or what to do , I hardly know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 63]: Edward remained silent for some little while , for he could not trust himself to speak ; at last he replied : `` To be candid with you , I am , and all my family have been , followers of the Beverley family , and I should be sorry if the colonel 's sword was to fall into any other hands .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 52]: I think , therefore , if I pay the bill which is due , you may safely let me hold the sword as a security for the money , with the express understanding that if it is ever claimed by the Beverley family , I am to give it up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 18]: `` Certainly , '' said Oswald ; `` nothing can be fairer or more clearly put . ''
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 15]: `` I think so , too , young man , '' replied the shopkeeper .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 13]: `` Of course , you will leave your name and address ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 18]: `` Yes ; and my friend here will vouch for its being correct , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 29]: The shopkeeper then produced the account , which Edward paid ; and giving on the paper the name of Edward Armitage , he took possession of the sword .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 30]: He then paid for the powder and lead , which Oswald took charge of , and , hardly able to conceal his joy , hastened out of the shop .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 19]: `` Oswald , '' cried Edward , `` I would not part with it for thousands of pounds .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 12]: I never will part with it but with my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 40]: `` I believe so , '' replied Oswald ; `` and I believe more , that it will never be disgraced in your hands ; but do not talk so loud , for there are listeners and spies everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 9]: Is there anything else that you require ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 21]: `` No , I think not ; the fact is that this sword has put everything out of my head .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 10]: If there was anything else I have forgotten it .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 24]: Let us go back to the inn , and we will harness the pony , and call for the flour and oatmeal . ''
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 49]: When they arrived at the inn , Oswald went out to the yard to get the cart ready , while Edward went into the landlord 's room to make inquiries as to the quantity of venison he would be able to take off his hands at a time .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 38]: Oswald had taken the sword from Edward , and had put it in the cart while he was fastening the harness , when a man came up to the cart , and looked earnestly at the sword .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 26]: He then examined it , and said to Oswald : `` Why , that was Colonel Beverley 's , my old master 's , sword .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 6]: I knowed it again directly .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 14]: I took it to Phillips , the gunmaker , to be cleaned . ''
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 13]: replied Oswald ; `` I pray what may be your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 31]: `` Benjamin White , '' replied the man ; `` I served at Arnwood till the night it was burned down ; and I have been here ever since . ''
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 9]: `` And what are you doing now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 21]: `` I 'm tapster at the ` Commonwealth , ' in Fish Street -- not much of a place . ''
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 31]: `` Well , well , you stand by the pony , and look that nobody takes anything out of the cart , while I go in for some parcels . ''
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 24]: `` Yes , to be sure I will ; but , I say , forester , how came you by that sword ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 15]: `` I will tell you when I come out again , '' replied Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 14]: Oswald then went in to Edward , and told him what had occurred .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 26]: `` He will certainly know you , sir , and you must not come out till I can get him away , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 47]: `` You are right , Oswald ; but before he goes , ask him what became of my aunt , and where she was buried , and also ask him where the other servants are -- perhaps they are at Lymington as well as he . ''
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 26]: `` I will find it all out , '' replied Oswald , who then left Edward , and returned to the landlord and recommenced conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 27]: Oswald , on his return , told Benjamin in what manner the sword had been procured from the shopman , by the grandson of old Armitage .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 25]: `` I never knew that he had one , '' replied Benjamin ; `` nor did I know that old Jacob was dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 13]: `` What became of all the women who were at Arnwood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 3]: inquired Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 17]: `` Why , Agatha married one of the troopers , and went away to London . ''
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 6]: `` And the others ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 28]: `` Why , cook went home to her friends , who live about ten miles from here , and I have never heard of her since . ''
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 12]: `` But there were three of them , '' said Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 16]: `` Oh yes ; there was Phoebe , '' replied Benjamin , looking rather confused .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 9]: `` She married a trooper -- the jilt !
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 10]: -- and went off to London when Agatha did .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 47]: If I 'd have thought that she would have done so I would not have carried her away from Arnwood behind me on a pillion , as I did ; she might have been burnt with the poor children , for all as I cared . ''
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 9]: `` Was not the old lady killed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 19]: `` Yes ; that is to say , she killed herself , rather than not kill Southwold . ''
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 7]: `` Where was she buried ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 35]: `` In the churchyard , at Saint Faith 's , by the mayor and corporation ; for there was not money enough found upon her person to pay the expenses of her burial . ''
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 12]: `` And so you are tapster at the ` Commonwealth . '
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 7]: Is it a good inn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 8]: `` Ca n't say much for it .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 16]: I sha n't stay longer than I can help , I can tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 24]: `` Well , but you must have an easy place , if you can stay away so long as you do now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 11]: `` Wo n't I be mobbed when I go back !
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 18]: But that 's always the case , make haste or not , so it 's all one .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 55]: However , I do think I must be a-going now , so good-bye , Mr Forester ; and tell Jacob Armitage 's grandson that I shall be glad to see him , for old Jacob 's sake ; and it 's hard but I 'll find him something to drink when he calls . ''
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 41]: `` I will : I shall see him to-morrow , '' replied Oswald , getting into the cart ; `` so good-bye , Benjamin , '' much to the satisfaction of Oswald , who thought that he would never go .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 25]: They went away at a rapid pace , to make up for lost time , and soon disappeared round the corner of the street .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 27]: Oswald then got out again , summoned Edward , and having called for the flour and other heavy articles , they set off on their return .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 29]: During the drive Oswald made known to Edward the information which he had gained from Benjamin , and at a late hour they arrived safely at the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 58]: They staid up but a short time , as they were tired ; and Oswald had resolved upon setting off before daylight on the following morning , which he did without disturbing any one ; for Humphrey was up and dressed as soon as Oswald was , and gave him something to eat as he went along .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 7]: All the others remained fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 44]: Humphrey walked about a mile with Oswald , and was returning to the farm , when he thought , as he had not examined his pit-fall for many days , that he might as well look at it , before he went back .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 22]: He therefore struck in the direction in which it lay , and arrived there just as the day began to dawn .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 16]: It was the end of March , and the weather was mild for the season .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 36]: Humphrey arrived at the pit , and it was sufficiently light for him to perceive that the covering had been broken in , and therefore , in all probability , something must have been trapped .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 25]: He sat down and waited for daylight , but at times he thought he heard a heavy breathing , and once a low groan .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 44]: This made him more anxious , and he again and again peered into the pit , but could not for a long while discover anything , until at last he thought that he could make out a human figure lying at the bottom .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 12]: Humphrey called out , asking if there was any one there .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 34]: A groan was the reply , and now Humphrey was horrified at the idea that somebody had fallen into the pit , and had perished , or was perishing for want of succour .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 44]: Recollecting that the rough ladder which he had made to take the soil up out of the pit was against an oak-tree , close at hand , he ran for it , and put it down the pit , and then cautiously descended .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 27]: On his arrival at the bottom , his fears were found to be verified , for he found the body of a lad half-clothed lying there .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 41]: He turned it up , as it was lying with its face to the ground , and attempted to remove it and to ascertain if there was life in it , which he was delighted to find was the case .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 11]: The lad groaned several times , and opened his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 62]: Humphrey was afraid that he was not strong enough to lift it on his shoulders and carry it up the ladder ; but on making the attempt , he found out , from exhaustion , the poor lad was light enough for him to carry him , which he did , and safely landed him by the side of the pit .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 29]: Recollecting that the watering-place of the herd of cattle was not far off , Humphrey then hastened to it , and filled his hat half full of water .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 21]: The lad , although he could not speak , drank eagerly , and in a few minutes appeared much recovered .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 13]: Humphrey gave him some more , and bathed his face and temples .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 12]: The sun had now risen , and it was broad daylight .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 33]: The lad attempted to speak , but what he did say was in so low a tone , and evidently in a foreign language , that Humphrey could not make him out .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 93]: He therefore made signs to the lad that he was going away , and would be back soon ; and having , as he thought , made the lad comprehend this , Humphrey ran away to the cottage as fast as he could ; and as soon as he arrived he called for Edward , who came out , and when Humphrey told him in few words what had happened , Edward went into the cottage again for some milk and some cake , while Humphrey put the pony into the cart .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 29]: In a few moments they were off again , and soon arrived at the pit-fall , where they found the lad still lying where Humphrey had left him .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 42]: They soaked the cake in the milk , and , as soon as it was soft , gave him some ; after a time he swallowed pretty freely , and was so much recovered as to be able to sit up .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 16]: They then lifted him into the cart , and drove gently home to their cottage .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 11]: `` What do you think he is , Edward ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 3]: said Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 14]: `` Some poor beggar lad , who has been crossing the forest . ''
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 53]: `` No , not exactly ; he appears to me to be one of the Zingaros or gipsies , as they call them : he is very dark , and has black eyes and white teeth , just like those I saw once near Arnwood , when I was out with Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 39]: Jacob said that no one knew where they came from , but that they were all over the country , and that they were great thieves , and told fortunes , and played all manner of tricks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 18]: `` Perhaps it may be so ; I do not think that he can speak English . ''
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 17]: `` I am most thankful to Heaven that I chanced this morning to visit the pit-fall .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 13]: Only suppose that I had found the poor boy starved and dead !
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 34]: I should have been very unhappy , and never should have had any pleasure in looking at the cows , as they would always have reminded me of such a melancholy accident . ''
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 27]: `` Very true , Humphrey ; but you have been saved that misfortune , and ought to be grateful to Heaven that such is the case .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 12]: What shall we do with him now we have him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 24]: `` Why , if he chooses to remain with us , he will be very useful in the cow-yard , '' said Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 38]: `` Of course , '' replied Edward , laughing , `` as he was taken in the pit-fall , he must go into the yard with all he others who were captured in the same way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 37]: `` Well , Edward , let us get him all right again first , and then we will see what is to be done with him ; perhaps he will refuse to remain with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 40]: As soon as they arrived at the cottage they lifted the lad out of the cart , and carried him into Jacob 's room , and laid him on the bed , for he was too weak to stand .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 32]: Alice and Edith , who were much surprised at the new visitor , and the way in which he had been caught , hastened to get some gruel ready for him .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 31]: As soon as it was ready they gave it to the boy , who then fell back on the bed with exhaustion , and was soon in a sound sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 25]: He slept soundly all that night ; and the next morning , when he awoke , he appeared much better , although very hungry .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 20]: This last complaint was easy to remedy , and then the lad got up and walked into the sitting-room .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 7]: `` What 's your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 6]: said Humphrey to the lad .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 8]: `` Pablo , '' replied the lad .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 7]: `` Can you speak English ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 9]: `` Yes , little , '' replied he .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 12]: `` How did you happen to fall into the pit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 6]: `` Not see hole . ''
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 7]: `` Are you a gipsy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 9]: `` Yes , Gitano -- same thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 25]: Humphrey put a great many more questions to the lad , and elicited from him , in his imperfect English , the following particulars .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 37]: That he was in company with several others of his race , going down to the sea-coast on one of their usual migrations , and that they had pitched their tents not far from the pit-fall .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 34]: That during the night he had gone out to set some snares for rabbits , and going back to the tents , it being quite dark , he had fallen into the hole .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 18]: That he had remained there three days and nights , having in vain attempted to get out .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 19]: His mother was with the party of gipsies to which he belonged ; but he had no father .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 26]: He did not know where to follow the gang , as they had not said where they were going , farther than to the sea-coast .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 27]: That it was no use looking for them ; and that he did not care much about leaving them , as he was very unkindly treated .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 70]: In reply to the question as to whether he would like to remain with them , and work with them on the farm , he replied that he should like it very much if they would be kind to him , and not make him work too hard ; that he would cook the dinner , and catch them rabbits and birds , and make a great many things .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 17]: `` Will you be honest , if we keep you , and not tell lies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 3]: said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 16]: The lad thought a little while , and then nodded his head in the affirmative .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 56]: `` Well , Pablo , we will try you , and if you are a good lad , we will do all we can to make you happy , '' said Edward ; `` but if you behave ill , we shall be obliged to turn you out of doors ; do you understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 21]: `` Be as good as I can , '' replied Pablo ; and here the conversation ended for the present .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 69]: Pablo was a very short-built lad , of apparently fifteen or sixteen years of age , very dark in complexion , but very handsome in features , with beautiful white teeth and large dark eyes ; and there was certainly something in his intelligent countenance which recommended him , independent of his claim to their kindness from his having been left thus friendless in consequence of his misadventure .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 23]: Humphrey was particularly pleased with and interested about him , as the lad had so nearly lost his life through his means .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 46]: `` I really think , Edward , '' said Humphrey , as they were standing outside of the door of the cottage , `` that the lad may be very useful to us , and I sincerely hope that he may prove honest and true .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 21]: We must first get him into health and spirits , and then I will see what he can do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 30]: `` The fact is , my dear Humphrey , we can do no otherwise : he is separated from his friends , and does not know where to go .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 42]: It would be inhuman , as we have been the cause of his misfortune , to turn him away ; but although I feel this , I do not feel much security as to his good behaviour and being very useful .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 45]: I have always been told that these gipsies were vagrants , who lived by stealing all they could lay their hands upon ; and , if he has been brought up in that way , I fear that he will not easily be reformed .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 14]: However , we can but try , and hope for the best . ''
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 41]: `` What you say is very just , Edward ; at the same time , there is an honest look about this lad , although he is a gipsy , that makes me put a sort of confidence in him .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 28]: Admitting that he has been taught to do wrong , do you not think that when told the contrary he may be persuaded to do right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 39]: `` It is not impossible , certainly , '' replied Edward ; `` but , Humphrey , be on the safe side , and do not trust him too far , until you know more of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 12]: `` That I most certainly will not , '' replied Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 16]: `` When do you purpose going over to the keeper 's cottage , Edward ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 49]: `` In a day or two ; but I am not exactly in a humour now to be very civil to the Roundheads , although the one I have promised to visit is a lady , and a very amiable , pretty little girl into the bargain . ''
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 18]: `` Why , Edward , what has made you feel more opposed to them than usual ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 70]: `` In the first place , Humphrey , the murder of the king -- for it was murder , and nothing better -- I can not get that out of my head ; and yesterday I obtained what I consider as almost a gift from Heaven ; and if it is so , it was not given but with the intention that I should make use of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 9]: `` And what was that , Edward ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 46]: `` Our gallant father 's sword , which he drew so nobly and so well in defence of his sovereign , Humphrey , and which I trust his son may one day wield with equal distinction , and , it may be , better fortune .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 14]: Come in with me , and I will show it to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 26]: Edward and Humphrey went into the bedroom , and Edward brought out the sword , which he had placed by his side on the bed .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 51]: `` See , Humphrey , this was our father 's sword ; and , '' continued Edward , kissing the weapon , `` I trust I may be permitted to draw it to revenge his death , and the death of one whose life ever should have been sacred . ''
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 27]: `` I trust that you will , my dear brother , '' replied Humphrey ; `` you will have a strong arm and a good cause .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 7]: Heaven grant that both may prosper !
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 10]: But tell me how you came by it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 39]: Edward then related all that had passed during his visit with Oswald to Lymington , not forgetting to tell him of Benjamin 's appearance , and the arrangements he had made relative to the sale of the venison .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 27]: As soon as dinner was over , Edward and Humphrey took down their guns , having agreed that they would go and hunt the wild cattle .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 19]: `` Humphrey , have you any idea where the herd of cattle are feeding at this time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 42]: `` I know where they were feeding yesterday and the day before , and I do not think that they will have changed their ground ; for the grass is yet very young , and only grown on the southern aspects .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 23]: Depend upon it we shall fall in with them not four miles from where we now are , if not nearer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 15]: `` We must stalk them as we do the deer , must we not ?
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 16]: They wo n't allow us to approach within shot , Humphrey , will they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 3]: said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 35]: `` We have to take our chance , Edward ; they will allow us to advance within shot , but the bulls will then advance upon us , while the herd increase their distance .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 28]: On the other hand , if we stalk them , we may kill one , and then the report of the gun will frighten the others away .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 24]: In the first instance there is a risk ; in the second there is none , but there is more fatigue and trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 13]: Choose as you please , I will act as you decide . ''
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 86]: `` Well , Humphrey , since you give me the choice , I think that this time I shall take the bull by the horns , as the saying is ; that is , if there are any trees near us , for if the herd are in an open place I would not run such a risk ; but if we can fire upon them and fall back upon a tree in case of a bull charging , I will take them openly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 39]: `` With all my heart , Edward : I think it will be very hard , if , with our two guns and Smoker to back us , we do not manage to be masters of the field .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 33]: However , we must survey well before we make our approach ; and if we can get within shot without alarming or irritating them , we of course will do so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 14]: `` The bulls are very savage at this spring-time , '' observed Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 42]: `` They are so at all times , as far as I can see of them , '' replied Humphrey ; `` but we are near to them now , I should think -- yes , there is the herd . ''
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 43]: `` There they are , sure enough , '' replied Edward : `` now we have not to do with deer , and need not be so very cautious ; but still the animals are wary , and keep a sharp look-out .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 13]: We must approach them quietly , by slipping from tree to tree .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 5]: Smoker , to heel !
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 11]: -- down -- quiet , Smoker -- good dog ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 45]: Edward and Humphrey stopped to load their guns , and then approached the herd in the manner which had been proposed , and were very soon within two hundred yards of the cattle , behind a large oak , when they stopped to reconnoitre .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 15]: The herd contained about seventy head of cattle , of various sizes and ages .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 57]: They were feeding in all directions , scattered , as the young grass was very short ; but although the herd was spread over many acres of land , Edward pointed out to Humphrey that all the full-grown large bulls were on the outside , as if ready to defend the others in case of attack .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 29]: `` Humphrey , '' said Edward , `` one thing is clear -- as the herd is placed at present , we must have a bull or nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 44]: It is impossible to get within shot of the others without passing a bull , and depend upon it our passage will be disputed ; and moreover , the herd will take to flight , and we shall get nothing at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 38]: `` Well , '' replied Humphrey , `` beef is beef ; and , as they say , beggars must not be choosers , so let it be a bull , if it must be so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 18]: `` Let us get nearer to them , and then we will decide what we shall do .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 5]: Steady , Smoker ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 22]: They advanced gradually , hiding from tree to tree , until they were within eighty yards of one of the bulls .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 24]: The animal did not perceive them , and as they were now within range , they again stepped behind the tree to consult .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 15]: `` Now , Edward , I think that it would be best to separate .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 23]: You can fire from where we are , and I will crawl through the fern , and get behind another tree . ''
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 47]: `` Very well , do so , '' replied Edward : `` if you can manage , get to that tree with the low branches , and then perhaps you will be within shot of the white bull , which is coming down in this direction .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 5]: Smoker , lie down !
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 16]: He can not go with you , Humphrey ; it will not be safe . ''
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 24]: The distance of the tree which Humphrey ventured to get to was about one hundred and fifty yards from where Edward was standing .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 40]: Humphrey crawled along for some time in the fern , but at last he came to a bare spot of about ten yards wide , which they were not aware of , and where he could not be concealed .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 13]: Humphrey hesitated , and at last decided upon attempting to cross it .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 86]: Edward , who was one moment watching the motions of Humphrey , and at another that of the two animals nearest to them , perceived that the white bull farthest from him , but nearest to Humphrey , threw its head in the air , pawed with his foot , and then advanced with a roar to where Humphrey was on the ground , still crawling towards the tree , having passed the open spot , and being now not many yards from the tree .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 29]: Perceiving the danger that his brother was in , and that , moreover , Humphrey himself was not aware of it , he hardly knew how to act .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 44]: The bull was too far from him to fire at it with any chance of success ; and how to let Humphrey know that the animal had discovered him and was making towards him , without calling out , he did not know .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 44]: All this was the thought of a moment , and then Edward determined to fire at the bull nearest to him , which he had promised not to do till Humphrey was also ready to fire ; and after firing to call Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 72]: He , therefore , for one moment , turned away from his brother , and , taking aim at the bull , fired his gun ; but probably from his nerves being a little shaken at the idea of Humphrey being in danger , the wound was not mortal , and the bull galloped back to the herd , which formed a closed phalanx about a quarter of a mile distant .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 54]: Edward then turned to where his brother was , and perceived that the bull had not made off with the rest of the cattle , but was within thirty yards of Humphrey , and advancing upon him , and that Humphrey was standing up beside the tree with his gun ready to fire .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 57]: Humphrey fired , and , as it appeared , he also missed his aim ; the animal made at him ; but Humphrey , with great quickness , dropped his gun , and , swinging by the lower boughs , was into the tree , and out of the bull 's reach , in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 33]: Edward smiled when he perceived that Humphrey was safe ; but still he was a prisoner , for the bull went round and round the tree roaring and looking up at Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 19]: Edward thought a minute , then loaded his gun and ordered Smoker to run in to the bull .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 24]: The dog , who had only been restrained by Edward 's keeping him down at his feet , sprang forward to the attack .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 54]: Edward had intended , by calling to the dog , to induce the bull to follow it till within gunshot ; but before the bull had been attacked , Edward observed that one or two more of the bulls had left the herd , and were coming at a rapid pace towards him .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 34]: Under these circumstances , Edward perceived that his only chance was to climb into a tree himself , which he did , taking good care to take his gun and ammunition with him .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 18]: Having safely fixed himself in a forked bough , Edward then surveyed the position of the parties .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 11]: There was Humphrey in the tree , without his gun .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 34]: The bull who had pursued Humphrey was now running at Smoker , who appeared to be aware that he was to decoy the bull towards Edward , for he kept retreating towards him .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 41]: In the meantime the two other bulls were quite close at hand , mingling their bellowing and roaring with the first ; and one of them as near to Edward as the first bull , which was engaged with Smoker .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 31]: At last one of the advancing bulls stood still , pawing the ground as if disappointed at not finding an enemy , not forty yards from where Edward was perched .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 14]: Edward took good aim , and when he fired the bull fell dead .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 59]: Edward was reloading his piece when he heard a howl , and looking round saw Smoker flying up in the air , having been tossed by the first bull ; and at the same time he observed that Humphrey had descended from the tree , recovered his gun , and was now safe again upon the lower bough .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 77]: The first bull was advancing again to attack Smoker , who appeared incapable of getting away , so much was he injured by the fall , when the other bull , who apparently must have been an old antagonist of the first , roared and attacked him ; and now the two boys were up in the tree , the two bulls fighting between them , and Smoker lying on the ground , panting and exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 24]: As the bulls , with locked horns , were furiously pressing each other , both guns were discharged , and both animals fell .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 34]: After waiting a little while to see if they rose again , or if any more of the herd came up , Edward and Humphrey descended from the trees and heartily shook hands .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWELVE .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 17]: `` A narrow escape , '' said Edward , as he held his brother 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 21]: `` Yes , indeed we may thank Heaven for our preservation , '' replied Humphrey ; `` and poor Smoker !
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 10]: Let us see if he is much hurt . ''
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 32]: `` I trust not , '' said Edward , going up to the dog , who remained quite still on the ground , with his tongue out , and panting violently .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 31]: They examined poor Smoker all over very carefully , and found that there was no external wound ; but on Edward pressing his side the animal gave a low howl .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 17]: `` It is there where the horn of the bull took him , '' observed Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 22]: `` Yes , '' said Edward , pressing and feeling softly ; `` and he has two of his ribs broken .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 32]: Humphrey , see if you can get him a little water , that will recover him more than anything else ; the bull has knocked the breath out of his body .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 13]: I think he will soon be well again , poor fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 11]: Humphrey soon returned with some water from a neighbouring pool .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 30]: He brought it in his hat and gave it to the dog , who lapped it slowly at first , but afterwards much faster , and wagging his tail .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 20]: `` He will do now , '' said Edward ; `` we must give him time to recover himself .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 9]: Now then , let us examine our quarry .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 13]: Why , Humphrey , what a quantity of meat we have here !
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 11]: It will take three journeys to Lymington at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 19]: `` Yes , and no time to lose , for the weather is getting warm already , Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 5]: Now what to do ?
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 12]: Will you remain while I go home for the cart ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 33]: `` Yes , it 's no use both going ; I will stay here and watch poor Smoker , and take off the skins ready by the time you are back again .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 18]: Leave me your knife as well as my own , for one will soon be blunt . ''
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 19]: Humphrey gave his knife to Edward , and taking up his gun , set off for the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 29]: Edward had skinned two of the bulls before Humphrey 's return ; and Smoker , although he evidently was in great pain , was on his legs again .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 45]: As soon as they had finished and quartered the beasts , the cart was loaded , and they returned home ; they had to return a second time , and both the pony and they were very tired before they sat down to supper .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 14]: They found the gipsy boy very much recovered , and in good spirits .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 43]: Alice said that he had been amusing Edith and her by tossing up three potatoes at a time , and playing them like balls ; and that he had spun a platter upon an iron skewer and balanced it on his chin .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 33]: They gave him some supper , which he ate in the chimney-corner , looking up and staring every now and then at Edith , to whom he appeared very much attached already .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 6]: `` Is it good ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 11]: said Humphrey to the boy , giving him another venison-steak .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 17]: `` Yes ; not have so good supper in pit-hole , '' replied Pablo , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 19]: Early on the following morning Edward and Humphrey set off to Lymington with the cart laden with meat .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 39]: Edward showed Humphrey all the shops and the streets they were in where the purchases were to be made -- introduced him to the landlord of the hostelrie -- and having sold their meat , they returned home .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 37]: The rest of the meat was taken to Lymington and disposed of by Humphrey on the following day ; and the day after that , the three skins were carried to the town and disposed of .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 25]: `` We made a good day 's work , Edward , '' said Humphrey , as he reckoned up the money they had made .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 68]: `` We earned it with some risk , at all events , '' replied Edward ; `` and now , Humphrey , I think it is time that I keep my promise to Oswald , and go over to the Intendant 's house and pay my visit to the young lady , as I presume she is -- and certainly she has every appearance of being one .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 16]: I want the visit to be over , as I want to be doing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 9]: `` How do you mean , Edward ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 45]: `` I mean that I want to go out and kill some deer ; but I will not do it till after I have seen her : when my visit is over , I intend to defy the Intendant and all his verderers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 19]: `` But why should this visit prevent you going out this very day , if so inclined ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 57]: `` I do n't know , but she may ask me if I have done so , and I do not want to tell her that I have ; neither do I want to say that I have not if I have ; and therefore I shall not commence till after I have seen her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 8]: `` When will you set off ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 58]: `` To-morrow morning ; and I shall take my gun , although Oswald desired me not ; but after the fight we had with the wild cattle the other day I do n't think it prudent to be unarmed ; indeed , I do not feel comfortable without I have my gun , at any time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 33]: `` Well , I shall have plenty to do when you are away -- the potatoes must be hoed up , and I shall see what I can make of Master Pablo .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 31]: He appears well enough , and he has played quite long enough ; so I shall take him with me to the garden to-morrow , and set him to work .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 16]: What a quantity of fruit there is a promise of in the orchard this year !
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 51]: And Edward , if this boy turns out of any use , and is a help to me , I think that I shall take all the orchard into garden , and then enclose another piece of ground , and see if we can not grow some corn for ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 28]: It is the greatest expense that we have at present , and I should like to take my own corn to the mill to be ground . ''
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 12]: `` But will not growing corn require plough and horses ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 3]: said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 37]: `` No ; we will till it by hand : two of us can dig a great deal at odd times , and we shall have a better crop with the spade than with the plough .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 13]: We have now so much manure that we can afford it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 46]: `` Well , if it is to be done , it should be done at once , Humphrey , before the people from the other side of the forest come and find us out , or they will dispute our right to the enclosure . ''
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 61]: `` The forest belongs to the king , brother , and not to the Parliament : and we are the king 's liegemen , and only look to him for permission , '' replied Humphrey ; `` but what you say is true , the sooner it is done the better , and I will about it at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 10]: `` How much do you propose fencing in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 8]: `` About two or three acres . ''
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 16]: `` But that is more than you can dig this year or the next . ''
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 42]: `` I know that ; but I will manure it without digging , and the grass will grow so rich to what it will outside of the enclosure , that they will suppose it has been enclosed a long while . ''
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 47]: `` That 's not a bad idea , Humphrey : but I advise you to look well after that boy , for he is of a bad race , and has not been brought up , I am afraid , with too strict notions of honesty .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 40]: Be careful , and tell your sisters also to be cautious not to let him suppose that we have any money in the old chest , till we find out whether he is to be trusted or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 35]: `` Better not let him know it under any circumstances , '' replied Humphrey ; `` he may continue honest , if not tempted by the knowledge that there is anything worth stealing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 21]: `` You are right , Humphrey ; well , I will be off to-morrow morning and get this visit over .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 21]: I hope to be able to get all the news from her , now that her father is away . ''
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 30]: `` I hope to get some work out of this Master Pablo , '' replied Humphrey ; `` how many things I could do if he would only work !
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 33]: Now , I 'll tell you one thing -- I will dig a saw-pit and get a saw , and then I can cut out boards , and build anything we want .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 61]: The first time I go to Lymington I will buy a saw -- I can afford it now ; and I 'll make a carpenter 's bench for the first thing , and then , with some more tools , I shall get on ; and then , Edward , I 'll tell you what else I will do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 41]: `` Then , Humphrey , '' replied Edward , laughing , `` you must tell me some other time , for it is now very late , and I must go to bed , as I have to rise early .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 23]: I know you have so many projects in your mind that it would take half the night to listen to them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 48]: `` Well , I believe what you say is true , '' replied Humphrey , `` and it will be better to do one thing at a time than to talk about doing a hundred ; so we will , as you say , to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 30]: At sunrise Edward and Humphrey were both up ; Alice came out when they tapped at her door , as she would not let Edward go without his breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 10]: Edith joined them , and they went to prayers .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 16]: While they were so employed , Pablo came out and listened to what was said .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 17]: When prayers were over , Humphrey asked Pablo if he knew what they had been doing .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 14]: `` No , not much ; suppose you pray sun to shine . ''
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 19]: `` No , Pablo , '' said Edith , `` pray to God to make us good . ''
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 6]: `` You bad then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 9]: said Pablo ; `` me not bad . ''
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 27]: `` Yes , Pablo , everybody very bad , '' said Alice ; `` but if we try to be good , God forgives us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 56]: The conversation was then dropped , and as soon as Edward had had his breakfast , he kissed his sisters , bidding them and Humphrey farewell : he then threw his gun over his arm , and calling his puppy , which he had named Holdfast , set off on his journey across the forest .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 22]: Holdfast , as well as Humphrey 's puppy , which had been named Watch , had grown very fine young animals .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 88]: The first had been named Holdfast , because it would seize the pigs by the ears and lead them into the sty , and the other because it was so alert at the least noise : but , as Humphrey said , Watch ought to have learnt to lead the pigs , it being more in his line of business than Holdfast 's , which was to be brought up for hunting in the forest , while Watch was being educated as a house and farm-yard dog .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 64]: Edward had refused to take the pony , as Humphrey required it for the farm-work , and the weather was so fine that he preferred walking ; the more so , as it would enable him on his return across the forest to try for some venison , which he could not have done if he had been mounted on Billy 's back .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 18]: Edward walked quick , followed by his dog , which he had taught to keep to heel .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 42]: He felt happy , as people do who have no cares , from the fine weather -- the deep green of the verdure chequered by the flowers in bloom , and the majestic scenery which met his eye on every side .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 22]: His heart was as buoyant as his steps , as he walked along , the light summer breeze fanning his face .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 24]: His thoughts , however , which had been more of the chase than anything else , suddenly changed , and he became serious .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 22]: For some time he had heard no political news of consequence , or what the Commons were doing with the king .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 22]: This reverie naturally brought to his mind his father 's death , the burning of his property , and its sequestration .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 12]: His cheeks coloured with indignation , and his brow was moody .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 8]: Then he built castles for the future .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 34]: He imagined the king released from his prison , and leading an army against his oppressors ; he fancied himself at the head of a troop of cavalry , charging the parliamentary horse .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 6]: Victory was on his side .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 19]: The king was again on his throne , and he was again in possession of the family estate .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 45]: He was rebuilding the hall , and somehow or another it appeared to him that Patience was standing by his side , as he gave directions to the artificers -- when his reverie was suddenly disturbed by Holdfast barking and springing forward in advance .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 43]: Edward , who had by this time got over more than half his journey , looked up , and perceived himself confronted by a powerful man , apparently about forty years of age , and dressed as a verderer of the forest .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 20]: He thought at the time that he had seldom seen a person with a more sinister and forbidding countenance .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 14]: `` How now , young fellow , what are you doing here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 23]: said the man , walking up to him , and cocking the gun which he held in his hand as he advanced .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 43]: Edward quietly cocked his own gun , which was loaded , when he perceived that hostile preparation on the part of the other person , and then replied , `` I am walking across the forest , as you may perceive . ''
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 30]: `` Yes , I perceive you are walking , and you are walking with a dog and a gun : you will now be pleased to walk with me .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 12]: Deer-stealers are not any longer permitted to range this forest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 10]: `` I am no deer-stealer , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 34]: `` It will be quite sufficient to give me that title when you find me with venison in my possession ; and as for going with you , that I certainly shall not .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 10]: Sheer off or you may meet with harm . ''
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 36]: `` Why , you young good-for-nothing , if you have not venison , it is not from any will not to take it ; you are out in pursuit of it , that is clear .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 29]: Come , come , you 've the wrong person to deal with : my orders are to take up all poachers , and take you I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 42]: `` If you can , '' replied Edward ; `` but you must first prove that you are able so to do ; my gun is as good and my aim is as sure as yours , whoever you may be .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 36]: I tell you again , I am no poacher , nor have I come out to take the deer , but to cross over to the Intendant 's cottage , whither I am now going .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 30]: I tell you thus much , that you may not do anything foolish ; and having said this , I advise you to think twice before you act once .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 26]: Let me proceed in peace , or you may lose your place , if you do not by your own rashness lose your life . ''
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 19]: There was something so cool and so determined in Edward 's quiet manner , that the verderer hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 36]: He perceived that any attempt to take Edward would be at the risk of his own life ; and he knew that his orders were to apprehend all poachers , but not to shoot people .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 49]: It was true that resistance with firearms would warrant his acting in self-defence ; but admitting that he should succeed , which was doubtful , still Edward had not been caught in the act of killing venison , and he had no witnesses to prove what had occurred .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 50]: He also knew that the Intendant had given very strict orders as to the shedding of blood , which he was most averse to under any circumstances ; and there was something in Edward 's appearance and manner so different from a common person , that he was puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 15]: Moreover , Edward had stated that he was going to the Intendant 's house .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 48]: All things considered , as he found that bullying would not succeed , he thought it advisable to change his tone , and therefore said , `` You tell me that you are going to the Intendant 's house ; you have business there , I presume ?
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 29]: If I took you prisoner , it is there I should have conducted you ; so , young man , you may now walk on before me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 41]: `` I thank you , '' replied Edward , `` but walk on before you I will not : but if you choose to half-cock your gun again , and walk by my side , I will do the same .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 29]: Those are my terms , and I will listen to no other ; so be pleased to make up your mind , as I am in haste . ''
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 21]: The verderer appeared very indignant at this reply , but after a time said , `` Be it so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 45]: Edward then uncocked his gun , with his eyes fixed upon the man , and the verderer did the same ; and then they walked side by side , Edward keeping at the distance of three yards from him , in case of treachery .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 31]: After a few moments ' silence , the verderer said , `` You tell me you are going to the Intendant 's house ; he is not at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 14]: `` But young Mistress Patience is , I presume , '' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 30]: `` Yes , '' replied the man , who , finding that Edward appeared to know so much about the Intendant 's family , began to be more civil .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 19]: `` Yes , she is at home , for I saw her in the garden this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 10]: `` And Oswald , is he at home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 3]: rejoined Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 6]: `` Yes , he is .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 23]: You appear to know our people , young man ; who may you be , if it is a fair question ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 38]: `` It would have been a fair question had you treated me fairly , '' replied Edward ; `` but as it is no concern of yours , I shall leave you to find it out . ''
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 48]: This reply puzzled the man still more ; and he now , from the tone of authority assumed by Edward , began to imagine that he had made some mistake , and that he was speaking to a superior , although clad in a forester 's dress .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 15]: He therefore answered humbly , observing that he had only been doing his duty .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 8]: Edward walked on without making any reply .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 37]: As they arrived within a hundred yards of the Intendant 's house , Edward said : `` I have now arrived at my destination , and am going into that house , as I told you .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 40]: Do you choose to enter it with me , or will you go to Oswald Partridge and tell him that you have met with Edward Armitage in me forest , and that I should be glad to see him ?
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 13]: I believe you are under his orders , are you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 30]: `` Yes , I am , '' replied the verderer , `` and as I suppose that all 's right , I shall go and deliver your message . ''
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 26]: Edward then turned away from the man , and went into the wicket-gate of the garden , and knocked at the door of the house .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 23]: The door was opened by Patience Heatherstone herself , who said , `` Oh , how glad I am to see you !
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 4]: Come in . ''
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 25]: Edward took off his hat and bowed ; Patience led the way into her father 's study , where Edward had been first received .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 30]: `` And now , '' said Patience , extending her hand to Edward , `` thanks , many thanks , for your preserving me from so dreadful a death .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 25]: You do n't know how unhappy I have been at not being able to give you my poor thanks for your courageous behaviour . ''
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 12]: Her hand still remained in Edward 's while she said this .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 49]: `` You rate what I did too highly , '' replied Edward ; `` I would have done the same for any one in such distress : it was my duty as a -- man , '' cavalier he was about to say , but he checked himself .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 38]: `` Sit down , '' said Patience , taking a chair , -- `` nay , no ceremony ; I can not treat as an inferior one to whom I owe such a debt of gratitude . ''
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 8]: Edward smiled as he took his seat .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 33]: `` My father is as grateful to you as I am -- I 'm sure that he is ; for I heard him when at prayer call down blessings on your head .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 7]: What can he do for you ?
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 15]: I begged Oswald Partridge to bring you here , that I might find out .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 22]: Oh , sir , do pray let me know how we can show our gratitude by something more than words . ''
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 39]: `` You have shown it already , Mistress Patience , '' replied Edward ; `` have you not honoured a poor forester with your hand in friendship , and even admitted him to sit down before you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 80]: `` He who has preserved my life at the risk of his own becomes to me as a brother -- at least I feel as a sister towards him : a debt is still a debt , whether indebted to a king or to a -- '' `` Forester , Mistress Patience , that is the real word that you should not have hesitated to have used : do you imagine that I am ashamed of my calling ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 28]: `` To tell you candidly the truth , then , '' replied Patience , `` I can not believe that you are what you profess to be .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 19]: I mean to say , that although a forester now , you were never brought up as such .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 10]: My father has an opinion allied to mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 90]: `` I thank you both for your good opinion of me , but I fear that I can not raise myself above the condition of a forester ; nay , from your father 's coming down here , and the new regulations , I have every chance of sinking down to the lower grade of a deer-stealer and poacher ; indeed , had it not been that I had my gun with me , I should have been seized as such this very day as I came over . ''
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 15]: `` But you were not shooting the deer , were you , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 3]: inquired Patience .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 19]: `` No , I was not ; nor have I killed any since last I saw you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 24]: `` I am glad that I can say that to my father , '' replied Patience ; `` it will much please him .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 31]: He said to me that he thought you capable of much higher employment than any that could be offered here , and only wished to know what you would accept .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 63]: He has interest -- great interest -- although just now at variance with the rulers of this country , on account of the -- '' `` Murder of the king , you would or you should have said , Mistress Patience : I have heard how much he was opposed to that foul deed , and I honour him for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 14]: `` How kind , how truly kind you are to say so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 24]: said Patience , the tears starting in her eyes ; `` what pleasure to hear my father 's conduct praised by you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 19]: `` Why , of course , Mistress Patience , all of my way of thinking must praise him .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 10]: Your father is in London , I hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 20]: `` Yes , he is ; and that reminds me that you must want some refreshment after your walk .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 6]: I will call Phoebe . ''
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 8]: So saying , Patience left the room .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 55]: The fact was , Mistress Patience was reminded that she had been sitting with a young man some time , and alone with him -- which was not quite proper in those times , and when Phoebe appeared with the cold viands , she retreated out of hearing , but remained in the room .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 42]: Edward partook of the meal offered him in silence , Patience occupying herself with her work , and keeping her eyes fixed on it , unless when she gave a slight glance at the table to see if anything was required .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 20]: When the meal was over , Phoebe removed the tray , and then Edward rose to take his leave .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 27]: `` Nay , do not go yet -- I have much to say first ; let me again ask you how we can serve you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 23]: `` I never can take any office under the present rulers of the nation ; so that question is at rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 38]: `` I was afraid you would answer so , '' replied Patience gravely : `` do not think I blame you ; for many are there already who would gladly retrace their steps if it were possible .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 20]: They little thought , when they opposed the king , that affairs would have ended as they have done .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 8]: Where do you live , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 26]: `` At the opposite side of the forest , in a house belonging to me now , but which was inherited by my grandfather . ''
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 10]: `` Do you live alone -- surely not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 8]: `` No , I do not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 29]: `` Nay , you may tell me anything , for I would never repeat what might hurt you , or you might not wish to have known . ''
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 18]: `` I live with my brother and two sisters , for my grandfather is lately dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 10]: `` Is your brother younger than you are ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 5]: `` He is . ''
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 11]: `` And your sisters , what are their ages ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 7]: `` They are younger still . ''
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 13]: `` You told my father that you lived upon your farm ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 5]: `` We do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 8]: `` Is it a large farm ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 7]: `` No ; very small . ''
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 8]: `` And does that support you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 10]: `` That and killing wild cattle has lately . ''
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 11]: `` Yes , and killing deer also until lately ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 7]: `` You have guessed right . ''
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 18]: `` You were brought up at Arnwood , you told my father ; did you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 20]: `` Yes , I was brought up there , and remained there until the death of Colonel Beverley . ''
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 11]: `` And you were educated , were you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 14]: `` Yes ; the chaplain taught me what little I do know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 28]: `` Then , if you were brought up in the house and educated by the chaplain , surely Colonel Beverley never intended you for a forester ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 24]: `` He did not ; I was to have been a soldier as soon as I was old enough to bear arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 13]: `` Perhaps you are distantly related to the late Colonel Beverley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 59]: `` No ; I am not _ distantly _ related , '' replied Edward , who began to feel uneasy at this close cross-examination ; `` but still , had Colonel Beverley been alive , and the king still required his services , I have no doubt that I should have been serving under him at this time .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 29]: And now , Mistress Patience , that I have answered so many questions of yours , may I be permitted to ask a little about yourself in return ?
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 6]: Have you any brothers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 10]: `` None ; I am an only child . ''
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 9]: `` Have you only one parent alive ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 5]: `` Only one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 9]: `` What families are you connected with ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 34]: Patience looked up with surprise at this last question -- `` My mother 's name was Cooper ; she was sister to Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper , who is a person well-known . ''
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 3]: `` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 8]: Then you are of gentle blood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 12]: `` I believe so , '' replied Patience , with surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 26]: `` Thank you for your condescension , Mistress Patience ; and now , if you will permit me , I will take my leave . ''
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 54]: `` Before you go , let me once more thank you for saving a worthless life , '' said Patience : `` well , you must come again when my father is here ; he will be but too glad to have an opportunity of thanking one who has preserved his only child .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 20]: Indeed , if you knew my father , you would feel as much regard for him as I do .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 26]: He is very good , although he looks so stern and melancholy ; but he has seldom smiled since my poor mother 's death . ''
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 38]: `` As to your father , Mistress Patience , I will think as well as I can of one who is joined to a party which I hold in detestation : I can say no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 30]: `` I must not say all that I know , or you would perhaps find out that he is not quite so wedded to that party as you suppose .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 23]: Neither his brother-in-law nor he are great friends of Cromwell 's , I can assure you ; but this in confidence . ''
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 17]: `` That raises him in my estimation ; but why then does he hold office ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 47]: `` He did not ask it ; it was given to him , I really believe , because they wished him out of the way ; and he accepted it because he was opposed to what was going on , and wished himself to be away .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 12]: At least I infer so much from what I have learnt .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 18]: It is not an office of power or trust which leagues him with the present Government . ''
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 20]: `` No ; only one which opposes him to me and my mal-practices , '' replied Edward , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 36]: `` Well , Mistress Patience , you have shown great condescension to a poor forester , and I return you many thanks for your kindness towards me : I will now take my leave . ''
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 12]: `` And when will you come and see my father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 71]: `` I can not say ; I fear that I shall not be able very soon to look in his injured face , and it will not be well for a poacher to come near him , '' replied Edward : `` however , some day I may be taken and brought before you as a prisoner , you know , and then he is certain to see me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 40]: `` I will not tell you to kill deer , '' replied Patience ; `` but if you do kill them , no one shall harm you -- or I know little of my power or my father 's .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 14]: Farewell then , sir ; and once more , gratitude and thanks . ''
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 25]: Patience held out her hand again to Edward , who this time , like a true cavalier , raised it respectfully to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 25]: Patience coloured a little , but did not attempt to withdraw it , and Edward , with a low obeisance , quitted the room .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 3]: CHAPTER THIRTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 39]: As soon as he was out of the Intendant 's house , Edward hastened to the cottage of Oswald Partridge , whom he found waiting for him ; for the verderer had not failed to deliver his message .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 35]: `` You have had a long talk with Mistress Patience , '' said Oswald , after the first greeting ; `` and I am glad of it , as it gives you consequence here .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 70]: The Roundhead rascal whom you met was inclined to be very precise about doing his duty , and insisted that he was certain that you were on the look-out for deer ; but I stopped his mouth by telling him that I often took you out with me , as you were the best shot in the whole forest , and that the Intendant knew that I did so .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 55]: I think that if you were caught in the act of killing a deer you had better tell them that you killed it by my request , and I will bear you out , if they bring you to the Intendant , who will , I 'm sure , thank me for saying so .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 18]: You might kill all the deer in the forest after what you have done for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 17]: `` Many thanks ; but I do not think I can take advantage of your offer .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 24]: Let them catch me if they can , and if they do catch me , let them take me if they can . ''
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 77]: `` I see , sir , that you will accept no favour from the Roundheads , '' replied Oswald ; `` however , as I am now head keeper , I shall take care that my men do not interfere with you , if I can help it ; all I wish is to prevent any insult or indignity being offered to you : they not being aware who you are , as I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 13]: `` Many thanks , Oswald ; I must take my chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 22]: Edward then told Oswald of their having taken the gipsy boy in the pit , at which he appeared much amused .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 16]: `` What is the name of the verderer whom I met in the forest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 3]: inquired Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 15]: `` James Corbould ; he was discharged from the army , '' replied Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 12]: `` I do not like his appearance , '' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 32]: `` No ; his face tells against him , '' replied Oswald ; `` but I know nothing of him ; he has been here little more than a fortnight . ''
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 16]: `` Can you give me a corner to put my head in to-night , Oswald ?
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 10]: For I shall not start till to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 46]: `` You may command all I have , sir , '' replied Oswald ; `` but I fear there is little more than a hearty welcome ; I have no doubt that you could be lodged at the Intendant 's house if you choose . ''
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 34]: `` No , Oswald , the young lady is alone , and I will not trust to Phoebe 's accommodation again ; I will stay here , if you will permit me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 18]: `` And welcome , sir : I will put your puppy in the kennel at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 43]: Edward remained that night at Oswald 's , and at daylight he rose , and having taken a slight breakfast , throwing his gun over his shoulder , went to the kennel for Holdfast , and set off on his return home .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 84]: `` That 's a very nice little girl , '' were the words which Edward found himself constantly saying to himself as he walked along ; `` and she is of a grateful disposition , or she would not have behaved as she has done towards me -- supposing me to be of mean birth ; '' and then he thought of what she had told him relative to her father , and Edward felt his animosity against a Roundhead wasting fast away .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 32]: `` I am not likely to see her again very soon , '' thought Edward , `` unless , indeed , I am brought to the Intendant as a prisoner . ''
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 38]: Thus thinking upon one subject or another , Edward had gained above eight miles of his journey across the forest , when he thought that he was sufficiently far away to venture to look-out for some venison .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 45]: Remembering there was a thicket not far from him , in which there was a clear pool of water , Edward thought it very likely that he might find a stag there cooling himself , for the weather was now very warm at noon-day .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 14]: He therefore called Holdfast to him , and proceeded cautiously towards the thicket .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 18]: As soon as he arrived at the spot , he crouched and crept silently through the underwood .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 13]: At last he arrived close to the cleared spot by the pool .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 31]: There was no stag there , but fast asleep upon the turf lay James Corbould , the sinister-looking verderer who had accosted him in the forest on the previous day .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 47]: Holdfast was about to bark , when Edward silenced him , and then advanced to where the verderer was lying ; and who having no dog with him to give notice of Edward 's approach , still remained snoring with the sun shining on his face .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 77]: Edward perceived that his gun was under him on the grass ; he took it up , gently opened the pan and scattered the powder , and then laid it down again ; for Edward said to himself , `` That man has come out after me , that I am certain ; and as there are no witnesses , he may be inclined to be mischievous , for a more wretched-looking person I never saw .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 21]: Had he been deer-hunting , he would have brought his dog ; but he is man-hunting , that is evident .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 49]: Now I will leave him , and should he fall in with anything , he will not kill at first shot , that 's certain ; and if he follows me , I shall have the same chance of escape as anything else he may fire at . ''
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 31]: Edward then walked out of the covert , thinking that if ever there was a face which proclaimed a man to be a murderer it was that of James Corbould .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 28]: As he was threading his way , he heard the howl of a dog , and on looking round , perceived that Holdfast was not with him .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 11]: He turned back , and Holdfast came running to him .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 96]: The fact was , that Holdfast had smelt some meat in the pocket of the verderer , and had been putting his nose in to ascertain what it was : in so doing he had wakened up Corbould , who had saluted him with a heavy blow on the head : this occasioned the puppy to give the howl , and also occasioned Corbould to seize his gun , and follow stealthily in the track of the dog , which he well knew to be the one he had seen the day before with Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 33]: Edward waited for a short time , and not perceiving that Corbould made his appearance , continued on his way home , having now given up all thoughts of killing any venison .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 37]: He walked fast , and was within six miles of the cottage , when he stopped to drink at a small rill of water , and then sat down to rest himself for a short time .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 20]: While so doing , he fell into one of his usual reveries , and forgot how time passed away .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 29]: He was , however , aroused by a low growl on the part of Holdfast , and it immediately occurred to him that Corbould must have followed him .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 21]: Thinking it as well to be prepared , he quietly loaded his gun , and then rose up to reconnoitre .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 26]: Holdfast sprang forward , and Edward looking in the direction , perceived Corbould partly hidden behind a tree , with his gun levelled at him .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 37]: He heard the trigger pulled , and snap of the lock , but the gun did not go off ; and then Corbould made his appearance , striking at Holdfast with the butt-end of his gun .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 19]: Edward advanced to him and desired him to desist , or it would be the worse for him .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 5]: `` Indeed , younker !
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 12]: It may be the worse for you , '' cried Corbould .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 16]: `` It might have been if your gun had gone off , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 8]: `` I did not aim at you .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 18]: I aimed at the dog , and I will kill the brute , if I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 59]: `` Not without danger to yourself ; but it was not him that you aimed at -- your gun was not pointed low enough to hit the dog -- it was levelled at me , you sneaking wretch ; and I have only to thank my own prudence and your sleepy head for having escaped with my life .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 18]: I tell you candidly that I threw the powder out of your pan while you were asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 59]: If I served you as you deserve , I should now put my bullet into you , but I can not kill a man who is defenceless -- and that saves your life ; but set off as fast as you can away from me , for if you follow me , I will show no more forbearance .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 34]: Away with you directly , '' continued Edward , raising his gun to his shoulder and pointing it to Corbould ; `` if you do not be off , I 'll fire . ''
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 47]: Corbould saw that Edward was resolute , and thought proper to comply with his request : he walked away till he considered himself out of gunshot , and then commenced a torrent of oaths and abusive language , with which we shall not offend our readers .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 29]: Before he went farther , he swore that he would have Edward 's life before many days had passed , and then shaking his fist he went away .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 22]: Edward remained where he was standing till the man was fairly out of sight , and then proceeded on his journey .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 63]: It was now about four o'clock in the afternoon , and Edward , as he walked on , said to himself , `` That man must be of a very wicked disposition , for I have offended him in nothing except in not submitting to be made his prisoner ; and is that an offence to take a man 's life for ?
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 23]: He is a dangerous man , and will be more dangerous after being again foiled by me as he has been to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 63]: I doubt if he will go home ; I am almost sure that he will turn and follow me when he thinks that he can without my seeing him ; and if he does , he will find out where our cottage is -- and who knows what mischief he may not do , and how he may alarm my little sisters ?
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 24]: I 'll not go home till dark ; and I 'll now walk in another direction , that I may mislead him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 32]: Edward then walked away more to the north , and every half-hour shifted his course , so as to be walking in a very different direction from where the cottage stood .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 39]: In the meantime it grew gradually dark ; and as it became so , every now and then when Edward passed a large tree he turned round behind it and looked to see if Corbould was following him .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 41]: At last , just as it was dark , he perceived the figure of a man at no great distance from him , who was following him , running from tree to tree , so as to make his approach .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 8]: `` Oh , you are there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 23]: thought Edward , `` now will I give you a nice dance , and we will see whose legs are tired soonest .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 9]: Let me see , where am I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 47]: Edward looked round , and then perceived that he was close to the clump of trees where Humphrey had made his pit-fall for the cattle , and there was a clear spot of about a quarter of a mile between it and where he now stood .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 20]: Edward made up his mind , and immediately walked out to cross the clearing , calling Holdfast to heel .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 27]: It was now nearly dark , for there was only the light of the stars ; but still there was sufficient light to see his way .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 37]: As Edward crossed the cleared spot , he once looked round and perceived that Corbould was following him , and nearer than he was before , trusting probably to the increased darkness to hide his approach .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 18]: `` That will do , '' thought Edward , `` come along , my fine fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 30]: And Edward walked on till he came to the pit-fall ; there he stopped and looked round , and soon discovered the verderer at a hundred yards ' distance .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 35]: Edward held his dog by the mouth , that he should not growl or bark , and then went on in a direction so as to bring the pit-fall exactly between Corbould and himself .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 79]: Having done so , he proceeded at a more rapid pace ; and Corbould following him , also increased his , till he arrived at the pit-fall , which he could not perceive , and fell into it headlong ; and as he fell into the pit , at the same time Edward heard the discharge of his gun , the crash of the small branches laid over it , and a cry on the part of Corbould .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 29]: `` That will do , '' thought Edward , `` now you may lie there as long as the gipsy did , and that will cool your courage .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 8]: Humphrey 's pit-fall is full of adventure .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 10]: In this case it has done me a service .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 13]: Now I may turn and go home as fast as I can .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 13]: Come , Holdfast , old boy , we both want our suppers .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 24]: I can answer for one , for I could eat the whole of that pasty which Oswald set before me this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 16]: Edward walked at a rapid pace , quite delighted at the issue of the adventure .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 21]: As he arrived near to the cottage he found Humphrey outside , with Pablo , on the look-out for him .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 33]: He soon joined them , and soon after embraced Alice and Edith , who had been anxiously waiting for his return , and who had wondered at his being out so late .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 25]: `` Give me my supper , my dear girls , '' said Edward ; `` and then you shall know all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 49]: As soon as Edward had satisfied his craving appetite -- for he had not , as my readers must recollect , eaten anything since his departure early in the morning from the house of Oswald Partridge -- he entered into a narrative of the events of the day .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 43]: They all listened with great interest ; and when Edward had finished , Pablo , the gipsy boy , jumped up , and said : `` Now he is in the pit , to-morrow morning I take gun and shoot him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 19]: `` No , no , Pablo , you must not do that , '' replied Edward , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 21]: `` Pablo , '' said little Edith , `` go and sit down ; you must not shoot people . ''
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 17]: `` He shoot master then , '' said Pablo ; `` he very bad man . ''
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 30]: `` But if you shoot him , you will be a bad boy , Pablo , '' replied Edith , who appeared to have assumed an authority over him .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 26]: Pablo did not appear to understand this , but he obeyed the order of his little mistress , and resumed his seat at the chimney-corner .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 18]: `` But , Edward , '' said Humphrey , `` what do you propose to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 34]: `` I hardly know ; my idea was to let him remain there for a day or two , and then send to Oswald to let him know where the fellow was . ''
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 50]: `` The only objection to that is , '' replied Humphrey , `` that you say his gun went off as he fell into the pit ; it may be probable that he is wounded , and if so , he might die if he is left there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 26]: `` You are right , Humphrey , that is possible ; and I would not have the life of a fellow-creature on my conscience . ''
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 41]: `` I think it would be advisable , Edward , that I should set off early to-morrow on the pony , and see Oswald , tell him all that has occurred , and show him where the pit-fall is . ''
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 13]: `` I believe that would be the best plan , Humphrey . ''
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 36]: `` Yes , '' said Alice , `` it would be dreadful that a man should die in so wicked a state ; let him be taken out , and perhaps he will repent . ''
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 10]: `` Wo n't God punish him , brother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 3]: said Edith .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 18]: `` Yes , my dear , sooner or later , the vengeance of Heaven overtakes the wicked .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 23]: But I am very tired after so long a walk ; let us go to prayers , and then to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 39]: The danger that Edward had incurred that day was felt strongly by the whole party ; and , with the exception of Pablo , there was earnest devotion and gratitude to Heaven when their orisons were offered up .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 37]: Humphrey was off before daybreak , and , at nine o'clock , had arrived at the cottage of Oswald , by whom he was warmly greeted before the cause of his unexpected arrival was made known .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 66]: Oswald was greatly annoyed at Humphrey 's narration , and appeared to be very much of the opinion of Pablo , which was , to leave the scoundrel where he was ; but on the remonstrance of Humphrey , he set off , with two of the other verderers , and before nightfall Humphrey arrived at the pit-fall , where they heard Corbould groaning below .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 6]: `` Who 's there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 8]: said Oswald , looking into the pit .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 14]: `` It 's me -- it 's Corbould , '' replied the man .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 6]: `` Are you hurt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 28]: `` Yes , badly , '' replied Corbould ; `` when I fell , my gun went off , and the ball has gone through my thigh .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 8]: I have almost bled to death . ''
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 39]: Humphrey went for the ladder , which was at hand , and , with much exertion on the part of the whole four of them , they contrived to drag out Corbould , who groaned heavily with pain .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 26]: A handkerchief was tied tightly round his leg , to prevent any further bleeding , and they gave him some water , which revived him .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 10]: `` Now , what 's to be done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 12]: said Oswald ; `` we can never get him home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 15]: `` I will tell you , '' said Humphrey , walking with him aside .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 23]: `` It will not do for any of these men to know our cottage , and we can not take them there .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 19]: Desire them to remain with the man , while you go for a cart to carry him home .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 29]: We will go to the cottage , give Billy his supper , and then return with him in the cart , and bring your men something to eat .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 16]: Then I will go with you , and bring the cart back again before daylight .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 17]: It will be a night 's walk , but it will be the safest plan . ''
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 36]: `` I think so too , '' replied Oswald , who desired the men to wait till his return , as he was going to borrow a cart ; and then set off with Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 33]: As soon as they arrived at the cottage , Humphrey gave the pony to Pablo to put into the stable and feed , and then communicated to Edward the state of Corbould .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 51]: `` It 's almost a pity that he had not killed himself out-right , '' observed Oswald ; `` it would have been justice to him for attempting your life without any cause ; he is a bloodthirsty scoundrel , and I wish he was anywhere but where he is .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 21]: However , the Intendant shall know of it , and I have no doubt that he will be discharged . ''
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 40]: `` Do nothing in a hurry , Oswald , '' replied Edward ; `` at present let him give his own version of the affair ; for he may prove more dangerous when discharged than when under your control .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 8]: Now sit down and take your supper .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 19]: Billy must have an hour to get his , and therefore there is no hurry for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 14]: `` That is your gipsy lad , Edward , is he not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 3]: said Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 15]: `` I like the boy 's looks ; but they are a queer race .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 31]: You must not trust him too much , '' continued Oswald , in an under tone , `` until you have tried him , and are satisfied of his fidelity .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 41]: They are very excitable , and capable of strong attachment if well treated , that I know ; for I did a gipsy a good turn once , and it proved to be the saving of my life afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 13]: `` Oh , tell us how , Oswald , '' said Alice .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 25]: `` It is too long a story now , my dear little lady , '' replied Oswald ; `` but I will another time .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 46]: Whatever he may do , do not strike him ; for they never forgive a blow , I am told by those who know them , and it never does them any good ; as I said before , they are a queer race . ''
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 49]: `` He will not be beaten by us , '' replied Humphrey , `` depend upon it , unless Edith slaps him ; for she is the one who takes most pains with him , and I presume he would not care much about her little hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 19]: `` No , no , '' replied Oswald , laughing , `` Edith may do as she pleases .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 8]: What does he do for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 20]: `` Oh , nothing as yet , for he is hardly recovered , poor fellow , '' replied Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 54]: `` He follows Edith , and helps her to look for the eggs ; and last night he set some springes after his own fashion , and certainly beat me , for he took three rabbits and a hare , while I , with all my traps , only took one rabbit . ''
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 33]: `` I think you had better leave that part of your livelihood entirely to him ; he has been bred up to it , Humphrey , and it will be his amusement .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 17]: You must not expect him to work very hard ; they are not accustomed to it .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 40]: They live a roving life , and never work if they can help it ; still , if you make him fond of you , he may be very useful , for they are very clever and handy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 28]: `` I hope to make him useful , '' replied Humphrey , `` but still I will not force him to do what he does not like .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 18]: He is very fond of the pony already , and likes to take care of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 22]: `` Bring him over to me , one of these days , so that he may know where to find me .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 20]: It may prove of consequence if you have a message to send , and can not come yourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 17]: `` That is very true , '' replied Edward ; `` I will not forget it .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 12]: Humphrey , shall you or I go with the cart ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 45]: `` Humphrey , by all means ; it will not do for them to suppose I had the cart from you , Edward ; they do not know Humphrey , and he will be off again in the morning before they are up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 8]: `` Very true , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 15]: `` And it is time for us to set off , '' replied Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 14]: `` Will Mistress Alice oblige me with something for my men to eat ?
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 9]: For they have fasted the whole day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 21]: `` Yes , '' replied Alice , `` I will have it ready before the pony is in the cart .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 9]: Edith , dear , come with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 22]: Humphrey then went out to harness the pony , and when all was ready , he and Oswald set off again .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 23]: When they arrived at the pit-fall they found Corbould lying between the two other verderers , who were sitting by his side .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 58]: Corbould was much recovered since his wound had been bound up , and he was raised up and put on the fodder which Humphrey had put into the cart , and they proceeded on their journey to the other side of the forest , the verderers eating what Humphrey had brought for them as they walked along .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 55]: It was a tedious and painful journey for the wounded man , who shrieked out when the cart was jolted by the wheel getting into a rut or hole ; but there was no help for it , and he was very much exhausted when they arrived , which was not till past midnight .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 42]: Corbould was then taken to his cottage and put on the bed , and another verderer sent for a surgeon : those who had been with Oswald were glad to go to bed , for it had been a fatiguing day .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 40]: Humphrey remained with Oswald for three hours , and then again returned with Billy , who , although he had crossed the forest three times in the twenty-four hours , appeared quite fresh and ready to go back again .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 38]: `` I will let you know how he gets on , Humphrey , and what account he gives of his falling into the pit ; but you must not expect me for a fortnight at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 27]: Humphrey wished Oswald good-bye ; and Billy was so anxious to get back to his stable that Humphrey could not keep him at a quiet pace .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 45]: `` Horses , and all animals indeed , know that there is no place like home ; it is a pity that men , who consider themselves much wiser , have not the same consideration , '' thought Humphrey as the pony trotted along .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 35]: Humphrey thought a good deal about the danger that Edward had been subjected to , and said to himself , `` I really think that I should be more comfortable if Edward was away .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 9]: I am always in a fidget about him .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 20]: I wish the new king , who is now in France , would raise an army and come over .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 27]: It is better that Edward should be fighting in the field than remain here and risk being shot as a deer-stealer , or put in prison .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 33]: The farm is sufficient for us all ; and when I have taken in more ground it will be more than sufficient , even if I do not kill the wild cattle .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 12]: I am fit for the farm , but Edward is not .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 15]: He is thrown away , living in this obscurity , and he feels it .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 16]: He will always be in hot water some way or another , that is certain .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 20]: What a narrow escape he has had with that scoundrel , and yet how little he cares for it !
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 38]: He was intended for a soldier , that is evident ; and if ever he is one , he will be in his element , and distinguish himself , if it pleases God to spare his life .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 46]: I 'll persuade him to stay at home a little while to help me to enclose the other piece of ground ; and after that is done , I 'll dig a saw-pit , and see if I can coax Pablo to saw with me .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 10]: I must go to Lymington and buy a saw .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 30]: If I once could get the trees sawed up into planks , what a quantity of things I could make , and how I could improve the place . ''
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 34]: Thus thought Humphrey as he went along ; he was all for the farm and improvements , and was always calculating when he should have another calf or a fresh litter of pigs .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 60]: His first idea was , that he would make Pablo work hard ; but the advice he had received from Oswald was not forgotten ; and he now was thinking how he should coax Pablo into standing below in the saw-pit , which was not only hard work , but disagreeable , from the sawdust falling into the eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 31]: Humphrey 's cogitations were interrupted by a halloo , and turning round in the direction of the voice , he perceived Edward , and turned the cart to join him .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 19]: `` You 're just come in time , Humphrey ; I have some provision for Alice 's larder .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 26]: I took my gun and came out on the path which I knew you would return on , and I have killed a young buck .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 13]: He is good meat , and we are scarce of provisions . ''
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 27]: Humphrey helped Edward to put the venison in the cart , and they returned to the cottage , which was not more than three miles off .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 30]: Humphrey told Edward the result of his journey , and then proposed that Edward should stop at home for a few days and help him with the new enclosure .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 43]: To this Edward cheerfully consented ; and as soon as they arrived at the cottage , and Humphrey had had his breakfast , they took their axes and went out to fell at a cluster of small spruce-firs about a mile off .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOURTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 13]: `` Now , Humphrey , what do you propose to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 28]: `` This , '' replied Humphrey : `` I have marked out three acres or thereabouts of the land running in a straight line behind the garden .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 15]: There is not a tree on it , and it is all good feeding-ground .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 42]: What I intend to do is to enclose it with the spruce-fir posts and rails that we are about to cut down , and then set a hedge upon a low bank which I shall raise all round inside the rails .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 42]: I know where there are thousands of seedling thorns , which I shall take up in the winter , or early in the spring , to put in , as the bank will be ready for them by that time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 30]: `` Well , that 's all very good ; but I fear it will be a long while before you have such a quantity of land dug up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 80]: `` Yes , of course it will ; but , Edward , I have plenty of manure to spare , and I shall put it all over this land , and then it will become a rich pasture , and also an earlier pasture than what we can get from the forest , and will be very handy to turn the cows and the calves upon ; or even Billy , if we want him in a hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 32]: `` All that is very true , '' replied Edward , `` so that it will be useful , at all events , if you do not dig it up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 22]: `` Indeed it will , '' replied Humphrey ; `` I only wish it were six acres instead of three . ''
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 48]: `` I ca n't say I do , '' replied Edward , laughing ; `` you are too grand in your ideas ; only think what a quantity of spruces we shall have to cut down on it , to post and rail what you just propose .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 25]: Let it be three acres first , Humphrey ; and when they are enclosed , you may begin to talk of three more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 14]: `` Well , perhaps you are right , Edward , '' said Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 29]: `` Why , here 's Pablo coming after us : he 's not coming to work , I presume , but to amuse himself by looking on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 24]: `` I do n't think he is strong enough to do much hard work , Humphrey , although he appears very ingenious . ''
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 39]: `` No , I agree with you ; and if he is to work , depend upon it it must not be by having work set out for him ; he would take a disgust to it directly .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 8]: I have another plan for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 9]: `` And what is that , Humphrey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 27]: `` I shall not set him anything to do , and shall make him believe that I do not think he is able to do anything .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 43]: That will pique him , and I think by that means I shall get more work out of him than you would think , especially when , after he has done it , I express my wonder and give him praise . ''
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 24]: `` Not a bad idea , that ; you will work upon his pride , which is probably stronger than his laziness . ''
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 52]: `` I do not think him lazy , but I think him unused to hard work , and , having lived a life of wandering and idleness , not very easy to be brought to constant and daily work , except by degrees , and by the means which I propose .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 53]: -- Here we are , '' continued Humphrey , throwing his axe and billhook down , and proceeding to take off his doublet : `` now for an hour or two 's fulfilment of the sentence of our first parents -- to wit , ` the sweat of the brow . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 34]: Edward followed Humphrey 's example in taking off his doublet ; they selected the long thin trees most fitted for rails , and were hard at work when Pablo came up to them .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 26]: More than a dozen trees had fallen , and lay one upon the other , before they stopped a while to recover themselves a little .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 32]: `` Well , Pablo , '' said Humphrey , wiping his forehead , `` I suppose you think looking on better than cutting down trees ; and so it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 8]: `` What cut down trees for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 12]: `` To make posts and rails to fence in more ground .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 9]: I shall not leave the boughs on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 23]: `` No , cut them off by and by , and then put poles on the cart and carry them home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 22]: Edward and Humphrey then recommenced their labour , and worked for another half-hour , when they paused to recover their wind .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 10]: `` Hard work , Pablo , '' said Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 13]: `` Yes , very hard work ; Pablo not strong enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 18]: `` Oh no , you are not able to do anything of this kind , I know .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 16]: No work this for gipsies ; they take birds ' nests and catch rabbits . ''
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 16]: `` Yes , '' replied Pablo , nodding ; `` and you eat them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 35]: `` So he does , Pablo , '' said Edward ; `` so you are useful in your way ; for if he had nothing to eat he would not be able to work .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 12]: Strong man cut down trees , weak man catch rabbits . ''
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 8]: `` Both good , '' said Pablo .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 18]: `` Yes , but strong man like work ; not strong man not like work , Pablo .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 14]: So now look on again , for we must have another spell . ''
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 41]: `` Strong man cut down trees , not strong man cut off branches , '' said Pablo , taking up the billhook and setting to work to cut off the boughs , which he did with great dexterity and rapidity .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 24]: Edward and Humphrey exchanged glances and smiles , and then worked away in silence till it was , as they supposed , dinner-time .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 33]: They were not wrong in their supposition , although they had no other clock than their appetites , which , however , tell the time pretty correctly to those who work hard .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 19]: Alice had the platters on the table , and was looking out to see if they were coming .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 12]: `` Why , Pablo , have you been at work ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 3]: said Edith .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 12]: `` Yes , little missy -- work all the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 20]: `` Indeed he has , and has worked very well , and been very useful , '' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 18]: `` It has given you an appetite for your dinner , Pablo , has it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 3]: said Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 11]: `` Have that without work , '' replied the boy .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 50]: `` Pablo , you are a very good gipsy boy , '' said Edith , patting his head with a patronising air ; `` I shall let you walk out with me and carry the basket to put the eggs in when you come home in the evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 12]: `` That is a reward , '' said Humphrey , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 41]: After dinner they continued their labour , and by supper-time had so many trees cut down , that they determined to carry home the next day , and lay them along , to see how many more they would want .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 30]: While they put the trees in the cart and took them home , Pablo contrived to lop off the boughs and prepare the poles for them to take away .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 45]: As soon as they had cut down sufficient and carted them home , they then selected shorter trees for posts ; and when Pablo had cleared them of the boughs , they sawed them out the proper lengths , and then carted them home .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 20]: This occupied nearly the whole week , and then they proceeded to dig holes and set the posts in .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 36]: The railing was then to be nailed to the posts , and that occupied them three days more ; so that it was altogether a fortnight of hard work before the three acres were enclosed .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 50]: `` There , '' said Humphrey , `` that 's a good job over ; many thanks , Edward , for your assistance ; and thank you too , Pablo , for you really have helped us very much indeed , and are a very useful , good boy .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 37]: Now for raising the bank -- that I must do when I can spare time ; but my garden is overrun with weeds , and I must get Edith and Alice to help me there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 33]: `` If you do n't want me any longer , Humphrey , '' said Edward , `` I think I shall go over to see Oswald , and take Pablo with me .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 63]: I want to know how that fellow Corbould is , and what he says ; and whether the Intendant has come back ; not that I shall go near him or his good little daughter , but I think I may as well go , and it will be a good opportunity of showing Pablo the way to Oswald 's cottage . ''
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 34]: `` I think so too ; and when you come back , Edward , one of us must go to Lymington ; for I require some tools , and Pablo is very ragged .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 20]: He must have some better clothes than these old ones of ours if he is to be sent messages .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 7]: Do n't you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 6]: `` Certainly I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 12]: `` And I want a thousand things , '' said Alice .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 15]: `` Indeed , mistress , wo n't less than a thousand content you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 28]: `` Yes , perhaps not quite a thousand , but I really do want a great many , and I will make you a list of them .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 36]: I have not pans enough for my milk ; I want salt ; I want tubs ; but I will make out a list , and you will find it a very long one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 16]: `` Well , I hope you have something to sell to pay for them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 12]: `` Yes ; I have plenty of butter salted down . ''
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 8]: `` What have you , Edith ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 47]: `` Oh , my chickens are not large enough yet : as soon as they are , Humphrey must get me some ducks and geese , for I mean to keep some ; and by and by I will have some turkeys ; but not yet .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 18]: I must wait till Humphrey builds me the new house for them he has promised me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 39]: `` I think you are right , Edith , about the ducks and geese ; they will do well on the water behind the yard , and I will dig you out a bigger pool for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 35]: `` Edith , my dear , your little fingers are just made to weed my onions well , and I wish you would do it to-morrow morning , if you have time . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 18]: _ Yes _ , Humphrey , but my little fingers wo n't smell very nice afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 22]: `` Not till you have washed them , I guess ; but there is soap and water , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 38]: `` Yes , I know there is ; but if I weed the onions I can not help Alice to make the butter ; however , if Alice can do without me I will do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 21]: `` I want some more seeds sadly , '' said Humphrey , `` and I must make out my list .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 22]: I must go to Lymington myself this time , Edward ; for you will be puzzled with all our wants . ''
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 35]: `` Not if I know exactly what you do want ; but as I really do not , and probably should make mistakes , I think it will be better if you do go .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 30]: But it is bedtime , and as I shall start early , good-night , sisters ; I beg you will let me have something to eat before I start .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 35]: I shall try for some venison , as I come back , and shall take Smoker with me : he is quite well again , and his ribs are as stout as ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 59]: `` And , Edward , '' said Alice , `` I wish , when you kill any venison , that you would bring home some of those parts which you usually throw away , for I assure you , now that we have three dogs , I hardly know how to find enough for them to eat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 20]: `` I 'll not fail , Alice , '' replied Edward , `` and now once more good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 23]: Early the next morning Edward took his gun , and , with Pablo and Smoker , set off for Oswald 's cottage .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 48]: Edward talked a great deal with Pablo relative to his former life ; and , by the answers which the boy gave him , was satisfied that , notwithstanding his doubtful way of bringing up , the lad was not corrupted , but was a well-minded boy .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 45]: As they walked through a grove of trees , Edward still talking , Pablo stopped and put his hand before Edward 's mouth , and then stooping down , at the same time seizing Smoker by the neck , he pointed with his finger .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 23]: Edward at first could see nothing , but eventually he made out the horns of an animal just rising above a hillock .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 9]: It was evidently one of the wild cattle .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 18]: Edward cocked his gun and advanced cautiously , while Pablo remained where he was , holding Smoker .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 33]: As soon as he was near enough to hit the head of the animal , Edward levelled and fired , and Pablo let Smoker loose , who bounded forward over the hillock .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 23]: They followed the dog , and found him about to seize a calf which stood by a heifer that Edward had shot .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 29]: Edward called him over and went up to the animal ; it was a fine young heifer , and the calf was not more than a fortnight old .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 13]: `` We can not stop now , Pablo , '' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 26]: `` Humphrey would like to have the calf , and we must take our chance of its remaining by its mother till we come back .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 17]: I think it will for a day or two , so let us push on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 17]: No further adventure happened , and they arrived a little after noon at Oswald 's cottage .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 29]: He was not at home ; his wife saying that she believed that he was with the Intendant , who had come back from London the day before .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 17]: `` But I will put on my hood and see , '' said the young woman .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 9]: In a few minutes she returned with Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 40]: `` I am glad that you have come , sir , '' said Oswald , as Edward extended his hand , `` as I have just seen the Intendant , and he has been asking many questions about you .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 25]: I am certain he thinks that you are not the grandson of Jacob Armitage , and that he supposes I know who you are .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 37]: He asked me where your cottage was , and whether I could not take him to it , as he wished to speak to you , and said that he felt great interest about you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 8]: `` And what did you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 52]: `` I said that your cottage was a good day 's journey from here , and I was not certain that I knew the exact way , as I had been there but seldom ; but that I knew where to find it , after I saw the forests of Arnwood .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 17]: I told him about Corbould and his attempt upon you , and he was very wroth .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 37]: I never saw him moved before ; and young Mistress Patience , she was indeed angry and perplexed , and begged her father to send the assailant away as soon as he could be moved . ''
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 33]: `` Master Heatherstone replied , ` Leave it to me , my dear ; ' and then asked me what account Corbould gave of himself , and his falling into the pit .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 50]: I told him that Corbould stated that he was following a deer , which he had severely wounded about noon-day , and having no dog with him , he could not overtake it , although he knew by its bleeding track that it could not hold out much longer .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 24]: That he followed it until nightfall , and had it in view and close to him when he fell into the pit . ''
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 37]: `` Well , the story was not badly made up , '' said Edward , `` only for a _ stag _ read _ man _ ; and what did the Intendant say to that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 51]: `` He said that he believed you , and that Corbould 's story was false -- as , if it had been a stag that he was following , no one would have known that he had fallen into the pit , and he would have remained there till now .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 59]: I quite forgot to say , that when the Intendant said that he wished to call at your cottage , the young mistress said that she would go with him , as you had told her that you had two sisters living with you , and she wished very much to see them and make their acquaintance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 21]: `` I am afraid that we shall not be able to prevent this visit , Oswald , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 15]: `` He is in command here , and the forest is in his charge .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 6]: We must see to it .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 22]: I only should like , if possible , to have notice of his coming , that we may be prepared . ''
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 17]: `` You need no preparation , sir , if he should come , '' replied Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 30]: `` Very true , '' said Edward ; `` we have nothing to conceal , and if he finds us in a pickle it is of no consequence . ''
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 11]: `` Rather the better , sir , '' replied Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 39]: `` Let your sisters be at the wash-tub , and you and your brother carting manure ; he will then be more likely to have no suspicion of your being otherwise than what you assume to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 12]: `` Have you heard any news from London , Oswald ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 5]: `` Not as yet .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 22]: I was away yesterday evening , when Master Heatherstone came back , and I have not seen his man this morning .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 33]: While you eat your dinner I will go into the kitchen ; and if he is not there , Phoebe will be sure to tell me all that she has heard . ''
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 22]: `` Do not say that I am here , Oswald , as I do not wish to see the Intendant . ''
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 31]: `` Mum 's the word , sir ; but you must stay in the cottage , or others will see you , and it may come to his ears . ''
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 23]: Oswald 's wife then put before him a large pie , and some wheaten bread , with a biggin of good beer .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 28]: Edward helped Pablo to a large allowance , and then filled his own platter ; while thus occupied Oswald Partridge had left the cottage , as agreed .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 8]: `` What do you say , Pablo ?
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 10]: Do you think you can walk back to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 5]: Like walking at night .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 11]: My people always do ; sleep in a daytime . ''
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 47]: `` Well , I think it will be better to go home : Oswald has only one bed , and I do not wish them to know that I am here ; so Pablo , eat heartily , and then we shall not be so tired .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 16]: I want to get home , that I may send Humphrey after the calf . ''
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 12]: `` One bed here ; you stay , '' replied Pablo .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 10]: `` I go home and tell Master Humphrey . ''
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 16]: `` Do you think you would be able to find your way , Pablo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 13]: `` Once go one way , always know same way again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 18]: `` You are a clever fellow , Pablo , and I have a mind to try you .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 5]: Now drink some beer .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 47]: I think , Pablo , you shall go home , and tell Humphrey that I and Smoker will be where the heifer lies dead , and have it skinned by nine o'clock to-morrow morning ; so if he comes , he will find me there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 8]: `` Yes , I go now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 15]: `` No , not now , you must rest yourself a little more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 19]: `` Pablo not tired , '' replied the gipsy , getting up ; `` be back before supper .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 20]: As I go along , look at calf and dead cow -- see if calf stay with mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 20]: `` Very well , then , if you wish it , you may go now , '' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 8]: Pablo nodded his head , and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 9]: A few minutes afterwards Oswald made his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 7]: `` Is the boy gone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 30]: `` Yes ; he is gone back to the cottage ; '' and Edward then stated how he had killed the heifer , and wanted to obtain the calf .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 21]: `` I 've an idea that you will find that boy very useful , if he is properly managed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 27]: `` I think so too , '' replied Edward ; `` and I am glad to perceive that he is already attached to all of us .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 7]: We treat him as ourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 17]: `` You are right ; and now for the news that I have to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 22]: The Duke Hamilton , the Earl of Holland , and Lord Capel have been tried , condemned , and executed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 3]: Edward sighed .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 4]: `` More murder !
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 13]: But we must expect it from those who have murdered their king .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 5]: Is that all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 17]: King Charles the Second has been proclaimed in Scotland , and invited to come over . ''
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 10]: `` That is indeed news , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 7]: `` Where is he now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 17]: `` At the Hague ; but it was said that he was going to Paris . ''
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 10]: `` That is all that you have heard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 15]: `` Yes ; that was what was current when Master Heatherstone was in town .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 40]: His man Sampson gave me the news ; and he further said , ` That his master 's journey to London was to oppose the execution of the three lords ; but it was all in vain . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 34]: `` Well , '' replied Edward , after a pause , `` if the king does come over , there will be some work cut out for some of us , I expect .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 25]: Your news has put me in a fever , '' continued Edward , taking up the biggin and drinking a large draught of beer .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 26]: `` I thought it would , '' replied Oswald ; `` but until the time comes , the more quiet you keep the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 21]: `` Yes , Oswald ; but I ca n't talk any more ; I must be left alone to think .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 16]: I will go to bed , as I shall be off early in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 8]: Is that fellow Corbould getting well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 34]: `` Yes , sir ; he is out of bed , and walks a little with a stick ; but he is still very lame , and will be for some time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 19]: `` Good-night , Oswald ; if I have anything to say I will write and send the boy .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 12]: I do not want to be seen here any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 8]: `` It will be best , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 25]: Good-night ; I will put Smoker in the kennel to the right , as he will not be friendly with the other dogs . ''
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 10]: Edward retired to bed , but not to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 12]: The Scots had proclaimed the king , and invited him over .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 26]: `` He will surely come , '' thought Edward , `` and he will have an army round him as soon as he lands . ''
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 85]: Edward made up his resolution to join the army as soon as he had heard that the king had landed ; and what with considering how he should be able so to do , and afterwards building castles as to what he would do , it was long before he fell asleep ; and when he did , he dreamt of battles and victory -- he was charging at the head of his troops -- he was surrounded by the dying and the dead .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 81]: He was wounded , and he was somehow or another well again , as if by magic ; and then the scene was changed , and he was rescuing Patience Heatherstone from his own lawless men , and preserving the life of her father , which was about to be sacrificed ; and at last he awoke , and found that the daylight peeped through the windows , and that he had slept longer than he had intended to do .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 32]: He arose and dressed himself quickly , and , not waiting for breakfast , went to the kennel , released Smoker from his durance , and set off on his return .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 15]: Before nine o'clock he had arrived at the spot where the heifer lay dead .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 15]: He found the calf still by its side , bleating and walking round uneasily .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 18]: As he approached with the dog , it went to a farther distance , and there remained .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 19]: Edward took out his knife , and commenced skinning the heifer , and then took out the inside .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 18]: The animal was quite fresh and good , but not very fat , as may be supposed .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 27]: While thus occupied Smoker growled and then sprang forward , bounding away in the direction of the cottage , and Edward thought Humphrey was at hand .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 29]: In a few minutes the pony and cart appeared between the trees , with Humphrey and Pablo in it , and Smoker leaping up at his friend Billy .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 30]: `` Good-morning , Humphrey , '' said Edward , `` I am almost ready for you ; but the question is , how are we to take the calf ?
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 9]: It is as wild as a deer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 18]: `` It will be a puzzler , without Smoker can run it down , '' said Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 12]: `` I take him , with Smoker , '' said Pablo .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 10]: `` How will you take it , Pablo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 50]: Pablo went to the cart and took out a long small cord which Humphrey had brought with them , and made a noose at one end ; he coiled the rope in his hand , and then threw it out to its full length , by way of trial .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 13]: `` This way I take him , suppose I get near enough .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 11]: This way take bulls in Spain : call him lasso .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 6]: Now come with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 33]: Pablo had his rope again coiled in his hand , and then went round to the other side of the calf , which still remained lowing at about 200 yards ' distance .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 9]: `` Now tell Smoker , '' cried Pablo .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 40]: Humphrey set Smoker upon the calf , which retreated from the dog , presenting his head to run at it ; and Pablo kept behind the animal , while Smoker attacked it , and drove it near to him .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 41]: As soon as the calf , which was so busy with the dog that it did not perceive Pablo , came sufficiently near to him , Pablo threw his rope , and caught the loop round the animal 's neck .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 25]: The calf set off galloping towards Humphrey , and dragging Pablo after him , for the latter was not strong enough to hold it .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 40]: Humphrey went to his assistance , and then Edward , and the calf was thrown down by Smoker , who seized it by the neck , and it was tied and put on the cart in a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 6]: `` Well done , Pablo !
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 19]: You are a clever fellow , '' said Edward , `` and this calf shall be yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 17]: `` It is a cow-calf , '' said Humphrey , `` which I am glad of .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 20]: Pablo , you did that well , and , as Edward says , the calf belongs to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 8]: Pablo looked pleased , but said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 31]: The meat and hide were put into the cart with some of the offal which Alice had asked for the dogs , and they set off on their return home .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 66]: Humphrey was very anxious to go to Lymington , and was not sorry that he had some meat to take with him : he determined to get off the next morning ; and Edward proposed that he should take Pablo with him , that he might know the way there in case of any emergency , for they both felt that Pablo could be trusted .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 34]: Edward said he would remain at home with his sisters , and see if he could be of any use to Alice ; if not , there would be work in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 23]: Humphrey and Pablo went away after breakfast , with Billy , and the meat and skin of the heifer in the cart .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 85]: Humphrey had also a large basket of eggs and three dozen of chickens from Alice to be disposed of , and a list as long as the tail of a kite of articles which she and Edith required ; fortunately there was nothing very expensive on the list , long as it was ; but women in those day 's required needles , pins , buttons , tapes , thread , worsted , and a hundred other little necessaries , as they do now .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 31]: As soon as they were gone Edward , who was still castle-building instead of offering his services to Alice , brought out his father 's sword and commenced cleaning it .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 42]: When he had polished it up to his satisfaction , he felt less inclined than ever to do anything ; so after dinner he took his gun and walked out into the forest , that he might indulge in his reveries .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 67]: He walked on , quite unconscious of the direction in which he was going , and more than once finding his hat knocked off his head by the branch of a tree which he had not perceived -- for the best of all possible reasons , because his eyes were cast on the ground -- when his ears were saluted with the neighing of a horse .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 30]: He looked up and perceived that he was near to a herd of forest ponies , the first that he had seen since he had lived in the forest .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 10]: This roused him , and he looked about him .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 10]: `` Where can I have been wandering to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 32]: thought Edward : `` I never fell in with any of the forest ponies before ; I must therefore have walked in a direction quite contrary to what I usually do .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 15]: I do not know where I am ; the scenery is new to me .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 6]: What a fool I am .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 36]: It 's lucky that nobody except Humphrey digs pitfalls , or I should probably have been in one by this time ; and I 've brought out my gun and left the dog at home .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 12]: Well , I suppose I can find my way back . ''
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 18]: Edward then surveyed the whole herd of ponies , which were at no great distance from him .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 20]: There was a fine horse or two among them , which appeared to be the leaders of the herd .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 33]: They allowed Edward to approach to within two hundred yards , and then , with manes and tails streaming in the air , they darted off with the rapidity of the wind .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 15]: `` Now I 'll puzzle Humphrey when I go back , '' thought Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 19]: `` He says that Billy is getting old , and that he wishes he could get another pony .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 22]: I will tell him what a plenty there are , and propose that he should invent some way of catching one .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 23]: That will be a poser for him ; yet I 'm sure that he 'll try , for he is very ingenious .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 14]: And now which way am I to turn to find my way home ?
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 15]: I think it ought to be to the north ; but which is north ?
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 17]: For there is no sun out , and now I perceive it looks very like rain .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 9]: I wonder how long I have been walking !
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 9]: I 'm sure I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 42]: Edward then hurried in a direction which he considered might lead him homeward , and walked fast ; but he once more fell into his habit of castle-building , and was talking to himself : `` The king proclaimed in Scotland !
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 69]: He will come over of course : I will join his army -- and then -- '' Thus he went on , again absorbed in the news which he had gained from Oswald , till on a sudden he again recollected himself , and perceived that he had lost sight of the copse of trees on a high hill , to which he had been directing his steps .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 4]: Where was it ?
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 20]: He turned round and round , and at last found out that he had been walking away from it .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 31]: `` I must dream no more , '' thought he ; `` or if I do indulge in any more day-dreams , I certainly shall neither sleep nor dream to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 22]: It is getting dark already , and here am I lost in the forest , and all through my own foolishness .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 72]: If the stars do not shine , I shall not know how to direct my steps ; indeed , if they do , I do n't know whether I have walked south or north , and I am in a pretty pickle ; -- not that I care for being out in the forest on a night like this ; but my sisters and Humphrey will be alarmed at my absence .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 40]: The best thing I can do , is to decide upon taking some straight line , and continue in it : I must then get out of the forest at last , even if I walk right across it .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 31]: That will be better than going backwards and forwards , or round and round , as I otherwise shall do , just like a puppy running after its own tail .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 8]: So now shine out , stars . ''
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 22]: Edward waited until he could make out Charles 's Wain , which he well knew , and then the Polar Star .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 42]: As soon as he was certain of that , he resolved to travel by it due north , and he did so , sometimes walking fast , and at others keeping up a steady trot for half a mile without stopping .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 71]: As he was proceeding on his travels , he observed , under some trees ahead of him , a spark of fire emitted ; he thought it was a glow-worm at first ; but it was more like the striking of a flint against steel ; and as he saw it a second time , he stopped , that he might ascertain what it might be before he advanced farther .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIFTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 38]: It was now very dark , as there was no moon , and the stars were often obscured by the clouds , which were heavy , and borne along by the wind , which was very high .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 31]: The light again appeared , and this time Edward heard the clash of the flint against the steel , and he was certain that it was somebody striking a light .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 19]: He advanced very cautiously , and arrived at a large tree , behind which he remained to reconnoitre .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 91]: The people , whoever they might be , were not more than thirty yards from him ; a light spread its rays for a moment or two , and he could make out a figure kneeling and holding his hat to protect it from the wind ; then it burnt brighter , and he saw that a lantern had been lighted , and then again , of a sudden , all was dark again : so Edward immediately satisfied himself that a dark lantern had been lighted and then closed .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 34]: Who the parties might be he of course had no idea ; but he was resolved that he would ascertain , if he could , before he accosted them and asked his way .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 30]: `` They have no dog , '' thought Edward , `` or it would have growled before this ; and it 's lucky that I have none either . ''
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 37]: Edward then crept softly nearer to them : the wind , which was strong , blew from where they were to where Edward stood , so that there was less chance of their hearing his approach .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 37]: Edward went on his hands and knees , and crawled through the fern until he gained another tree , and within ten yards of them , and from where he could hear what they might say .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 49]: He was thus cautious , as he had been told by Oswald that there were many disbanded soldiers who had taken up their quarters in the forest , and had committed several depredations upon the houses adjacent to it , always returning to the forest as a rendezvous .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 15]: Edward listened , and heard one say : `` It is not time yet !
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 13]: No , no : too soon by half an hour or more .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 26]: The people from Lymington who buy him what he wants always bring it to him at night , that his retreat may not be discovered .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 28]: They sometimes do not leave the cottage till two hours after dark , for they do not leave Lymington to go there till it is dark ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 14]: `` Do you know who it is who supplies him with food ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 18]: `` Yes , the people at the inn in Parliament Street -- I forget the sign . ''
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 3]: I know .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 12]: Yes , the landlord is a downright Malignant in his heart !
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 15]: We might squeeze him well , if we dared show ourselves in Lymington . ''
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 23]: `` Yes , but they would squeeze our necks tighter than would be agreeable , I expect , '' replied the other .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 10]: `` Are you sure that he has money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 43]: `` Quite sure ; for I peeped through the chinks of the window-shutters , and I saw him pay for the things brought to him ; it was from a canvas bag , and it was gold that he took out . ''
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 15]: `` And where did he put the bag after he had paid them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 38]: `` That I ca n't tell , for as I knew that they would come out as soon as they were paid , I was obliged to beat a retreat , lest I should be seen . ''
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 13]: `` Well , then , how is it to be managed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 73]: `` We must first tap at the door , and try if we can get in as benighted travellers : if that wo n't do , and I fear it will not , while you remain begging for admittance at the door , and keep him occupied , I will try the door behind , that leads into the garden ; and if not the door , I will try the window .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 25]: I have examined them both well , and have been outside when he has shut up his shutters , and I know the fastenings .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 12]: With a pane out , I could open them immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 12]: `` Is there anybody else besides him in the cottage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 17]: `` Yes , a lad who attends him , and goes to Lymington for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 5]: `` No women ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 5]: `` Not one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 10]: `` But do you think we two are sufficient ?
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 8]: Had we not better get more help ?
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 14]: There is Broom , and Black , the gipsy , at the rendezvous .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 19]: I can go for them , and be back in time : they are stout and true . ''
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 8]: `` Stout enough , but not true .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 24]: No , no , I want no sharers in this business , and you know how ill they behaved in the last affair .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 11]: I 'll swear that they only produced half the swag .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 17]: I like honour between gentlemen and soldiers ; and that 's why I have chosen you .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 9]: I know I can trust you , Benjamin .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 10]: It 's time now -- what do you say ?
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 14]: We are two to one , for I count the boy as nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 5]: Shall we start ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 6]: `` I am with you .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 17]: You say there 's a bag of gold , and that 's worth fighting for . ''
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 53]: `` Yes , Ben , and I 'll tell you : with what I 've got buried , and my share of that bag , I shall have enough , I think ; and I 'll start for the Low Countries , for England 's getting rather too warm for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 36]: `` Well , I sha n't go yet , '' replied Benjamin ; `` I do n't like your foreign parts ; they have no good ale , and I ca n't understand their talk .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 39]: I 'd sooner remain in jolly old England with a halter twisted ready for me , than pass my life with such a set of chaps who drink nothing but Scheidam , and wear twenty pair of breeches .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 50]: Come , let 's be off : if we get the money , you shall go to the Low Countries , Will , and I 'll start for the north , where they do n't know me -- for if you go , I wo n't stay here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 60]: The two men then rose up ; and the one whose name appeared to be Will , first examined if the candle in his dark lantern burnt well ; and then they both set off , followed by Edward , who had heard quite enough to satisfy him that they were bent upon a burglary -- if not murder .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 59]: Edward followed them , so as to keep their forms indistinctly in sight , which was as much as he could do at twenty yards ' distance : fortunately the wind was so high that they did not hear his footsteps , although he often trod upon a rotten stick , which snapped as it broke in twain .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 37]: As near as Edward could guess , he had tracked them for about three miles , when they stopped , and he perceived that they were examining their pistols , which they took from their belts .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 32]: They then went on again , and entered a small plantation of oak-trees , of about forty years ' growth -- very thick and very dark , with close underwood below .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 50]: They followed each other through a narrow path , until they came to a cleared place in the middle of the plantation , in which there stood a low cottage , surrounded with covert on every side , with the exception of some thirty yards of land around it .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 32]: All was still , and as dark as pitch ; Edward remained behind the trees , and when the two men again stopped , he was not six feet from them .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 22]: They consulted in a low tone , but the wind was so high that he could not distinguish what they said .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 33]: At last they advanced to the cottage , and Edward , still keeping within the trees , shifted his position so that he should be opposite the gable end of the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 27]: He observed one man to go up to the front door , while the other went round to the door behind , as had been agreed .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 31]: Edward threw open the pan of the lock of the gun , and reprimed it , that he might be sure , and then waited for what was to follow .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 57]: He heard the man Will at the front door , talking and asking for shelter in a plaintive but loud voice ; and shortly afterwards he perceived a light through the chinks of the shutters -- for Edward was continually altering his position to see what was going on in the front and in the back .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 65]: At one time he thought of levelling his gun and killing one of the men at once ; but he could not make up his mind to do that , as a burglary , although intended , had not yet been committed ; so he remained passive until the attack was really made , when he resolved that he would come to the rescue .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 62]: After some minutes of entreaty that they would open the door , the man in front commenced thumping and beating against it , as if he would make them open the door by force ; but this was to attract the attention of those within , and divert it from the attempts that the other was making to get in behind .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 20]: Edward was aware of this : he now kept his eye upon what was going on at the back .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 59]: Advancing nearer , which he ventured to do now that both the men were so occupied , he perceived that the fellow had contrived to open the window close to the back door , and was remaining quite close to it with a pistol in his hand , apparently not wishing to run the risk of climbing in .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 26]: Edward slipped under the eaves of the cottage , not six feet from the man , who remained with his back partly turned towards him .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 18]: Edward then finding he had obtained this position unperceived , crouched down with his gun ready pointed .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 23]: As Edward remained in this position , he heard a shrill voice cry out , `` They are getting in behind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 7]: and a movement in the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 23]: The man near him , who had his pistol in his hand , put his arm through the window and fired inside .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 21]: A shriek was given , and Edward fired his gun into the body of the man , who immediately fell .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 41]: Edward lost no time in reloading his gun , during which he heard the bursting open of the front door and the report of firearms ; then all was silent for a moment , excepting the wailing of somebody within .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 35]: As soon as his gun was reloaded Edward walked round to the front of the cottage , where he found the man who was called Ben lying across the threshold of the open door .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 30]: He stepped across the body , and , looking into the room within , perceived a body stretched on the floor , and a young lad weeping over it .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 63]: `` Do n't be alarmed , I am a friend , '' said Edward , going in to where the body lay ; and taking the light which was at the farther end of the chamber , he placed it on the floor , that he might examine the state of the person who was breathing heavily , and apparently badly wounded .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 25]: `` Rise up , my lad , '' said Edward , `` and let me see if I can be of any use . ''
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 23]: No , '' cried the boy , throwing back his long hair from his temples , `` he bleeds to death ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 27]: `` Bring me some water quick , '' said Edward , `` there 's a good lad , while I see where he is hurt . ''
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 43]: The boy ran up to fetch the water , and Edward discovered that the ball had entered the neck , above the collar-bone , and that the blood poured out of the man 's mouth , who was choking with the effusion .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 43]: Although ignorant of surgery , Edward thought that such a wound must be mortal ; but the man was not only alive but sensible , and although he could not utter a word , he spoke with his eyes and with signs .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 50]: He raised his hand and pointed to himself first , and shook his head , as if to say that it was all over with him ; and then he turned round his head , as if looking for the lad , who was now returning with the water .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 41]: When the lad again knelt by his side , weeping bitterly , the man pointed to him , and gave such an imploring look that Edward immediately comprehended what he wished ; it was to ask protection for the boy .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 19]: It could not be misunderstood , and could Edward do otherwise than promise it to the dying man ?
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 31]: His generous nature could not refuse it , and he said , `` I understand you ; you wish me to take care of your boy when you are gone .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 6]: Is it not so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 5]: The man signified assent .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 9]: `` I promise you I will do so .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 17]: I will take him into my own family , and he shall share with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 32]: The man raised his hand again , and a gleam of joy passed over his features as he took the hand of the lad and put it into that of Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 55]: His eyes were then fixed upon Edward , as if to scrutinise into his character by his features , while the former bathed his temples and washed the blood from his mouth with the water brought by the boy , who appeared in a state of grief so violent as to paralyse his senses .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 25]: After a minute or two another effusion of blood choked the wounded man , who , after a short struggle , fell back dead .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 6]: `` He is gone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 12]: thought Edward , `` and now what is to be done ?
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 14]: I must first ascertain whether the two villains are dead or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 32]: Edward took a light and examined the body of Ben , lying over the threshold of the door ; the man was quite dead , the ball having entered his brain .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 97]: He was proceeding round the outside of the cottage to examine the state of the other man , whom he had shot himself ; but the wind nearly blew out the light , and he therefore returned to the chamber and placed it on the floor , near to where the boy lay insensible over the corpse of the man who had died in the arms of Edward ; and then went out without a light , and with his gun , to the other side of the cottage , where the other robber had fallen .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 19]: As he approached the man , a faint voice was heard to say : `` Ben , Ben !
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 9]: Some water , for the love of God !
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 8]: Ben , I 'm done for ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 53]: Edward , without giving an answer , went back to the room for the water , which he took round to the man , and put it to his lips ; he felt that he was bound by humanity so to do to a dying man , scoundrel though he might be .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 23]: It was still dark , but not so dark as it had previously been , for the late moon was just rising .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 25]: The man drank the water eagerly , and said , `` Ben , I can speak now , but I sha n't long . ''
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 35]: He then pulled the basin towards him again , and after he had drunk , he said in broken sentences , `` I feel -- that I am bleeding to death -- inside . ''
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 4]: Then he paused .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 17]: `` You know the oak -- struck by lightning -- a mile north -- of this .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 5]: I 'm going fast .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 17]: Three yards from it south -- I buried all my -- money ; it 's yours .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 6]: Oh , another drink ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 27]: The man again attempted to drink out of the basin proffered by Edward ; but as he made the attempt he fell back with a groan .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 30]: Edward , perceiving that he was dead , returned to the cottage to look after the lad , who still remained prostrate and embracing the corpse in the chamber .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 10]: Edward then reflected upon what had best be done .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 26]: After a time he decided upon dragging away the body of the robber named Ben outside of the threshold , and then securing the door .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 23]: This , with some trouble , he effected , and he then made fast the window that had been forced open behind .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 34]: Before he removed the boy , who lay with his face buried on the corpse , and appeared to be in a state of insensibility , Edward examined the corpse as it lay .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 49]: Although plainly dressed , yet it was evident that it was not the body of a rustic ; the features were fair , and the beard was carefully cut ; the hands were white , and the fingers long , and evidently had never been employed in labour .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 32]: That the body was that of some superior person disguised as a rustic , was evident , and this was corroborated by the conversation which took place between the two robbers .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 4]: `` Alas ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 23]: thought Edward , `` the family of Arnwood appear not to be the only people who are in disguise in this forest .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 4]: That poor boy !
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 7]: He must not remain there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 47]: Edward looked round , and perceived that there was a bed in the adjoining room , the door of which was open ; he lifted up the boy , and carried him , still insensible , into the room , and laid him on the bed .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 25]: He then went for some more water , which he found and threw into his face , and poured a little into his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 60]: Gradually the boy stirred , and recovered from his stupor , and then Edward held the water to his mouth , and made him drink some , which he did , and then , suddenly aroused to a recollection of what had passed , the boy gave a shriek of woe , and burst into a paroxysm of tears .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 9]: This ended in convulsive sobbings and low moanings .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 31]: Edward felt that he could do no more at present , and that it would be better if he was left for a time to give vent to his grief .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 24]: Edward sat down on a stool by the side of the orphan , and remained for some time in deep and melancholy thought .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 41]: `` How strange , '' thought he at last , `` it is , that I should feel so little as I do now , surrounded by death , compared to what I did when good old Jacob Armitage died !
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 14]: Then I felt it deeply , and there was an awe in death .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 7]: Now I no longer dread it .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 19]: Is it because I loved the good old man , and felt that I had lost a friend ?
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 21]: No , that can not be the cause ; I may have felt more grief but not awe or dread .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 27]: Or is it because that was the first time that I had seen death , and it is the first sight of death which occasions awe ?
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 28]: Or is it because that every day I have fancied myself on the battle-field , with hundreds lying dead and wounded around me , in my dreamings ?
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 4]: I know not .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 29]: Poor old Jacob died peaceably in his bed , like a good Christian , and trusting , after a blameless life , to find mercy through his Saviour .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 79]: Two of these who are now dead , out of the three , have been summoned away in the height of their wickedness , and in the very commission of crime ; the third has been foully murdered ; and out of three lying dead , one has fallen by my own hand , and yet I feel not so much as when I attended the couch , and listened to the parting words of a dying Christian !
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 27]: I can not account for it , or reason why ; I only know that it is so , and I now look upon death unconcerned .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 34]: Well , this is a kind of preparation for the wholesale murder and horrors of the battle-field , which I have so long sighed for -- God forgive me if I am wrong !
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 5]: And this poor boy !
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 11]: I have promised to protect him , and I will .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 27]: Could I fail my promise , I should imagine the spirit of his father -LRB- as I presume he was -RRB- looking down and upbraiding me .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 9]: No , no , I will protect him .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 31]: I and my brother and sisters have been preserved and protected , and I were indeed vile if I did not do to others as I have been done by .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 11]: And now let me reflect what is to be done .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 26]: I must not take the boy away , and bury the bodies ; this person has friends at Lymington , and they will come here .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 20]: The murder has taken place in the forest : then I must let the Intendant know what has occurred .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 11]: I will send over to Oswald ; Humphrey shall go .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 3]: Poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 19]: What a state of anxiety must he and my little sisters be in at my not returning home !
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 13]: I had quite forgotten that ; but it can not be helped .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 38]: I will wait till sunrise , and then see if the boy will be more himself , and probably from him I shall be able to find out what part of the forest I am in . ''
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 21]: Edward took up the candle and went into the room in which he had laid the boy on the bed .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 8]: He found him in a sound sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 18]: `` Poor fellow , '' said Edward , `` he has for a time forgotten his misery .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 7]: What a beautiful boy he is !
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 7]: I long to know his history .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 7]: Sleep on , my poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 7]: It will do you service . ''
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 32]: Edward then returned to the other room , and recollected , or rather was reminded , that he had had no supper , and it was now nearly dawn of day .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 16]: He looked into a cupboard and found plenty of provisions and some flasks of wine .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 23]: `` I have earned my supper , '' thought he , `` and I will not , therefore , deny myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 18]: So he brought out the viands and a flask of wine , and made a hearty meal .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 26]: `` It is long since I have tasted wine , '' thought he , `` and it may be long ere I drink it again .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 16]: I have little relish for it now ; it is too fiery to the palate .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 45]: I recollect , when a child , how my father used to have me at the table , and give me a stoup of claret , which I could hardly lift to my lips , to drink to the health of the king . ''
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 32]: The memory of the king raised other thoughts in Edward 's mind , and he again sank into one of his reveries , which lasted till he fell into a slumber .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 25]: When he woke up , it was at the voice of the boy , who in his sleep had cried out `` Father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 23]: Edward started up , and found that the sun was an hour high , and that he must have slept some time .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 38]: He gently opened the cottage-door , looked at the bodies of the two men , and then walked out to survey the locality of the cottage , which he had but faintly made out during the night .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 29]: He found that it was surrounded by a thicket of trees and underwood , so close and thick that there appeared to him no outlet in any direction .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 8]: `` What a place for concealment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 12]: thought Edward , `` but still these prowling thieves discovered it .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 20]: Why , troops of horse might scour the forest for months , and never discover such a hiding-place . ''
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 34]: Edward walked round by the side of the thicket , to find out the track by which the robbers had entered when he followed them , and at last succeeded in doing so .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 45]: He followed the path through the thicket until he was clear of it and again in the forest , but the scenery outside was unknown to him , and he had not an idea as to what part of the forest it was in .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 11]: `` I must question the boy , '' thought Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 20]: `` I will go back and wake him up , for it is time that I was moving . ''
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 21]: As he was again turning into the thicket he heard a dog giving tongue , as if on a scent .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 18]: It came nearer and nearer to him , and Edward remained to see what it might be .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 26]: In a moment more he perceived his own dog , Smoker , come bounding out of a neighbouring copse , followed by Humphrey and Pablo .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 3]: Edward hallooed .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 25]: Smoker sprang towards him , leaping up , and loading him with caresses , and in another moment he was in Humphrey 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 12]: `` Oh , Edward , let me first thank God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 13]: said Humphrey , as the tears started and rolled down his cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 8]: `` What a night we have passed !
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 4]: What has happened ?
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 73]: That dear fellow Pablo thought of putting Smoker on the scent ; he brought out your jacket and showed it to Smoker , and gave it him to smell , and then led him along till he was on your footsteps ; and the dog followed him , it seems , although it has been round and round in every direction , till at last he has brought us to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 10]: Edward shook hands with Pablo , and thanked him .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 12]: `` How far are we from the cottage , Humphrey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 15]: `` About eight miles , I should say , Edward ; not more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 36]: `` Well , I have much to tell you , and I must tell it to you in few words before I go farther , and afterwards I will tell you all in detail . ''
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 40]: Edward then gave a succinct narration of what had occurred , and , having thus prepared Humphrey and Pablo for what they were to see , led the way back through the thicket to the cottage inside of it .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 36]: Humphrey and Pablo were much shocked at the scene of slaughter which presented itself to their eyes ; and , after having viewed the bodies , they began to consult what had best be done .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 52]: The proposal of Edward , that Humphrey should go over and make known the circumstances to Oswald , that they might be communicated to the Intendant , was readily acceded to ; and Pablo , it was agreed , should go home and tell Alice and Edith that Edward was safe .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 18]: `` But now , Humphrey , about this boy ; we can not leave him here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 6]: `` Where is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 8]: `` He still sleeps , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 60]: The question is , whether you should ride over with the pony or walk , and leave Pablo to return with the pony and cart ; for I will not take the boy away or leave the house myself without removing the property which belongs to the boy , and of which I will make inquiry when he wakes .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 24]: Besides , there is money , by what the robbers stated , which of course must be taken care of for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 15]: `` I think it will be best for me to walk over , Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 38]: If I ride , I should arrive too late in the afternoon for anything to be done till next morning , and if I walk , I shall be in time enough , so that is settled .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 43]: Besides , it will give you more time to remove the boy 's property , which , as his father was in all probability a Malignant , and a denounced man , they might think right to secure for the government . ''
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 9]: `` Very true ; then be it so .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 34]: Do you start for the Intendant 's ; and Pablo , go home and fetch the pony and cart , while I remain here with the boy , and get everything ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 22]: Humphrey and Pablo both set off , and then Edward went to waken the boy , still lying on the bed .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 9]: `` Come , you must get up now .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 47]: You know that what 's done can not be undone ; and if you are a good boy , and have read the Bible , you must know that we must submit to the will of God , who is our kind Father in heaven . ''
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 5]: `` Ah me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 34]: said the boy , who was awake when Edward went to him , `` I know well it is my duty , but it is a hard duty , and I am heart-broken .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 26]: I have lost my father , the only friend I had in the world : who is there to love and to cherish me now ?
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 7]: What will become of me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 41]: `` I promised your father , before he died , that I would take care of you , my poor fellow ; and a promise is sacred with me , even if it were not made to a dying man .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 26]: I will do my best , depend upon it , for I have known myself what it is to want and to find a protector .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 20]: You shall live with me and my brother and sisters , and you shall have all we have . ''
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 8]: `` Have you sisters , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 4]: replied the boy .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 73]: `` Yes ; I have sent for the cart to take you away from this , and to-night you shall be in our cottage ; but now tell me -- I do not ask who your father was , or why he was living here in secret , as I found it out by what I overheard the robbers say to one another -- but how long have you lived here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 7]: `` More than a year . ''
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 7]: `` Whose cottage is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 42]: `` My father bought it when he came , as he thought it safer so , that he might not be discovered or betrayed ; for he had escaped from prison after having been condemned to death by the Parliament . ''
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 12]: `` Then he was a loyal man to his king ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 13]: `` Yes he was , and that was his only crime . ''
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 25]: `` Then fear not , my good boy ; we are all loyal as well as he was , and will never be otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 12]: I tell you this that you may safely trust to us .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 17]: Now , if the cottage was his , the furniture and property were his also . ''
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 8]: `` Yes ; all was his . ''
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 12]: `` And it is now yours , is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 14]: `` I suppose so , '' said the boy , bursting into tears .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 68]: `` Then listen to me ; -- your father is safe from all persecution now ; he is , I trust , in heaven ; and you they can not touch , as you have done nothing to offend them ; but still they will take possession of your father 's property as soon as they know of his death , and find out who he was .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 53]: This , for your sake , I wish to prevent them from doing , and have therefore sent for the cart , that I may remove to my cottage everything that is of value , that it may be held for your benefit ; some day or another you may require it .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 54]: The murder having been committed in the forest , and I having been a witness , and , moreover , having shot one of the robbers , I have considered it right to send over to the Intendant of the forest to give him notice of what has taken place within his jurisdiction .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 57]: I do not think he is so bad a man as the rest ; but still , when he comes here , he may consider it his duty to take possession of everything for the Parliament , as I have no doubt such are his orders , or will be when he communicates with the Parliament .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 53]: Now this is a robbery which I wish to prevent , by carrying away your property before they come over , which they will to-morrow , and I propose that you shall accompany me , with all that you can take away , or that may be useful , this evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 11]: `` You are very kind , '' replied the boy .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 19]: `` I will do all you wish ; but I feel very weak , and very unwell . ''
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 14]: `` You must exert yourself for your own sake , my poor fellow .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 14]: Come , now , sit up and put all your own clothes together .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 13]: Collect everything in this room , while I look about the house .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 11]: And tell me , had not your father some money ?
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 32]: For the robbers said that they saw him counting it out of a sack , through the chinks of the shutters , and that was why they made the attack . ''
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 5]: `` Hateful money ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 4]: cried the boy .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 24]: `` Yes , he had , I believe , a great deal of money ; but I can not say how much . ''
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 68]: `` Now get up , and do as I request , my dear boy , '' said Edward , raising him up in his arms ; `` when your grief is lessened , you may have many happy days yet in store for you ; you have a Father in heaven that you must put your trust in , and with Him you will find peace . ''
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 24]: The boy rose up , and Edward closed the door of the chamber , that he might not see his father 's corpse .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 31]: `` I do put my trust in Heaven , good sir , '' replied the boy , `` for it has already sent me a kind friend in my distress .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 15]: You are good , I am sure ; I see that in your face .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 19]: How much more wretched would have been my condition if you had not fortunately come to our assistance !
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 22]: Too late , indeed , to save my poor father , but not too late to succour and console his child .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 15]: I will go away with you , for I can not stay here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIXTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 18]: Edward then took the counterpane off the bed , and went with it into the next room .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 30]: He gently drew the body to the corner of the room , and covered it up with the counterpane , and then proceeded to examine the cupboards , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 44]: In one he found a good store of books , in another there was linen of all sorts , a great many curious arms , two suits of bright armour such as worn in those times , pistols and guns , and ammunition .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 19]: On the floor of one of the cupboards was an iron chest about two feet by eighteen inches .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 4]: It was locked .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 20]: Edward immediately concluded that this chest held the money of the unfortunate man ; but where was the key ?
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 6]: Most likely about his person .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 48]: He did not like to afflict the poor boy by putting the question to him , but he went to the body and examined the pockets of the clothes ; he found a bunch of several keys , which he took , and then replaced the coverlid .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 31]: He tried one of the keys , which appeared to be of the right size , to the lock of the iron chest , and found that it fitted it .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 25]: Satisfied with this , he did not raise the lid of the chest , but dragged it out into the centre of the room .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 24]: There were many things of value about the room ; the candlesticks were silver , and there were goblets of the same metal .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 37]: Edward collected all these articles , and a timepiece , and put them into a basket , of which there were two large ones at the end of the room , apparently used for holding firewood .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 24]: Everything that he thought could be useful , or of value , he gathered together for the benefit of the poor orphan boy .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 18]: He afterwards went into another small room , where he found sundry small trunks and cases locked-up .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 25]: These he brought out without examining , as he presumed that they contained what was of value , or they would not be locked .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 48]: When he had collected everything , he found that he had already more than the cart could carry in one trip ; and he wanted to take some bedding with him , as he had not a spare bed in the cottage to give to the boy .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 32]: Edward decided in his own mind that he would take the most valuable articles away that night , and return with the cart for the remainder early on the following morning .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 37]: It was now past noon , and Edward took out of the cupboard what victuals were left , and then went into the chamber where the boy was , and begged that he would eat something .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 39]: The poor boy said that he had no appetite ; but Edward insisted , and at last prevailed upon him to eat some bread and drink a glass of wine , which proved of great service to him .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 22]: The poor fellow shuddered as he saw the body covered up in the corner of the room , but said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 20]: Edward was trying to make him eat a little more , when Pablo made his appearance at the door .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 14]: `` Have you put up all that you want in the bed-chamber ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 3]: said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 10]: `` Yes , I have put up everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 8]: `` Then we will bring them out .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 10]: Come , Pablo , you must help us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 10]: Pablo made signs , and pointed to the door .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 4]: Edward went out .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 9]: `` First pull body away from this . ''
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 14]: `` Yes , '' replied Edward ; `` we must do so . ''
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 73]: Edward and Pablo pulled the body of the robber on one side of the doorway , and threw over it some dried fern which lay by ; they then backed the cart down to the door ; the iron chest was first got in , then all the heavy articles , such as armour , guns , and books , etcetera , and by that time the cart was more than half-loaded .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 66]: Edward then went into the chamber , and brought out the packages the boy had made up , and put them all in the cart until it was loaded high up ; they brought out some blankets , and laid over all , to keep things steady ; and then Edward told the boy that all was ready , and that they had better go .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 25]: `` Yes , I am willing , '' replied he , with streaming eyes ; `` but let me see him once more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 20]: `` Come , then , '' said Edward , leading him to the corpse , and uncovering the face .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 29]: The boy knelt down , kissed the forehead and cold lips , covered up the face again , and then rose and wept bitterly on Edward 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 38]: Edward did not attempt to check his sorrow ; he thought it better it should have vent ; but , after a time , he led the boy by degrees till they were out of the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 20]: `` Now , then , '' said Edward , `` we must go , or we shall be late .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 28]: My poor little sisters have been dreadfully alarmed at my not having come home last night , and I long to clasp them in my arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 28]: `` Indeed you must , '' replied the boy , wiping away his tears , `` and I am very selfish ; let us go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 29]: `` No room for cart to get through wood , '' said Pablo ; `` hard work , cart empty -- more hard work , cart full . ''
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 63]: And so it proved to be ; and it required all the united efforts of Billy , Edward , and Pablo , to force a passage for the cart through the narrow pathway ; but at last it was effected , and then they went on at a quick pace , and in less than two hours the cottage was in sight .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 33]: When within two hundred yards of it , Edith , who had been on the watch , came bounding out , flew into Edward 's arms , and covered him with kisses .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 11]: `` You naughty Edward , to frighten us so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 14]: `` Look , Edith , I have brought you a nice little play-fellow .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 6]: Welcome him , dearest . ''
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 13]: Edith extended her hand as she looked into the boy 's face .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 15]: `` He is a pretty boy , Edward , much prettier than Pablo . ''
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 18]: `` No , Missy Edith , '' said Pablo ; `` Pablo more man than he . ''
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 18]: `` Yes , you may be more man , Pablo ; but you are not pretty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 7]: `` And where is Alice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 26]: `` She was getting supper ready , and I did not tell her that I saw you coming , because I wanted first kiss . ''
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 6]: `` You little jealous thing !
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 5]: But here comes Alice .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 23]: Dear Alice , you have been very uneasy , but it was not my fault , '' said Edward , kissing her .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 22]: `` If I had not been where I was this poor boy would have been killed as well as his father .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 19]: Make him welcome , Alice , for he is an orphan now , and must live with us .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 33]: I have brought many things in the cart , and to-morrow we will bring more , for we have no bed for him , and to-night he must sleep with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 35]: `` We will make him as happy as we can , Edward ; and we will be sisters to him , '' said Alice , looking at the boy , who was blushing deeply .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 6]: `` How old are you ?
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 7]: And what is your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 14]: `` I am thirteen years old next January , '' replied the boy .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 7]: `` And your Christian name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 15]: `` I will tell you by and by , '' replied he , confused .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 61]: They arrived at the cottage , and Edward and Pablo were busy unpacking the cart , and putting all the contents into the inner chamber , where Pablo now slept , when Alice , who , with Edith , had been talking to the boy , came to Edward and said -- `` Edward , she 's a girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 5]: `` A girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 5]: replied Edward , astonished .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 17]: `` Yes , she has told me so , and wished me to tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 11]: `` But why does she wear boys ' clothes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 54]: `` It was her father 's wish , as he was very often obliged to send her to Lymington to a friend 's house , and he was afraid of her getting into trouble ; but she has not told me her story as yet -- she says that she will to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 23]: `` Well , then , '' replied Edward , `` you must make up a bed for her in your room to-night .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 12]: Take Pablo 's bed , and he shall sleep with me .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 13]: To-morrow morning I will bring some more bedding from her cottage . ''
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 12]: `` How Humphrey will be surprised when he comes back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 5]: said Alice , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 36]: `` Yes ; she will make a nice little wife for him some years hence ; and she may prove an heiress perhaps , for there is an iron chest with money in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 17]: Alice returned to her new companion , and Edward and Pablo continued to unload the cart .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 28]: `` Well , Pablo , I suppose you will allow that , now that you know she is a girl , she is handsomer than you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 22]: `` Oh yes , '' replied Pablo , `` very handsome girl ; but too much girl for handsome boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 44]: At last everything was out of the cart , the iron chest dragged into Pablo 's room , and Billy put into his stable and given his supper , which he had well earned , for the cart had been very heavily loaded .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 31]: They then all sat down to supper , Edward saying to their new acquaintance -- `` So I find that I am to have another sister instead of another brother .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 9]: Now you will tell me your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 9]: `` Yes ; Clara is my name . ''
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 15]: `` And why did you not tell me that you are a girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 30]: `` I did not like , because I was in boys ' clothes , and felt ashamed ; indeed I was too unhappy to think about what I was .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 6]: My poor dear father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 6]: and she burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 15]: Alice and Edith kissed her and consoled her , and she became calm again .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 23]: After supper was over they busied themselves making arrangements for her sleeping in their room , and then they went to prayers .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 16]: `` We have much to be thankful for , my dears , '' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 46]: `` I am sure I feel that I have been in great danger , and I only wish that I had been more useful than I have been ; but it has been the will of God , and we must not arraign His decrees .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 35]: Let us return thanks for His great mercies , and bow in submission to His dispensations , and pray that He will give peace to poor little Clara , and soften her affliction . ''
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 34]: And as Edward prayed , little Clara knelt and sobbed , while Alice caressed her with her arm round her waist , and at times stopped her prayer to kiss and console her .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 24]: When they had finished , Alice led her away to her bedroom , followed by Edith , and they put her to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 18]: Edward and Pablo also retired , both worn out by the fatigue and excitement of the day .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 26]: They were up on the following morning at day-dawn , and , putting Billy in the cart , set off for the cottage of Clara .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 119]: They found everything as they had left it , and , having loaded the cart with what had been left behind the day before , the bedding for two beds , with several articles of furniture which Edward thought might be useful , there being still a little room left , Edward packed up in a wooden case with dried fern all the wine that was in the cupboard ; and , having assisted Pablo in forcing the cart once more through the path in the wood , he left him to return home with the cart , while he remained to wait the arrival of Humphrey , and whoever might come with him from the Intendant 's .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 37]: About ten o'clock , as he was watching outside of the wood , he perceived several people approaching him , and soon made out that Humphrey , the Intendant , and Oswald were among the number .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 36]: When they came up to him Edward saluted the Intendant in a respectful manner , shook hands with Oswald , and then led the way by the narrow path through the wood to the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 14]: The Intendant was on horseback , but all the rest were on foot .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 31]: The Intendant left his horse to the care of one of the verderers , and went through the wood on foot with the of the party , preceded by Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 51]: He appeared to be very grave and thoughtful , and Edward thought that there was a coolness in his manner towards himself , -- for it must be recollected that Mr Heatherstone had not seen Edward since he had rendered him such service in saving the life of his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 33]: The consequence was , that Edward felt somewhat indignant , but he did not express his feelings , by his looks even , but conveyed the party in silence to the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 26]: On their arrival , Edward pointed to the body of the robber , which had been covered with fern , and the verderers exposed it .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 10]: `` By whose hand did that man fall ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 4]: said the Intendant .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 14]: `` By the hand of the party who lived in the cottage . ''
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 32]: Edward then led the way round to the back of the cottage where the other robber lay -- `` And this man was slain by my hand , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 28]: `` We have one more body to see , '' continued Edward , leading the way into the cottage and uncovering the corpse of Clara 's father .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 43]: Mr Heatherstone looked at the face and appeared much moved -- `` Cover it up , '' said he , turning away ; and then sitting down on a chair close to the table -- `` And how was this found ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 41]: `` I neither saw this person killed nor the robber you first saw , but I heard the report of the firearms at almost the same moment , and I presume that they fell by each other 's hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 43]: The Intendant called his clerk , who had accompanied him , and desired him to get ready his writing materials , and then said -- `` Edward Armitage , we will now take down your deposition as to what has occurred . ''
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 39]: Edward then commenced by stating `` that he was out in the forest and had lost his way , and was seeking his way home -- '' `` You were out in the forest during the night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 9]: `` Yes , sir , I was . ''
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 6]: `` With your gun ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 11]: `` I always carry my gun , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 7]: `` In pursuit of game ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 9]: `` No , sir , I was not .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 16]: I have never been out in pursuit of game during night-time in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 7]: `` What were you then about ?
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 9]: You did not go out for nothing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 37]: `` I went out to commune with my own thoughts : I was restless , and I wandered about without knowing where I went , and that is the reason why I lost my way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 10]: `` And pray what may have excited you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 45]: `` I will tell you : I was over with Oswald Partridge the day before ; you had just arrived from London , and he gave me the news that King Charles had been proclaimed in Scotland , and that news unsettled me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 6]: `` Well , proceed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 10]: Edward met with no more interruption in his narrative .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 26]: He stated briefly all that had taken place , from the time he fell in with the robbers till the winding up of the catastrophe .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 40]: The clerk took down all that Edward had stated , and then read it over to him , to ascertain if he had written it down correctly , and then inquired of Edward if he could read and write .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 18]: `` I should hope so , '' replied Edward , taking the pen and signing his name .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 38]: The clerk stared , and then said , `` People in your condition do not often know how to read and write , Mr Forester , and therefore you need not be offended at the question . ''
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 8]: `` Very true , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 16]: `` May I ask if my presence is considered any longer to be necessary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 28]: `` You stated that there was a boy in the house , young man , '' said the Intendant : `` what has become of him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 9]: `` He is removed to my cottage . ''
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 8]: `` Why did you do so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 28]: `` Because when his father died I promised to him that I would take care of his child ; and I intend to keep my word . ''
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 14]: `` You had spoken with him , then , before he died ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 4]: said the Intendant .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 52]: `` Not so ; it was all carried on by signs on his part , but it was as intelligible as if he spoke , and what I replied he well understood ; and I really think I removed a great anxiety off his mind by giving him the promise . ''
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 31]: The Intendant paused , and then said , `` I perceive that some articles have been removed -- the bedding , for instance -- have you taken anything away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 54]: `` I have removed bedding , for I had no bed to offer to the lad , and he told me that the cottage and furniture belonged to his father ; of course by his father 's death it became his , and I felt that I was warranted in so doing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 12]: `` May I ask , did you remove any papers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 33]: `` I can not tell ; the lad packed up his own things ; there were some boxes removed , which were locked-up , and the contents are to me wholly unknown .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 37]: I could not leave the boy here in this scene of death , and I could not well leave the property belonging to him to be at the mercy of any other plunderers of the forest .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 28]: I did as I considered right for the benefit of the boy , and in accordance with the solemn promise which I made to his father . ''
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 10]: `` Still the property should not have been removed .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 13]: The party who now lies dead there is a well-known Malignant . ''
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 10]: `` How do you know that , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 15]: interrupted Edward ; `` did you recognise him when you saw the body ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 14]: `` I did not say that I did , '' replied the Intendant .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 36]: `` You either must have so done , sir , '' replied Edward , `` or you must have been aware that he was residing in this cottage : you have to choose between . ''
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 22]: `` You are bold , young man , '' replied the Intendant , `` and I will reply to your observation .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 40]: I did recognise the party when I saw his face , and I knew him to be one who was condemned to death , and who escaped from prison a few days before the one appointed for his execution .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 25]: I heard search had been made for him , but in vain , and it was supposed that he had escaped beyond the seas .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 20]: Now his papers may be the means of giving the Parliament information against others as well as himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 15]: `` And enable them to commit a few more murders , '' added Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 19]: `` Silence , young man ; the authorities must not be spoken of in so irreverent a manner .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 10]: Are you aware that your language is treasonable ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 37]: `` According to Act of Parliament , as at present constituted , it may be , '' replied Edward ; `` but as a loyal subject of King Charles the Second , I deny it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 30]: `` I have no concern with your loyalty , young man , but I will not admit any language to be uttered in my presence against the ruling powers .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 5]: The inquest is over .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 18]: Let every one leave the house except Edward Armitage , to whom I would speak alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 19]: `` Excuse me one moment , sir , '' said Edward , `` and I will return . ''
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 72]: Edward went out with the rest , and calling Humphrey aside , said to him , `` Contrive to slip away unperceived ; here are the keys ; haste to the cottage as fast as you can ; look for all the papers you can find in the packages taken there ; bury them and the iron chest in the garden , or anywhere where they can not be discovered . ''
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 13]: Humphrey nodded , and turned away , and Edward re-entered the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 28]: He found the Intendant was standing over the corpse ; he had removed the coverlid , and was looking mournfully down on the face disfigured with blood .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 81]: Perceiving the entrance of Edward , he again took his seat at the table , and after a pause said -- `` Edward Armitage , that you have been brought up very superior to your station in life is certain ; and that you are loyal , bold , and resolute , is equally so ; you have put me under an obligation which I never can repay , even if you allowed me to exert myself in your behalf .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 26]: I take this opportunity of acknowledging it ; and now allow me to say that for these times you are much too frank and impetuous .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 15]: This is no time for people to give vent to their feelings and opinions .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 19]: Even I am as much surrounded with spies as others , and am obliged to behave myself accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 35]: Your avowed attachment to the king 's cause has prevented me from showing that more than cordiality that I really feel for you , and to which you are in every way entitled . ''
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 29]: `` I can not conceal my opinions , sir ; I was brought up in the house of a loyal cavalier , and never will be otherwise . ''
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 8]: `` Granted -- why should you be ?
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 26]: But do you not yourself see that you do the cause more harm than good by thus avowing your opinions when such avowal is useless ?
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 59]: If any other man in the county , who is of your opinion , was to express himself , now that your cause is hopeless , as you have done , the prisons would be crowded , the executions would be daily , and the cause would be in proportion weakened by the loss of the most daring .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 17]: ` Bide your time ' is a good motto , and I recommend it to you .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 88]: You must feel that , however we may be at variance in our opinions , Edward Armitage , my hand and my authority never can be used against one to whom I am so indebted ; and feeling this , you compel me in the presence of others to use a harshness and coldness towards you , contrary -- wholly contrary -- to what , you may believe me when I say it , I really feel for one who so nobly rescued my only child . ''
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 29]: `` I thank you , sir , for your advice , which I feel to be good , and for your good opinion , which I value . ''
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 30]: `` And which I feel that you deserve ; and you shall have , young as you are , my confidence , which I know you will not abuse .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 65]: I did know this man who now lies dead before us , and I did also know that he was concealed in this cottage : Major Ratcliffe was one of my earliest and dearest friends , and until this unhappy civil war , there never was any difference between us , and even afterwards only in politics , and the cause we each espoused .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 28]: I knew , before I came down here as Intendant , where his place of concealment was , and have been most anxious for his safety . ''
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 49]: `` Excuse me , Mr Heatherstone , but each day I find more to make me like you than I did the day before : at first I felt most inimical ; now I only wonder how you can be leagued with the party you now are . ''
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 14]: `` Edward Armitage , I will now answer for myself and thousands more .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 24]: You are too young a man to have known the cause of the insurrection , or rather opposition to the unfortunate King Charles .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 25]: He attempted to make himself absolute , and to wrest the liberties from the people of England ; that his warmest adherents will admit .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 58]: When I joined the party which opposed him , I little thought that matters would have been carried so far as they have been ; I always considered it lawful to take up arms in defence of our liberties , but at the same time I equally felt that the person of the king was sacred . ''
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 9]: `` I have heard so , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 36]: `` Yes , and in truth ; for never did any people strive more zealously to prevent the murder of the king -- for murder it was -- than my relative Ashley Cooper and myself .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 52]: So much so , indeed , as to have incurred not only the suspicion but the ill-will of Cromwell , who , I fear , is now making rapid advances towards that absolute authority for which the king has suffered , and which he would now vest in his own person .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 79]: I considered that our cause was just ; and , had the power been left in the hands of those who would have exercised it with discretion and moderation , the king would even now have been on the throne , and the liberties of his subjects sacred ; but it is easier to put a vast and powerful engine into motion than to stop it ; and such has been the case in this unfortunate civil war .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 36]: Thousands who took an active part against the king will , when the opportunity is ripe , retrace their steps ; but I expect that we have much to suffer before that time will come .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 26]: And now , Edward Armitage , I have said more to you than I have to any person breathing , except my own kinsman . ''
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 31]: `` I thank you for your confidence , sir , which not only will not be betrayed , but will act as a warning to guide my future conduct . ''
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 6]: `` I meant it should .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 11]: Be no longer rash and careless in avowing your opinions .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 16]: You can do no good to the cause , and may do yourself much harm .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 18]: And now I must ask you another question , which I could not before the other people .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 28]: You have surprised me by stating that Major Ratcliffe had a son here : there must be some mistake , or the boy must be an impostor .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 21]: He had a daughter , an only daughter , as I have ; but he never had a son . ''
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 59]: `` It is a mistake that I fell into , sir , by finding a boy here , as I stated to you at the inquest ; and I considered it to be a boy until I brought her home , and she then discovered to my sisters that she was a girl dressed in boys ' clothes .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 18]: I did not give that as explanation at the inquest , as it was not necessary . ''
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 7]: `` I am right , then .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 53]: I must relieve you of that charge , Edward Armitage ; she shall be to me as a daughter , and I trust that you will agree with me , without any disparagement to your feelings , that my house will be a more fit residence for her than your cottage . ''
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 23]: `` I will not prevent her going , if she wishes it , after your explanation and confidence , Mr Heatherstone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 5]: `` One thing more .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 38]: As I said to you before , Edward Armitage , I believe many of these verderers , all of whom have been selected from the army , are spies upon me : I must therefore be careful .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 14]: You said that you were not aware that there were any papers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 64]: `` I saw none , sir ; but I suspect , from the many locked-up trunks and small boxes , that there may be ; but when I went out with the others from the inquest , I despatched my brother Humphrey to the cottage , advising him to open all the locks and to remove any papers which he might find . ''
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 4]: The Intendant smiled .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 22]: `` Well , if such is the case , we have only to go to your cottage and make an examination .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 13]: We shall find nothing , and I shall have performed my duty .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 10]: I was not aware that your brother was here .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 14]: I presume it was the young man who walked with Oswald Partridge . ''
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 7]: `` It was , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 17]: `` By his appearance , I presume that he also was brought up at Arnwood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 15]: `` He was , sir , as well as I , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 40]: `` Well , then , I have but one word more to say , -- recollect , if I appear harsh and severe in the presence of others , it is only assumed towards you , and not real .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 5]: You understand that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 15]: `` I do , sir , and beg you will exercise your discretion . ''
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 46]: The Intendant then went out and said to the party , `` It appears from what I can extract from this lad Armitage , that there are boxes which he removed to his cottage ; we will go there to see what they may contain .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 5]: It is now noon .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 19]: Have you any refreshment to offer us in your cottage , young man , when we arrive ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 40]: `` I keep no hostelrie , sir , '' replied Edward , somewhat gloomily ; `` my own labour , and my brother 's , is sufficient for the support of my own family , but no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 24]: `` Let us move on ; and two of you keep your eye upon that young man , '' said the Intendant aside .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 32]: They then proceeded through the wood ; the Intendant mounted his horse , and they set off for the cottage , where they arrived at about two o'clock in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVENTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 24]: Humphrey came out as soon as he perceived the Intendant and his party approaching , and whispered to Edward that all was safe .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 22]: The Intendant dismounted , and ordering everybody but his clerk to wait outside , was ushered into the cottage by Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 33]: Alice , Edith , and Pablo were in the room ; the two girls were not a little flushed and frightened by the unusual appearance of so large a body of strangers .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 12]: `` These are my sisters , sir , '' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 8]: `` Where is Clara , Alice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 13]: `` She is alarmed , and has gone into our bedroom . ''
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 23]: `` I hope you are not alarmed at my presence , '' said the Intendant , looking earnestly at the two girls .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 20]: `` It is my duty which obliges me to pay this visit ; but you have nothing to fear .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 21]: Now , Edward Armitage , you must produce all the boxes and packages which you took from the cottage . ''
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 17]: `` I will , sir , '' replied Edward , `` and here are the keys .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 11]: Humphrey , do you and Pablo bring them out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 27]: The boxes were brought out , opened , and examined by the Intendant and his clerk , but of course no papers were found in them .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 20]: `` I must now send in two of my people to search the house , '' said the Intendant .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 19]: `` Had you not better go to the little girl , that she may not be frightened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 11]: `` I will go to her , '' said Alice .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 52]: Two of the people , assisted by the clerk , then searched the house ; they found nothing worthy of notice , except the weapons and armour which Edward had removed , and which he stated to the Intendant that he took away as valuable property belonging to the little girl .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 71]: `` It is sufficient , '' said the Intendant to his clerk -- `` undoubtedly there are no papers ; but I must , before I go , interrogate this child , who has been removed thus ; but she will be frightened , and I shall obtain no answer from her if we are so many , so let everybody leave the cottage while I speak to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 21]: The clerk and the others left the cottage , and the Intendant desired Edward to bring Clara from the bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 18]: She came out , accompanied by and indeed clinging to Alice , for she was much alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 55]: `` Come here , Clara , '' said the Intendant gently ; `` you do not know perhaps that I am your sincere friend ; and now that your father is dead , I want you to come and live with my daughter , who will be delighted to have you as a companion .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 6]: Will you go with me ?
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 15]: And I will take care of you and be a father to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 28]: `` I do not like to leave Alice and Edith ; they treat me so kindly , and call me sister , '' replied Clara , sobbing .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 42]: `` I am sure they do , and you must be fond of them already ; but still it is your duty to come with me ; and if your father could speak to you now he would tell you so .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 51]: I will not force you away , but remember , you are born a lady , and must be brought up and educated as a lady , which can not be the case in this cottage , although they are very kind to you , and very nice young people .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 31]: You do not recollect me , Clara , but you have often sat on my knee when you were a little girl , and when your father lived in Dorsetshire .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 22]: You recollect the great walnut-tree by the sitting-room window , which looked out in the garden , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 10]: `` Yes , '' replied Clara , with surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 39]: `` Yes , so do I too , and how you used to sit on my knee ; and do you remember Jason , the big mastiff , and how you used to ride upon his back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 20]: `` Yes , '' replied Clara , `` I do ; but he died a long while ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 14]: `` He did , when you were not more than six years old .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 14]: And now tell me , where did the old gardener bury him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 9]: `` Under the mulberry-tree , '' replied Clara .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 17]: `` Yes , so he did , and I was there when poor Jason was buried .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 6]: You do n't recollect me .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 21]: But I will take off my hat , for I did not wear the same dress that I do now .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 13]: Now look , Clara , and see if you remember me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 35]: Clara , who was no longer alarmed , looked on the Intendant 's face , and then said , `` You called my father Philip , and he used to call you Charles . ''
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 30]: `` You are right , my sweet one , '' replied the Intendant pressing Clara to his bosom ; `` I did so , and we were great friends .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 8]: Now , will you come with me ?
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 27]: And I have a little girl , older than you by three or four years , who will be your companion and love you dearly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 12]: `` May I come and see Alice and Edith sometimes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 24]: `` Yes , you shall ; and she will come with you and make their acquaintance , if their brother will permit it .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 29]: I will not take you away now , dearest ; you shall remain here for a few days , and then we will come over and fetch you .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 23]: I will send Oswald Partridge over to let you know the day , Edward Armitage , when we will come for her .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 12]: Good-bye , dear Clara , and good-bye , my little girls .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 5]: Humphrey Armitage , good-bye .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 9]: Who is this lad you have there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 25]: `` He is a gipsy whom Humphrey trapped in his pit-fall , sir , and we have soon tamed him , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 29]: `` Well , then , Edward Armitage , good-bye , '' said the Intendant , extending his hand to him ; `` we must meet soon again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 15]: The Intendant then went out of the cottage , and joined his people outside .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 50]: Edward went out after him ; and as the Intendant mounted his horse , he said very coldly to Edward , `` I shall keep a sharp look-out on your proceedings , sir , depend upon it ; I tell you so decidedly , so fare you well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 16]: With these words the Intendant put the spurs to his horse , and rode away .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 13]: `` What made him speak so sharply to you , Edward ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 3]: said Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 20]: `` Because he means kindly , but does not want other people to know it , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 20]: `` Come in , Humphrey ; I have much to tell you and much to surprise you with . ''
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 11]: `` I have been surprised already , '' replied Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 13]: `` How did this Roundhead know Clara 's father so well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 23]: `` I will explain all before we go to bed , '' replied Edward ; `` let us go in now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 27]: The two brothers had a long conversation that evening , in which Edward made Humphrey acquainted with all that had passed between him and the Intendant .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 36]: `` It 's my opinion , Edward , '' said Humphrey , `` that he thinks matters have been carried too far , and that he is sorry that he belongs to the Parliamentary party .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 50]: He finds out , now that it is too late , that he has allied himself with those who have very different feelings and motives than his own , and has assisted to put power into the hands of those who have not the scruples which he has . ''
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 56]: `` Yes ; and in ridding themselves of one tyranny , as they considered it , they have every prospect of falling into the hands of a greater tyrant than before ; for , depend upon it , Cromwell will assume the sovereign power , and rule this kingdom with a rod of iron . ''
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 42]: `` Well , many more are , I have no doubt , or soon will be , of his opinion ; and the time will come , be it sooner or later , when the king will have his own again .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 8]: They have proclaimed him in Scotland already .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 10]: Why does he not come over and show himself ?
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 24]: His presence would , I think , induce thousands to flock to him , -- I 'm sure that it would me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 38]: `` I am very glad of this good intelligence with the Intendant , Edward , as it will not now be necessary for us to be so careful ; we may go and come when we please .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 17]: I almost wish you could be persuaded to accept any eligible offer he may make you .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 32]: Many no doubt are in office , and serving the present government , who have the same feelings as the Intendant , or even feelings as strong as your own . ''
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 29]: `` I can not bear the idea of accepting anything from them or their instruments , Humphrey ; nor , indeed , could I leave my sisters . ''
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 31]: `` On that score you may make your mind easy ; -- Pablo and I are quite sufficient for the farm , or anything else we may want to do .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 15]: If you can be more useful elsewhere , have no scruple in leaving us .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 42]: If the king was to come over and raise an army , you would leave us , of course ; and I see no reason why , if an eligible offer is made you , you should not do it now .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 42]: You and your talents are thrown away in this forest , and you might serve the king and the king 's cause better by going into the world and watching the times than you ever can by killing his venison . ''
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 79]: `` Certainly , '' replied Edward , laughing , `` I do not much help his cause by killing his deer , that must be admitted ; all I shall say is this , -- if anything is offered to me which I can accept without injury to my feelings and my honour , I shall not decline it , provided that I may , by accepting it , prove of service to the king 's cause . ''
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 9]: `` That is all I wish , Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 12]: And now I think we had better go to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 25]: The next day they dug up the iron chest and the box into which Humphrey had put all the papers he had collected together .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 32]: Edward opened the iron chest , and found in it a considerable quantity of gold in bags , and many trinkets and jewels which he did not know the value of .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 28]: The papers he did not open , but resolved that they should be given to the Intendant , for Edward felt that he could trust in him .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 20]: The other boxes and trunks were also opened and examined , and many other articles of apparent value discovered .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 32]: `` I should think all these jewels worth a great deal of money , Humphrey , '' said Edward ; `` if so , all the better for poor little Clara .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 30]: I am sorry to part with her , although we have known her so short a time ; she appears to be such an amiable and affectionate child . ''
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 15]: `` That she is ; and certainly the handsomest little girl I ever saw .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 4]: What beautiful eyes !
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 22]: Do you know that on one of her journeys to Lymington she was very nearly taken by a party of gipsies ?
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 23]: And by what Pablo can make out , it would appear that it was by the party which he belonged to . ''
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 17]: `` I wonder at her father 's permitting her to go alone such a distance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 8]: `` Her father could not do otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 5]: Necessity has no law .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 22]: He could trust no other person , so he put her in boy 's clothes that there might be less risk .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 15]: Still , she must have been very intelligent to have done the office . ''
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 16]: `` She is thirteen years old , although she is small , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 15]: `` And intelligent she certainly is , as you may see by her countenance .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 20]: Who would ever have imagined that our sisters would have been able to do what they are doing now ?
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 19]: It 's an old saying , ` We never know what we can do till we try . '
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 46]: By the bye , Humphrey , I met a famous herd of forest ponies the other day , and I said to myself , ` I wonder whether Humphrey will be clever enough to take one of them , as he has the wild cattle ?
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 14]: For Billy is getting old , and we want a successor . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 37]: `` We want more than a successor to Billy , Edward , we want two more to help him -- and I have the means of maintaining two more ponies if I could catch them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 18]: `` I fear that you will never manage that , Humphrey , '' said Edward , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 70]: `` I know well what you mean , '' replied Humphrey : `` you wish to dare me to it -- well , I wo n't be dared to anything , and I most certainly will try to catch a pony or two ; but I must think about it first , and when I have arranged my plan in my mind I will then make the attempt . ''
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 16]: `` When I see the ponies in the yard I will believe it , Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 24]: They are as wild as deer and as fleet as the wind , and you can not catch them in a pit-fall . ''
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 43]: `` I know that , good brother ; but all I can say is , that I will try what I can do , and I can do no more -- but not at present , for I am too busy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 35]: Three days after this conversation Oswald Partridge made his appearance , having been sent by the Intendant to tell Edward that he should come over on the following day to take away little Clara .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 9]: `` And how is she to go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 3]: said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 34]: `` He will bring a little nag for her , if she can ride -- if she can not , she must ride in the cart which will come for the baggage . ''
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 10]: `` Clara , can you ride a horse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 17]: `` Yes , '' replied Clara , `` if it does not jump about too much .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 11]: I always rode one when I lived in Dorsetshire . ''
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 38]: `` This wo n't jump about , my little lady , '' said Oswald , `` for he is thirty years old , I believe , and as steady as an old gentleman ought to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 16]: `` I have had some conversation with Master Heatherstone , '' continued Oswald to Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 13]: `` He is much pleased with you , I can tell you .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 51]: He said , that in times like these he required young men like you about him ; and that as you would not take the berth of verderer , he must find one better suited for you , for he said you were too good for such an office . ''
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 34]: `` Many thanks to him for his good opinion , '' replied Edward ; `` but I do not think that he has any office in his gift which I can accept . ''
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 10]: `` So I thought , but I said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 18]: He again asked many questions relative to old Jacob Armitage , and he pressed me very hard .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 34]: He said that Humphrey was as much above his position in appearance as you were ; but as he was brought up at Arnwood he presumed that he had had the same advantages .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 18]: And then he said -- ` But were his two sisters brought up at Arnwood also ? '
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 25]: I replied that I believed not , although they were often there , and were allowed to play with the children of the house .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 20]: He looked at me steadfastly , as if he would read my thoughts , and then went on writing .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 40]: I can not help thinking that he has a suspicion that you are not the grandchildren of old Jacob ; but at the same time I do not think that he has an idea who you really are . ''
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 13]: `` You must keep our secret , Oswald , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 21]: `` I have a very good opinion of the Intendant , I acknowledge ; but I will trust nobody . ''
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 24]: `` As I hope for future mercy , sir , I never will divulge it until you bid me , '' replied Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 18]: `` I trust to you , Oswald , and so there 's an end of the matter .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 21]: But , tell me , Oswald , what do they say about his taking charge of this little girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 45]: `` Why , they did begin to talk about it ; but when he gave out that it was the order of Parliament that the child should remain with him until further directions , of course they said nothing , for they dared not .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 66]: It seems that the Ratcliffe property is sequestrated , but not yet granted to any one ; and the Parliament will most likely , as soon as she is old enough , give her as a wife , with the property , to one of their party , -- they have done it before now , as it secures the property under all changes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 8]: `` I perceive , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 16]: `` When did you hear that the little girl was to live with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 24]: `` Not till yesterday morning ; and it was not till the evening that we knew it was the order of Parliament . ''
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 51]: Edward did not think it right to tell Oswald what he knew , as it was a secret confided to him by the Intendant , and therefore merely observed , `` I presumed that the child would not be left on our hands ; '' and then the conversation dropped .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 32]: As Oswald had informed them , the Intendant made his appearance in the forenoon of the following day , and was accompanied by his daughter , who rode by his side .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 26]: A groom , on another horse , led a pony for Clara to ride ; and a cart for the luggage followed at some distance .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 24]: Edward went out to assist Miss Heatherstone to dismount , and she frankly extended her hand to him as she reached the ground .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 19]: Edward was a little surprised as well as pleased at this condescension on her part towards a forester .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 16]: `` You do me much honour , Mistress Patience , '' said he , bowing .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 29]: `` I can not forget that I owe my life to you , Master Armitage , '' replied Patience , `` and I can not be too grateful .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 9]: May I request another favour of you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 16]: `` Certainly , if it is in my power to do as you wish . ''
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 37]: `` It is this , '' said she , in a low voice : `` that you will not hastily reject any overtures which may be made to you by my father ; that is all .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 28]: And now let me go in and see your sisters , for my father has praised them very much , and I wish to know them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 22]: Edward led the way into the cottage , and Patience followed him , while the intendant was in conversation with Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 36]: Edward , having introduced his sisters and Clara , then went out to pay his respects to the Intendant , who , now they were alone , was very candid towards both him and Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 35]: Edward then told the Intendant that there was an iron chest with a good deal of money in it , and jewels also , and many other articles of value in the other boxes .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 17]: `` I fear , sir , that the cart will hardly hold all the goods . ''
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 24]: `` I do not intend to take away the heavy or more bulky articles , such as the bedding , armour , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 15]: I will only take Clara 's own packages , and the valuables and papers .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 21]: The remainder may stay here , as they can be of no use , till they are demanded from you .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 6]: Where is Oswald Partridge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 14]: `` In the stable with the horses , sir , '' replied Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 41]: `` Then , when the cart is loaded -- and it had better be done by you while the men are in the stable -- Oswald shall take charge of it , and take the things to my house . ''
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 15]: `` Here are the keys , sir , '' said Edward , presenting them .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 3]: `` Good .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 21]: And now , Edward Armitage , that we are alone , I want to have a little conversation with you .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 28]: You are aware how much I feel indebted to you for the service you have rendered me , and how anxious I am to show my gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 18]: You are born for better things than to remain an obscure forester , and perhaps a deer-stalker .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 43]: I have now an offer to make to you , which I trust , upon reflection , you will not refuse -- and I say reflection , because I do not wish you to give an answer till you have well reflected .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 47]: I know that you will not accept anything under the present government , but a private situation you can raise no objection to ; the more so as , so far from leaving your family , you will be more in a position to protect them .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 45]: I am in want of a secretary , and I wish you to accept that office , to live entirely in my house , and to receive a handsome salary for your services , which will not , I trust , be too heavy .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 50]: You will be near to your family here in the cottage , and be able to protect them and assist them ; and what is more , you will mix with the world and know what is going on , as I am in the confidence of the government .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 17]: Of course I put implicit confidence in you , or I would not offer the situation .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 30]: But you will not be always down here : I have my correspondents and friends , to whom I shall have to send you occasionally on most trusty commissions .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 27]: You , I am sure , will suit me in every respect , and I hope you will undertake the post which I now offer you .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 34]: Give me no answer just now ; consult with your brother , and give the offer due consideration , and when you have made up your mind you can let me know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 11]: Edward bowed ; and the Intendant went into the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 32]: Edward then assisted Humphrey and Pablo to get the iron chest on the cart , and covered it with the other packages and boxes , till the cart was well loaded .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 57]: Leaving Pablo in charge till Oswald came from the stables , Edward and Humphrey then went into the cottage , where they found a very social party ; Patience Heatherstone having succeeded in making great friends with the other three girls , and the Intendant , to Edward 's surprise , laughing and joking with them .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 43]: Alice and Edith had brought out some milk , biscuits , and all the fruit that was ripe , with some bread , a piece of cold salt beef , and a ham : and they were eating as well as talking .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 17]: `` I have been praising your sisters ' housekeeping , Armitage , '' said the Intendant .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 10]: `` Your farm appears to be very productive . ''
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 19]: `` Alice expected Miss Heatherstone , sir , '' replied Edward , `` and made an unusual provision .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 14]: You must not think that we live on such fare every day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 20]: `` No , '' replied the Intendant drily ; `` on other days I daresay you have other fare .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 28]: I would almost make a bet that there is a pasty in the cupboard which you dare not show to the Intendant of the New Forest . ''
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 14]: `` You are mistaken , sir , for once , '' replied Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 18]: `` Alice knows well how to make one , but she has not one just now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 16]: `` Well , I must believe you , Master Humphrey , '' replied the Intendant .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 33]: `` And now , my dear child , we must think of going , for it is a long ride , and the little girl is not used to a horse . ''
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 15]: `` Mistress Alice , many thanks for your hospitality ; and now , farewell .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 6]: Edith , good-bye , dear .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 10]: Now , Clara , are you quite ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 8]: They all went out of the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 16]: The Intendant put Clara on the pony , after she had kissed Alice and Edith .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 34]: Edward assisted Patience ; and when she was mounted she said -- `` I hope you will accept my father 's offer -- you will oblige me so much if you do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 14]: `` I will give it every consideration it deserves , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 20]: `` Indeed , it will depend more upon my brother than myself whether I accept it or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 21]: `` Your brother is a very sensible young man , sir , therefore I have hopes , '' replied Patience .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 18]: `` A quality which it appears you do not give me credit for , Miss Heatherstone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 15]: `` Not when pride or vindictive feelings obtain the mastery , '' replied she .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 58]: `` Perhaps you will find that I am not quite so proud , or bear such ill-will , as I did when I first saw your father , Miss Heatherstone ; and some allowance should be made , even if I did show such feelings , when you consider that I was brought up at Arnwood . ''
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 9]: `` True -- most true , Master Armitage .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 37]: I had no right to speak so boldly , especially to you , who risked your own life to save the daughter of one of those Roundheads who treated the family of your protector so cruelly .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 11]: You must forgive me ; and now , farewell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 22]: Edward bowed , and then turned to the Intendant , who had apparently been waiting while the conversation was going on .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 21]: The Intendant bade him a cordial farewell ; Edward shook Clara by the hand , and the cavalcade set off .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 39]: They all remained outside of the cottage till the party were at some distance , and then Edward walked apart with Humphrey , to communicate to him the offer made by the Intendant , and ask his opinion .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 19]: `` My opinion is made up , Edward ; which is , that you should accept it immediately .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 30]: You are under no obligation to the government , and you have already conferred such an obligation upon the Intendant that you have a right to expect a return .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 20]: Why stay here , when you can safely mix with the world and know how things are going on ?
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 20]: I do not require your assistance , now that I have Pablo , who is more useful every day .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 47]: Do not lose such an opportunity of making a friend for yourself and all of us -- a protector , I may say ; and who is , by what he has confided to you , anything but approving of the conduct of the present government .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 17]: He has paid you a deserved compliment by saying that he can and will trust you .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 19]: You must not refuse the offer , Edward -- it would really be folly if you did . ''
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 45]: `` I believe you are right , Humphrey ; but I have been so accustomed to range the forest -- I am so fond of the chase -- I am so impatient of control or confinement , that I hardly know how to decide .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 22]: A secretary 's life is anything but pleasing to me , sitting at a table writing and reading all day long .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 13]: The pen is but a poor exchange for the long-barrelled gun . ''
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 21]: `` It does more execution , nevertheless , '' replied Humphrey , `` if what I have read is true .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 16]: But you are not to suppose that your life will be such a sedentary one .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 16]: Did he not say that he would have to trust you with missions of importance ?
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 39]: Will you not , by going to London and other places , and mixing with people of importance , be preparing yourself for your proper station in life , which I trust that one day you will resume ?
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 57]: And does it follow that because you are appointed a secretary you are not to go out in the forest and shoot a deer with Oswald , if you feel inclined -- with this difference , that you may do it then without fear of being insulted or persecuted by such a wretch as that Corbould ?
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 43]: Do not hesitate any longer , my dear brother ; recollect that our sisters ought not to live this forest life as they advance in years -- they were not born for it , although they have so well conformed to it .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 41]: It depends upon you to release them eventually from their false position ; and you can never have such an opening as is now offered you , by one whose gratitude alone will make him anxious to serve you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 29]: `` You are right , Humphrey , and I will accept the offer ; I can but return to you if things do not go on well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 15]: `` I thank you sincerely for your decision , Edward , '' replied Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 10]: `` What a sweet girl that Patience Heatherstone is !
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 12]: -- I think I never saw such an enchanting smile ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 42]: Edward thought of the smile she gave him when they parted but an hour ago , and agreed with Humphrey , but he replied -- `` Why , brother , you are really in love with the Intendant 's daughter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 33]: `` Not so , my dear fellow ; but I am in love with her goodness and sweetness of disposition , and so are Alice and Edith , I can tell you .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 54]: She has promised to come over and see them , and bring them flowers for their garden , and I hardly know what ; and I am very glad of it , as my sisters have been buried here so long that they can not but gain by her company now and then .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 17]: I will leave Mistress Heatherstone for you ; I am in love with little Clara . ''
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 22]: `` Not a bad choice , Humphrey : we both aspire high , for two young foresters , do we not ?
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 21]: However , they say ` Every dog has his day , ' and Cromwell and his parliament may have theirs .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 22]: King Charles may be on his throne again now , long before -- you catch a forest pony , Humphrey . ''
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 30]: `` I hope he will , Edward : but recollect how you laughed at the idea of my catching a cow -- you may be surprised a second time .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 16]: ` Where there is a will there is a way , ' the saying is .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 29]: But I must go and help Alice with the heifer ; she is not very quiet yet , and I see her going out with her pail . ''
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 60]: The brothers then parted , and Edward walked about , turning over in his mind the events of the day , and very often finding his thoughts broken in upon by sudden visions of Patience Heatherstone -- and certainly the remembrance of her was to him the most satisfactory and pleasing portion of the prospect in his offered situation .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 18]: `` I shall live with her , and be continually in her company , '' thought he .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 15]: `` Well , I would take a less pleasing office if only for that .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 16]: She requested me to accept it to oblige her , and I will do so .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 8]: How hasty we are in our conclusions !
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 15]: When I first saw her father , what an aversion I felt for him !
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 21]: Now , the more I know him , the more I like him , nay , more -- respect him .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 36]: He said that the king wished to be absolute , and wrest the liberties from his subjects , and that they were justified in opposing him ; I never heard that when at Arnwood . ''
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 12]: `` If so , was it lawful so to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 39]: `` I think it was , but not to murder him ; that I can never admit , nor does the Intendant : on the contrary , he holds his murderers in as great detestation as I do .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 14]: Why , then , we do not think far apart from one another .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 58]: At the commencement , the two parties were -- those who supported him , not admitting that he was right , but too loyal to refuse to fight for their king -- and those who opposed , hoping to force him to do right ; the king for his supposed prerogatives , the people for their liberties .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 47]: The king was obstinate , the people resolute , until virulent warfare inflamed both parties , and neither would listen to reason ; and the people gained the upper hand , they wreaked their vengeance , instead of looking to the dictates of humanity and justice .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 18]: How easy it had been to have deposed him , and have sent him beyond the seas !
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 13]: Instead of which they detained him a prisoner and then murdered him .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 33]: The punishment was greater than the offence , and dictated by malice and revenge ; it was a diabolical act , and will soil the page of our nation 's history . ''
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 23]: So thought Edward , as he paced before the cottage , until he was summoned in by Pablo to their evening meal .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 26]: `` Edward , '' said Edith , `` scold Pablo ; he has been ill-treating my poor cat ; he is a cruel boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 3]: Pablo laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 29]: `` See , Edward , he 's laughing : put him in the pit-fall again , and let him stay there till he says he is sorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 17]: `` I very sorry now Missy Edith , but cat bite me , '' said Pablo .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 27]: `` Well , if pussy did , it did n't hurt you much ; and what did I tell you this morning out of the Bible ?
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 13]: -- that you must forgive them who behave ill to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 33]: `` Yes , Missy Edith , you tell me all that , and so I do ; I forgive pussy 'cause she bite me , but I kick her for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 11]: `` That 's not forgiveness , is it , Edward ?
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 16]: You should have forgiven it at once , and not kicked it at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 40]: `` Miss Edith , when pussy bite me , pussy hurt me , make me angry , and I give her a kick ; then I think what you tell me , and I do as you tell me .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 9]: I forgive pussy with all my heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 27]: `` I think you must forgive Pablo , Edith , '' said Edward , `` if it is only to set him a good example . ''
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 29]: `` Well , I will this time ; but if he kicks pussy again , he must be put in the pit-fall -- mind that , Pablo . ''
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 25]: `` Yes , Missy Edith , I go into pit-fall , and then you cry , and ask Master Edward to take me out .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 34]: When you have me put in pit-fall then you not good Christian , 'cause you not forgive ; when you cry and take me out , then you good Christian once more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 50]: By this conversation it will appear to the reader that they had been trying to impress Pablo with the principles of the Christian religion -- and such was the case ; Edith having been one of the most active in the endeavour , although very young for a missionary .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 31]: However , Alice and Humphrey had been more successful , and Pablo was now beginning to comprehend what they had attempted to instil , and was really progressing every day .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 15]: Edward remained at the cottage , expecting to hear some message from the Intendant .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 50]: He was right in his conjecture , for , on the third day , Oswald Partridge came ever to say that the Intendant would be happy to see him , if he could make it convenient to go over ; which Edward assented to do on the following day .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 18]: Oswald had ridden over on a pony : Edward arranged to take Billy and return with him .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 22]: They started early the next morning , and Edward asked Oswald if he knew why the Intendant had sent for him .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 40]: `` Not exactly , '' replied Oswald ; `` but I think , from what I heard Miss Patience say , it is to offer you some situation , if you could be prevailed upon to accept it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 17]: `` Very true , '' replied Edward ; `` he offers me the post of secretary .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 6]: What do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 46]: `` Why , sir , I think I would accept it ; at all events , I would take it on trial -- there can be no harm done : if you do not like it you can only go back to the cottage again .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 34]: One thing I am sure of , which is , that Master Heatherstone will make it as pleasant to you as he can , for he is most anxious to serve you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 27]: `` That I really believe , '' replied Edward ; `` and I have , pretty well , made up my mind to accept the office .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 42]: It is a post of confidence , and I shall know all that is going on , which I can not do while I am secluded in the forest ; and depend upon it , we shall have stirring news . ''
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 13]: `` I suppose you think that the king will come over ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 3]: replied Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 30]: `` I feel certain of it , Oswald ; and that is the reason why I want to be where I can know all that is going on . ''
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 55]: `` Well , sir , it is my opinion that the king will come over , as well as yours ; yet I think at present he stands but a poor chance ; Master Heatherstone knows more on that score than any one , I should think ; but he is very close . ''
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 20]: The conversation then changed , and after a ride of eight hours they arrived at the Intendant 's house .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 14]: Edward gave Billy into Oswald 's charge , and knocked at the door .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 19]: Phoebe let him in , and asked him into the sitting-room , where he found the Intendant alone .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 32]: `` Edward Armitage , I am glad to see you ; and shall be still more so if I find that you have made up your mind to accept my proposition .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 6]: What is your reply ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 64]: `` I am very thankful to you for the offer , sir , '' replied Edward ; `` and will accept it if you think that I am fitted for it , and if I find that I am equal to it : I can but give it a trial , and leave if I find it too arduous or too irksome . ''
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 25]: `` Too arduous it shall not be -- that shall be my concern ; and too irksome I hope you will not find it .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 35]: My letters are not so many but that I could answer them myself , were it not that my eyes are getting weak , and I wish to save them as much as possible .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 29]: You will therefore have to write chiefly what I shall dictate ; but it is not only for that I require a person that I can confide in .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 25]: I very often shall send you to London instead of going myself , and to that I presume you will have no objection ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 7]: `` Certainly none , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 37]: `` Well , then , it is no use saying any more just now ; you will have a chamber in this house , and you will live with me , and at my table altogether .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 20]: Neither shall I say anything just now about remuneration , as I am convinced that you will be satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 23]: All that I require now , is to know the day that you will come , that everything may be ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 13]: `` I suppose , sir , I must change my attire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 22]: replied Edward , looking at his forester 's dress ; `` that will hardly accord with the office of secretary . ''
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 34]: `` I agree with you that it will be better to keep that dress for your forest excursions , as I presume you will not altogether abandon them , '' replied the Intendant .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 11]: `` You can provide yourself with a suit at Lymington .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 8]: I will furnish you the means . ''
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 34]: `` I thank you , sir , I have means , much more than sufficient , '' replied Edward , `` although not quite so wealthy as little Clara appeared to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 6]: `` Wealthy , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 4]: replied the Intendant .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 16]: `` I had no idea that poor Ratcliffe possessed so much ready money and jewels .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 16]: Well , then , this is Wednesday ; can you come over next Monday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 19]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied Edward , `` I see no reason to the contrary . ''
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 20]: `` Well , then , that is settled , and I suppose you would like to see your accommodation .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 9]: Patience and Clara are in the next room .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 26]: You can join them , and you will make my daughter very happy by telling her that you are to become a resident with us .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 15]: You will of course dine with us to-day , and sleep here to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 41]: Mr Heatherstone then opened the door , and saying to his daughter , `` Patience , my dear , I leave you to entertain Edward Armitage till dinner-time , '' he ushered Edward in , and closed the door again .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 25]: Clara ran up to Edward as soon as he went in ; and having kissed him , Edward then took Patience 's offered hand .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 7]: `` Then you have consented ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 4]: said Patience inquiringly .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 14]: `` Yes , I could not refuse such kindness , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 8]: `` And when do you come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 15]: `` On Monday night , if I can be ready by that time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 11]: `` Why , what have you to get ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 3]: said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 15]: `` I must not appear in a forester 's dress , my little Clara .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 34]: I can wear that with a gun in my hand , but not with a pen : so I must go to Lymington and see what a tailor can do for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 23]: `` You will feel as strange in a secretary 's dress as I did in boys ' clothes , '' said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 55]: `` Perhaps I may , '' said Edward ; although he felt that such would not be the case , having been accustomed to much better clothes when at Arnwood than what were usually worn by secretaries ; and this remembrance brought back Arnwood in its train , and Edward became silent and pensive .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 38]: Patience observed it , and after a time said -- `` You will be able to watch over your sisters , Mr Armitage , as well here , almost , as if you were at the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 7]: You do not return till to-morrow ?
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 7]: How did you come over ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 11]: `` I rode the pony Billy , Mistress Patience . ''
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 12]: `` Why do you call her Mistress Patience , Edward ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 3]: said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 13]: `` You call me Clara : why not call her Patience ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 21]: `` You forget that I am only a forester , Clara , '' replied Edward , with a grave smile .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 15]: `` No , you are a secretary _ now _ , '' replied Clara .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 11]: `` Mistress Patience is older than you by several years .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 25]: I call you Clara , because you are but a little girl ; but I must not take that liberty with Mistress Heatherstone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 9]: `` Do you think so , Patience ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 3]: said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 89]: `` I certainly do not think that it would be a liberty in a person , after being well acquainted with me , to call me Patience , '' replied she ; `` especially when that person lives in the house with us , eats and associates with us as one of the family , and is received on an equality ; but I daresay , Clara , that Master Armitage will be guided by his own feelings , and act as he considers to be proper . ''
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 17]: `` But you give him leave , and then it is proper , '' replied Clara .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 15]: `` Yes , if he gave himself leave , Clara , '' said Patience .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 25]: `` But we will now show him his own room , Clara , '' continued Patience , wishing to change the subject of conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 9]: `` Will you follow us , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 9]: said Patience , with a little mock ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 19]: Edward did so without replying , and was ushered into a large airy room , very neatly furnished .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 20]: `` This is your future lodging , '' said Patience ; `` I hope you will like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 15]: `` Why , he never saw anything like it before , '' said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 11]: `` Yes I have , Clara , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 6]: `` Where did you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 14]: `` At Arnwood ; the apartments were on a much larger scale . ''
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 3]: `` Arnwood !
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 27]: Oh yes , I have heard my father speak of it , '' said Clara , with the tears starting in her eyes at his memory .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 17]: `` Yes , it was burnt down , and all the children burnt to death ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 18]: `` So they say , Clara ; but I was not there when it was burnt . ''
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 7]: `` Where were you then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 12]: `` I was at the cottage where I now live . ''
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 25]: Edward turned round to Patience , and perceived that her eyes were fixed upon him , as if she would have read his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 15]: Edward smiled , and said -- `` Do you doubt what I say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 6]: `` No , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 40]: said she , `` I have no doubt that you were at the cottage at the time ; but I was thinking that if the apartments at Arnwood were more splendid , those at your cottage are less comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 23]: You have been used to better and to worse , and therefore will , I trust , be content with these . ''
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 11]: `` I trust I have shown no signs of discontent .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 18]: I should indeed be difficult to please , if an apartment like this did not suit me .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 38]: Besides , allow me to observe , that although I stated that the apartments at Arnwood were on a grander scale , I never said that I had ever been a possessor of one of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 7]: Patience smiled and made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 31]: `` Now that you know your way to your apartment , Master Armitage , we will , if you please , go back to the sitting-room , '' said she .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 32]: As they were going back into the sitting-room she said -- `` When you come over on Monday , you will , I presume , bring your clothes in a cart ?
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 26]: I ask it , because I promised some flowers and other things to your sisters , which I can send back by the cart . ''
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 34]: `` You are very kind to think of them , Mistress Patience , '' replied Edward ; `` they are fond of flowers , and will be much pleased with possessing any . ''
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 13]: `` You sleep here to-night , I think my father said ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 3]: inquired Patience .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 37]: `` He did make the proposal , and I shall gladly avail myself of it , as I am not to trust to Phoebe 's ideas of comfort this time , '' said Edward , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 52]: `` Yes , that was a cross action of Phoebe 's ; and I can tell you , Master Armitage , that she is ashamed to look you in the face ever since ; but how fortunate for me that she was cross , and turned you out as she did !
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 35]: You must forgive her , as she was the means of your performing a noble action ; and I must forgive her , as she was the means of my life being saved . ''
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 24]: `` I have no feeling except kindness towards Phoebe , '' replied Edward ; `` indeed I ought to feel grateful to her !
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 33]: For if she had not given me so bad a bed that night , I never should have been so comfortably lodged as it is proposed that I shall be now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 20]: `` I hope you are hungry , Edward , '' said Clara ; `` dinner is almost ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 14]: `` I daresay I shall eat more than you do , Clara . ''
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 12]: `` So you ought , a great big man like you .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 8]: How old are you , Edward ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 20]: said Clara ; `` I am thirteen ; Patience is past sixteen : now how old are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 20]: `` I am not yet eighteen , Clara ; so that I can hardly be called a man . ''
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 12]: `` Why , you are as tall as Mr Heatherstone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 9]: `` Yes , I believe I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 14]: `` And ca n't you do everything that a man can do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 18]: `` I really do n't know ; but I certainly shall always try so to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 12]: `` Well , then , you must be a man . ''
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 15]: `` Clara , if it pleases you , I will be a man . ''
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 20]: `` Here comes Mr Heatherstone , so I know dinner is ready ; is it not , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 26]: `` Yes , my child , it is , '' replied Mr Heatherstone , kissing Clara ; `` so let us all go in . ''
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 37]: Mr Heatherstone , as was usual at that time with the people to whose party he ostensibly belonged , said a grace before meat , of considerable length , and then they sat down to table .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 52]: As soon as the repast was over Mr Heatherstone returned to his study , and Edward went out to find Oswald Partridge , with whom he remained the larger portion of the afternoon , going to the kennel and examining the dogs , and talking of matters connected with the chase .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 37]: `` I have not two men that can stalk a deer , '' observed Oswald ; `` the men appointed here as verderers and keepers have not one of them been brought up to the business .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 79]: Most of them are men who have been in the army , and I believe have been appointed to these situations to get rid of them , because they were troublesome ; and they are anything but good characters ; the consequence is , that we kill but few deer , for I have so much to attend to here , as none of them know their duties , that I can seldom take my own gun out .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 53]: I stated so to the Intendant , and he said , that if you accepted an offer he had made you , and came over here , we should not want venison ; so it is clear that he does not expect you to have your pen always in your hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 29]: `` I am glad to hear that , '' replied Edward ; `` depend upon it his own table , at all events , shall be well supplied .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 15]: Is not that the fellow Corbould , who is leaning against the wall ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 25]: `` Yes ; he is to be discharged , as he can not walk well , and the surgeon says he will always limp .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 23]: He owes you a grudge , and I am glad that he is going away , for he is a dangerous man .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 28]: But the sun is setting , Mr Edward , and supper will soon be on the table ; you had better go back to the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 28]: Edward bade Oswald farewell , and returned to the Intendant 's , and found that Oswald was correct , as supper was being placed on the table .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 26]: Soon after supper , Phoebe and the men-servants were summoned , and prayers offered up by the Intendant ; after which Patience and Clara retired .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 32]: Edward remained in conversation with the Intendant for about an hour , and then was conducted by him to his room , which had already been shown to him by Patience .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 8]: Edward did not sleep much that night .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 90]: The novelty of his situation -- the novelty of his prospects , and his speculations thereon , kept him awake till near morning ; he was , however , up in good time , and having assisted at the morning prayers , and afterwards eaten a most substantial breakfast , he took his leave of the Intendant and the two girls , and set off on his return to the cottage , having renewed his promise of coming on the following Monday to take up his abode with them .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 27]: Billy was fresh , and cantered gaily along , so that Edward was back early in the afternoon , and once more welcomed by his household .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 24]: He stated to Humphrey all that had occurred , and Humphrey was much pleased at Edward having accepted the offer of the Intendant .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 27]: Alice and Edith did not quite so much approve of it , and a few tears were shed at the idea of Edward leaving the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 18]: The next day , Edward and Humphrey set off for Lymington , with Billy in the cart .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 21]: `` Do you know , Edward , '' said Humphrey , `` what I am going to try and purchase ?
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 24]: I will tell you -- as many kids as I can , or goats and kids , I do n't care which . ''
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 11]: `` Why , have you not stock enough , already ?
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 20]: You will this year have four cows in milk , and you have two cow calves bringing up . ''
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 27]: `` That is very true , but I do not intend to have goats for their milk , but simply for eating in lieu of mutton .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 32]: Sheep I can not manage , but goats , with a little hay in winter , will do well , and will find themselves in the forest all the year round .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 34]: I wo n't kill any of the females for the first year or two , and after that I expect we shall have a flock sufficient to meet any demand upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 27]: `` It is not a bad idea , Humphrey ; they will always come home , if you have hay for them during the winter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 21]: `` Yes , and a large shed for them to lie in when the snow is on the ground . ''
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 32]: `` Now I recollect , when we used to go to Lymington , I saw a great many goats , and I have no doubt that they are to be purchased .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 19]: I will soon ascertain that for you , from the landlord of the hostelrie , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 19]: `` We will drive there first , as I must ask him to recommend me a tailor . ''
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 20]: On their arrival at Lymington , they went straight to the hostelrie , and found the landlord at home .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 28]: He recommended a tailor to Edward , who sent for him to the inn , and was measured by him for a plain suit of dark cloth .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 32]: Edward and Humphrey then went out , as Edward had to procure boots , and many other articles of dress to correspond with the one which he was about to assume .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 40]: `` I am most puzzled about a hat , Humphrey , '' said Edward : `` I hate those steeple-crowned hats , worn by the Roundheads ; yet the hat and feather is not proper for a secretary . ''
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 19]: `` I would advise you to submit to wear the steeple-crowned hats , nevertheless , '' said Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 35]: `` Your dress , as I consider , is a sort of disgrace to a cavalier born , and the heir of Arnwood ; why not , therefore , take its hat as well ?
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 29]: As secretary to the Intendant , you should dress like him ; if not , you may occasion remarks , especially when you travel on his concerns . ''
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 27]: `` You are right , Humphrey , I must not do things by halves ; and unless I wear the hat I might be suspected . ''
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 17]: `` I doubt if the Intendant wears it for any other reason , '' said Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 22]: `` At all events , I will not go to the height of the fashion , '' replied Edward , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 15]: `` Some of the hats are not quite so tall as the others . ''
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 14]: `` Here is the shop for the hat and for the sword-belt . ''
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 24]: Edward chose a hat and a plain sword-belt , paid for them , and desired the man to carry them to the hostelrie .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 62]: While all these purchases on the part of Edward , and many others by Humphrey , such as nails , saws , tools , and various articles which Alice required for the household , were being gathered together , the landlord had sent out to inquire for the goats , and found out at what price they were to be procured .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 62]: Humphrey left Edward to put away their goods into the cart , while he went out a second time , to see the goats ; with the man who had them for sale he made an agreement for a male and three females with two kids each at their sides , and ten more female kids which had just been weaned .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 54]: The man engaged to drive them from Lymington , as far as the road went into the forest , on the following day ; when Humphrey would meet him , pay him his money , and drive them to the cottage , which would only be three miles from the place agreed upon .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 20]: Having settled that satisfactorily , he returned to Edward , who was all ready , and they returned home .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 25]: `` We have dipped somewhat into the bag to-day , Edward , '' said Humphrey ; `` but the money is well spent . ''
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 34]: `` I think so , Humphrey , but I have no doubt that I shall be able to replace the money very soon , as the Intendant will pay me for my services .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 22]: The tailor has promised the clothes on Saturday without fail ; so that you or I must go for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 64]: `` I will go , Edward ; my sisters will wish you to stay with them now , as you are so soon to leave them ; and I will take Pablo with me , that he may know his way to the town ; and I will show him where to buy things , in case he goes there by himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 40]: `` It appears to me to have been a most fortunate thing your having caught Pablo as you did , Humphrey , for I do not well know how I could have left you if you had not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 86]: `` At all events I can do much better without you than I should have done , '' replied Humphrey ; `` although I think now that I could get on by myself ; but still , Edward , you know we can not tell what a day may bring forth , and I might fall sick , or something happen which might prevent my attending to anything ; and then , without you or Pablo , everything might have gone to wrack and ruin .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 37]: Certainly , when we think how we were left , by the death of old Jacob , to our own resources , we have much to thank God for in having got on so well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 21]: `` I agree with you , and also that it has pleased Heaven to grant us all such good health .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 26]: However , I shall be close at hand if you want me , and Oswald will always call and see how you get on . ''
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 14]: `` I hope you will manage that he calls once a week . ''
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 27]: `` I will if I can , Humphrey , for I shall be just as anxious as you are to know if all goes on well .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 34]: Indeed , I shall insist upon coming over to you once a fortnight ; and I hardly think the Intendant will refuse me -- indeed I am sure that he will not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 9]: `` So am I , '' replied Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 48]: `` I am certain that he wishes us all well , and has , in a measure , taken us under his protection ; but , Edward , recollect , I shall never kill any venison after this , and so you may tell the Intendant . ''
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 21]: `` I will , and that will be an excuse for him to send some over , if he pleases .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 33]: Indeed , as I know I shall be permitted to go out with Oswald , it will be hard if a stray buck does not find its way to the cottage . ''
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 14]: Thus did they continue talking over matters till they arrived at the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 24]: Alice came out to them , saying to Humphrey -- `` Well , Humphrey , have you brought my geese and ducks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 34]: Humphrey had forgotten them , but he replied , `` You must wait till I go to Lymington again on Saturday , Alice , and then I hope to bring them with me .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 11]: As it is , look how poor Billy is loaded .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 5]: Where 's Pablo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 5]: `` In the garden .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 15]: He has been working there all day , and Edith is with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 33]: `` Well then we will unload the cart , while you get us something to eat , Alice , for we are not a little hungry , I can tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 26]: `` I have some rabbit stew on the fire , Humphrey , all ready for you , and you will find it very good . ''
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 10]: `` Nothing I like better , my dear girl .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 46]: Pablo wo n't thank me for bringing this home , '' continued Humphrey , taking the long saw out of the cart ; `` he will have to go to the bottom of the pit again , as soon as the pit is made . ''
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 23]: The cart was soon unloaded , Billy taken out and turned out to feed , and then they went in to supper .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 29]: Humphrey was off the next morning , with Pablo , at an early hour , to meet the farmer of whom he had purchased the goats and kids .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 34]: He found them punctual to the time , at the place agreed upon ; and being satisfied with the lot , paid the farmer his money and drove them home through the forest .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 18]: `` Goat very good , kid better ; always eat kid in Spain , '' said Pablo .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 10]: `` Were you born in Spain , Pablo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 9]: `` Not sure , but I think so .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 8]: First recollect myself in that country . ''
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 8]: `` Do you recollect your father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 8]: `` No ; never see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 10]: `` Did your mother never talk about him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 12]: `` Call her mother , but think no mother at all .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 5]: Custom with Gitanas . ''
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 10]: `` Why did you call her mother ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 15]: 'Cause she feed me when little , beat me when I get big . ''
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 6]: `` All mothers do that .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 8]: What made you come to England ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 34]: `` I do n't know , but I hear people say , Plenty of money in England -- plenty to eat -- plenty to drink ; bring plenty money back to Spain . ''
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 10]: `` How long have you been in England ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 17]: `` One , two , three year ; yes , three year and a bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 12]: `` Which did you like best , England or Spain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 16]: `` When with my people , like Spain best ; warm sun -- warm night .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 37]: England , little sun , cold night , much rain , snow , and air always cold ; but now I live with you , have warm bed , plenty victuals , like England best . ''
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 18]: `` But when you were with the gipsies , they stole everything , did they not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 31]: `` Not steal everything , '' replied Pablo , laughing , `` sometimes take and no pay when nobody there ; farmer look very sharp -- have big dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 10]: `` Did you ever go out to steal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 6]: `` Make me go out .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 27]: Not bring back something , beat me very hard ; suppose farmer catch me , beat hard too nothing but beat , beat , beat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 9]: `` Then they obliged you to steal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 23]: `` Suppose bring nothing home , first beat , and then not have to eat for one , two , three days .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 8]: How you like that , Master Humphrey ?
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 12]: I think you steal after no victuals for three days ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 34]: `` I should hope not , '' replied Humphrey , `` although I have never been so severely punished ; and I hope , Pablo , you will never steal any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 7]: `` Why steal any more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 3]: replied Pablo .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 13]: `` I not like to steal ; but because hungry I steal .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 22]: Now I never hungry , always have plenty to eat ; no one beat me now ; sleep warm all night .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 6]: Why I steal , then ?
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 38]: No , Master Humphrey , I never steal more , 'cause I have no reason why , and 'cause Missy Alice and Missy Edith tell me how the good God up there say must not steal . ''
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 35]: `` I am glad to hear you give that as a reason , Pablo , '' replied Humphrey , `` as it proves that my sisters have not been teaching you in vain . ''
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 12]: `` Like to hear Missy Alice talk ; she talk grave .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 36]: Missy Edith talk too , but she laugh very much ; very fond Missy Edith , very happy little girl ; jump about just like one of these kids we drive home ; always merry .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 2]: Hah !
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 11]: See cottage now ; soon get home , Massa Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 8]: Missy Edith like see kids very much .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 6]: Where we put them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINETEEN .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 25]: `` We will put them into the yard for the present ; I mean that Holdfast shall take charge of them by and by .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 7]: I will soon teach him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 22]: `` Yes , he take charge of coat , or anything I tell him , why not take charge of goats ?
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 5]: Clever dog , Holdfast .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 17]: Massa Humphrey , you think Massa Edward take away both his dogs , Smoker and Watch ?
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 7]: I say better not take puppy .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 8]: Take Smoker , and leave puppy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 8]: `` I agree with you , Pablo .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 8]: We ought to have two dogs here .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 7]: I will speak to my brother .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 28]: Now run forward and open the gate of the yard , and throw them some hay , Pablo , while I go and call my sisters . ''
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 27]: The flock of goats was much admired , and the next morning was driven out into the forest to feed , attended by Pablo and Holdfast .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 22]: When it was dinner-time , Pablo drove the flock near to the cottage , telling the dog to mind the goats .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 76]: The sensible animal remained at once with them until Pablo 's return from dinner ; and it may be as well to observe here that in a few days the dog took charge of them altogether , driving them home to the yard every evening ; and as soon as they were put into the yard the dog had his supper , and he took good care , therefore , not to be too late .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 6]: To return to our narrative .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 41]: On Saturday Humphrey and Pablo went to Lymington to bring home Edward 's clothes , and Humphrey made Pablo acquainted with all that he wanted him to know , in case it might be necessary to send him there alone .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 16]: Edward remained with his sisters , as he was to leave them on the Monday .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 44]: Sunday was passed as usual ; they read the service at old Armitage 's grave , and afterwards they walked in the forest ; for Sunday was the only day on which Alice could find time to leave her duties in the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 36]: They were not more grave than usual at the idea of Edward 's leaving them , but they kept up their spirits , as they were aware that it was for the advantage of all .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 30]: On Monday morning , Edward , to please his sisters , put on his new clothes , and put his forester 's dress in the bundle with his linen .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 23]: Alice and Edith thought he looked very well in them , and said that it reminded them of the days of Arnwood .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 35]: The fact was that Edward appeared as he was -- a gentleman born ; that could not well be concealed under a forester 's dress , and in his present attire it was undeniable .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 11]: After breakfast Billy was harnessed and brought to the cottage-door .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 32]: Edward 's linen was put in the cart , and , as he had agreed with Humphrey , he took only Smoker with him , leaving the puppy at the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 10]: Pablo went with him to bring back the cart .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 27]: Edward kissed his sisters , who wept at the idea of his leaving them , and shaking hands with Humphrey set off to cross the forest .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 9]: `` Who would ever have believed this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 51]: thought Edward , as he drove across the forest ; `` that I should put myself under the roof and under the protection of a Roundhead -- one in outward appearance , and in the opinion of the world at least , if he is not so altogether in opinion .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 22]: There is surely some spell upon me , and I almost feel as if I were a traitor to my principles .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 19]: Why I know not , I feel a regard for that man , and a confidence in him .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 6]: And why should I not ?
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 16]: He knows my principles , my feelings against his party , and he respects them .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 26]: Surely he can not wish to gain me over to his party ; that were indeed ridiculous -- a young forester -- a youth unknown .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 14]: No , he would gain nothing by that , for I am nobody .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 11]: It must be from good-will , and no other feeling .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 18]: I have obliged him in the service I rendered his daughter , and he is grateful . ''
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 39]: Perhaps , had Edward put the question to himself , `` Should I have been on such friendly terms with the Intendant -- should I have accepted his offer , if there had been no Patience Heatherstone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 28]: he might then have discovered what was the `` spell upon him '' which had rendered him so tractable ; but of that he had no idea .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 27]: He only felt that his situation would be rendered more comfortable by the society of an amiable and handsome girl , and he inquired no further .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 33]: His reverie was broken by Pablo , who appeared tired of holding his tongue , and said , `` Massa Edward , you not like leave home -- you think very much .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 6]: Why you go there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 57]: `` I certainly do not like to leave home , Pablo , for I am very fond of my brother and sisters ; but we can not always do as we wish in this world , and it is for their sakes , more than from my own inclinations , that I have done so . ''
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 18]: `` Ca n't see what good you do Missy Alice and Missy Edith 'cause you go away .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 11]: How it possible do good , and not with them ?
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 13]: Suppose bad accident , and you away , how you do good .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 14]: Suppose bad accident , and you at cottage , then you do good .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 11]: I think , Massa Edward , you very foolish . ''
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 67]: Edward laughed at this blunt observation of Pablo 's , and replied , `` It is very true , Pablo , that I can not watch over my sisters , and protect them in person when I am away ; but there are reasons why I should go , nevertheless , and I may be more useful to them by going than by remaining with them .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 12]: If I did not think so I would not leave them .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 12]: They know nobody , and have no friends in the world .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 8]: Suppose anything was to happen to me .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 41]: Suppose both Humphrey and I were to die -- for you know that we never know how soon that event may take place -- who would there be to protect my poor sisters , and what would become of them ?
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 29]: Is it not , therefore , wise that I should procure friends for them , in case of accident , who would look after them and protect them ?
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 22]: And it is my hope , that by leaving them now , I shall make powerful and kind friends for them .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 6]: Do you understand me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 16]: `` Yes , I see now ; you think more than me , Massa Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 17]: I say just now , you foolish ; I say now , Pablo great fool . ''
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 103]: `` Besides , Pablo , recollect that I never would have left them as long as there was only Humphrey and me to look after them , because an accident might have happened to one of us ; but when you came to live with us , and I found what a good clever boy you were , and that you were fond of us all , I then said , ` Now I can leave my sisters , for Pablo shall take my place , and assist Humphrey to do what is required , and to take care of them . '
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 8]: Am I not right , Pablo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 22]: `` Yes , Massa Edward , '' replied Pablo , taking hold of Edward 's wrist , `` you quite right .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 37]: Pablo does love Missy Alice , Missy Edith , Massa Humphrey , and you , Massa Edward ; he love you all very much indeed ; he love you so much that he die for you !
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 6]: Can do no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 25]: `` That is what I really thought of you , Pablo , and yet I am glad to hear it from your own mouth .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 54]: If you had not come to live with us , and had not proved so faithful , I could not have left to benefit my sisters ; but you have induced me to leave , and they have to thank you if I am able to be of any service to them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 28]: `` Well , Massa Edward , you go ; never mind us , we make plenty of work ; do everything all the same as you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 21]: `` I think you will , Pablo , and that is the reason why I have agreed to go away .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 18]: But , Pablo , Billy is growing old , and you will want some more ponies . ''
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 24]: `` Yes , Massa Edward , Massa Humphrey talk to me about ponies last night , and say , plenty in the forest .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 10]: Ask me if I think us able catch them .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 16]: I say yes , catch one , two , twenty , suppose want them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 9]: How will you do that , Pablo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 24]: `` Massa Edward , you tell Massa Humphrey no possible , so I no tell you how , '' replied Pablo , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 15]: `` Some day you come see us , see five ponies in the stable .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 17]: Massa Humphrey and I , we talk about , find out how ; you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 34]: `` Well , then , I shall ask no more questions , Pablo ; and when I see the ponies in the stable then I 'll believe it , and not before . ''
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 19]: `` Suppose you want big horse for ride , catch big horse , Massa Edward , you see .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 10]: Massa Humphrey very clever , he catch cow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 8]: `` Catch gipsy , '' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 24]: `` Yes , '' said Pablo , laughing , `` catch cow , catch gipsy , and by and by catch horse . ''
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 22]: When Edward arrived at the Intendant 's house , he was very kindly received by the Intendant and the two girls .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 48]: Having deposited his wardrobe in his bedroom , he went out to Oswald and put Smoker in the kennel , and on his return found Pablo sitting on the carpet in the sitting-room , talking to Patience and Clara , and they all three appeared much amused .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 39]: When Pablo and Billy had both had something to eat , the cart was filled with pots of flowers , and several other little things as presents from Patience Heatherstone , and Pablo set off on his return .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 16]: `` Edward , you do look like a -- , '' said Clara , stopping .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 12]: `` Like a secretary , I hope , '' added Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 17]: `` Well , you do n't look like a forester ; does he , Patience ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 3]: continued Clara .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 14]: `` You must not judge of people by their clothes , Clara . ''
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 9]: `` Nor do I , '' replied Clara .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 35]: `` Those clothes would not look well upon Oswald , or the other men , for they would not suit them ; but they do suit you : do n't they , Patience ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 18]: Patience Heatherstone , however , did not make any answer to this second appeal made by Clara .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 11]: `` Why do n't you answer me , Patience ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 3]: said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 21]: `` My dear Clara , it 's not the custom for young maidens to make remarks upon people 's attire .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 9]: Little girls like you may do so . ''
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 18]: `` Why , did you not tell Pablo that he looked well in his new clothes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 12]: `` Yes , but Pablo is not Mr Armitage , Clara .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 6]: That is very different . ''
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 48]: `` Well , it may be , but still you might answer a question , if put to you , Patience ; and I ask again , does not Edward look much better in the dress he has on than in that he generally has worn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 18]: `` I think it a becoming dress , Clara , since you will have an answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 28]: `` Fine feathers make fine birds , Clara , '' said Edward , laughing : `` and so that is all we can say about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 6]: Edward then changed the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 24]: Soon afterwards dinner was announced , and Clara again observed to Edward -- `` Why do you always call Patience , Mistress Heatherstone ?
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 11]: Ought he not to call her Patience , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 8]: said Clara , appealing to the Intendant .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 18]: `` That must depend upon his own feelings , my dear Clara , '' replied Mr Heatherstone .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 13]: `` It is my intention to waive ceremony as much as possible .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 27]: Edward Armitage has come to live with us as one of the family , and he will find himself treated by me as one of us .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 41]: I shall , therefore , in future address him as Edward , and he has my full permission , and I may say it is my wish , that he should be on the same familiar terms with us all .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 52]: When Edward feels inclined to address my daughter as he does you , by her name of baptism , he will , I daresay , now that he has heard my opinion , do so ; and reserve ` Mistress Heatherstone ' for the time when they have a quarrel . ''
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 41]: `` Then I hope he will never again address me that way , '' observed Patience ; `` for I am under too great obligations to him to bear even the idea of being on had terms with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 9]: `` Do you hear that , Edward ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 3]: said Clara .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 30]: `` Yes , I do , Clara ; and after such a remark , you may be sure that I shall never address her in that way again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 10]: In a few days Edward became quite at home .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 40]: In the forenoon Mr Heatherstone dictated one or two letters to him , which he wrote ; and after that his time was at his own disposal , and was chiefly passed in the company of Patience and Clara .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 33]: With the first he had now become on the most intimate and brotherly footing ; and when they addressed each other , Patience and Edward were the only appellations made use of .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 33]: Once Mr Heatherstone asked Edward whether he would not like to go out with Oswald to kill a deer , which he did ; but the venison was hardly yet in season .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 58]: There was a fine horse in the stable at Edward 's order , and he often rode out with Patience and Clara ; indeed his time passed so agreeably that he could hardly think it possible that a fortnight had passed away , when he asked permission to go over to the cottage and see his sisters .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 28]: With the Intendant 's permission , Patience and Clara accompanied him ; and the joy of Alice and Edith was great , when they made their appearance .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 43]: Oswald had , by Edward 's request , gone over a day or two before , to tell them that they were coming , that they might be prepared ; and the consequence was that it was a holiday at the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 18]: Alice had cooked her best dinner , and Humphrey and Pablo were at home to receive them .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 21]: `` How pleasant it will be , if we are to see you and Clara whenever we see Edward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 5]: said Alice to Patience .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 20]: `` So far from being sorry that Edward is with you I shall be quite glad of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 23]: `` I water the flowers every day , '' said Edith , `` and they make the garden look so gay . ''
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 29]: `` I will bring you plenty more in the autumn , Edith ; but this is not the right time for transplanting flowers yet , '' replied Patience .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 37]: `` And now , Alice , you must take me to see your farm , for when I was here last I had no time ; let us come now , and show me everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 25]: `` But my dinner , Patience ; I can not leave it , or it will be spoiled , and that will never do .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 21]: You must either go with Edith now , or wait till after dinner , when I can get away . ''
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 25]: `` Well , then , we will stay till after dinner , Alice , and we will help you to serve it up . ''
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 18]: `` Thank you , Pablo generally does that , for Edith can not reach down the things .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 9]: I do n't know where he is . ''
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 16]: `` He went away with Edward and Humphrey , I think , '' said Edith .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 17]: `` I 'll scold him when he comes back for being out of the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 40]: `` Never mind , Edith , I can reach the dishes , '' said Patience , `` and you and Clara can then take them , and the platters , and put them on the table for Alice . ''
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 17]: And Patience did as she proposed , and the dinner was soon afterwards on the table .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 70]: There was a ham , and two boiled fowls , and a piece of salted beef , and some roasted kid , besides potatoes and green peas ; and when it is considered that such a dinner was set on the table by such young people , left entirely to their own exertions and industry , it must be admitted that it did them and their farm great credit .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 30]: In the meantime Edward and Humphrey , after the first greetings were over , had walked out to converse , while Pablo had taken the horses into the stable .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 12]: `` Well , Humphrey , how do you get on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 8]: `` Very well , '' replied Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 10]: `` I have just finished a very tough job .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 25]: I have dug out the saw-pit , and have sawed the slabs for the sides of the pit , and made it quite secure .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 29]: The large fir-tree that was blown down is now at the pit , ready for sawing up into planks , and Pablo and I are to commence to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 27]: At first we made but a bad hand of sawing off the slabs , but before we had cut them all we got on pretty well .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 31]: Pablo do n't much like it , and indeed no more do I much , it is such mechanical work , and so tiring ; but he does not complain .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 29]: I do not intend that he shall saw more than two days in a week ; that will be sufficient ; we shall get on fast enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 24]: `` You are right , Humphrey ; it is an old saying , that you must not work a willing horse to death .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 15]: Pablo is very willing , but hard work he is not accustomed to . ''
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 23]: `` Well , now you must come and look at my flock of goats , Edward , they are not far off .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 24]: I have taught Holdfast to take care of them , and he never leaves them now , and brings them home at night .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 17]: Watch always remains with me , and is an excellent dog , and very intelligent . ''
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 11]: `` You have indeed a fine flock , Humphrey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 3]: said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 16]: `` Yes , and they are improved in appearance already since they have been here .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 34]: Alice has got her geese and ducks , and I have made a place large enough for them to wash in , until I have time to dig them out a pond . ''
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 30]: `` I thought we had gathered more hay than you required ; but with this addition , I think you will find none to spare before the spring . ''
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 28]: `` So far from it , that I have been mowing down a great deal more , Edward , and it is almost ready to carry away .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 25]: Poor Billy has had hard work of it , I assure you , since he came back , with one thing and another . ''
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 30]: `` Poor fellow , but it wo n't last long , Humphrey , '' said Edward , smiling ; `` the other horses will soon take his place . ''
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 29]: `` I trust they will , '' said Humphrey , `` at all events by next spring ; before that I do not expect that they will . ''
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 28]: `` By the bye , Humphrey , you recollect what I said to you that the robber I shot told me , just before he died ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 42]: `` Yes , I do recollect it now , '' replied Humphrey ; `` but I had quite forgot all about it till you mentioned it now , although I wrote it down , that we might not forget it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 13]: `` Well , I have been thinking all about it , Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 38]: The robber told me that the money was mine , taking me for another person ; therefore I do not consider it was given to me , nor do I consider that it was his to give .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 21]: I hardly know what to do about it , nor to whom the money can be said to belong . ''
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 10]: `` Well I think I can answer that question .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 36]: The property of all malefactors belongs to the king ; and therefore this money belongs to the king ; and we may retain it for the king , or use it for his service . ''
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 44]: `` Yes , it would have belonged to the king had the man been condemned , and hung on the gallows as he deserved ; but he was not , and therefore I think that it does not belong to the king . ''
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 24]: `` Then it belongs to whoever finds it , and who keeps it till it is claimed -- which will never be . ''
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 24]: `` I think I must speak to the Intendant about it , '' replied Edward ; `` I should feel more comfortable . ''
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 23]: `` Then do so , '' replied Humphrey ; `` I think you are right to have no concealments from him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 18]: `` But , Humphrey , '' replied Edward , laughing , `` what silly fellows we are !
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 37]: We do not yet know whether we shall find anything ; we must first see if there is anything buried there ; and when we have done so , then we will decide how to act .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 38]: I shall , if it please God , be over again in a fortnight , and in the meantime , do you find out the place , and ascertain if what the fellow said is true . ''
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 8]: `` I will , '' replied Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 21]: `` I will go to-morrow , with Billy and the cart , and take a spade and pick-axe with me .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 37]: It may be a fool 's errand , but still they say , and one would credit , for the honour of human nature , that the words of a dying man are those of truth .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 16]: We had better go back now , for I think dinner must be ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 56]: Now that they had become so intimate with Patience Heatherstone -- and I may add , so fond of her -- there was no longer any restraint , and they had a very merry dinner-party ; and after dinner , Patience went out with Alice and Edith , and looked over the garden and farm .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 44]: She wished very much to ascertain if there was anything that they required , but she could discover but few things , and those only trifles ; but she recollected them all , and sent them to the cottage a few days afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 70]: But the hour of parting arrived , for it was a long ride back , and they could not stay any longer , if they wished to get home before dark , as Mr Heatherstone had requested Edward that they should do ; so the horses were brought out , and wishing good-bye , they set off again , little Edith crying after them , `` Come again soon !
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 8]: Patience , must come again soon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWENTY .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 24]: The summer had now advanced , when Oswald one day said to Edward -- `` Have you heard the news , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 35]: `` Nothing very particular , '' replied Edward ; `` I know that General Cromwell is over in Ireland , and they say very successful ; but I have cared little for particulars . ''
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 36]: `` They say a great deal more , sir , '' replied Oswald ; `` they say that the king is in Scotland , and that the Scotch have raised an army for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 9]: replied Edward , `` that is news indeed !
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 10]: The Intendant has never mentioned it to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 23]: `` I daresay not , sir ; for he knows your feelings , and would be sorry to part with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 39]: `` I will certainly speak to him on the subject , '' said Edward , `` at the risk of his displeasure ; and join the army I will , if I find what you say is true .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 27]: I should hold myself a craven to remain here while the king is fighting for his own , and not to be at his side . ''
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 37]: `` Well , sir , I think it is true , for I heard that the Parliament had sent over for General Cromwell to leave Ireland , and lead the troops against the Scotch army . ''
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 8]: `` You drive me mad , Oswald !
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 9]: I will go to the Intendant immediately ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 20]: Edward , much excited by the intelligence , went into the room where he usually sat with the Intendant .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 43]: The latter , who was at his desk , looked up , and saw how flushed Edward was , and said very quietly -- `` Edward , you are excited , I presume , from hearing the news which has arrived ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 32]: `` Yes , sir , I am very much so ; and I regret very much that I should be the last to whom such important news is made known . ''
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 34]: `` It is , as you say , important news , '' replied the Intendant ; `` but if you will sit down , we will talk a little upon the subject . ''
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 33]: Edward took a chair , and the Intendant said -- `` I have no doubt that your present feeling is to go to Scotland , and join the army without delay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 12]: `` Such is my intention , I candidly confess , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 6]: It is my duty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 18]: `` Perhaps you may be persuaded to the contrary before we part , '' replied the Intendant .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 32]: `` The first duty you owe is to your family in their present position ; they depend upon you ; and a false step on your part would be their ruin .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 22]: How can you leave them , and leave my employ , without it being known for what purpose you are gone ?
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 4]: It is impossible !
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 32]: I must myself make it known , and even then it would be very injurious to me , the very circumstance of my having one of your party in my service .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 33]: I am suspected by many already , in consequence of the part I have taken against the murder of the late king , and also of the lords who have since suffered .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 17]: But , Edward , I did not communicate this intelligence to you , for many reasons .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 43]: I knew that it would soon come to your ears , and I thought it better that I should be more prepared to show you that you may do yourself and me harm , and can do no good to the king .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 36]: I will now show you that I do put confidence in you ; and if you will read these letters , they will prove to you that I am correct in what I assert . ''
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 114]: The Intendant handed three letters to Edward , by which it was evident that all the king 's friends in England were of opinion that the time was not ripe for the attempt , and that it would be only a sacrifice to stir in the matter ; that the Scotch army raised was composed of those who were the greatest enemies to the king , and that the best thing that could happen for the king 's interest would be that they were destroyed by Cromwell ; that it was impossible for the English adherents of Charles to join them , and that the Scotch did not wish them so to do .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 24]: `` You are no politician , Edward , '' said the Intendant smiling , as Edward laid the letters down on the table .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 21]: `` You must admit , that in showing you these letters I have put the utmost confidence in you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 28]: `` You have indeed , sir ; and thanking you for having so done , I hardly need add that your confidence will never be betrayed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 29]: `` That I am sure of ; and I trust you will now agree with me and my friends that the best thing is to remain quiet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 17]: `` Certainly , sir , and for the future I will be guided by you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 25]: `` That is all I require of you ; and after that promise you shall hear all the news as soon as it arrives .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 48]: There are thousands who are just as anxious to see the king on the throne again as you are , Edward -- and you now know that I am one of them ; but the time is not yet come , and we must bide our time .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 14]: Depend upon it , that General Cromwell will scatter that army like chaff .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 7]: He is on his march now .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 24]: After what has passed between us this day , Edward , I shall talk unreservedly to you on what is going on . ''
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 41]: `` I thank you , sir , and I promise you faithfully , as I said before , not only to be guided by your advice but to be most secret in all that you may trust me with . ''
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 38]: `` I have confidence in you , Edward Armitage ; and now we will drop the subject for the present : Patience and Clara want you to walk with them , so good-bye for a while . ''
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 11]: Edward left the Intendant , much pleased with the interview .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 12]: The Intendant kept his word , and concealed nothing from Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 9]: All turned out as the Intendant had foretold .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 41]: The Scotch army was cut to pieces by Cromwell , and the king retreated to the Highlands ; and Edward now felt satisfied that he could do no better than be guided by the Intendant in all his future undertakings .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 12]: We must now pass over some time in a few words .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 15]: Edward continued at the Intendant 's , and gave great satisfaction to Mr Heatherstone .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 26]: He passed his time very agreeably , sometimes going out to shoot deer with Oswald , and often supplying venison to his brother and sisters .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 60]: During the autumn , Patience very often went to the cottage , and occasionally Mr Heatherstone paid them a visit ; but after the winter set in Edward came over by himself , shooting as he went ; and when he and Smoker came , Billy always had a journey to go for the venison left in the forest .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 46]: Patience sent Alice many little things for her own and Edith 's use , and some very good books for them to read ; and Humphrey , during the evenings , read with his sisters , that they might learn what he could teach them .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 8]: Pablo also learnt to read and write .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 33]: Humphrey and Pablo had worked at the saw-pit , and had sawed out a large quantity of boards and timber for building , but the work was put off till the spring .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 44]: The reader may recollect that Edward had proposed to Humphrey that he should ascertain whether what the robber had stated before his death , relative to his having concealed his ill-gotten wealth under the tree which was struck by lightning , was true .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 11]: About ten days afterwards Humphrey set off on this expedition .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 34]: He did not take Pablo with him , as , although he had a very good opinion of him , he agreed with Oswald that temptation should not be put in his way .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 31]: Humphrey considered that it would be the best plan to go at once to Clara 's cottage , and from that proceed to find the oak-tree mentioned by the robber .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 77]: When he arrived at the thicket which surrounded the cottage , it occurred to him that he would just go through it and see if it was in the state which they had left it in ; for after the Intendant had been there he had given directions to his men to remain and bury the bodies , and then to lock up the doors and bring the keys to him , which had been done .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 16]: Humphrey tied Billy and the cart to a tree , and walked through the thicket .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 26]: As he approached he heard voices ; so he took care to advance very cautiously , for he had not brought his gun with him .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 13]: He crouched down as he came to the opening before the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 56]: The doors and windows were open , and there were two men sitting outside , cleaning their guns ; and in one of them Humphrey recognised the man Corbould , who had been discharged by the Intendant as soon as his wound had been cured , and who was supposed to have gone to London .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 27]: Humphrey was too far off to hear what they said : he remained there some time , and three more men came out of the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 40]: Satisfied with what he had seen , Humphrey cautiously retreated , and gaining the outside of the thicket , led away Billy and the cart over the turf , that the noise of the wheels might not be heard .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 33]: `` This bodes no good , '' thought Humphrey , as he went along , every now and then looking back to ascertain if the men had come out and seen him .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 38]: `` That Corbould , we know , has vowed vengeance against Edward and all of us , and has no doubt joined those robbers -- for robbers they must be -- that he may fulfil his vow .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 21]: It is fortunate that I have made the discovery , and I will send over immediately to the Intendant . ''
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 62]: As soon as a clump of trees had shut out the thicket , and he had no longer any fear of being seen by these people , Humphrey went in the direction which the robber had mentioned , and soon afterwards he perceived the oak scathed with lightning , which stood by itself on a green spot of about twenty acres .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 38]: It had been a noble tree before it had been destroyed ; now it spread its long naked arms , covering a large space of ground , but without the least sign of vegetation or life remaining .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 20]: The trunk was many feet in diameter , and was apparently quite sound , although the tree was dead .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 34]: Humphrey left Billy to feed on the herbage close by , and then , from the position of the sun in the heavens , ascertained the point at which he was to dig .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 27]: First looking around him to see that he was not overlooked , he took his spade and pick-axe out of the cart and began his task .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 40]: There was a spot not quite so green as the rest , which Humphrey thought likely to be the very place that he should dig at , as probably it was not green from the soil having been removed .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 39]: He commenced at this spot , and after a few moment 's labour his pick-axe struck upon something hard , which , on clearing away the earth , he discovered to be the lid of a wooden box .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 36]: Satisfied that he was right , Humphrey now worked hard , and in a few minutes he had cleared sufficient space to be able to lift out the box and place it on the turf .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 25]: He was about to examine it , when he perceived , at about five hundred yards ' distance , three men coming towards him .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 23]: `` They have discovered me , '' thought Humphrey ; `` and I must be off as soon as I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 26]: He ran to Billy , who was close to him , and bringing the cart to where the box lay , he lifted it in .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 40]: As he was getting in himself , with the reins in his hands , he perceived that the three men were running towards him as fast as they could , and that they all had guns in their hands .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 24]: They were not more than a hundred and fifty yards from him when Humphrey set off , putting Billy to a full trot .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 38]: The three men observing this , called out to Humphrey to stop , or they would fire ; but Humphrey 's only reply was giving a lash to Billy , which set him off at a gallop .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 16]: The men immediately fired , and the bullets whistled past Humphrey without doing any harm .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 25]: Humphrey looked round , and finding that he had increased his distance , pulled up the pony , and went a more moderate pace .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 28]: `` You 'll not catch me , '' thought Humphrey ; `` and your guns are not loaded , so I 'll tantalise you a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 45]: He made Billy walk , and turned round to see what the men were about ; they had arrived at where he had dug out the box , and were standing round the hole , evidently aware that it was no use following him .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 28]: `` Now , '' thought Humphrey , as he went along at a faster pace , `` those fellows will wonder what I have been digging up .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 24]: The villains little think that I know where to find them , and they have proved what they are by firing at me .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 7]: Now , what must I do ?
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 29]: They may follow me to the cottage , for I have no doubt that they know where we live , and that Edward is at the Intendant 's .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 33]: They may come and attack us , and I dare not leave the cottage to-night , or send Pablo away , in case they should ; but I will to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 26]: Humphrey considered as he went along all the circumstances and probabilities , and decided that he would act as he at first proposed to himself .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 37]: In an hour he was at the cottage ; and as soon as Alice had given him his dinner -- for he was later than the usual dinner-hour -- he told her what had taken place .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 6]: `` Where is Pablo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 18]: `` He has been working in the garden with Edith all the day , '' replied Alice .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 38]: `` Well , dear , I hope they will not come to-night : to-morrow I will have them all in custody ; but if they do come , we must do our best to beat them off .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 66]: It is fortunate that Edward left the guns and pistols which he found in Clara 's cottage , so we shall have no want of firearms ; and we can barricade the doors and windows , so that they can not get in in a hurry ; but I must have Pablo to help me , for there is no time to be lost . ''
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 11]: `` But can not I help you , Humphrey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 3]: said Alice .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 8]: `` Surely I can do something ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 16]: `` We will see , Alice ; but I think I can do without you .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 7]: We have still plenty of daylight .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 10]: I will take the box into your room . ''
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 45]: Humphrey , who had only taken the box out of the cart and carried it within the threshold of the door , now took it into his sisters ' bedroom , and then went out and called Pablo , who came running to him .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 40]: `` Pablo , '' said Humphrey , `` we must bring to the cottage some of the large pieces we sawed out for rafters ; for I should not be surprised if the cottage were attacked this night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 9]: He then told Pablo what had taken place .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 23]: `` You see , Pablo , I dare not send to the Intendant to-night in case the robbers should come here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 31]: `` No , not send to-night , '' said Pablo ; `` stay here and fight them ; first make door fast , then cut hole to fire through . ''
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 8]: `` Yes , that was my idea .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 10]: You do n't mind fighting them , Pablo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 36]: `` No ; fight hard for Missy Alice and Missy Edith , '' said Pablo ; `` fight for you too , Massa Humphrey , and fight for myself , '' added Pablo , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 48]: They then went for the pieces of squared timber , brought them from the saw-pit to the cottage , and very soon fitted them to the doors and windows , so as to prevent several men , with using all their strength , from forcing them open .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 33]: `` That will do , '' said Humphrey ; `` and now get me the small saw , Pablo , and I will cut a hole or two to fire through . ''
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 35]: It was dark before they had finished , and then they made all fast , and went to Pablo 's room for the arms , which they got ready for service , and loaded .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 21]: `` Now , we are all ready , Alice , so let us have our supper , '' said Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 22]: `` We will make a fight for it , and they shall not get in so easily as they think . ''
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 21]: After they had had their supper , Humphrey said the prayers , and told his sisters to go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 30]: `` Yes , Humphrey , we will go to bed , but we will not undress ; for if they come , I must be up to help you .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 23]: I can load a gun , you know , and Edith can take them to you as fast as I load them .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 7]: Wo n't you , Edith ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 22]: `` Yes , I will bring you the guns , Humphrey , and you shall shoot them , '' replied Edith .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 12]: Humphrey kissed his sisters , and they went to their room .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 44]: He then put a light in the chimney , that he might not have to get one in case the robbers came , and then desired Pablo to go and lie down on his bed , as he intended to do the same .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 16]: Humphrey remained awake till past three o'clock in the morning ; but no robbers came .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 20]: Pablo was snoring loud , and at last Humphrey fell asleep himself and did not awake till broad daylight .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 19]: He got up , and found Alice and Edith were already in the sitting-room , lighting the fire .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 18]: `` I would not wake you , Humphrey , as you had been sitting up so long .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 22]: The robbers have not made their appearance , that is clear ; shall you unbar the door and window-shutters now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 8]: `` Yes , I think we may .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 5]: Here , Pablo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 17]: `` Yes , '' replied Pablo , coming out half asleep ; `` what the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 4]: Thief come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 24]: `` No , '' replied Edith , `` thief not come , but sun shine ; and lazy Pablo not get up . ''
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 8]: `` Up now , Missy Edith . ''
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 9]: `` Yes , but not awake yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 10]: `` Yes , Missy Edith , quite awake . ''
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 14]: `` Well then , help me to undo the door , Pablo . ''
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 17]: They took down the barricades , and Humphrey opened the door cautiously , and looked out .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 46]: `` They wo n't come now , at all events , I should think , '' observed Humphrey ; `` but there is no saying -- they may be prowling about , and may think it easier to get in during daytime than at night .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 37]: Go out , Pablo , and look about everywhere ; take a pistol with you , and fire it off if there is any danger , and then come back as fast as you can . ''
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 40]: Pablo took the pistol , and then Humphrey went out of the door and looked well round in front of the cottage , but he would not leave the door till he was assured that no one was there .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 28]: Pablo returned soon after , saying that he had looked round everywhere , and into the cow-house and yard , and there was nobody to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 11]: This satisfied Humphrey , and they returned to the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 41]: `` Now , Pablo , get your breakfast , while I write the letter to the Intendant , '' said Humphrey ; `` and then you must saddle Billy and go over as fast as you can with the letter .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 12]: You can tell him all I have not said in it .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 15]: I shall expect you back at night , and some people with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 22]: `` I see , '' said Pablo , who immediately busied himself with some cold meat which Alice put before him .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 18]: Pablo had finished his breakfast and brought Billy to the door before Humphrey had finished his letter .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 25]: As soon as it was written and folded Pablo set off as fast as Billy could go to the other side of the forest .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 105]: Humphrey continued on the look-out during the whole day , with his gun on his arm , and his two dogs by his side ; for he knew the dogs would give notice of the approach of any one , long before he might see them ; but nothing occurred during the whole day ; and when the evening closed in he barricaded the doors and windows , and remained on the watch with the dogs , waiting for the coming of the robbers , or for the coming of the party which he expected would be sent by the Intendant to take them .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 27]: Just as it was dark Pablo returned with a note from Edward saying that he would be over by ten o'clock , with a large party .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 55]: Humphrey had said in his letter that it would be better that any force sent by the Intendant should not arrive till after dark , as the robbers might be near and perceive them , and then they might escape ; he did not therefore expect them to come till some time after dark .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 41]: Humphrey was reading a book -- Pablo was dozing in the chimney-corner -- the two girls had retired into their room and had lain down on the bed in their clothes -- when the dogs both gave a low growl .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 11]: `` Somebody come , '' said Pablo , starting up .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 17]: Again the dogs growled , and Humphrey made a sign to Pablo to hold his tongue .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 22]: A short time of anxious silence succeeded , for it was impossible to ascertain whether the parties were friends or enemies .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 36]: The dogs now sprang up and barked furiously at the door , and as soon as Humphrey had silenced them , a voice was heard outside , begging for admission to a poor benighted traveller .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 28]: This was sufficient : it could not be the party from the Intendant 's , but the robbers who wished to induce them to open the door .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 59]: Pablo put a gun into Humphrey 's hand , and took another for himself ; he then removed the light into the chimney , and on the application from outside being repeated , Humphrey answered -- `` That he never opened the door at that hour of the night , and that it was useless their remaining . ''
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 55]: No answer or repetition of the request was made , but , as Humphrey retreated with Pablo into the fireplace , a gun was fired into the lock of the door , which was blown off into the room , and had it not been for the barricades the door must have flown open .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 65]: The robbers appeared surprised at such not being the case , and one of them inserted his arm into the hole made in the door to ascertain what might be the further obstacle to open it , when Pablo slipped past Humphrey , and gaining the door , discharged his gun under the arm which had been thrust into the hole in the door .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 21]: The person , whoever it might have been , gave a loud cry , and fell at the threshold outside .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 22]: `` I think that will do , '' said Humphrey ; `` we must not take more life than is necessary .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 24]: I had rather that you had fired through his arm -- it would have disabled him , and that would have sufficed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 9]: `` Kill much better , '' said Pablo .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 20]: `` Corbould shot through leg , come again to rob ; suppose shot dead , never rob more . ''
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 22]: The dogs now flew to the back of the cottage , evidently pointing out that the robbers were attempting that side .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 15]: Humphrey put his gun through the hole in the door , and discharged it .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 13]: `` Why you do that , Massa Humphrey , nobody there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 40]: `` I know that , Pablo ; but if the people are coming from the Intendant 's they will see the flash and perhaps hear the report , and it will let them know what is going on . ''
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 24]: `` There is another gun loaded , Humphrey , '' said Alice , who with Edith had joined them without Humphrey observing it .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 37]: `` Thanks , love ; but you and Edith must not remain here : sit down on the hearth , and then you will be sheltered from any bullet which they may fire into the house .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 21]: I have no fear of their getting in , and we shall have help directly , I have no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 29]: Pablo , I shall fire through the back door ; they must be there , for the dogs have their noses under it , and are so violent .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 19]: Do you fire another gun , as a signal , through the hole in the front door . ''
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 23]: Humphrey stood within four feet of the back door , and fired just above where the dogs held their noses and barked .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 15]: Pablo discharged his gun as directed , and then returned to reload the guns .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 21]: The dogs were now more quiet , and it appeared as if the robbers had retreated from the back door .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 28]: Pablo blew out the light , which had been put more in the centre of the room , when Alice and Edith took possession of the fireplace .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 52]: `` No fear , Missy Edith , I know where find everything , '' said Pablo , who now went and peered through the hole in the front door , to see if the robbers were coming to it again ; but he could see and hear nothing for some time .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 82]: At last the attack was renewed ; the dogs flew backwards and forwards , sometimes to one door and then to another , as if both were to be assailed : and at the same time a crash in Alice 's bed-chamber told them that the robbers had burst in the small window in that room , which Humphrey had not paid any attention to , as it was so small that a man could hardly introduce his body through it .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 43]: Humphrey immediately called Holdfast and opened the door of the room ; for he thought that a man forcing his way in would be driven back or held by the dog , and he and Pablo dared not leave the two doors .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 35]: Watch , the other dog , followed Holdfast into the bedroom ; and oaths and curses , mingled with the savage yells of the dogs , told them that a conflict was going on .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 26]: Both doors were now battered with heavy pieces of timber at the same time , and Pablo said -- `` Great many robbers here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 47]: A moment or more had passed , during which Pablo and Humphrey had both again fired their guns through the door , when , of a sudden , other sounds were heard -- shots were fired outside , loud cries , and angry oaths and exclamations .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 20]: `` The Intendant 's people are come , '' said Humphrey , `` I am sure of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 24]: Shortly afterwards Humphrey heard his name called by Edward , and he replied , and went to the door and undid the barricades .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 20]: `` Get a light , Alice , dear , '' said Humphrey , `` we are all safe now .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 21]: I will open the door directly , Edward , but in the dark I can not see the fastenings . ''
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 9]: `` Are you all safe , Humphrey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 8]: `` Yes , all safe , Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 8]: Wait till Alice brings a light . ''
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 12]: Alice soon brought one , and then the door was unfastened .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 38]: Edward stepped over the body of a man which lay at the threshold , saying -- `` You have settled somebody there , at all events , '' and then caught Edith and Alice in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 15]: He was followed by Oswald and some other men , leading in the prisoners .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 12]: `` Bind that fellow fast , Oswald , '' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 20]: `` Get another light , Pablo ; let us see who it is that lies outside the door . ''
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 24]: `` First see who is in my bedroom , Edward , '' said Alice , `` for the dogs are still there . ''
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 7]: `` In your bedroom , dearest ?
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 11]: Well , then , let us go there first . ''
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 30]: Edward went in with Humphrey , and found a man half in the window and half out , held by the throat and apparently suffocated by the two dogs .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 41]: He took the dogs off ; and desiring the men to secure the robber , and ascertain whether he was alive or not , he returned to the sitting-room , and then went to examine the body outside the door .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 8]: `` Corbould , as I live ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 3]: cried Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 15]: `` Yes , '' replied Edward ; `` he has gone to his account .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 5]: God forgive him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 52]: On inquiry they found that of all the robbers , to the number of ten , not one had escaped -- eight they had made prisoners , Corbould , and the man whom the dogs had seized , and who was found to be quite dead , made up the number .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 49]: The robbers were all bound and guarded ; and then , leaving them under the charge of Oswald and five of his men , Edward and Humphrey set off with seven more to Clara 's cottage , to ascertain if there were any more to be found there .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 33]: They arrived by two o'clock in the morning , and on knocking several times the door was opened and they seized another man , the only one who was found in it .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 23]: They then went back to the cottage with their prisoner , and by the time that they had arrived it was daylight .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 34]: As soon as the party sent by the Intendant had been supplied with breakfast , Edward bade farewell to Humphrey and his sisters , that he might return and deliver up his prisoners .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 16]: Pablo went with him to bring back the cart which carried the two dead bodies .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 27]: This capture cleared the forest of the robbers who had so long infested it , for they never had any more attempts made from that time .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 140]: Before Edward left , Humphrey and he examined the box which had been dug up from under the oak , and which had occasioned such danger to the inmates of the cottage ; for one of the men stated to Edward that they suspected that the box which they had seen Humphrey dig out contained treasure , and that without they had seen him in possession of it , they never should have attacked the cottage , although Corbould had often persuaded them so to do ; but as they knew that he was only seeking revenge -- and they required money to stimulate them -- they had refused , as they considered that there was nothing to be obtained in the cottage worth the risk , as they knew that the inmates had firearms and would defend themselves .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 38]: On examination of its contents , they found in it a sum of forty pounds in gold , a bag of silver , and some other valuables in silver spoons , candlesticks , and ornaments for women .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 41]: Edward took a list of the contents , and when he returned he stated to the Intendant all that had occurred , and requested to know what should be done with the money and other articles which Humphrey had found .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 29]: `` I wish you had said nothing to me about it , '' said the Intendant , `` although I am pleased with your open and fair dealing .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 30]: I can not say anything , except that you had better let Humphrey keep it till it is claimed -- which , of course , it never will be .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 29]: But , Edward , Humphrey must come over here and make his deposition , as I must report the capture of these robbers and send them to trial .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 22]: You had better go with the clerk and take the depositions of Pablo and your sisters , while Humphrey comes here .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 7]: You can stay till his return .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 32]: Their depositions are not of so much consequence as Humphrey 's , as they can only speak as to the attack , but Humphrey 's I must take down myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 33]: When Patience and Clara heard that Edward was going over , they obtained leave to go with him to see Alice and Edith , and were to be escorted back by Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 14]: This the Intendant consented to , and they had a very merry party .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 27]: Humphrey remained two days at the Intendant 's house , and then returned to the cottage , where Edward had taken his place during his absence .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 18]: The winter set in very severe , and the falls of snow were very heavy and frequent .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 25]: It was fortunate Humphrey had been so provident in making so large a quantity of hay , or the stock would have been starved .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 35]: The flock of goats , in great part , subsisted themselves on the bark of trees and moss ; at night they had some hay given to them , and they did very well .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 35]: It was hardly possible for Edward to come over to see his brother and sisters , for the snow was so deep as to render such a long journey too fatiguing for a horse .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 30]: Twice or thrice after the snow fell he contrived to get over , but after that they knew that it was impossible , and they did not expect him .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 30]: Humphrey and Pablo had little to do except attending to the stock , and cutting firewood to keep up their supply , for they now burnt it very fast .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 18]: The snow lay several feet high round the cottage , being driven against it by the wind .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 26]: They had kept a passage clear to the yard , and had kept the yard as clear as possible : they could do no more .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 22]: A sharp frost and clear weather succeeded to the snow-storms , and there appeared no chance of the snow melting away .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 17]: The nights were dark and long , and their oil for their lamp was getting low .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 41]: Humphrey was anxious to go to Lymington , as they required many things ; but it was impossible to go anywhere except on foot , and walking was , from the depth of the snow , a most fatiguing exercise .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 56]: There was one thing , however , that Humphrey had not forgotten , which was , that he had told Edward that he would try and capture some of the forest ponies ; and during the whole of the time since the heavy fall of snow had taken place he had been making his arrangements .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 39]: The depth of the snow prevented the animals from obtaining any grass , and they were almost starved , as they could find nothing to subsist upon except the twigs and branches of trees which they could reach .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 27]: Humphrey went out with Pablo and found the herd , which was about five miles from the cottage , and near to Clara 's old home .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 42]: He and Pablo brought with them as much hay as they could carry , and strewed it about , so as to draw the ponies nearer to them , and then Humphrey looked for a place which would answer his purpose .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 65]: About three miles from the cottage he found what he thought would suit him ; there was a sort of avenue between two thickets , about a hundred yards wide ; and the wind blowing through this avenue , during the snow-storm , had drifted the snow at one end of it , and raised right across it a large mound several feet high .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 44]: By strewing small bundles of hay he drew the herd of ponies into this avenue , and in it he left them a good quantity to feed upon every night for several nights , till at last the herd went there every morning .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 15]: `` Now , Pablo , we must make a trial , '' said Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 15]: `` You must get your lassos ready , in case they should be required .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 44]: We must go to the avenue before daylight with the two dogs , tie one upon one side of the avenue and the other on the other , that they may bark and prevent the ponies from attempting to escape through the thicket .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 31]: Then we must get the ponies between us and the drift of snow which lies across the avenue , and try if we can not draw them into the drift .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 31]: If so , they will plunge in so deep that some of them will not be able to get out before we have thrown the ropes round their necks . ''
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 17]: `` I see , '' said Pablo ; `` very good -- soon catch them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 25]: Before daylight they went with the dogs and a large bundle of hay , which they strewed nearer to the mound of drifted snow .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 19]: They then tied the dogs up on each side , ordering them to lie down and be quiet .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 25]: Then they walked through the thicket so as not to be perceived , until they considered that they were far enough from the snow-drift .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 37]: About daylight the herd came to pick up the hay as usual , and after they had passed them Humphrey and Pablo followed in the thicket , not wishing to show themselves till the last moment .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 32]: While the ponies were busy with the hay , they suddenly ran out into the avenue and separated , so as to prevent the ponies from attempting to gallop past them .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 136]: Shouting as loud as they could , as they ran up to the ponies , and calling to the dogs , who immediately set up a barking on each side ; the ponies , alarmed at the noise and the appearance of humphrey and Pablo , naturally set off in the only direction which appeared to them to be clear , and galloped away towards the mound of drifted snow , with their tails streaming , and snorting and plunging in the snow as they hurried along ; but as soon as they arrived at the mound they plunged first up to their bellies , and afterwards , as they attempted to force their way where the snow was deeper , many of them stuck fast altogether , and struggled to clear themselves in vain .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 48]: Humphrey and Pablo , who had followed them as fast as they could run , now came up with them and threw the lasso over the neck of one , and ropes with slip nooses over two more , which were floundering in the snow there together .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 24]: The remainder of the herd , after great exertions , got clear off by turning round and galloping back -- through the avenue .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 29]: The three captured ponies made a furious struggle ; but by drawing the ropes tight round their necks they were well-nigh choked , and soon unable to move .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 21]: The lads then tied their fore-legs , and loosened the ropes round their necks that they might recover their breath .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 12]: `` Got them now , Massa Humphrey , '' said Pablo .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 26]: `` Yes , but our work is not yet over , Pablo ; we must get them home ; how shall we manage that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 14]: `` Suppose they no eat to-day and to-morrow , get very tame . ''
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 23]: `` I believe that will be the best way ; they can not get loose again , do all they can . ''
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 11]: `` No , sir ; but get one home to-day .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 11]: This very fine pony ; suppose we try him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 48]: Pablo then put the halter on , and tied the end short to the fore-leg of the pony , so that it could not walk without keeping its head close to the ground -- if it raised its head it was obliged to lift up its leg .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 35]: Then he put the lasso round its neck to choke it if it was too unruly , and , having done that , he cast loose the ropes which had tied its fore-legs together .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 12]: `` Now , Massa Humphrey , we get him home somehow .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 22]: First I go loose the dogs ; he ` fraid of the dogs , and run t ` other way . ''
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 39]: The pony , which was an iron-grey and very handsome , plunged furiously and kicked behind ; but it could not do so without falling down , which it did several times before Pablo returned with the dogs .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 52]: Humphrey held one part of the lasso on one side , and Pablo on the other , keeping the pony between them ; and with the dogs barking at it behind , they contrived , with a great deal of exertion and trouble , to get the pony to the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 30]: The poor animal , driven in this way on three legs , and every now and then choked with the lasso , was covered with foam before they arrived .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 33]: Billy was turned out of his stable to make room for the newcomer , who was fastened securely to the manger and then left without food , that he might become tame .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 70]: It was too late then , and they were too tired themselves to go for the other two ponies , so they were left lying on the snow all night , and the next morning they found them much tamer than they were at first , and during the day , following the same plan , they were both brought to the stable and secured alongside of the other .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 16]: One was a bay pony with black legs , and the other a brown one .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 13]: The bay pony was a mare , and the other two horses .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 34]: Alice and Edith were delighted with the new ponies , and Humphrey was not a little pleased that he had succeeded in capturing them , after what had passed between Edward and himself .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 38]: After two days ' fasting , the poor animals were so tame that they ate out of Pablo 's hand and submitted to be stroked and caressed ; and before they were a fortnight in the stable .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 11]: Alice and Edith could go up to them without danger .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 23]: They were soon broken in ; for the yard being full of muck , Pablo took them into it and mounted them .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 46]: They plunged and kicked at first , and tried all they could to get rid of him , but they sank so deep into the muck that they were soon tired out ; and after a month they were all three tolerably quiet to ride .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 18]: The snow was so deep all over the country that there was little communication with the metropolis .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 32]: The Intendant 's letter spoke of King Charles raising another army in Holland , and that his adherents in England were preparing to join him as soon as he marched southward .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 33]: `` I think , Edward , '' said the Intendant , `` that the king 's affairs do now wear a more promising aspect , but there is plenty of time yet .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 16]: I know your anxiety to serve your king , and I can not blame it .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 21]: I shall not prevent your going , although of course I must not be cognisant of your having so done .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 12]: When the winter breaks up I shall send you to London .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 32]: You will then be able better to judge of what is going on , and your absence will not create any suspicion ; but you must be guided by me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 11]: `` I certainly will , sir , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 18]: `` I should indeed like to strike one blow for the king , come what will . ''
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 39]: `` All depends upon whether they manage affairs well in Scotland ; but there is so much jealousy and pride , and I fear treachery also , that it is hard to say how matters may end . ''
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 30]: It was soon after this conversation that a messenger arrived from London with letters , announcing that King Charles had been crowned in Scotland with great solemnity and magnificence .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 49]: `` The plot thickens , '' said the Intendant ; `` and by this letter from my correspondent Ashley Cooper , I find that the king 's army is well appointed , and that David Lesley is Lieutenant-General : Middleton commands the horse , and Wemyss the artillery .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 26]: That Wemyss is certainly a good officer , but was not true to the late king : -- may he behave better to the present !
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 27]: Now , Edward , I shall send you to London , and I will give you letters to those who will advise you how to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 13]: You may take the black horse ; he will bear you well .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 67]: You will of course write to me , for Sampson will go with you , and you can send him back when you consider that you do not require or wish for his presence : there is no time to be lost , for , depend upon it , Cromwell , who is still at Edinburgh , will take the field as soon as he can .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 9]: Are you ready to start to-morrow morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 9]: `` Yes , sir , quite ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 30]: `` I fear that you can not go over to the cottage to bid farewell to your sisters , but perhaps it is better that you should not . ''
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 42]: `` I think so too , sir , '' replied Edward ; `` now that the snow has nearly disappeared I did think of going over , having been so long absent , but I must send Oswald over instead . ''
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 19]: `` Well , then , leave me to write my letters , and do you prepare your saddle-bags .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 7]: Patience and Clara will assist you .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 8]: Tell Sampson to come to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 31]: Edward went to Patience and Clara , and told them that he was to set off for London on the following morning , and was about to make his preparations .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 10]: `` How long do you remain , Edward ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 3]: inquired Patience .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 22]: `` I can not tell ; Sampson goes with me , and I must of course be guided by your father .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 11]: Do you know where the saddle-bags are , Patience ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 12]: `` Yes , Phoebe shall bring them to your room . ''
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 14]: `` And you and Clara must come and give me your assistance . ''
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 23]: `` Certainly we will , if you require it ; but I did not know that your wardrobe was so extensive . ''
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 24]: `` You know that it is anything but extensive , Patience ; but that is the reason why your assistance is more required .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 43]: A small wardrobe ought at least to be in good order ; and what I would require is , that you would look over the linen , and where it requires a little repair you will bestow upon it your charity . ''
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 31]: `` That we will do , Clara , '' replied Patience ; `` so get your needles and thread , and let us send him to London with whole linen .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 11]: We will come when we are ready , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 28]: `` I do n't like his going to London at all , '' said Clara ; `` we shall be so lonely when he has gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 21]: Edward had left the room , and having obtained the saddle-bags from Phoebe , had gone up to his chamber .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 56]: The first thing that he laid hold of was his father 's sword ; he took it down , and having wiped it carefully , he kissed it , saying , `` God grant that I may do credit to it , and prove as worthy to wield it as was my brave father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 45]: He had uttered these words aloud ; and again taking the sword , and laying it down on the bed , turned round , and perceived that Patience had , unknown to him , entered the room , and was standing close to him .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 26]: Edward was not conscious that he had spoken aloud , and therefore merely said , `` I was not aware of your presence , Patience .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 7]: Your foot is so light . ''
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 9]: `` Whose sword is that , Edward ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 12]: `` It is mine ; I bought it at Lymington . ''
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 14]: `` But what makes you have such an affection for that sword ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 6]: `` Affection for it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 35]: `` Yes ; as I came into the room you kissed it as fervently as -- '' `` As a lover would his mistress , I presume you would say , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 12]: `` Nay , I meant not to use such vain words .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 12]: I was about to say as a Catholic would a relic .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 8]: I ask you again , why so ?
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 7]: A sword is but a sword .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 14]: You are about to leave this on a mission of my father 's .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 24]: You are not a soldier , about to engage in strife and war ; if you were , why kiss your sword ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 6]: `` I will tell you .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 6]: I do love this sword .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 23]: I purchased it , as I told you , at Lymington , and they told me that it belonged to Colonel Beverley .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 10]: It is for his sake that I love it .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 12]: You know what obligations our family were under to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 18]: `` This sword was then wielded by Colonel Beverley , the celebrated Cavalier , was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 13]: said Patience , taking it from off the bed and examining it .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 20]: `` Yes , it was ; and here , you see , are his initials upon the hilt . ''
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 12]: `` And why do you take it to London with you ?
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 30]: Surely it is not the weapon which should be worn by a secretary , Edward : it is too large , and cumbrous , and out of character . ''
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 22]: `` Recollect , that till these last few months I have been a forester , Patience , and not a secretary .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 24]: Indeed I feel that I am more fit for active life than the situation which your father 's kindness has bestowed upon me .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 22]: I was brought up , as you have heard , to follow to the wars , had my patron lived . ''
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 5]: Patience made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 29]: Clara now joined them , and they commenced the task of examining the linen ; and Edward left the room , as he wished to speak with Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 8]: They did not meet again till dinner-time .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 21]: Edward 's sudden departure had spread a gloom over them all , -- even the Intendant was silent and thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 35]: In the evening he gave Edward the letters which he had written , and a considerable sum of money , telling him where he was to apply if he required more for his expenses .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 26]: The Intendant cautioned him on his behaviour in many points , and also relative to his dress and carriage during his stay in the metropolis .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 23]: `` If you should leave London there will be no occasion , nay , it would be dangerous to write to me .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 29]: I shall take it for granted that you will retain Sampson till your departure , and when he returns here I shall presume that you have gone north .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 17]: I will not detain you longer , Edward : may Heaven bless and protect you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 12]: So saying , the Intendant went away to his own room .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 7]: `` Kind and generous man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 16]: thought Edward ; `` how much did I mistake you when we first met ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 46]: Taking up the letters and bag of money , which still remained on the table , Edward went to his room , and having placed the letters and money in the saddle-bag , he commended himself to the Divine Protector , and retired to rest .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 21]: Before daylight the sound of Sampson 's heavy travelling boots below roused up Edward , and he was soon dressed .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 51]: Taking his saddle-bags on his arm , he walked softly downstairs , that he might not disturb any of the family ; but when he was passing the sitting-room he perceived that there was a light in it , and on looking in , that Patience was up and dressed .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 47]: Edward looked surprised , and was about to speak , when Patience said -- `` I rose early , Edward , because , when I took leave of you last night , I forgot a little parcel that I wanted to give you before you went .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 14]: It will not take much room , and may beguile a weary hour .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 8]: It is a little book of meditations .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 17]: Will you accept it , and promise me to read it when you have time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 26]: `` I certainly will , my dear Patience -- if I may venture on the expression -- read it , and think of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 17]: `` Nay you must read it and think of what it contains , '' replied Patience .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 6]: `` I will , then .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 18]: I shall not need the book to remind me of Patience Heatherstone , I assure you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 50]: `` And now , Edward , I do not pretend to surmise the reason of your departure , nor would it be becoming in me to attempt to discover what my father thinks proper to be silent upon , but I must beg you to promise one thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 33]: `` Name it , dear Patience , '' replied Edward ; `` my heart is so full at the thought of leaving you that I feel I can refuse you nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 24]: `` It is this , -- I have a presentiment , I know not why , that you are about to encounter danger .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 37]: If so , be prudent , -- be prudent for the sake of your dear sisters -- be prudent for the sake of all your friends , who would regret you -- promise me that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 34]: `` I do promise you , most faithfully , Patience , that I will ever have my sisters and you in my thoughts , and will not be rash under any circumstances . ''
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 15]: `` Thank you , Edward ; may God bless you and preserve you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 41]: Edward first kissed Patience 's hand , that was held in his own ; but perceiving the tears starting in her eyes , he kissed them off , without any remonstrance on her part , and then left the room .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 26]: In a few moments more he was mounted on a fine powerful black horse , and followed by Sampson , on his road to London .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 17]: We will pass over the journey , which was accomplished without any event worthy of remark .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 55]: Edward had , from the commencement , called Sampson to his side , that he might answer the questions he had to make upon all that he saw , and which the reader must be aware was quite new to one whose peregrinations had been confined to the New Forest and the town adjacent .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 25]: Sampson was a very powerful man , of a cool and silent character , by no means deficient in intelligence , and trustworthy withal .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 17]: He had long been a follower of the Intendant , and had served in the army .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 20]: He was very devout ; and generally , when not addressed , was singing hymns in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 35]: On the evening of the second day they were close to the metropolis , and Sampson pointed out to Edward Saint Paul 's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey , and other objects worthy of note .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 11]: `` And where are we to lodge , Sampson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 3]: inquired Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 24]: `` The best hotel that I know of for man and beast is the ` Swan with Three Necks , ' in Holborn .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 25]: It is not over frequented by roysterers , and you will there be quiet , and if your affairs demand it , unobserved . ''
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 25]: `` That will suit me , Sampson : I wish to observe , and not be observed , during my stay in London . ''
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 17]: Before dark they had arrived at the hotel , and the horses were in the stable .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 25]: Edward had procured an apartment to his satisfaction , and , feeling fatigued with his two days ' travelling , had gone to bed .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 30]: The following morning he examined the letters which had been given to him by the Intendant , and inquired of Sampson if he could direct him on his way .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 34]: Sampson knew London well : and Edward set out to Spring Gardens to deliver a letter , which the intendant informed him was confidential , to a person of the name of Langton .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 47]: Edward knocked and was ushered in , Sampson taking a seat in the hall while Edward was shown into a handsomely-furnished library , where he found himself in the presence of a tall spare man , dressed after the fashion of the Roundheads of the time .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 5]: He presented the letter .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 27]: Mr Langton bowed and requested Edward to sit down ; and after Edward had taken a chair , he then seated himself and opened the letter .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 39]: `` You are right welcome , Master Armitage , '' said Mr Langton ; `` I find that , young as you appear to be , you are in the whole confidence of our mutual friend Mr Heatherstone .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 37]: He hints at your being probably obliged to take a journey to the north , and that you will be glad to take charge of any letters which I may have to send in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 37]: I will have them ready for you ; and in case of need they will be such as will give a colouring to your proceeding , provided you may not choose to reveal your true object .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 12]: How wears our good friend Heatherstone , and his daughter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 7]: `` Quite well , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 24]: `` And he told me in one of his former letters that he had the daughter of our poor friend Ratcliffe with him .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 6]: Is it not so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 22]: `` It is , Mr Langton ; and as gentle and pretty a child as you could wish to see . ''
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 9]: `` When did you arrive in London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 7]: `` Yesterday evening , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 9]: `` And do you propose any stay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 17]: `` That I can not answer , sir ; I must be guided by your advice .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 25]: I have nought to do here , unless it be to deliver some three or four letters , given me by Mr Heatherstone . ''
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 71]: `` It is my opinion , Master Armitage , that the less you are seen in this city the better ; there are hundreds employed to find out newcomers , and to discover from their people , or by other means , for what purpose they may have come ; for you must be aware , Master Armitage , that the times are dangerous and people 's minds are various .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 27]: In attempting to free ourselves from what we considered despotism , we have created for ourselves a worse despotism , and one that is less endurable .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 24]: It is to be hoped that what has passed will make not only kings , but subjects , wiser than they have been .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 12]: Now what do you propose -- to leave this instantly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 10]: `` Certainly , if you think it advisable . ''
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 12]: `` My advice , then , is to leave London immediately .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 31]: I will give you letters to some friends of mine in Lancashire and Yorkshire ; in either county you can remain unnoticed , and make what preparations you think necessary .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 33]: But do nothing in haste -- consult well , and be guided by them , who will , if it is considered advisable and prudent , join with you in your project .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 6]: I need say no more .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 20]: Call upon me to-morrow morning an hour before noon , and I will have letters ready for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 13]: Edward rose to depart , and thanked Mr Langton for his kindness .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 19]: `` Farewell , Master Armitage , '' said Langton ; `` to-morrow at the hour of eleven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 66]: Edward then quitted the house , and delivered the other letters of credence , the only one of importance at the moment was the one of credit ; the others were to various members of the Parliament , desiring them to know Master Armitage as a confidential friend of the Intendant , and in case of need to exert their good offices in his behalf .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 18]: The letter of credit was upon a Hamburgh merchant , who asked Edward if he required money .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 42]: Edward replied that he did not at present , but that he had business to do for his employer in the north , and might require some when there , if it was possible to obtain it so far from London .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 7]: `` When do you set out ?
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 9]: And to what town do you go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 11]: `` That I can not well tell till to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 22]: `` Call before you leave this , and I will find some means of providing for you as you wish . ''
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 7]: Edward then returned to the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 66]: Before he went to bed he told Sampson that he found that he had to leave London on Mr Heatherstone 's affairs , and might be absent some time ; he concluded by observing that he did not consider it necessary to take him with him , as he could dispense with his services , and Mr Heatherstone would be glad to have him back .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 11]: `` As you wish , sir , '' replied Sampson .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 9]: `` When am I to go back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 11]: `` You may leave to-morrow as soon as you please .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 7]: I have no letter to send .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 23]: You may tell them that I am well , and will write as soon as I have anything positive to communicate . ''
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 14]: Edward then made Sampson a present , and wished him a pleasant journey .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 20]: At the hour appointed on the following day Edward repaired to Mr Langton , who received him very cordially .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 42]: `` I am all ready for you , Master Armitage : there is a letter to two Catholic ladies in Lancashire , who will take great care of you ; and here is one to a friend of mine in Yorkshire .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 22]: The ladies live about four miles from the town of Bolton , and my Yorkshire friend in the city of York .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 8]: You may trust to either of them .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 20]: And now , farewell ; and , if possible , leave London before nightfall -- the sooner the better .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 6]: Where is your servant ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 11]: `` He has returned to Mr Heatherstone this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 6]: `` You have done right .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 19]: Lose no time in leaving London ; and do n't be in a hurry in your future plans .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 4]: You understand me .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 15]: If any one accosts you on the road put no trust in any professions .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 13]: You of course are going down to your relations in the north .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 5]: Have you pistols ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 18]: `` Yes , sir ; I have a pair which belonged to the unfortunate Mr Ratcliffe . ''
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 30]: `` Then they are good ones , I 'll answer for it : no man was more particular about his weapons , or knew how to use them better .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 12]: Farewell , Master Armitage , and may success attend you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 15]: Mr Langton held out his hand to Edward , who respectfully took his leave .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 26]: Edward was certain that Mr Langton would not have advised him to leave London if he had not considered that it was dangerous to remain .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 61]: He therefore first called upon the Hamburgh merchant , who , upon his explanation , gave him a letter of credit to a friend who resided in the city of York ; and then returned to the hotel , packed up his saddle-bags , paid his reckoning , and , mounting his horse , set off on the northern road .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 31]: As it was late in the afternoon before he was clear of the metropolis , he did not proceed farther than Barnet , where he pulled up at the inn .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 33]: As soon as he had seen his horse attended to , Edward , with his saddle-bags on his arm , went into the room in the inn where all the travellers congregated .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 35]: Having procured a bed and given his saddle-bags into the charge of the hostess , he sat down by the fire , which , although it was warm weather , was nevertheless kept alight .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 24]: Edward had made no alteration in the dress which he had worn since he had been received in the house of Mr Heatherstone .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 9]: It was plain , although of good materials .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 24]: He wore a high-crowned hat , and altogether would , from his attire , have been taken for one of the Roundhead party .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 25]: His sword and shoulder-belt were indeed of more gay appearance than those usually worn by the Roundheads ; but this was the only difference .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 20]: When Edward first entered the room there were three persons in it , whose appearance was not very prepossessing .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 28]: They were dressed in what had once been very gay attire , but which now exhibited tarnished lace , stains of wine , and dust from travelling .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 28]: They eyed him as he entered with his saddle-bags , and one of them said -- `` That 's a fine horse you were riding , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 6]: Has he much speed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 32]: `` He has , '' replied Edward , as he turned away , and went into the bar to speak with the hostess , and give his property into her care .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 7]: `` Going north , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 8]: inquired the same person when Edward returned .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 17]: `` Not exactly , '' replied Edward , walking to the window to avoid further conversation .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 15]: `` The Roundhead is on the stilts , '' observed another of the party .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 37]: `` Yes , '' replied the first ; `` it is easy to see that he has not been accustomed to be addressed by gentlemen ; for half a pin I would slit his ears . ''
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 19]: Edward did not choose to reply ; he folded his arms and looked at the man with contempt .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 38]: The hostess , who had overheard the conversation , now called for her husband , and desired him to go into the room and prevent any further insults to the young gentleman who had just come in .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 53]: The host , who knew the parties , entered the room , and said -- `` Now you 'll clear out of this as fast as you can ; be off with you , and go to the stables , or I 'll send for somebody whom you will not like . ''
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 19]: The three men rose and swaggered , but obeyed the host 's orders , and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 25]: `` I am sorry , young Master , that these roysterers should have affronted you , as my wife tells me that they have .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 11]: I did not know that they were in the house .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 35]: We can not well refuse to take in their horses ; but we know well who they are , and , if you are travelling far , you had better ride in company . ''
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 30]: `` Thank you for your caution , my good host , '' replied Edward ; `` I thought that they were highwaymen , or something of that sort . ''
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 26]: `` You have made a good guess , sir ; but nothing has yet been proved against them , or they would not be here .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 16]: In these times we have strange customers , and hardly know who we take in .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 24]: You have a good sword there , sir , I have no doubt ; but I trust that you have other arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 16]: `` I have , '' replied Edward , opening his doublet and showing his pistols .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 7]: `` That 's right , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 11]: Will you take anything before you go to bed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 21]: `` Indeed I will , for I am hungry ; anything will do , with a pint of wine . ''
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 21]: As soon as he had supped Edward asked the hostess for his saddle-bags , and went up to his bed .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 17]: Early the next morning he rose and went to the stable to see his horse fed .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 17]: The three men were in the stables , but they did not say anything to him .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 28]: Edward returned to the inn , called for breakfast , and , as soon as he had finished , took out his pistols to renew the priming .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 25]: While so occupied he happened to look up , and perceived one of the men with his face against the window , watching him .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 36]: `` Well , now you see what you have to expect , if you try your trade with me , '' thought Edward , `` I am very glad that you have been spying . ''
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 28]: Having replaced his pistols , Edward paid his reckoning , and went to the stable desiring the ostler to saddle his horse and fix on his saddle-bags .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 12]: As soon as this was done he mounted and rode off .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 19]: Before he was well clear of the town the highwaymen cantered past him on three well-bred active horses .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 49]: `` I presume we shall meet again , '' thought Edward , who for some time cantered at a gentle rate , and then , as his horse was very fresh , he put him to a faster pace , intending to do a long day 's work .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 59]: He had ridden about fifteen miles , when he came to a heath , and , as he continued at a fast trot , he perceived the three highwaymen about a quarter of a mile in advance of him ; they were descending a hill which was between them , and he soon lost sight of them again .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 21]: Edward now pulled up his horse to let him recover his wind , and walked him gently up the hill .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 34]: He had nearly gained the summit when he heard the report of firearms , and soon afterwards a man on horse back , in full speed , galloped over the hill towards him .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 14]: He had a pistol in his hand , and his head turned back .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 19]: The reason for this was soon evident , as immediately after him appeared the three highwaymen in pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 14]: One fired his pistol at the man who fled , and missed him .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 19]: The man then fired in return , and with true aim , as one of the highwaymen fell .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 32]: All this was so sudden that Edward had hardly time to draw his pistol and put spurs to his horse before the parties were upon him , and were passing him .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 16]: Edward levelled at the second highwayman as he passed him , and the man fell .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 28]: The third highwayman , perceiving this , turned his horse to the side of the road , cleared a ditch , and galloped away across the heath .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 51]: The man who had been attacked had pulled up his horse when Edward came to his assistance , and now rode up to him , saying -- `` I have to thank you , sir , for your timely aid ; for these rascals were too many for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 12]: `` You are not hurt , I trust , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 3]: replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 19]: `` No , not the least ; the fellow singed my curls though , as you may perceive .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 10]: They attacked me but half a mile from here .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 49]: I was proceeding north when I heard the clatter of hoofs behind me ; I looked round , and saw at once what they were , and I sprung my horse out of the road to a thicket close to it , that they might not surround me .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 28]: One of the three rode forward to stop my passage , and the other two rode round to the back of the thicket to get behind me .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 36]: I then saw that I had separated them , and could gain a start upon them by riding back again , which I did as fast as I could , and they immediately gave chase .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 5]: The result you saw .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 21]: Between us we have broken up the gang ; for both these fellows seem dead , or nearly so . ''
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 9]: `` What shall we do with them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 12]: `` Leave them where they are , '' replied the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 10]: `` I am in a hurry to get on .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 23]: I have important business at the city of York , and can not waste my time in depositions , and such nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 20]: It is only two scoundrels less in the world , and there 's an end of the matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 23]: As Edward was equally anxious to proceed , he agreed with the stranger that it was best to do as he proposed .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 25]: `` I am also going north , '' replied Edward , `` and am anxious to get there as soon as I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 14]: `` With your permission we will ride together , '' said the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 34]: `` I shall be the gainer , as I shall feel that I have one with me who is to be trusted to in case of any further attacks during our journey . ''
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 31]: There was such a gentlemanlike , frank , and courteous air about the stranger , that Edward immediately assented to his proposal of their riding in company for mutual protection .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 42]: He was a powerful , well-made man , of apparently about one or two and twenty , remarkably handsome in person , dressed richly , but not gaudily , in the cavalier fashion , and wore a hat with a feather .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 29]: As they proceeded , they entered into conversation on indifferent matters for some time , neither party attempting by any question to discover who his companion might be .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 45]: Edward had more than once , when the conversation flagged for a minute , considered what reply he should give in case his companion should ask him the cause of his journey , and at last had made up his mind what to say .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 80]: A little before noon they pulled up to bait their horses at a small village , -- the stranger observing that he avoided Saint Alban 's , and all other large towns , as he did not wish to satisfy the curiosity of people , or to have his motions watched ; and therefore , if Edward had no objection , he knew the country so well that he could save time by allowing him to direct their path .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 61]: Edward was , as may be supposed , very agreeable to this , and during their whole journey they never entered a town , except they rode through it after dark ; and put up at humble inns on the roadside , where , if not quite so well attended to , at all events they were free from observation .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 23]: It was , however , impossible that this reserve could continue long , as they became more and more intimate every day .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 35]: At last the stranger said -- `` Master Armitage , we have travelled together for some time , interchanging thoughts and feelings , but with due reserve as respects ourselves and our own plans .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 5]: Is this to continue ?
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 29]: If so , of course you have but to say so ; but if you feel inclined to trust me , I have the same feeling towards you .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 51]: By your dress I should imagine that you belonged to a party to which I am opposed ; but your language and manners do not agree with your attire ; and I think a hat and feathers would grace that head better than the steeple-crowned affair which now covers it .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 17]: It may be that the dress is only assumed as a disguise : you know best .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 34]: However , as I say , I feel confidence in you , to whatever party you may belong , and I give you credit for your prudence and reserve in these troubled times .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 36]: I am a little older than you , and may advise you ; and I am indebted to you , and can not therefore betray you -- at least I trust you believe so . ''
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 42]: `` I do believe it , '' replied Edward ; `` and I will so far answer you , Master Chaloner , that this attire of mine is not the one which I would wear if I had my choice . ''
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 44]: `` I believe that , '' replied Chaloner ; `` and I can not help thinking you are bound north on the same business as myself , which is , I confess to you honestly , to strike a blow for the king .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 38]: If you are on the same errand , I have two old relations in Lancashire who are stanch to the cause ; and I am going to their house to remain until I can join the army .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 26]: If you wish it , you shall come with me , and I will promise you kind treatment and safety while under their roof . ''
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 14]: `` And the names of these relatives of yours , Master Chaloner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 3]: said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 17]: `` Nay , you shall have them ; for when I trust , I trust wholly .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 6]: Their name is Conynghame . ''
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 19]: Edward took his letters from out of his side-pocket , and handed one of them to his fellow-traveller .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 22]: The address was , `` To the worthy Mistress Conynghame , of Portlake , near Bolton , county of Lancaster . ''
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 18]: `` It is to that address that I am going myself , '' said Edward , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 14]: `` Whether it is the party you refer to you best know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 8]: Chaloner burst out with a loud laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 5]: `` This is excellent !
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 31]: Two people meet , both bound on the same business , both going to the same rendezvous , and for three days do not venture to trust each other . ''
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 16]: `` The times require caution , '' replied Edward , as he replaced his letter .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 17]: `` You are right , '' answered Chaloner , `` and you are of my opinion .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 11]: I know now that you have both prudence and courage .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 28]: The first quality has been scarcer with us Cavaliers than the last ; however , now all reserve is over , at least on my part . ''
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 10]: `` And on mine also , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 10]: Chaloner then talked about the chances of the war .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 51]: He stated that King Charles 's army was in a good state of discipline , and well found in everything ; that there were hundreds in England who would join it , as soon as it had advanced far enough into England ; and that everything wore a promising appearance .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 46]: `` My father fell at the battle of Naseby , at the head of his retainers , '' said Chaloner , after a pause ; `` and they have contrived to fine the property , so that it has dwindled from thousands down to hundreds .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 34]: Indeed , were it not for my good old aunts , who will leave me their estates , and who now supply me liberally , I should be but a poor gentleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 8]: `` Your father fell at Naseby ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 3]: said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 6]: `` Were you there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 8]: `` I was , '' replied Chaloner .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 12]: `` My father also fell at Naseby , '' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 6]: `` Your father did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 24]: replied Chaloner , `` I do not recollect the name -- Armitage -- he was not in command there , was he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 3]: continued Chaloner .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 10]: `` Yes , he was , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 28]: `` There was none of that name among the officers that I can recollect , young sir , '' replied Chaloner , with an air of distrust .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 8]: `` Surely you have been misinformed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 36]: `` I have spoken the truth , '' replied Edward ; `` and have now said so much that I must , to remove your suspicion , say more than perhaps I should have done .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 16]: My name is not Armitage , although I have been so called for some time .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 15]: You have set me the example of confidence , and I will follow it .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 13]: My father was Colonel Beverley , of Prince Rupert 's troop . ''
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 5]: Chaloner started with astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 31]: `` I 'm sure that what you say is true , '' at last said he ; `` for I was thinking who it was that you reminded me of .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 9]: You are the very picture of your father .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 23]: Although a boy at the time , I knew him well , Master Beverley ; a more gallant Cavalier never drew sword .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 40]: Come , we must be sworn friends in life and death , Beverley , '' continued Chaloner , extending his hand , which was eagerly grasped by Edward , who then confided to Chaloner the history of his life .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 31]: When he had concluded , Chaloner said -- `` We all heard of the firing of Arnwood , and it is at this moment believed that all the children perished .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 27]: It is one of the tales of woe that our nurses repeat to the children , and many a child has wept at your supposed deaths .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 31]: But tell me , now , had you not fallen in with me , was it your intention to have joined the army under your assumed name of Armitage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 10]: `` I hardly know what I intended to do .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 9]: I wanted a friend to advise me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 9]: `` And you have found one , Beverley .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 21]: I owe my life to you , and I will repay the debt as far as is in my power .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 30]: You must not conceal your name to your sovereign ; the very name of Beverley is a passport ; but the son of Colonel Beverley will be indeed welcomed .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 15]: Why , the very name will be considered as a harbinger of good fortune .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 23]: Your father was the best and truest soldier that ever drew sword ; and his memory stands unrivalled for loyalty and devotion .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 18]: We are near to the end of our journey ; yonder is the steeple of Bolton church .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 22]: The old ladies will be out of their wits when they find that they have a Beverley under their roof . ''
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 30]: Edward was much delighted at this tribute paid to his father 's memory , and the tears more than once started into his eyes as Chaloner renewed his praise .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 24]: Late in the evening they arrived at Portlake , a grand old mansion , situated in a park crowded with fine old timber .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 38]: Chaloner was recognised as they rode up the avenue by one of the keepers , who hastened forward to announce his arrival ; and the domestics had opened the door for them before they arrived at it .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 33]: In the hall they were met by the old ladies , who expressed their delight at seeing their nephew , as they had had great fear that something had happened to him .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 71]: `` And something did very nearly happen to me , '' replied Chaloner , `` had it not been for the timely assistance of my friend here , who , notwithstanding his Puritan attire , I hardly need tell you is a Cavalier devoted to the good cause , when I state that he is the son of Colonel Beverley , who fell at Naseby with my good father . ''
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 23]: `` No one can be more welcome , then , '' replied the old ladies , who extended their hands to Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 17]: They then went into a sitting-room , and supper was ordered to be sent up immediately .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 26]: `` Our horses will be well attended to , Edward , '' said Chaloner ; `` we need not any longer look after them ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 14]: And now , good aunts , have you no letters for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 15]: `` Yes , there are several ; but you had better eat first . ''
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 26]: `` Not so ; let me have the letters ; we can read them before supper , and talk them over when at table . ''
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 24]: One of the ladies produced the letters , which Chaloner , as he read them , handed over to Edward for his perusal .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 38]: They were from General Middleton , and some other friends of Chaloner 's who were with the army , giving him information as to what was going on , and what their prospects were supposed to be .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 35]: `` You see that they have marched already , '' said Chaloner , `` and I think the plan is a good one , and it has put General Cromwell in an awkward position .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 16]: Our army is now between his and London , with three days march in advance .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 25]: And we shall now be able to pick up our English adherents , who can join us without risk , as we go along .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 27]: It has been a bold step , but a good one ; and if they only continue as well as they have begun we shall succeed .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 23]: The Parliamentary army is not equal to ours in numbers , as it is ; and we shall add to ours daily .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 23]: The king has sent to the Isle of Man for the Earl of Derby , who is expected to join to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 11]: `` And where is the army at this moment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 3]: inquired Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 27]: `` They will be but a few miles from us to-night , their march is so rapid ; to-morrow we will join if it pleases . ''
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 8]: `` Most willingly , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 20]: After an hour 's more conversation , they were shown into their rooms , and retired for the night .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 42]: The next morning , before they had quitted their beds , a messenger arrived with letters from General Middleton , and from him they found that the king 's army had encamped on the evening before not six miles from Portlake .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 62]: As they hastily dressed themselves , Chaloner proposed to Edward that a little alteration in his dress would be necessary ; and taking him to a wardrobe in which had been put aside some suits of his own , worn when he was a younger and slighter-made man than he now was , he requested Edward to make use of them .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 47]: Edward , who was aware that Chaloner was right in his proposal , selected two suits of colours which pleased him most ; and dressing in one , and changing his hat for one more befitting his new attire , was transformed into a handsome Cavalier .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 28]: As soon as they had broken their fast they took leave of the old ladies , and , mounting their horses , set off for the camp .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 62]: An hour 's ride brought them to the outposts ; and communicating with the officer on duty , they were conducted by an orderly to the tent of General Middleton , who received Chaloner with great warmth as an old friend , and was very courteous to Edward as soon as he heard that he was the son of Colonel Beverley .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 60]: `` I have wanted you , Chaloner , '' said Middleton ; `` we are raising a troop of horse ; the Duke of Buckingham commands it , but Massey will be the real leader of it ; you have influence in this county , and will , I have no doubt , bring us many good hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 9]: `` Where is the Earl of Derby ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 24]: `` Joined us this morning ; we have marched so quick that we have not had time to pick our adherents up . ''
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 6]: `` And General Lesley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 14]: `` Is by no means in good spirits : why I know not .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 25]: We have too many ministers with his army , that is certain , and they do harm ; but we can not help ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 30]: His majesty must be visible by this time ; if you are ready I will introduce you ; and when that is done we will talk matters over . ''
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 39]: General Middleton then walked with them to the house in which the king had taken up his quarters for the night ; and after a few minutes ' waiting in the anteroom they were admitted into his presence .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 36]: `` Allow me , your majesty , '' said General Middleton , after the first salutations , `` to present to you Major Chaloner , whose father 's name is not unknown to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 28]: `` On the contrary , well-known to us , '' replied the king , `` as a loyal and faithful subject , whose loss we must deplore .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 15]: I have no doubt that his son inherits his courage and his fidelity . ''
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 16]: The king held out his hand , and Chaloner bent his knee and kissed it .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 32]: `` And now , your majesty will be surprised that I should present to you one of a house supposed to be extinct -- the eldest son of Colonel Beverley . ''
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 19]: replied his majesty ; `` I heard that all his family perished at the ruthless burning of Arnwood .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 26]: I hold myself fortunate , as a king , that even one son of so loyal and brave a gentleman as Colonel Beverley has escaped .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 35]: You are welcome , young sir -- most welcome to us ; you must be near us ; the very name of Beverley will be pleasing to our ears by night or day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 24]: Edward knelt down and kissed his majesty 's hand , and the king said -- `` What can we do for a Beverley ?
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 17]: Let us know , that we may show our feelings towards his father 's memory ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 26]: `` All I request is , that your majesty will allow me to be near you in the hour of danger , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 23]: `` A right Beverley reply , '' said the king , `` and so we shall see to it , Middleton . ''
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 30]: After a few more courteous words from his majesty they withdrew ; but General Middleton was recalled by the king for a minute or two to receive his commands .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 65]: When he rejoined Edward and Chaloner , he said to Edward -- `` I have orders to send in for his majesty 's signature your commission as captain of horse , and attached to the king 's personal staff ; it is a high compliment to the memory of your father , sir , and , I may add , your own personal appearance .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 34]: Chaloner will see to your uniforms and accoutrements ; you are well mounted , I believe you have no time to lose , as we march to-morrow for Warrington , in Cheshire . ''
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 11]: `` Has anything been heard of the Parliamentary army ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 24]: `` Yes ; they are on the march towards London by the Yorkshire road , intending to cut us off if they can .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 19]: And now , gentlemen , farewell ; for I have no idle time , I assure you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 12]: Edward was soon equipped , and now attended upon the king .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 19]: When they arrived at Warrington they found a body of horse drawn up to oppose their passage onwards .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 82]: These were charged , and fled with a trifling loss ; and as they were known to be commanded by Lambert , one of Cromwell 's best generals , there was great exultation in the king 's army ; but the fact was that Lambert had acted upon Cromwell 's orders , which were , to harass and delay the march of the king as much as possible , but not to risk with his small force anything like an engagement .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 38]: After this skirmish it was considered advisable to send back the Earl of Derby and many other officers of importance into Lancashire , that they might collect the king 's adherents in that quarter and in Cheshire .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 19]: Accordingly the earl , with about two hundred officers and gentlemen , left the army with that intention .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 85]: It was then considered that it would be advisable to march the army direct to London ; but the men were so fatigued with the rapidity of the march up to the present time , and the weather was so warm , that it was decided in the negative ; and as Worcester was a town well affected to the king , and the country abounded with provisions , it was resolved that the army should march there , and wait for English reinforcements .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 25]: This was done ; the city opened the gates with every mark of satisfaction , and supplied the army with all that it required .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 56]: The first bad news which reached them was the dispersion and defeat of the whole of the Earl of Derby 's party by a regiment of militia , which had surprised them at Wigan during the night , when they were all asleep , and had no idea that any enemy was near to them .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 35]: Although attacked at such a disadvantage , they defended themselves till a large portion of them were killed , and the remainder were taken prisoners , and most of them brutally put to death .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 18]: The Earl of Derby was made a prisoner , but not put to death with the others .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 12]: `` This is bad news , Chaloner , '' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 53]: `` Yes ; it is more than bad , '' replied the latter ; `` we have lost our best officers , who never should have left the army ; and now , the consequences of the defeat will be that we shall not have any people coming forward to join us .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 47]: The winning side is the right side in this world ; and there is more evil than that : the Duke of Buckingham has claimed the command of the army , which the king has refused ; so that we are beginning to fight among ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 13]: General Lesley is evidently dispirited , and thinks bad of the cause .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 10]: Middleton is the only man who does his duty .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 39]: Depend upon it we shall have Cromwell upon us before we are aware of it ; and we are in a state of sad confusion -- officers quarrelling , men disobedient , much talking , and little doing .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 27]: Here we have been five days , and the works , which have been proposed to be thrown up as defences , not yet begun . ''
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 22]: `` I can not but admire the patience of the king , with so much to harass and annoy him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 42]: `` He must be patient , perforce , '' replied Chaloner ; `` he plays for a crown , and it is a high stake ; but he can not command the minds of men , although he may the persons .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 35]: I am no croaker , Beverley ; but this I do say , that if we succeed with this army , as it is at present disorganised , we shall perform a miracle . ''
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 54]: `` We must hope for the best , '' replied Edward ; `` common danger may cement those who would otherwise be asunder ; and when they have the army of Cromwell before them , they may be induced to forget their private quarrels and jealousies and unite in the good cause . ''
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 35]: `` I wish I could be of your opinion , Beverley , '' replied Chaloner ; `` but I have mixed with the world longer than you have , and I think otherwise . ''
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 69]: Several more days passed , during which no defences were thrown up , and the confusion and quarrelling in the army continued to increase , until at last news arrived that Cromwell was within half a day 's march of them , and that he had collected all the militia on his route , and was now in numbers nearly double to those in the king 's army .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 32]: All was amazement and confusion -- nothing had been done -- no arrangements had been made -- and Chaloner told Edward that all was lost if immediate steps were not taken .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 13]: On the 3rd of October the army of Cromwell appeared in sight .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 54]: Edward had been on horseback , attending the king , for the best part of the night ; the disposition of the troops had been made as well as it could ; and it was concluded , as Cromwell 's army remained quiet , that no attempt would be made on that day .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 17]: About noon the king returned to his lodging , to take some refreshment after his fatigue .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 20]: Edward was with him ; but before an hour had passed the alarm came that the armies were engaged .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 54]: The king mounted his horse , which was ready saddled at the door ; but before he could ride out of the city he was met and nearly beaten back by the whole body almost of his own cavalry , who came running on with such force that he could not stop them .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 44]: His majesty called to several of the officers by name , but they paid no attention ; and so great was the panic , that both the king , and his staff who attended him , were nearly overthrown and trampled under foot .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 34]: Cromwell had passed a large portion of his troops over the river without the knowledge of his opponents , and when the attack was made in so unexpected a quarter a panic ensued .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 77]: Where General Middleton and the Duke of Hamilton commanded , a very brave resistance was made ; but Middleton being wounded , and the Duke of Hamilton having had his leg taken off by a round shot , and many gentlemen having fallen , the troops , deserted by the remainder of the army , at last gave way , and the rout was general , the foot throwing away their muskets before they were discharged .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 25]: His majesty rode back into the town and found a body of horse , who had been persuaded by Chaloner to make a stand .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 19]: `` Follow me , '' said his majesty , `` we will see what the enemy are about .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 21]: I do not think they pursue , and if so , we may yet rally from this foolish panic . ''
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 61]: His majesty , followed by Edward , Chaloner , and several of his personal staff , then galloped out to reconnoitre ; but to his mortification he found that the troops had not followed him , but gone out of the town by the other gate , and that the enemy 's cavalry in pursuit were actually in the town .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 30]: Under such circumstances , by the advice of Chaloner and Edward , his majesty withdrew , and turning his horse 's head he made all haste to leave Worcester .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 52]: After several hours ' riding , the king found himself in company of about 4000 of the cavalry who had so disgracefully fled ; but they were still so panic-struck that he could put no confidence in them , and having advised with those about him he resolved to quit them .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 53]: This he did without mentioning his intentions to any of his staff , not even Chaloner or Edward , leaving at night with two of his servants , whom he dismissed as soon as it was daylight , considering that his chance of escape would be greater if he was quite alone .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 43]: It was not till next morning that the troops discovered that the king had left them , and then they determined to separate , and as the major portion were from Scotland to make what haste they could back to that country .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 11]: And now Chaloner and Edward consulted as to their plans .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 52]: `` It appears to me , '' said Edward , laughing , `` that the danger of this campaign of ours will consist in getting back again to our own homes ; for I can most safely assert that I have not as yet struck a blow for the king . ''
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 8]: `` That is true enough , Beverley .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 11]: When do you purpose going back to the New Forest ?
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 18]: I think , if you will permit me , I will accompany you , '' said Chaloner .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 18]: `` All the pursuit will be to the northward to intercept and overtake the retreat into Scotland .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 28]: I can not therefore go to Lancashire ; and indeed , as they know that I am out , they will be looking for me everywhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 24]: `` Then come with me , '' said Edward ; `` I will find you protection till you can decide what to do .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 47]: Let us ride on away from this , and we will talk over the matter as we go ; but depend upon it , the farther south we get the safer we shall be ; but still not safe , unless we can change our costume .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 27]: There will be a strict search for the king to the south , as they will presume that he will try to get safe to France .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 2]: Hark !
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 4]: What is that ?
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 7]: I heard the report of arms .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 14]: Let us ride up this hill and see what is going on . ''
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 31]: They did so , and perceived that there was a skirmish between a party of Cavaliers and some of the Parliamentary cavalry at about a quarter of a mile distant .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 18]: `` Come , Chaloner , let us at all events have one blow , '' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 39]: `` Agreed , '' replied Chaloner , spurring his horse ; and down they went at full speed , and in a minute were in the _ melee _ , coming on the rear of the Parliamentary troops .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 9]: This sudden attack from behind decided the affair .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 34]: The Parliamentary troopers , thinking that there were wore than two coming upon them , made off after another minute 's combat , leaving five or six of their men on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 9]: `` Thanks , Chaloner thanks , Beverley ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 9]: said a voice , which they immediately recognised .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 11]: It was that of one of the king 's pages .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 19]: `` These fellows with me were just about to run if you had not come to our aid .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 18]: I will remain with them no longer , but join you if you will permit me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 18]: `` At all events remain here till they go away -- I will send them off . ''
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 18]: `` My lads , you must all separate , or there will be no chance of escape .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 8]: No more than two should ride together .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 14]: Depend upon it we shall have more of the troops here directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 53]: The men , about fifteen in number , who had been in company with Grenville , considered that Chaloner 's advice was good , and without ceremony set off with their horses ' heads to the northward , leaving Chaloner , Edward , and Grenville together on the field of the affray .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 34]: A dozen men were lying on the ground , either dead or severely wounded ; seven of them were of the king 's party , and the other five of the Parliamentary troops .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 53]: `` Now what I propose , '' said Edward , `` is this , -- let us do what we can for those who are wounded , and then strip off the dresses and accoutrements of those Parliamentary dragoons who are dead , and dress ourselves in them , accoutrements and all .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 27]: We can then pass through the country in safety , as we shall be supposed to be one of the parties looking for the king . ''
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 22]: `` That is a good idea , '' replied Chaloner , `` and the sooner it is done the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 68]: `` Well , '' said Edward , wiping his sword , which he still held drawn , and then sheathing it , `` I will take the spoils of this fellow nearest to me : he fell by my hand , and I am entitled to them by all the laws of war and chivalry ; but first let us dismount and look to the wounded . ''
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 60]: They tied their horses to a tree , and having given what assistance they could to the wounded men , they proceeded to strip three of the Parliamentary troopers ; and then , laying aside their own habiliments , they dressed themselves in the uniform of the enemy , and mounting their horses made all haste from the place .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 17]: Having gained about twelve miles , they pulled up and rode at a more leisurely pace .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 46]: It was now eight o'clock in the evening , but still not very dark ; they therefore rode on another five miles , till they came to a small village , where they dismounted at an ale-house , and put their horses into the stable .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 18]: `` We must be insolent and brutal in our manners , or we shall be suspected . ''
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 28]: `` Very true , '' said Grenville , giving the ostler a kick and telling him to bestir himself if he did not want his ears cropped .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 16]: They entered the ale-house , and soon found out they were held in great terror .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 66]: They ordered everything of the best to be produced , and threatened to set fire to the house if it was not ; they turned the man and his wife out of their bed , and all three went to sleep in it ; and , in short , they behaved in such an arbitrary manner that nobody doubted that they were Cromwell 's men .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 30]: In the morning they set off again , by Chaloner 's advice paying for nothing that they had ordered , although they had all of them plenty of money .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 41]: They now rode fast , inquiring at the places which they passed through whether any fugitives had been seen , and if they came to a town , inquiring , before they entered , whether there were any Parliamentary troops .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 53]: So well did they manage , that after four days they had gained the skirts of the New Forest , and concealed themselves in a thicket till night-time , when Edward proposed that he should conduct his fellow-travellers to the cottage , where he would leave them till his plans were arranged .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 7]: Edward had already arranged his plans .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 47]: His great object was to ward off any suspicion of where he had been , and of course any idea that the Intendant had been a party to his acts ; and the fortunate change of his dress enabled him now to do so with success .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 69]: He had decided to conduct his two friends to the cottage that night , and the next morning to ride over in his Parliamentary costume to the Intendant 's house , and bring the first news of the success of Cromwell and the defeat at Worcester ; by which stratagem it would appear as if he had been with the Parliamentary , and not with the Royalist army .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 61]: As they had travelled along , they found that the news of Cromwell 's success had not yet arrived : in those times there was not the rapidity of communication that we now have , and Edward thought it very probable that he would be the first to communicate the intelligence to the Intendant and those who resided near him .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 25]: As soon as it was dusk the three travellers left their retreat , and , guided by Edward , soon arrived at the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 46]: Their appearance at first created no little consternation , for Humphrey and Pablo happened to be in the yard when they heard the clattering of the swords and accoutrements , and through the gloom observed , as they advanced , that the party were troopers .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 64]: At first Humphrey was for running on and barring the door , but , on a second reflection , he felt that he could not do a more imprudent thing , if there was danger ; and he therefore contented himself with hastily imparting the intelligence to his sisters , and then remaining at the threshold to meet the coming of the parties .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 27]: The voice of Edward calling him by name dissipated all alarm , and in another minute he was in the arms of his brother and sisters .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 55]: `` First let us take our horses to the stable , Humphrey , '' said Edward , after the first greeting was over , `` and then we will come and partake of anything that Alice can prepare for us , for we have not fared over well for the last three days . ''
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 49]: Accompanied by Humphrey and Pablo , they all went to the stables , and turned out the ponies to make room for the horses ; and as soon as they were all fed and littered down they returned to the cottage , and Chaloner and Grenville were introduced .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 30]: Supper was soon on the table , and they were too hungry to talk while they were eating , so but little information was gleaned from them that night .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 33]: However , previous to Alice and Edith leaving the room to prepare beds for the newcomers , Humphrey ascertained that all was lost , and that they had escaped from the field .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 29]: When the beds were ready , Chaloner and Grenville retired , and then Edward remained half an hour with Humphrey , to communicate to him what had passed .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 35]: Of course he could not enter into detail ; but told him that he would get information from their new guests after he had left , which he must do early in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 66]: `` And now , Humphrey , my advice is this : My two friends can not remain in this cottage , for many reasons ; but we have the key of Clara 's cottage , and they can take up their lodging there , and we can supply them with all they want until they find means of going abroad , which is their intention .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 21]: I must be off to the Intendant 's to-morrow , and the day after I will come over to you .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 36]: In the meantime our guests can remain here , while you and Pablo prepare the cottage for them ; and when I return everything shall be settled , and we will conduct them to it .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 54]: I do not think there is much danger of their being discovered while they remain there , certainly not so much as if they were here ; for we must expect parties of troops in every direction now , as they were when the king 's father made his escape from Hampton Court .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 31]: And now to bed , my good brother ; and call me early , for I much fear that I shall not wake up , if you do not . ''
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 8]: The brothers then parted for the night .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 28]: The next morning , long before their guests were awake , Edward had been called by Humphrey , and found Pablo at the door with his horse .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 40]: Edward , who had put on his Parliamentary accoutrements , bade a hasty farewell to them , and set off across the forest to the house of the Intendant , where he arrived before they had left their bedrooms .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 18]: The first person he encountered was , very fortunately , Oswald , who was at his cottage-door .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 42]: Edward beckoned to him , being then about one hundred yards off ; but Oswald did not recognise him at first , and advanced towards him in a very leisurely manner , to ascertain what the trooper might wish to inquire .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 11]: But Edward called him Oswald , and that was sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 25]: In few words Edward told him how all was lost , and how he had escaped by changing clothes with one of the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 15]: `` I am now come to bring the news to the Intendant , Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 8]: You understand me , of course ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 31]: `` Of course I do , Master Edward , and will take care that it is well-known that you have been fighting by the side of Cromwell all this time .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 25]: I should recommend you to show yourself in this dress for the remainder of the day , and then every one will be satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 11]: Shall I go to the Intendant 's before you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 22]: `` No , no , Oswald ; the Intendant does not require me to be introduced to him , of course .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 12]: I must now gallop up to his house and announce myself .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 14]: Farewell for the present -- I shall see you during the day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 88]: Edward put spurs to his horse , and arrived at the Intendant 's at full speed , making no small clattering in the yard below as he went in , much to the surprise of Sampson , who came out to ascertain what was the cause , and who was not a little surprised at perceiving Edward , who threw himself off the horse , and desiring Sampson to take it to the stable , entered the kitchen , and disturbed Phoebe , who was preparing breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 18]: Without speaking to her , Edward passed on to the Intendant 's room , and knocked . ''
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 7]: _ Who _ is there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 4]: said the Intendant .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 15]: `` Edward Armitage , '' was the reply , and the door was opened .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 15]: The Intendant started back at the sight of Edward in the trooper 's costume .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 20]: `` My dear Edward , I am glad to see you in any dress ; but this requires explanation .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 8]: Sit down and tell me all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 29]: `` All is soon told , sir , '' replied Edward , taking off his iron skull-cap , and allowing his hair to fall down on his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 39]: He then , in few words , stated what had happened , and by what means he had escaped , and the reason why he had kept on the trooper 's accoutrements and made his appearance in them .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 48]: `` You have done very prudently , '' replied the Intendant , `` and you have probably saved me ; at all events you have warded off all suspicion , and those who are spies upon me will now have nothing to report except to my favour .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 21]: Your absence has been commented upon , and made known at high quarters , and suspicion has arisen in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 18]: Your return as one of the Parliamentary forces will now put an end to all ill-natured remarks .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 11]: My dear Edward , you have done me a service .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 49]: As my secretary , and having been known to have been a follower of the Beverleys , your absence was considered strange , and it was intimated at high quarters that you had gone to join the king 's forces , and that with my knowledge and consent .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 27]: This I have from Langton ; and it has in consequence injured me not a little : but now your appearance will make all right again .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 31]: Now we will first to prayers , and then to breakfast ; and after that we will have a more detailed account of what has taken place since your departure .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 28]: Patience and Clara will not be sorry to recover their companion ; but how they will like you in that dress I can not pretend to say .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 35]: However , I thank God that you have returned safe to us ; and I shall be most happy to see you once more attend in the more peaceful garb of a secretary . ''
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 33]: `` I will , with your permission , sir , not quit this costume for one day , as it may be as well that I should be seen in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 21]: `` You are right , Edward : for this day retain it ; to-morrow you will resume your usual costume .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 22]: Go down to the parlour ; you will find Patience and Clara anxiously waiting for you , I have no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 10]: I will join you there in ten minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 9]: Edward left the room , and went downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 15]: It hardly need be said how joyfully he was received by Patience and Clara .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 17]: The former , however , expressed her joy in tears -- the latter in wild mirth .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 27]: We will pass over the explanations and the narrative of what had occurred , which was given by Edward to Mr Heatherstone in his own room .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 79]: The Intendant said , as he concluded -- `` Edward , you must now perceive that , for the present , nothing more can be done ; if it pleases the Lord , the time will come when the monarch will be reseated on his throne ; at present , we must bow to the powers that be ; and I tell you frankly it is my opinion that Cromwell aims at sovereignty , and will obtain it .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 65]: Perhaps it may be better that we should suffer the infliction for a time , as for a time only can it be upheld , and it may be the cause of the king being more schooled and more fitted to reign than , by what you have told me in the course of your narrative , he at present appears to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 10]: `` Perhaps so , sir , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 19]: `` I must say that the short campaign I have gone through has very much opened my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 25]: I have seen but little true chivalric feeling , and much of interested motives , in those who have joined the king 's forces .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 31]: The army collected was composed of most discordant elements , and were so discontented , so full of jealousy and ill-will , that I am not surprised at the result .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 47]: One thing is certain , that there must be a much better feeling existing between all parties , before such a man as Cromwell can ever be moved from his position ; and , for the present , the cause may be considered as lost . ''
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 33]: `` You are right , Edward , '' replied the Intendant ; `` I would they were better ; but , as they are , let us make the best of them .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 37]: You have now seen enough to have subdued that fiery zeal for the cause which previously occupied your whole thoughts ; now let us be prudent , and try if we can not be happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 22]: It was only to Oswald that Edward made known what had occurred ; he knew that he was to be trusted .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 42]: The next day Edward resumed his forester 's dress , while another one was preparing for him , and went over to the cottage ; where , with the consent of the Intendant , he proposed remaining for a few days .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 47]: Of course Edward had not failed to acquaint the Intendant with his proposed plans relative to Chaloner and Grenville , and received his consent ; at the same time advising that they should gain the other side of the Channel as soon as they possibly could .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 10]: Edward found them all very anxious for his arrival .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 52]: Humphrey and Pablo had been to the cottage , which they had found undisturbed since the capture of the robbers , and made everything ready for the reception of the two Cavaliers , as on their first journey they took with them a cart-load of what they knew would be necessary .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 20]: Chaloner and Grenville appeared to be quite at home already , and not very willing to shift their quarters .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 43]: They , of course , still retained their troopers ' clothes , as they had no other to wear until they could be procured from Lymington ; but , as we have before mentioned , they were in no want of money .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 56]: They , had been amusing the girls and Humphrey with a description of what had occurred during the campaign , and Edward found that he had but little to tell them , as Chaloner had commenced his narrative with an account of his first meeting with Edward when he had been attacked by the highwaymen .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 20]: As soon as he could get away , Edward went out with Humphrey to have some conversation with him .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 28]: `` Now , Humphrey , as you have pretty well heard all my adventures since our separation , let me hear what you have been doing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 26]: `` I have no such tales of stirring interest to narrate as Chaloner has been doing as your deputy , Edward , '' replied Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 35]: `` All I can say is , that we have had no visitors -- that we have longed for your return -- and that we have not been idle since you quitted us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 28]: `` What horses were those in the stable , '' said Edward , `` that you turned out to make room for ours when we arrived ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 19]: Humphrey laughed , and then informed Edward of the manner in which they had succeeded in capturing them .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 23]: `` Well , you really deserve credit , Humphrey , and certainly were not born to be secluded in this forest . ''
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 44]: `` I rather think that I have found that I was born for it , '' replied Humphrey , `` although , I must confess , that since you have quitted us I have not felt so contented here as I did before .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 35]: You have returned , and you have no idea what an alteration I see in you since you have mixed with the world , and have been a party in such stirring scenes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 76]: `` Perhaps so , Humphrey , '' replied Edward ; `` and yet do you know that , although I so ardently wished to mix with the world , and to follow the wars , I am anything but satisfied with what I have seen of it ; and so far from feeling any inclination to return to it I rather feel more inclined to remain here , and remain in quiet and in peace .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 10]: I have been disappointed , that is the truth .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 42]: There is a great difference between the world such as we fancy it when we are pining for it , and the world when we actually are placed within the vortex , and perceive the secret springs of men 's actions .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 24]: I have gained a lesson , but not a satisfactory one , Humphrey ; it may be told in a very few words .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 9]: It is a most deceitful and hollow world !
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 11]: And that is all there is to be said . ''
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 18]: `` What very agreeable , pleasant young men are Masters Chaloner and Grenville , '' observed Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 52]: `` Chaloner I know well , '' replied Edward ; `` he is to be trusted , and he is the only one in whom I have been able to place confidence , and therefore I was most fortunate in falling in with him as I did on my first starting .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 62]: Grenville I know little about ; we met often , it is true , but it was in the presence of the king , being both of us on his staff ; at the same time , I must acknowledge that I know nothing against him ; and this I do know , which is , that he is brave . ''
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 39]: Edward then narrated what had passed between the Intendant and himself since his return ; and how well satisfied the Intendant had been with his _ ruse _ in returning to him in the dress of a trooper .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 28]: `` Talking about that , Edward , do you not think it likely that we shall have the troopers down here in search of the king ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 14]: `` I wonder you have not had them already , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 11]: `` And what shall we do if they arrive ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 25]: `` That is all prepared for , '' replied Edward ; `` although , till you mentioned it , I had quite forgotten it .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 77]: The Intendant was talking with me on the subject last night , and here is an appointment for you as verderer , signed by him , which you are to use as you may find necessary ; and here is another missive , ordering you to receive into your house two of the troopers who may be sent down here , and find them quarters and victuals , but not to be compelled to receive more .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 92]: Until the search is over , Chaloner and Grenville must retain their accoutrements and remain with us : And , Humphrey , if you have not made any use of the clothes which I left here -- I mean the first dress I had made when I was appointed secretary , and which I thought rather too faded to wear any longer -- I will put it on now , as , should any military come here as scouters to the Intendant , I shall have some authority over them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 14]: `` It is in your chest , where you left it , Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 30]: The girls did propose to make two josephs out of it for winter wear ; but they never have thought of it since , or have not had time .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 22]: By the bye , you have not told me what you think of Alice and Edith after your long absence . ''
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 55]: `` I think they are both very much grown and very much improved , '' replied Edward , `` but I must confess to you that I think it is high time that they were , if possible , removed from their present homely occupations , and instructed as young ladies should be . ''
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 12]: `` But how , Edward , is that to be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 39]: `` That I can not yet tell , and it grieves me that I can not ; but still I see the necessity of it , if ever we are to return to our position in society . ''
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 9]: `` And are we ever to return ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 56]: I thought little of it before I went away and mixed in society ; but since I have been in the world I have been compelled to feel that my dear sisters are not in their sphere , and I have resolved upon trying if I can not find a more suitable position for them .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 21]: Had we been successful I should have had no difficulty : but now I hardly know what to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 16]: `` I have not inquired about Mrs Patience , brother ; how is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 25]: `` She is as good and as handsome as ever , and very much grown ; indeed , she is becoming quite womanly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 5]: `` And Clara ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 24]: `` Oh , I do not perceive any difference in her : I think she is grown , but I hardly observed her .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 22]: Here comes Chaloner ; we will tell him of our arrangements in case we are disturbed by the military parties . ''
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 37]: `` It is a most excellent arrangement , '' said Chaloner , when Edward had made the communication ; `` and it was a lucky day when I first fell in with you , Beverley . ''
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 24]: `` Not Beverley , I pray you ; that name is to be forgotten ; it was only revived for the occasion . ''
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 54]: `` Very true ; then , Master Secretary Armitage , I think the arrangement excellent : the only point will be to find out what troops are sent down in this direction , as we must of course belong to some other regiment , and have been pursued from the field of battle .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 14]: I should think that Lambert 's squadrons will not be this way . ''
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 32]: `` We will soon ascertain that ; let your horses be saddled and accoutred , so that should any of them make their appearance the horses may be at the door .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 14]: It is my opinion that they will be here some time to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 19]: `` I fear that it will be almost impossible for the king to escape , '' observed Chaloner .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 16]: `` I hardly know what to think of his leaving us in that way . ''
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 47]: `` I have reflected upon it , '' replied Edward , `` and I think it was perhaps prudent : some were to be trusted , and some not ; it was impossible to know who were and who were not -- he therefore trusted nobody .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 19]: Besides , his chance of escape , if quite alone , is greater than if in company . ''
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 28]: `` And yet I feel a little mortified that he did not trust me , '' continued Edward ; `` my life was at his service . ''
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 47]: `` He could no more read your heart than he could mine or others , '' observed Chaloner ; `` and any selection would have been invidious : on the whole , I think he acted wisely , and I trust that it will prove so .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 31]: One thing is certain , which is , that all is over now , and that for a long while -- we may let our swords rest in their scabbards .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 38]: Indeed , I am sickened with it , after what I have seen , and would gladly live here with you , and help to till the land -- away from the world and all its vexations .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 23]: What say you , Edward ; will you and your brother take me as a labourer after all is quiet again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 23]: `` You would soon tire of it , Chaloner ; you were made for active exertion and bustling in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 26]: `` Nevertheless , I think , under two such amiable and pretty mistresses , I could stay well contented here : it is almost Arcadian .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 24]: But still it is selfish for me to talk in this way ; indeed , my feelings are contrary to my words . ''
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 9]: `` How do you mean , Chaloner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 82]: `` To be candid with you , Edward , I was thinking what a pity it is that two such sweet girls as your sisters should be employed here in domestic drudgery , and remain in such an uncultivated state -- if I may be pardoned for speaking so freely -- but I do so because I am convinced that , if in proper hands , they would grace a court ; and you must feel that I am right . ''
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 17]: `` Do you not think that the same feelings have passed in my mind , Chaloner ?
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 19]: Indeed , Humphrey will tell you that we were speaking on the same subject but an hour ago .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 70]: You must , however , be aware of the difficulty I am in : were I in possession of Arnwood and its domain , then indeed -- but that is all over now , and I presume I shall shortly see my own property , whose woods are now in sight of me , made over to some Roundhead , for good services against the Cavaliers at Worcester . ''
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 64]: `` Edward , '' replied Chaloner , `` I have this to say to you , and I can say it because you know that I am indebted to you for my life , and that is a debt that nothing can cancel : If at any time you determine upon removing your sisters from this , recollect my maiden aunts at Portlake .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 39]: They can not be in better hands , and they can not be in the hands of any person who will more religiously do their duty towards them , and be pleased with the trust confided to them .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 53]: They are rich , in spite of exactions ; but in these times women are not fined and plundered as men are , and they have been well able to afford all that has been taken from them , and all that they have voluntarily given to the assistance of our party .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 33]: They are alone , and I really believe that nothing would make them more happy than to have the care of the two sisters of Edward Beverley -- be sure of that .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 28]: But I will be more sure of it , if you will find means of sending to them a letter , which I shall write to them .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 44]: I tell you that you will do them a favour , and that if you do not accept the offer , you will sacrifice your sisters ' welfare to your own pride , -- which I do not think you would do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 43]: `` Most certainly I will not do that , '' replied Edward ; `` and I am fully sensible of your kind offer ; but I can say no more until I hear what your good aunts may reply to your letter .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 39]: You mistake me much , Chaloner , if you think that any sense of obligation would prevent me from seeing my sisters removed from a position so unworthy of them , but which circumstances have driven them to .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 23]: That we are paupers is undeniable ; but I never shall forget that my sisters are the daughters of Colonel Beverley . ''
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 20]: `` I am delighted with your reply , Edward , and I fear not that of my good aunts .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 34]: It will be a great happiness to me when I am wandering abroad to know that your sisters are under their roof , and are being educated as they ought to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 9]: `` What 's the matter , Pablo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 14]: said Humphrey to the former , who came running , out of breath .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 21]: `` Soldiers , '' said Pablo ; `` plenty of them , gallop this way -- gallop every way . ''
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 28]: `` Now , Chaloner , we must get ourselves out of this scrape ; and I trust that afterwards all will be well , '' said Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 38]: `` Bring the horses out to the door ; and , Chaloner , you and Grenville must wait within : bring my horse out also , as it will appear as if I had just ridden over .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 8]: I must in to change my dress .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 14]: Humphrey , keep a look-out and let us know when they come . ''
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 15]: Chaloner and Edward went in , and Edward put on his dress of secretary .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 13]: Shortly afterwards a party of cavalry were seen galloping towards the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 11]: They soon arrived there , and pulled up their horses .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 19]: An officer who headed them addressed Humphrey in a haughty tone , and asked him who he was .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 18]: `` I am one of the verderers of the forest , sir , '' replied Humphrey respectfully .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 7]: `` And whose cottage is that ?
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 7]: And who have you there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 66]: `` The cottage is mine , sir ; two of the horses at the door belong to two troopers who have come in quest of those who fled from Worcester ; the other horse belongs to the secretary of the Intendant of the forest , Mr Heatherstone , who has come over with directions from the Intendant as to the capture of the rebels . ''
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 11]: At this moment Edward came out and saluted the officer .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 18]: `` This is the secretary , sir , Master Armitage , '' said Humphrey , falling back .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 30]: Edward saluted the officer , and said -- `` Mr Heatherstone , the Intendant , has sent me over here to make arrangements for the capture of the rebels .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 87]: This man is ordered to lodge two troopers as long as they are considered necessary to remain ; and I have directions to tell any officer whom I may meet that Mr Heatherstone and his verderers will take good care that none of the rebels are harboured in this direction ; and that it will be better that the troops scour the southern edge of the forest , as it is certain that the fugitives will try all that they can to embark for France . ''
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 14]: `` What regiment do the troopers belong to that you have here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 20]: `` I believe to Lambert 's troop , sir ; but they shall come out and answer for themselves .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 13]: Tell those men to come out , '' said Edward to Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 26]: `` Yes , sir ; but they are hard to wake , for they have ridden from Worcester ; but I will rouse them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 13]: `` Nay , I can not wait , '' replied the officer .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 18]: `` I know none of Lambert 's troops , and they have no information to give . ''
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 36]: `` Could you not take them with you , sir , and leave two of your men instead of them ; for they are troublesome people to a poor man , and devour everything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 4]: said Humphrey submissively .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 31]: `` No , no , '' replied the officer , laughing , `` we all know Lambert 's people -- a friend or enemy is much the same to them .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 16]: I have no power over them , and you must make the best of it .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 3]: -- Forward !
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 27]: Men , '' continued the officer , saluting Edward as he passed on : and in a minute or two they were far in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 10]: `` That 's well over , '' observed Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 25]: `` Chaloner and Grenville are too young-looking and too good-looking for Lambert 's villains ; and a sight of them might have occasioned suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 9]: We must , however , expect more visits .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 8]: Keep a good look-out , Pablo . ''
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 28]: Edward and Humphrey then went in and joined the party inside the cottage , who were in a state of no little suspense during the colloquy outside .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 21]: `` Why , Alice , dearest , you look quite pale , '' said Edward , as he came in .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 9]: `` I feared for our guests , Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 27]: I 'm sure that if they had come into the cottage , Master Chaloner and Master Grenville would never have been believed to be troopers . ''
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 39]: `` We thank you for the compliment , Mistress Alice , '' said Chaloner ; `` but I think , if necessary , I could ruffle and swear with the best , or rather the worst of them .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 12]: We passed for troopers very well on the road here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 13]: `` Yes , but you did not meet any other troopers . ''
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 11]: `` That 's very true , and shows your penetration .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 48]: I acknowledge that with troopers there would have been more difficulty ; but still , among so many thousands there must be many varieties , and it would be an awkward thing for an officer of one troop to arrest upon suspicion the men belonging to another .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 22]: I think , when we are visited again , I shall sham intoxication -- that will not be very suspicious . ''
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 12]: `` No , not on either side , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 18]: `` Come , Alice , we will eat what dinner you may have ready for us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 43]: For three or four days the Parliamentary forces continued to scour the forest , and another visit or two was paid to the cottage , but without suspicion being created , in consequence of the presence of Edward , and his explanations .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 9]: The parties were invariably sent in another direction .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 118]: Edward wrote to the Intendant , informing him what had occurred , and requesting permission to remain a few days longer at the cottage ; and Pablo , who took the letter , returned with one from the Intendant , acquainting him that the king had not yet been taken ; and requesting the utmost vigilance on his part to ensure his capture , with directions to search various places , in company with the troopers who had been stationed at the cottage ; or if he did not like to leave the cottage , to show the letter to any officer commanding parties in search , that they might act upon the suggestions contained in it .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 37]: This letter Edward had an opportunity of showing to one or two officers commanding parties , who approached the cottage , and to whom Edward went out to communicate with , thereby preventing their stopping there .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 39]: At last , in about a fortnight , there was not a party in the forest , all of them having gone down to the sea-side , to look-out for the fugitives , several of whom were taken .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 39]: Humphrey took the cart to Lymington , to procure clothes for Chaloner and Grenville , and it was decided that they should assume those of verderers of the forest , which would enable them to carry a gun .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 37]: As soon as Humphrey had obtained what was requisite , Chaloner and Grenville were conducted to Clara 's cottage , and took possession , -- of course never showing themselves outside the wood which surrounded it .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 21]: Humphrey lent them Holdfast as a watch dog , and they took leave of Alice and Edith with much regret .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 10]: Humphrey and Edward accompanied them to their new abode .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 24]: It was arranged that the horses should remain under the care of Humphrey , as they had no stable at Clara 's cottage .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 37]: On parting , Chaloner gave Edward the letter for his aunts ; and then Edward once more bent his steps towards the Intendant 's house , and found himself in the company of Patience and Clara .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 40]: Edward narrated to the Intendant all that had occurred , and the Intendant approved of what he had done ; strongly advising that Chaloner and Grenville should not attempt to go to the continent till all pursuit was over .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 26]: `` Here 's a letter I have received from the Government , Edward , highly commending my vigilance and activity in pursuit of the fugitives .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 21]: It appears that the officers you fell in with have written up to state what admirable dispositions we had made .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 23]: It is a pity , is it not , Edward , that we are compelled to be thus deceitful in this world ?
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 16]: Nothing but the times , and the wish to do good , could warrant it .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 35]: We meet the wicked , and fight them with their own weapons ; but although it is treating them as they deserve , our conscience must tell us that it is not right . ''
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 37]: `` Surely , sir , to save the lives of people who have committed no other fault except loyalty to their king , will warrant our so doing -- at least , I hope so . ''
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 23]: `` According to the Scriptures , I fear it will not ; but it is a difficult question for us to decide .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 24]: Let us be guided by our own consciences ; if they do not reproach us we can not be far from right . ''
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 23]: Edward then produced the letter he had received from Chaloner , requesting that the Intendant would have the kindness to forward it .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 17]: `` I see , '' replied the Intendant ; `` I can forward these through Langton .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 10]: I presume it is to obtain credit for money .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 7]: It shall go on Thursday . ''
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 14]: The conference was then broken up , and Edward went to see Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 43]: For several days Edward remained at home , anxiously awaiting every news which arrived ; expecting every time that the capture of the king would be announced , and , with great joy , finding that hitherto all efforts had been unsuccessful .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 22]: But there was a question which now arose in Edward 's mind , and which was the cause of deep reflection .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 31]: Since the proposal of sending his sisters away had been started , he felt the great inconvenience of his still representing himself to the Intendant as the grandson of Armitage .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 83]: His sisters , if sent to the ladies at Portlake , must be sent without the knowledge of the Intendant ; and if so , the discovery of their absence would soon take place , as Patience Heatherstone would be constantly going over to the cottage ; and he now asked himself the question whether , after all the kindness and confidence which the Intendant had shown him , he was right in any longer concealing from him his birth and parentage .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 21]: He felt that he was doing the Intendant an injustice in not showing to him that confidence which he deserved .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 53]: That he was justified in so doing at first , he felt ; but since the joining the king 's army , and the events which had followed , he considered that he was treating the Intendant ill , and he now resolved to take the first opportunity of making the confession .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 18]: But to do it formally , and without some opportunity which might offer , he felt awkward .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 21]: At last he thought that he would at once make the confession to Patience , under the promise of secrecy .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 27]: That he might do at once ; and , after he had done so , the Intendant could not tax him with want of confidence altogether .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 20]: He had now analysed his feelings towards Patience ; and he felt how dear she had become to him .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 57]: During the time he was with the army she had seldom been out of his thoughts ; and although he was often in the society of well-bred women , he saw not one that , in his opinion , could compare with Patience Heatherstone ; but still , what chance had he of supporting a wife ?
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 13]: At present , at the age of nineteen , it was preposterous .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 156]: Thoughts like these ran in his mind , chasing each other , and followed by others as vague and unsatisfactory ; and , in the end , Edward came to the conclusion that he was without a penny , and that being known as the heir of Beverley would be to his disadvantage ; that he was in love with Patience Heatherstone , and had no chance at present of obtaining her ; and that he had done well up to the present time in concealing who he was from the Intendant , who could safely attest that he knew not that he was protecting the son of so noted a Cavalier ; and that he would confess to Patience who he was , and give as a reason for not telling her father , that he did not wish to commit him by letting him know who it was that was under his protection .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 48]: How far the reader may be satisfied with the arguments which Edward was satisfied with , we can not pretend to say ; but Edward was young , and hardly knew how to extricate himself from the cloak which necessity had first compelled him to put on .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 68]: Edward was already satisfied that he was not quite looked upon with indifference by Patience Heatherstone ; and he was not yet certain whether it was not a grateful feeling that she had towards him more than any other ; that she believed him to be beneath her in birth , he felt convinced , and therefore she could have no idea that he was Edward Beverley .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 32]: It was not till several days after he had made up his mind that he had an opportunity of being with her alone , as Clara Ratcliffe was their constant companion .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 45]: However , one evening Clara went out , and stayed out so long , carelessly wrapped up , that she caught cold ; and the following evening she remained at home , leaving Edward and Patience to take their usual walk unaccompanied by her .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 45]: They had walked for some minutes in silence , when Patience observed -- `` You are very grave , Edward , and have been very grave ever since your return ; have you anything to vex you beyond the failure of the attempt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 8]: `` Yes , I have , Patience .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 15]: I have much on my conscience , and do not know how to act .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 17]: I want an adviser and a friend , and know not where to find one . ''
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 19]: `` Surely , Edward , my father is your sincere friend , and not a bad adviser . ''
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 27]: `` I grant it ; but the question is between your father and me , and I can not advise with him for that reason . ''
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 50]: `` Then advise with me , Edward , if it is not a secret of such moment that it is not to be trusted to a woman : at all events it will be the advice of a sincere friend ; you will give me credit for that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 24]: `` Yes , and for much more ; for I think I shall have good advice , and will therefore accept your offer .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 115]: I feel , Patience , that although I was justified , on my first acquaintance with your father , in not making known to him a secret of some importance , yet now that he has put such implicit confidence in me , I am doing him and myself an injustice in not making the communication -- that is , as far as confidence in him is concerned , I consider that he has a right to know all , and yet I feel that it would be prudent on my part that he should not know all , as the knowledge might implicate him with those with whom he is at present allied .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 35]: A secret sometimes is dangerous ; and if your father could not say that on his honour he knew not of the secret , it might harm him if the secret became afterwards known .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 6]: Do you understand me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 35]: `` I can not say that I exactly do ; you have a secret that you wish to make known to my father , and you think the knowledge of it may harm him .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 13]: I can not imagine what kind of secret that may be . ''
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 12]: `` Well , I can give you a case in point .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 83]: Suppose now that I knew that King Charles was hidden in your stable-loft : such might be the case , and your father be ignorant of it , and his assertion of his ignorance would be believed ; but if I were to tell your father that the king was there , and it was afterwards discovered , do you not see that by confiding such a secret to him I should do harm , and perhaps bring him into trouble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 21]: `` I perceive now , Edward ; do you mean to say that you know where the king is concealed ?
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 20]: For if you do , I must beg of you not to let my father know anything about it .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 20]: As you say , it would put him in a difficult position , and must eventually harm him much .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 17]: There is a great difference between wishing well to a cause and supporting it in person .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 53]: My father wishes the king well , I believe , but , at the same time , he will not take an active part , as you have already seen ; at the same time , I am convinced that he would never betray the king if he knew where he was .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 31]: I say , therefore , if that is your secret , keep it from him , for his sake and for mine , Edward , if you regard me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 12]: `` You know not how much I regard you , Patience .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 37]: I saw many high-born women when I was away , but none could I see equal to Patience Heatherstone , in my opinion ; and Patience was ever in my thoughts during my long absence . ''
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 29]: `` I thank you for your kind feelings towards me , '' replied Patience ; `` but , Master Armitage , we were talking about your secret . ''
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 5]: `` Master Armitage ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 39]: rejoined Edward ; `` how well you know how to remind me , by that expression , of my obscure birth and parentage , whenever I am apt to forget the distance which I ought to observe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 6]: `` You are wrong ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 27]: replied Patience ; `` but you flattered me so grossly that I called you Master Armitage to show that I disliked flattery ; that was all .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 39]: I dislike flattery from those who are above me in rank , as well as those who are below me ; and I should have done the same to any other person , whatever his condition might be .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 30]: But forget what I said ; I did not mean to vex you , only to punish you for thinking me so silly as to believe such nonsense . ''
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 29]: `` Your humility may construe that into flattery which was said by me in perfect sincerity and truth -- that I can not help , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 47]: `` I might have added much more , and yet have been sincere ; if you had not reminded me of my not being of gentle birth I might have had the presumption to have told you much more ; but I have been rebuked . ''
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 21]: Edward finished speaking , and Patience made no reply : they walked on for several moments without exchanging another syllable .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 39]: At last Patience said -- `` I will not say who is wrong , Edward ; but this I do know , that the one who first offers the olive-branch after a misunderstanding can not but be right .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 18]: I offer it now , and ask you whether we are to quarrel about one little word .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 35]: Let me ask you , and give me a candid answer : Have I ever been so base as to treat as an inferior one to whom I have been so much obliged ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 15]: `` It is I who am in fault , Patience , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 29]: `` I have been dreaming for a long while , pleased with my dreams ; and forgetting that they were dreams , and not likely to be realised .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 6]: I must now speak plainly .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 32]: I love you , Patience ; love you so much that to part from you would be misery -- to know that my love was rejected , as bitter as death .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 13]: That is the truth , and I can conceal it no longer .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 12]: Now I admit you have a right to be angry . ''
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 14]: `` I see no cause for anger , Edward , '' replied Patience .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 24]: `` I have not thought of you but as a friend and benefactor ; it would have been wrong to have done otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 15]: I am but a young person , and must be guided by my father .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 8]: I would not offend him by disobedience .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 23]: I thank you for your good opinion of me , and yet I wish you had not said what you have . ''
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 28]: `` Am I to understand from your reply , that if your father raised no objection , my lowly birth would be none in your opinion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 19]: `` Your birth has never come into my head , except when reminded of it by yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 20]: `` Then , Patience , let me return for the present to what I had to confide to you .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 16]: I was -- '' `` Here comes my father , Edward , '' said Patience .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 16]: `` Surely I have done wrong , for I feel afraid to meet him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 30]: Mr Heatherstone now joined them , and said to Edward -- `` I have been looking for you ; I have news from London which has rejoiced me much .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 53]: I have at last obtained what I have some time been trying for ; and , indeed , I may say that your prudence and boldness in returning home as a trooper , added to your conduct in the forest , has greatly advanced , and ultimately obtained for me my suit .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 24]: There was some suspense before that ; but your conduct has removed it ; and now we shall have plenty to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 47]: They walked to the house , and the Intendant , as soon as he had gained his own room , said to Edward -- `` There is a grant to me of a property which I have long solicited for my services -- read it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 40]: Edward took up the letter , in which the Parliament informed Mr Heatherstone that his application for the property of Arnwood had been acceded to , and signed by the Commissioners ; and that he might take immediate possession .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 13]: Edward turned pale as he laid the document down on the table .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 13]: `` We will ride to-morrow , Edward , and look it over .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 8]: I intend to rebuild the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 5]: Edward made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 7]: `` Are you not well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 7]: said the Intendant , with surprise .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 28]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied Edward , `` I am well , I believe , but I will confess to you that I am disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 22]: I did not think that you would have accepted a property from such a source , and so unjustly sequestrated . ''
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 57]: `` I am sorry , Edward , '' replied the Intendant , `` that I should have fallen in your good opinion ; but allow me to observe that you are so far right , that I never would have accepted a property to which there were living claimants ; but this is a different case .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 14]: For instance , the Ratcliffe property belongs to little Clara and is sequestrated .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 8]: Do you think I would accept it ?
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 2]: Never !
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 19]: But here is a property without an heir ; the whole family perished in the flames of Arnwood !
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 6]: There is no living claimant !
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 13]: It must be given to somebody , or remain with the Government .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 34]: This property , therefore , and this property only , out of all sequestrated , I selected ; as I felt that , in obtaining it , I did harm to no one .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 11]: I have been offered others , but have refused them .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 26]: I would accept of this , and this only ; and that is the reason why my applications have hitherto been attended with no success .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 14]: I trust you believe me , Edward , in what I assert ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 10]: `` First answer me one question , Mr Heatherstone .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 25]: Suppose it were proved that the whole of the family did not , as it is supposed , perish at the conflagration of Arnwood ?
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 22]: Suppose a rightful heir to it should at any time appear , would you then resign the property to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 13]: `` As I hope for heaven , Edward , I would ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 13]: replied the Intendant , solemnly raising his eyes upwards as he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 41]: `` I then should think that I had been an instrument to keep the property out of other hands less scrupulous , and should surrender it as a trust which had been confided to me for the time only . ''
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 26]: `` With such feelings , Mr Heatherstone , I can now congratulate you upon your having obtained possession of the property , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 27]: `` And yet I do not deserve so much credit , as there is little chance of my sincerity being put to the test , Edward .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 21]: There is no doubt that the family all perished ; and Arnwood will become the dower of Patience Heatherstone . ''
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 6]: Edward 's heart beat quick .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 9]: A moment 's thought told him his situation .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 52]: He had been prevented , by the interruption of Mr Heatherstone , from making his confession to Patience ; and now he could not make it to anybody without a rupture with the Intendant , or a compromise , by asking what he so earnestly desired -- the hand of Patience .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 29]: Mr Heatherstone observing to Edward that he did not look so well , said supper was ready ; and that they had better go into the next room .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 4]: Edward mechanically followed .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 21]: At supper he was tormented by the incessant inquiries of Clara , as to what was the matter with him .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 30]: He did not venture to look at Patience , and made a hasty retreat to bed ; complaining , as he well might do , of a severe headache .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 13]: Edward threw himself on his bed , but to sleep was impossible .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 13]: He thought of the events of the day over and over again .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 12]: Had he any reason to believe that Patience returned his affection ?
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 50]: No : her reply was too calm , too composed , to make him suppose that ; and now that she would be an heiress , there would be no want of pretenders to her hand ; and he would lose her and his property at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 62]: It was true that the Intendant had declared that he would renounce the property if the true heir appeared , but that was easy to say upon the conviction that no heir would appear ; and even if he did renounce it , the Parliament would receive it again , rather than it should fall into the hands of a Beverley .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 14]: `` Oh that I had never left the cottage , '' thought Edward .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 15]: `` I might then at least have become resigned and contented with my lot .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 20]: Now I am miserable , and , whichever way I turn , I see no prospect of being otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 26]: One thing only I can decide upon , which is , that I will not remain any longer than I can help under this roof .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 30]: I will go over and consult with Humphrey ; and if I can only place my sisters as I want , Humphrey and I will seek our fortunes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 17]: Edward rose at daylight , and , dressing himself , went down and saddled his horse .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 39]: Desiring Sampson to tell the Intendant that he had gone over to the cottage , and would return by the evening , he rode across the forest , and arrived just as they were sitting down to breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 26]: His attempts to be cheerful before his sisters did not succeed , and they were all grieved to see him look so pale and haggard .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 18]: As soon as breakfast was over Edward made a sign , and he and Humphrey went out .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 11]: `` What is the matter , my dear brother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 3]: said Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 7]: `` I will tell you all .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 36]: Listen to me , '' replied Edward , who then gave him the detail of all that had passed , from the time he had walked out with Patience Heatherstone till he went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 15]: `` Now , Humphrey , you know all ; and what shall I do ?
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 7]: Remain there I can not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 23]: `` If Patience Heatherstone had professed regard for you , '' replied Humphrey , `` the affair would have been simple enough .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 37]: Her father could have no objections to the match ; and he would at the same time have acquitted his conscience as to the retaining of the property : but you say she showed none . ''
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 19]: `` She told me very calmly that she was sorry that I had said what I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 13]: `` But do women always mean what they say , brother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 3]: said Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 18]: `` She does , at all events , '' replied Edward ; `` she is truth itself .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 8]: No , I can not deceive myself .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 31]: She feels a deep debt of gratitude for the service I rendered her ; and that prevented her from being more harsh in her reply than what she was . ''
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 24]: `` But if she knew that you were Edward Beverley , do you not think it would make a difference in her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 25]: `` And if it did , it would be too humiliating to think that I was only married for my rank and station . ''
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 27]: `` But , considering you of mean birth , may she not have checked those feelings which she considered under the circumstances improper to indulge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 16]: `` Where there is such a sense of propriety there can be little affection . ''
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 48]: `` I know nothing about these things , Edward , '' replied Humphrey ; `` but I have been told that a woman 's heart is not easily read ; or if I have not been told it , I have read it or dreamt it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 9]: `` What do you propose to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 21]: `` What I fear you will not approve of , Humphrey ; it is to break up our establishment altogether .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 25]: If the answer is favourable from the Misses Conynghame , my sisters shall go to them ; but that we had agreed upon already .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 22]: Then for myself -- I intend to go abroad , resume my name , and obtain employment in some foreign service .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 13]: I will trust to the king for assisting me to that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 28]: `` That is the worst part of it , Edward ; but if your peace of mind depends upon it , I will not oppose it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 23]: `` You , Humphrey , may come with me and share my fortunes , or do what you think more preferable . ''
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 14]: `` I think then , Edward , that I shall not decide rashly .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 60]: I must have remained here with Pablo , if my sisters had gone to the Ladies Conynghame and you had remained with the Intendant ; I shall , therefore , till I hear from you , remain where I am , and I shall be able to observe what is going on here , and let you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 28]: `` Be it so , '' replied Edward ; `` let me only see my sisters well placed , and I shall be off the next day .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 9]: It is misery to remain there now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 15]: After some more conversation Edward mounted his horse and returned to the Intendant 's .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 14]: He did not arrive till late , for supper was on the table .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 38]: The Intendant gave him a letter for Master Chaloner , which was enclosed in one from Mr Langton ; -- and further informed Edward that news had arrived of the king having made his escape to France .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 7]: `` Thank God for that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 3]: exclaimed Edward .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 32]: `` With your leave , sir , I will to-morrow deliver this letter to the party to whom it is addressed , as I know it to be of consequence . ''
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 26]: The Intendant having given his consent , Edward retired without having exchanged a word with Patience or Clara beyond the usual civilities of the table .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 31]: The following morning Edward , who had not slept an hour during the night , set off for Clara 's cottage , and found Chaloner and Grenville still in bed .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 29]: At the sound of his voice the door was opened , and he gave Chaloner the letter ; the latter read it and then handed it to Edward .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 49]: The Misses Conynghame were delighted at the idea of receiving the two daughters of Colonel Beverley , and would treat them as their own ; they requested that they might be sent to London immediately , where the coach would meet them to convey them down to Lancashire .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 23]: They begged to be kindly remembered to Captain Beverley , and to assure him that his sisters should be well cared for .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 29]: `` I am much indebted to you , Chaloner , '' said Edward ; `` I will send my brother off with my sisters as soon as possible .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 22]: You will soon think of returning to France ; and if you will permit me , I will accompany you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 5]: `` You , Edward !
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 18]: That will be delightful ; but you had no idea of the kind when last we met .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 10]: What has induced you to alter your mind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 22]: `` I will tell you by and by ; I do not think I shall be here again for some days .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 67]: I must be a great deal at the cottage when Humphrey is away ; for Pablo will have a great charge upon him -- what with the dairy , and horses , and breed of goats , and other things -- more than he can attend to ; but as soon as Humphrey returns , I will come to you and make preparations for our departure .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 8]: Till then farewell , both of you .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 17]: We must see to provision you for three weeks or a month before Humphrey starts . ''
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 14]: Edward bade them a hearty farewell , and then rode to the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 29]: Although Alice and Edith had been somewhat prepared for leaving the cottage , yet the time was so very uncertain , that the blow fell heavy upon them .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 65]: They were to leave their brothers , whom they loved so dearly , to go to strangers ; and when they understood that they were to leave in two days , and that they should not see Edward again , their grief was very great ; but Edward reasoned with Alice and consoled her , although with Edith it was a more difficult task .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 47]: She not only lamented her brothers , but her cow , her pony , and her kids ; all the dumb animals were friends and favourites of Edith ; and even the idea of parting with Pablo was the cause of a fresh burst of tears .
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 27]: Having made every arrangement with Humphrey , Edward once more took his leave , promising to come over and assist Pablo as soon as he could .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 10]: The next day Humphrey was busied in his preparations .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 34]: They supplied the provisions to Clara 's cottage ; and when Pablo took them over in the cart , Humphrey rode to Lymington and provided a conveyance to London for the following day .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 23]: We may as well observe that they set off at the hour appointed , and arrived safely at London in three days .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 58]: There , at an address given in the letter , they found the coach waiting ; and having given his sisters into the charge of an elderly waiting-woman , who had come up in the coach to take charge of them , they quitted him with many tears , and Humphrey hastened back to the New Forest .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 46]: On his return he found , to his surprise , that Edward had not called at the cottage as he had promised ; and , with a mind foreboding evil , he mounted a horse and set off across the forest to ascertain the cause .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 45]: As he was close to the Intendant 's house he was met by Oswald , who informed him that Edward had been seized with a violent fever , and was in a very dangerous state , having been delirious for three or four days .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 33]: Humphrey hastened to dismount , and knocked at the door of the house ; it was opened by Sampson , and Humphrey requested to be shown up to his brother 's room .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 27]: He found Edward in the state described by Oswald , and wholly unconscious of his presence ; the maid , Phoebe , was by his bedside .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 19]: `` You may leave , '' said Humphrey , rather abruptly ; `` I am his brother . ''
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 11]: Phoebe retired , and Humphrey was alone with his brother .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 36]: `` It was , indeed , an unhappy day when you came to this house , '' exclaimed Humphrey , as the tears rolled down his cheeks ; `` my poor , poor Edward . ''
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 53]: Edward now began to talk incoherently , and attempted to rise from the bed , but his efforts were unavailing -- he was too weak ; but he raved of Patience Heatherstone , and he called himself Edward Beverley more than once , and he talked of his father and of Arnwood .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 23]: `` If he has raved in this manner , '' thought Humphrey , `` he has not many secrets left to disclose .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 16]: I will not leave him , and will keep others away if I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 19]: Humphrey had been sitting an hour with his brother , when the surgeon came to see his patient .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 14]: He felt his pulse , and asked Humphrey if he was nursing him .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 12]: `` I am his brother , sir , '' replied Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 36]: `` Then , my good sir , if you perceive any signs of perspiration -- and I think now that there is a little -- keep the clothes on him and let him perspire freely .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 10]: If so , his life will be saved . ''
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 15]: The surgeon withdrew , saying that he would return again late in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 45]: Humphrey remained for another two hours at the bedside , and then feeling that there was a sign of perspiration , he obeyed the injunctions of the surgeon , and held on the clothes , against all Edward 's endeavours to throw them off .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 20]: For a short time the perspiration was profuse , and the restlessness of Edward subsided into a deep slumber .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 4]: `` Thank Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 6]: There are then hopes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 9]: `` Did you say there were hopes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 6]: repeated a voice behind him .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 20]: Humphrey turned , and perceived Patience and Clara behind him , who had come in without his observing it .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 47]: `` Yes , '' replied Humphrey , looking reproachfully at Patience , `` there are hopes , by what the surgeon said to me -- hopes that he may yet be able to quit this house , which he was so unfortunate as to enter . ''
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 38]: This was a harsh and rude speech of Humphrey 's ; but he considered that Patience Heatherstone had been the cause of his brother 's dangerous state , and that she had not behaved well to him .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 32]: Patience made no reply , but falling down on her knees by the bedside , prayed silently ; and Humphrey 's heart smote him for what he had said to her .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 24]: `` She can not be so bad , '' thought Humphrey , as Patience and Clara quitted the room without the least noise .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 30]: Shortly afterwards the Intendant came up into the room , and offered his hand to Humphrey , who pretended not to see it , and did not take it .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 28]: `` He has got Arnwood ; that is enough for him , '' thought Humphrey ; `` but my hand in friendship he shall not receive . ''
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 30]: The Intendant put his hand within the clothes , and feeling the high perspiration in which Edward was in , said -- `` I thank thee , O God !
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 18]: For all Thy mercies , and that Thou hast been pleased to spare this valuable life . ''
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 10]: `` How are your sisters , Master Humphrey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 11]: said the Intendant ; `` my daughter bade me inquire .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 34]: I will send over to them and let them know that your brother is better , if you do not leave this for the cottage yourself after the surgeon has called again . ''
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 31]: `` My sisters are no longer at the cottage , Mr Heatherstone , '' replied Humphrey ; `` they have gone to some friends who have taken charge of them .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 26]: I saw them safe to London myself , or I should have known of my brother 's illness and have been here before this . ''
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 15]: `` You indeed tell me news , Master Humphrey , '' replied the Intendant .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 22]: `` With whom , may I ask , are your sisters placed , and in what capacity are they gone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 90]: This reply of the Intendant 's reminded Humphrey that he had somewhat committed himself , as being supposed to be the daughters of a forester , it was not to be thought that they had gone up to be educated ; and he therefore replied -- `` They found it lonely in the forest , Mr Heatherstone , and wished to see London ; so we have taken them there , and put them into the care of those who have promised that they shall be well placed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 22]: The Intendant appeared to be much disturbed and surprised , but he said nothing , and soon afterwards quitted the room .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 37]: He almost immediately returned with the surgeon , who , as soon as he felt Edward 's pulse , declared that the crisis was over , and that when he awoke he would be quite sensible .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 49]: Having given directions as to the drink of his patient , and some medicine which he was to take , the surgeon then left , stating that he should not call until the next evening , unless he was sent for , as he considered all danger over .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 14]: Edward continued in a quiet slumber for the major portion of the night .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 12]: It was just break of day when he opened his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 36]: Humphrey offered him some drink , which Edward took greedily ; and seeing Humphrey , said -- `` Oh , Humphrey , I had quite forgotten where I was -- I 'm so sleepy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 17]: and with these words his head fell on the pillow , and he was again asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 33]: When it was broad daylight Oswald came into the room -- `` Master Humphrey , they say that all danger is over now , but that you have remained here all night .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 11]: I will relieve you now , if you let me .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 16]: Go and take a walk in the fresh air -- it will revive you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 10]: `` I will , Oswald , and many thanks .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 16]: My brother has woke up once , and , I thank God , quite sensible .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 18]: He will know you when he wakes again , and then do you send for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 29]: Humphrey left the room , and was glad , after a night of close confinement in a sick-room , to feel the cool morning air fanning his cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 17]: He had not been long out of the house before he perceived Clara coming towards him .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 8]: `` How d'ye do , Humphrey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 13]: said Clara ; `` and how is your brother this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 16]: `` He is better , Clara , and I hope now out of danger . ''
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 28]: `` But , Humphrey , '' continued Clara ; `` when we came into the room last night , what made you say what you did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 11]: `` I do not recollect that I said anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 35]: `` Yes , you did ; you said that there were now hopes that your brother would be able soon to quit this house , which he had been so unfortunate as to enter .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 5]: Do you recollect ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 23]: `` I may have said so , Clara , '' replied Humphrey ; `` it was only speaking my thoughts aloud . ''
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 10]: `` But why do you think so , Humphrey ?
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 10]: Why has Edward been unfortunate in entering this house ?
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 8]: That is what I want to know .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 14]: Patience cried so much after she left the room because you said that .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 6]: Why did you say so ?
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 11]: You did not think so a short time ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 35]: `` No , my dear Clara , I did not , but I do now , and I can not give you my reasons ; so you must say no more about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 25]: Clara was silent for a time , and then said -- `` Patience tells me that your sisters have gone away from the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 7]: You told her father so . ''
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 11]: `` It is very true , they have gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 7]: `` But why have they gone ?
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 6]: What have they gone for ?
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 12]: Who is to look after the cows and goats and poultry ?
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 9]: Who is to cook your dinner , Humphrey ?
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 37]: What can you do without them , and why did you send them away without letting me or Patience know that they were going , so that at least we might have bid them farewell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 52]: `` My dear Clara , '' replied Humphrey -- who , feeling no little difficulty in replying to all these questions , resolved to cut the matter short by appearing to be angry -- `` you know that you are the daughter of a gentleman , and so is Patience Heatherstone .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 32]: You are both of gentle birth ; but my sisters , you know , are only the daughters of a forester , and my brother Edward and I are no better .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 47]: It does not become Mistress Patience and you to be intimate with such as we are , especially now that Mistress Patience is a great heiress : for her father has obtained the large property of Arnwood , and it will be hers after his death .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 67]: It is not fit that the heiress of Arnwood should mix herself up with forester 's daughters ; and as we had friends near Lymington who offered to assist us , and take our sisters under their charge , we thought it better that they should go ; for what would become of them , if any accident was to happen to Edward or to me ?
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 7]: Now they will be provided for .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 26]: After they have been taught , they will make very nice tire-women to some lady of quality , '' added Humphrey , with a sneer .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 13]: `` Do n't you think they will , my pretty Clara ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 5]: Clara burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 12]: `` You are very unkind , Humphrey , '' sobbed she .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 11]: `` You had no right to send away your sisters .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 11]: I do n't believe you -- that 's more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 8]: and Clara ran away into the house .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY SIX .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 34]: Our readers may think that Humphrey was very unkind ; but it was to avoid being questioned by Clara , who was evidently sent for the purpose , that he was so harsh .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 49]: At the same time it must be admitted that Mr Heatherstone having obtained possession of Arnwood , rankled no doubt in the minds of both the brothers , and every act now , on the part of him or his family , was viewed in a false medium .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 39]: But our feelings are not always at our control , and Edward was naturally impetuous , and Humphrey so much attached , and so much alarmed at his brother 's danger , that he was even more excited .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 37]: The blow fell doubly heavy , as it appeared that at the very same time Patience had rejected his brother and taken possession of their property , which had been held by the family for centuries .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 30]: What made the case more annoying was , that explanation , if there was any to offer on either side , was , under present circumstances , almost impossible .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 13]: Soon after Clara left him Humphrey returned to his brother 's room .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 10]: He found him awake , and talking to Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 33]: Ardently pressing his brother 's hand , Edward said -- `` My dear Humphrey , I shall soon be well now , and able , I trust , to quit this house .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 32]: What I fear is , that some explanation will be asked for by the Intendant , not only relative to my sisters having left us , but also upon other points .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 12]: This is what I wish to avoid , without giving offence .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 53]: I do not think that the Intendant is so much to blame in having obtained my property , as he does not know that a Beverley existed , but I can not bear to have any further intimacy with him , especially after what has taken place between me and his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 59]: What I have to request is , that you will never quit this room while I am still here , unless you are relieved by Oswald ; so that the Intendant or anybody else may have no opportunity of having any private communication with me , or forcing me to listen to what they may have to say .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 12]: I made this known to Oswald before you came in . ''
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 19]: `` Depend upon it , it shall be so , Edward ; for I am of your opinion .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 28]: Clara came to me just now , and I had much trouble , and was compelled to be harsh , to get rid of her importunity . ''
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 22]: When the surgeon called , he pronounced Edward out of danger , and that his attendance would be no longer necessary .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 7]: Edward felt the truth of this .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 18]: All that he required was strength ; and that he trusted in a few days to obtain .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 17]: Oswald was sent over to the cottage to ascertain how Pablo was going on by himself .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 34]: He found that everything was correct , and that Pablo , although he felt proud of his responsibility , was very anxious for Humphrey 's return , as he found himself very lonely .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 39]: During Oswald 's absence on this day , Humphrey never quitted the room and although the Intendant came up several times he never could find an opportunity of speaking to Edward , which he evidently wished to do .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 25]: To inquiries made as to how he was , Edward always complained of great weakness , for a reason which will soon be understood .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 56]: Several days elapsed , and Edward had often been out of bed during the night , when not likely to be intruded upon , and he now felt himself strong enough to be removed ; and his object was to leave the Intendant 's house without his knowledge , so as to avoid any explanation .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 13]: One evening Pablo came over with the horses after it was dark .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 54]: Oswald put them into the stable ; and the morning proving fine and clear , a little before break of day Edward came softly downstairs with Humphrey , and , mounting the horses , set off for the cottage , without any one in the Intendant 's house being aware of their departure .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 26]: It must not be supposed , however , that Edward took this step without some degree of consideration as to the feelings of the Intendant .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 132]: On the contrary , he left a letter with Oswald , to be delivered after his departure , in which he thanked the Intendant sincerely for all the kindness and compassion he had shown towards him assured him of his gratitude and kind feelings towards him and his daughter , but said that circumstances had occurred of which no explanation could be given without great pain to all parties , which rendered it advisable that he should take such an apparently unkind step as to leave without bidding them farewell in person ; that he was about to embark immediately for the continent , to seek his fortune in the wars ; and that he wished all prosperity to the family , which would ever have his kindest wishes and remembrances .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 36]: `` Humphrey , '' said Edward , after they had ridden about two miles across the forest , and the sun had risen in an unclouded sky , `` I feel like an emancipated slave .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 3]: Thank God !
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 19]: My sickness has cured me of all my complaints , and all I want now is active employment .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 33]: And now , Humphrey , Chaloner and Grenville are not a little tired of being inured up in their cottage , and I am as anxious as they are to be off .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 5]: What will you do ?
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 14]: Will you join us , or will you remain at the cottage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 22]: `` I have reflected upon it , Edward , and I have come to the determination of remaining at the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 24]: You will find it expensive enough to support one where you are going , and you must appear as a Beverley should do .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 28]: We have plenty of money saved to equip you , and maintain you well for a year or so ; but after that you may require more .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 4]: Leave me here .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 38]: I can make money , now that the farm is well stocked ; and I have no doubt that I shall be able to send over a trifle every year to support the honour of the family .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 13]: Besides , I do not wish to leave this for another reason .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 22]: I want to know what is going on , and watch the motions of the Intendant and the heiress of Arnwood .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 31]: I also do not wish to leave the country until I know how my sisters get on with the Ladies Conynghame : it is my duty to watch over them .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 16]: I have made up my mind , so do not attempt to dissuade me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 41]: `` I shall not , my dear Humphrey , as I think you have decided properly ; but I beg you will not think of laying by money for me -- a very little will suffice for my wants . ''
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 24]: `` Not so , good brother ; you must and shall , if I can help you , ruffle it with the best .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 36]: You will be better received if you do ; for , though poverty is no sin , as the saying is , it is scouted as sin should be , while sins are winked at .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 25]: You know that I require no money , and therefore you must and shall , if you love me , take it all . ''
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 9]: `` As you will , my dear Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 25]: Now then , let us put our horses to speed , for , if possible , we will to-morrow morning leave the forest . ''
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 27]: By this time all search for the fugitives from Worcester had long been over , and there was no difficulty in obtaining the means of embarkation .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 38]: Early the next morning everything was ready , and Edward , Humphrey , Chaloner , Grenville , and Pablo set off for Southampton , one of the horses carrying the little baggage which they had with them .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 70]: Edward , as we have before mentioned , with the money he had saved , and the store at the cottage , which had been greatly increased , was well supplied with cash ; and that evening they embarked , with their horses , in a small sailing vessel , and , with a favourable light wind , arrived at a small port of France on the following day .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 23]: Humphrey and Pablo returned to the cottage , we need hardly now say , very much out of spirits at the separation .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 30]: `` Oh , Massa Humphrey , '' said Pablo , as they rode along , `` Missy Alice and Missy Edith go away -- I wish go with them .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 11]: Massa Edward go away -- I wish go with him .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 11]: You stay at cottage -- I wish stay with you .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 9]: Pablo can not be in three places . ''
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 20]: `` No , Pablo ; all you can do is to stay where you can be most useful . ''
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 7]: `` Yes , I know that .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 8]: You want me at cottage very much .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 18]: Missy Alice and Edith and Massa Edward no want me ; so I stay at cottage . ''
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 20]: `` Yes , Pablo , we will stay at the cottage , but we ca n't do everything now .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 16]: I think we must give up the dairy , now that my sisters are gone .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 13]: I 'll tell you what I have been thinking of , Pablo .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 33]: We will make a large enclosed place , to coax the ponies into during the winter , pick out as many as we think are good , and sell them at Lymington .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 9]: That will be better than churning butter . ''
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 13]: `` Yes , I see ; plenty of work for Pablo . ''
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 43]: `` And plenty for me , too , Pablo ; but you know , when the enclosure is once made , it will last for a long while ; and we will get the wild cattle into it if we can . ''
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 10]: `` Yes , I see , '' said Pablo .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 16]: `` I like that very much ; only not like trouble to build place . ''
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 40]: `` We sha n't have much trouble , Pablo : if we fell the trees inside the wood at each side , and let them lie one upon the other , the animals will never break through them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 13]: `` That very good idea -- save trouble , '' said Pablo .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 14]: `` And what you do with cows , suppose no make butter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 22]: `` Keep them , and sell their calves ; keep them , to entice the wild cattle into the pen . ''
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 6]: `` Yes , that good .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 18]: And turn out old Billy to ` tice ponies into pen , '' continued Pablo , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 9]: `` Yes , we will try it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 10]: We must now return to the Intendant 's house .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 15]: Oswald delivered the letter to the Intendant , who read it with much astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 3]: `` Gone !
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 6]: Is he actually gone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 4]: said Mr Heatherstone .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 11]: `` Yes , sir , before daylight this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 11]: `` And why was I not informed of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 19]: said Mr Heatherstone ; `` why have you been a party to this proceeding , being my servant ?
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 6]: May I inquire that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 16]: `` I knew Master Edward before I knew you , sir , '' replied Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 18]: `` Then you had better follow him , '' rejoined the Intendant , in an angry tone .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 15]: `` Very well , sir , '' replied Oswald , who quitted the room .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 4]: `` Good Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 9]: How all my plans have been frustrated ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 9]: exclaimed the Intendant , when he was alone .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 16]: He then read the letter over more carefully than he had done at first . ''
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 15]: ` Circumstances had occurred of which no explanation could be given by him . '
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 12]: I do not comprehend that -- I must see Patience . ''
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 12]: Mr Heatherstone opened the door , and called to his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 28]: `` Patience , '' said Mr Heatherstone , `` Edward has left the house this morning ; here is a letter which he has written to me .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 22]: Read it , and let me know if you can explain some portion of it , which to me is incomprehensible .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 8]: Sit down and read it attentively . ''
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 17]: Patience , who was much agitated , gladly took the seat and perused Edward 's letter .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 26]: When she had done so she let it drop in her lap , and covered all her face , the tears trickling through her fingers .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 20]: After a time the Intendant said -- `` Patience , has anything passed between you and Edward Armitage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 9]: Patience made no reply , but sobbed aloud .
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 39]: She might not have shown so much emotion , but it must be remembered that for the last three weeks since Edward had spoken to her , and during his subsequent illness , she had been very unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 57]: The reserve of Humphrey , the expressions he had made use of , his repulse of Clara , and her not having seen anything of Edward during his illness , added to his sudden and unexpected departure without a word to her , had broken her spirits , and she sank beneath the load of sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 13]: The Intendant left her to recover herself before he again addressed her .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 43]: When she had ceased sobbing , her father spoke to her in a very kind voice , begging her that she would not conceal anything from him , as it was most important to him that the real facts should be known .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 16]: `` Now tell me , my child , what passed between Edward and you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 21]: `` He told me , just before you came up to us that evening , that he loved me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 8]: `` And what was your reply ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 16]: `` I hardly know , my dear father , what it was that I said .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 53]: I did not like to be unkind to one who saved my life , and I did not choose to say what I thought , because -- because -- because he was of low birth ; and how could I give encouragement to the son of a forester without your permission ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 7]: `` Then you rejected him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 15]: `` I suppose I did , or that he considered that I did so .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 21]: He had a secret of importance that he would have confided to me , had you not interrupted us . ''
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 17]: `` And now , Patience , I must request you to answer me one question candidly .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 16]: I do not blame you for your conduct , which was correct under the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 95]: I also had a secret which I perhaps ought to have confided ; but I did consider that the confidence and paternal kindness with which I treated Edward would have been sufficient to point out to you that I could not have been very averse to an union -- indeed , the freedom of communication which I allowed between you must have told you so : but your sense of duty and propriety has made you act as you ought to have done , I grant , although contrary to my real wishes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 8]: `` Your wishes , my father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 3]: said Patience .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 35]: `` Yes -- my wishes ; there is nothing that I so ardently desired as an union between you and Edward ; but I wished you to love him for his own merits . ''
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 25]: `` I have done so , father , '' replied Patience , sobbing again , `` although I did not tell him so . ''
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 36]: The Intendant remained silent for some time , and then said -- `` There is no cause for further concealment , Patience ; I have only to regret that I was not more explicit sooner .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 38]: I have long suspected , and have since been satisfied , that Edward Armitage is Edward Beverley , who , with his brother and sisters , were supposed to have been burnt to death at Arnwood . ''
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 16]: Patience removed her handkerchief from her face , and looked at her father with astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 65]: `` I tell you that I had a strong suspicion of it , my dear child , first , from the noble appearance , which no forest garb could disguise ; but what gave me further conviction was , that when at Lymington I happened to fall in with one Benjamin , who had been a servant at Arnwood , and interrogated him closely .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 81]: He really believed that the children were burnt ; it is true that I asked him particularly relative to the appearance of the children -- how many were boys and how many were girls , their ages , etcetera ; but the strongest proof was , that the names of the four children corresponded with the names of the Children of the Forest , as well as their ages , and I went to the church register and extracted them .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 32]: Now this was almost amounting to proof ; for it was not likely that four children in the forest cottage should have the same ages and names as those of Arnwood .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 41]: After I had ascertained this point , I engaged Edward , as you know , wishing to secure him ; for I was once acquainted with his father , and at all events well acquainted with the Colonel 's merits .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 32]: You remained in the house together , and it was with pleasure that I watched the intimacy between you ; and then I exerted myself to get Arnwood restored to him .
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 25]: I could not ask it for him , but I prevented it being given to any other , by laying claim to it myself .
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 38]: Had Edward remained with us , all might have succeeded as I wished ; but he would join in the unfortunate insurrection , and I knew it useless to prevent him , so I let him go .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 80]: I found that he took the name of Beverley during the time he was with the king 's army , and when I was last in town I was told so by the commissioners , who wondered where he had come from ; but the effect was , that it was now useless for me to request the estate for him , as I had wished to do -- his having served in the royal army rendered it impossible .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 10]: I therefore claimed it for myself , and succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 102]: I had made up my mind that he was attached to you , and you were equally so to him ; and as soon as I had the grant sent down , which was on the evening he addressed you , I made known to him that the property was given to me ; and I added , on some dry questions being put to me by him , relative to the possibility of there being still existing an heir to the estate , that there was no chance of that , and that you would be the mistress of Arnwood .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 49]: I threw it out as a hint to him , fancying that , as far as you were concerned , all would go well , and that I would explain to him my knowledge of who he was after he had made known his regard for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 39]: `` Yes , I see it all now , '' replied Patience ; `` in one hour he is rejected by me , and in the next he is told that I have obtained possession of his property .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 14]: No wonder that he is indignant , and looks upon us with scorn .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 21]: And now he has left us : we have driven him into danger , and may never see him again .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 4]: Oh , father !
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 8]: I am very , very miserable ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 10]: `` We must hope for the best , Patience .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 24]: It is true that he has gone to the wars , but it does not therefore follow that he is to be killed .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 18]: You are both very young -- much too young to marry -- and all may be explained .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 12]: I must see Humphrey , and be candid with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 15]: `` But Alice and Edith , -- where are they gone , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 7]: `` That I can inform you .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 18]: I have a letter from Langton on the subject , for I begged him to find out .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 46]: He says that there are two young ladies of the name of Beverley , who have been placed under the charge of his friends the Ladies Conynghame , who is aunt to Major Chaloner , who has been for some time concealed in the forest .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 11]: But I have letters to write , my dear Patience .
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 22]: To-morrow , if I live and do well , I will ride over to the cottage to see Humphrey Beverley . ''
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 12]: The Intendant kissed his daughter ; and she left the room .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 3]: Poor Patience !
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 16]: She was glad to be left to herself , and think over this strange communication .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 25]: For many days she had felt how fond she had been of Edward , much more so than she had believed herself to be .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 29]: `` And now , '' she thought , `` if he really loves me , and hears my father 's explanation , he will come back again . ''
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 17]: By degrees , she recovered her serenity , and employed herself in her quiet domestic duties .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 30]: Mr Heatherstone rode over to the cottage the next day , where he found Humphrey busily employed as usual ; and , what was very unusual , extremely grave .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 56]: It was not a pleasant task for Mr Heatherstone to have to explain his conduct to so very young a man as Humphrey ; but he felt that he could not be comfortable until the evil impression against him was removed , and he knew that Humphrey had a great deal of sterling good sense .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 56]: His reception was cool ; but when the explanation was made , Humphrey was more than satisfied , as it showed that the Intendant had been their best friend , and that it was from a delicacy on the part of Patience , rather than from any other cause , that the misunderstanding had occurred .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 35]: Humphrey inquired if he had permission to communicate the substance of their conversation to his brother , and Mr Heatherstone stated that such was his wish and intention when he confided it to Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 26]: It is hardly necessary to say that Humphrey took the earliest opportunity of writing to Edward at the direction which Chaloner had left with him .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 9]: But we must follow Edward for a time .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 24]: On his arrival at Paris he was kindly received by King Charles , who promised to assist his views in joining the army .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 54]: `` You have to choose between two generals , both great in the art of war -- Conde and Turenne ; I have no doubt that they will be opposed to each other soon -- that will be the better for you , as you will learn tactics from such great players . ''
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 11]: `` Which would your majesty recommend me to follow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 3]: inquired Edward .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 50]: `` Conde is my favourite , and he will soon be opposed to this truculent and dishonest court , who have kept me here as an instrument to accomplish their own wishes , but who have never intended to keep their promises and place me on the English throne .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 41]: I will give you letters to Conde and recollect that whatever general you take service under you will follow him , without pretending to calculate how far his movements may be right or wrong -- that is not your affair .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 23]: Conde is now just released from Vincennes ; but , depend upon it , he will be in arms very soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 25]: As soon as he was furnished with the necessary credentials from the king Edward presented himself at the levee of the prince of Conde .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 20]: `` You are here highly spoken of , '' said the prince , `` for so young a man .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 9]: So you were at the affair of Worcester ?
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 15]: We will retain you , for your services will be wanted by and by .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 9]: Can you procure any of your countrymen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 27]: `` I know but of two that I can recommend from personal knowledge ; but these two officers I can venture to pledge myself for . ''
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 5]: `` Any more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 21]: `` That I can not at present reply to your highness -- but I should think it very possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 19]: `` Bring me the officers to-morrow at this hour , Monsieur Beverley -- _ au revoir _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 22]: The prince of Conde then passed on to speak to other officers and gentlemen who were waiting to pay their respects .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 18]: Edward went to Chaloner and Grenville , who were delighted with the intelligence which he brought them .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 16]: The next day they were at the prince 's levee , and introduced by Edward .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 23]: `` I am fortunate , gentlemen , '' said the prince , `` in securing the services of such fine young men .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 38]: You will oblige me by enlisting as many of your countrymen as you may consider likely to do good service , and then follow me to Guienne , to which province I am now about to depart .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 35]: Be pleased to put yourself into communication with the parties named in this paper , and after my absence you will receive from them every assistance and necessary supplies which may be required . ''
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 35]: A month after this interview , Conde , who had been joined by a great number of nobles , and had been reinforced by troops from Spain , set up the standard of revolt .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 38]: Edward and his friends joined them , with about 300 English and Scotch , whom they had enlisted , and very soon afterwards Conde obtained the victory at Blenan , and in April 1652 advanced to Paris .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 37]: Turenne , who had taken the command of the French army , followed him , and a severe action was fought in the streets of the suburb D'Antoine , in which neither party had the advantage .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 33]: But eventually Conde was beaten back by the superior force of Turenne ; and not receiving the assistance he expected from the Spaniards , he fell back to the frontiers of Champagne .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 68]: Previous to his departure from Paris , Edward had received Humphrey 's letter , explaining away the Intendant 's conduct ; and the contents removed a heavy load from Edward 's mind ; but he now thought of nothing but war , and although he cherished the idea of Patience Heatherstone , he was resolved to follow the fortunes of the prince as long as he could .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 35]: He wrote a letter to the Intendant , thanking him for his kind feelings and intentions towards him , and he trusted that he might one day have the pleasure of seeing him again .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 29]: He did not , however , think it advisable to mention the name of his daughter , except in inquiring after her health , and sending his respects .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 24]: `` It may be years before I see her again , '' thought Edward , `` and who knows what may happen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 37]: The prince of Conde now had the command of the Spanish forces in the Netherlands ; and Edward , with his friends , followed his fortunes , and gained his good-will : they were rapidly promoted .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 28]: Time flew on , and in the year 1654 the court of France concluded an alliance with Cromwell , and expelled King Charles from the French frontiers .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 10]: The war was still carried on in the Netherlands .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 34]: Turenne bore down Conde , who had gained every campaign ; and the court of Spain , wearied with reverses , made overtures of peace , which were gladly accepted by the French .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 15]: During these wars Cromwell had been named Protector , and had shortly afterwards died .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 39]: Edward , who but rarely heard from Humphrey , was now anxious to quit the army and go to the king , who was in Spain ; but to leave his colours while things were adverse was impossible .
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 25]: After the peace and the pardon of Conde by the French king , the armies were disbanded , and the three adventurers were free .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 37]: They took their leave of the prince , who thanked them for their long and meritorious services ; and they then hastened to King Charles , who had left Spain and come to the Low Countries .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 33]: At the time of their joining the king , Richard , the son of Cromwell , who had been nominated Protector , had resigned , and everything was ready for the Restoration .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 31]: On the 15th of May 1660 the news arrived that Charles had been proclaimed king on the 8th , and a large body of gentlemen went to invite him over .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 37]: The king sailed from Scheveling , was met at Dover by General Monk , and conducted to London , which he entered amidst the acclamations of the people , on the 29th of the same month .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 25]: We may leave the reader to suppose that Edward , Chaloner , and Grenville were among the most favoured of those in his train .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 39]: As the procession moved slowly along the Strand , through a countless multitude , the windows of all the houses were filled with well-dressed ladies , who waved their white kerchiefs to the king and his attendant suite .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 28]: Chaloner , Edward , and Grenville , who rode side by side as gentlemen in waiting , were certainly the most distinguished among the king 's retinue .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 19]: `` Look , Edward , '' said Chaloner , `` at those two lovely girls at yon window .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 6]: Do you recognise them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 6]: `` Indeed I do not .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 9]: Are they any of our Paris beauties ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 9]: `` Why , thou insensible and unnatural animal !
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 22]: They are thy sisters , Alice and Edith : and do you not recognise behind them my good aunts Conynghame ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 12]: `` It is so , I believe , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 16]: `` Yes , now that Edith smiles , I 'm sure it is they . ''
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 27]: `` Yes , '' replied Grenville , `` there can be no doubt of that ; but will they , think you , recognise us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 32]: `` We shall see , '' replied Edward , as they now approached within a few yards of the window ; for while they had been speaking the procession had stopped .
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 27]: `` Is it possible , '' thought Edward , `` that these can be the two girls in russet gowns that I left at the cottage ?
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 6]: And yet it must be .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 19]: Well , Chaloner , to all appearance , your good aunts have done justice to their charge . ''
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 8]: `` Nature has done more , Edward .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 26]: I never thought that they would have grown into such lovely girls as they have , although I always thought that they were handsome . ''
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 13]: As they passed Edward caught the eye of Edith , and smiled .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 8]: `` Alice , that 's Edward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 18]: said Edith , so loud as to be heard by the king , and all near him .
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 23]: Alice and Edith rose and waved their handkerchiefs , but they were obliged to cease , and put them to their eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 9]: `` Are those your sisters , Edward ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 4]: said the king .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 8]: `` They are , your majesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 20]: The king rose in his stirrups , and made a low obeisance to the window where they were standing .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 22]: `` We shall have some court beauties , Beverley , '' said the king , looking at him over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 40]: As soon as the ceremonies were over , and they could escape from their attendance on the king 's person , Edward and his two friends went to the house in which resided the Ladies Conynghame and his sisters .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 35]: We pass over the joy of this meeting after so many years ' absence , and the pleasure which it gave to Edward to find his sisters grown such accomplished and elegant young women .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 30]: That his two friends , who were , as the reader will recollect , old acquaintances of Alice and Edith , were warmly received , we hardly need say .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 26]: `` Now , Edward , who do you think was here to-day -- the reigning belle , and the toast of all the gentlemen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 3]: `` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 8]: I must be careful of my heart .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 8]: Dear Edith , who is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 19]: `` No less than one with whom you were formerly well acquainted , Edward -- Patience Heatherstone . ''
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 16]: `` Patience Heatherstone , '' cried Edward , `` the toast of all London ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 35]: `` Yes ; and deservedly so , I can assure you : but she is as good as she is handsome , and , moreover , treats all the gay gallants with perfect indifference .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 28]: She is staying with her uncle , Sir Ashley Cooper ; and her father is also in town , for he called here with her to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 11]: `` When did you hear from Humphrey , Edith ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 6]: `` A few days back .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 10]: He has left the cottage now , altogether . ''
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 3]: `` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 7]: Where does he reside then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 4]: `` At Arnwood .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 15]: The house has been rebuilt , and I understand is a very princely mansion .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 18]: Humphrey has charge of it , until it is ascertained to whom it is to belong . ''
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 12]: `` It belongs to Mr Heatherstone , does it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 3]: replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 9]: `` How can you say so , Edward ?
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 11]: You received Humphrey 's letters a long while ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 20]: `` Yes , I did ; but let us not talk about it any more , my dear Edith .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 7]: I am in great perplexity . ''
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 29]: `` Nay , dear brother , let us talk about it , '' said Alice , who had come up and overheard the latter portion of the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 7]: `` What is your perplexity ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 25]: `` Well , '' replied Edward , `` since it is to be so , let us sit down and talk over the matter .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 47]: I acknowledge the kindness of Mr Heatherstone , and feel that all he asserted to Humphrey is true ; still I do not like that I should be indebted to him for a property which is mine , and that he has no right to give .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 15]: I acknowledge his generosity , but I do not acknowledge his right of possession .
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 64]: Nay , much as I admire , and I may say , fond as I am -LRB- for time has not effaced the feeling -RRB- of his daughter , it still appears to me that , although not said , it is expected that she is to be included in the transfer ; and I will accept no wife on such conditions . ''
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 47]: `` That is to say , because all you wish for , your property and a woman you love , are offered you in one lot , you will not accept them ; they must be divided , and handed over to you in two ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 5]: said Alice , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 25]: `` You mistake , dearest ; I am not so foolish ; but I have a certain pride , which you can not blame .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 22]: Accepting the property from Mr Heatherstone is receiving a favour , were it given as a marriage portion with his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 17]: Now , why should I accept as a favour what I can claim as a right ?
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 17]: It is my intention of appealing to the king and demanding the restoration of my property .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 7]: He can not refuse it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 14]: `` Put not your trust in princes , brother , '' replied Alice .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 43]: `` I doubt if the king , or his council , will consider it advisable to make so many discontented as to restore property which has been so long held by others , and by so doing create a host of enemies .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 27]: Recollect also that Mr Heatherstone and his brother-in-law Sir Ashley Cooper have done the king much more service than you ever have , or can do .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 26]: They have been most important agents in his restoration , and the king 's obligations to them are much greater than they are to you .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 30]: Besides , merely for what may be called a point of honour , for it is no more , in what an unpleasant situation will you put his majesty !
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 28]: At all events , Edward , recollect you do not know what are the intentions of Mr Heatherstone ; wait and see what he proffers first . ''
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 17]: `` But , my dear sister , it appears to me that his intentions are evident .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 6]: Why has he rebuilt Arnwood ?
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 18]: He is not going to surrender my property and make me a present of the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 10]: `` The reason for rebuilding the mansion was good .
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 19]: You were at the wars ; it was possible that you might or that you might not return .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 63]: He said this to Humphrey , who has all along been acting as his factotum in the business ; and recollect , at the time that Mr Heatherstone commenced the rebuilding of the mansion , what prospect was there of the restoration of the king , or of your ever being in a position to apply for the restoration of your property ?
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 47]: I believe , however , that Humphrey knows more of Mr Heatherstone 's intentions than he has made known to us ; and I therefore say again , my dear Edward , make no application till you ascertain what Mr Heatherstone 's intentions may be . ''
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 22]: `` Your advice is good , my dear Alice , and I will be guided by it , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 18]: `` And now let me give you some advice for your friends , Masters Chaloner and Grenville .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 33]: That much of their property has been taken away and put into other hands , I know ; and probably they expect it will be restored upon their application to the king .
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 16]: Those who hold the property think so too , and so far it is fortunate .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 70]: Now , from wiser heads than mine , I have been told that these applications will not be acceded to , as is supposed ; but , at the same time , if they were to meet the parties , and close with them at once , before the king 's intentions are known , they would recover their property at a third or a quarter of the value .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 16]: Now is their time : even a few days ' delay may make a difference .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 13]: They can easily obtain a delay for the payment of the moneys .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 28]: Impress that upon them , my dear Edward , and let them , if possible , be off to their estates to-morrow and make the arrangements . ''
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 13]: `` That is advice which must be followed , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 21]: `` We must go now , and I will not fail to communicate it to them this very night . ''
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 32]: We may as well here inform the reader that the advice was immediately acted upon , and that Chaloner and Grenville recovered all their estates at about five years ' purchase .
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 7]: Edward remained at court several days .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 23]: He had written to Humphrey , and had despatched a messenger with the letter , but the messenger had not yet returned .
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 12]: The court was now one continual scene of fetes and gaiety .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 20]: On the following day a drawing-room was to be held , and Edward 's sisters were to be presented .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 37]: Edward was standing , with many others of the suite , behind the chair of the king , amusing himself with the presentations as they took place , and waiting for the arrival of his sisters .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 46]: Chaloner and Grenville were not with him , they had obtained leave to go into the country , for the object we have before referred to -- when his eyes caught , advancing towards the king , Mr Heatherstone , who led his daughter Patience .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 32]: That they had not perceived him was evident ; indeed her eyes were not raised once , from the natural timidity felt by a young woman in the presence of royalty .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 19]: Edward half concealed himself behind one of his companions , that he might gaze upon her without reserve .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 48]: She was indeed a lovely young person , but little altered , except having grown taller and more rounded and perfect in her figure ; and her court-dress displayed proportions which her humble costume at the New Forest had concealed , or which time had not matured .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 64]: There was the same pensive sweet expression in her face , which had altered little ; but the beautiful rounded arms , the symmetrical fall of the shoulders , and the proportion of the whole figure , was a surprise to him ; and Edward , in his own mind , agreed that she might well be the reigning toast of the day .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 25]: Mr Heatherstone advanced and made his obeisance , and then his daughter was led forward , and introduced by a lady unknown to Edward .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 26]: After he had saluted her , the king said , loud enough for Edward to hear -- `` My obligations to your father are great .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 12]: I trust that the daughter will often grace our court . ''
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 23]: Patience made no reply , but passed on ; and , soon afterwards , Edward lost sight of her in the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 62]: If there ever had been any check to Edward 's feelings towards Patience -- and time and absence have their effect upon the most ardent of lovers -- the sight of her so resplendent in beauty acted upon him like magic ; and he was uneasy till the ceremony was over , and he was enabled to go to his sisters .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 21]: When he entered the room he found himself in the arms of Humphrey , who had arrived with the messenger .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 26]: After the greetings were over , Edward said -- `` Alice , I have seen Patience , and I fear I must surrender at discretion .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 18]: Mr Heatherstone may make his own terms ; I must waive all pride rather than lose her .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 30]: I thought that I had more control over myself ; but I have seen her , and feel that my future happiness depends upon obtaining her as a wife .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 19]: Let her father but give me her , and Arnwood will be but a trifle in addition ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 27]: `` With respect to the conditions upon which you are to possess Arnwood , '' said Humphrey , `` I can inform you what they are .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 24]: They are wholly unshackled , further than that you are to repay by instalments the money expended in the building of the house .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 40]: This I am empowered to state to you , and I think you will allow that Mr Heatherstone has fully acted up to what he stated were his views when he first obtained a grant of the property . ''
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 10]: `` He has , indeed , '' replied Edward .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 25]: `` As for his daughter , Edward , you have yet to ` win her and wear her , ' as the saying is .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 39]: Her father will resign the property to you as yours by right ; but you have no property in his daughter , and I suspect that she will not be quite so easily handed over to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 10]: `` But why should you say so , Humphrey ?
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 10]: Have we not been attached from our youth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 26]: `` Yes , it was a youthful passion , I grant ; but recollect , nothing came of it , and years have passed away .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 31]: It is now seven years since you quitted the forest , and in your letters to Mr Heatherstone you made no remark upon what had passed between you and Patience .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 48]: Since that , you have never corresponded or sent any messages ; and you can hardly expect that a girl , from the age of seventeen to twenty-four , will cherish the image of one who , to say the least , had treated her with indifference .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 10]: That is my view of the matter , Edward .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 6]: It may be wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 12]: `` And it may be true , '' replied Edward mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 12]: `` Well , my view is different , '' replied Edith .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 23]: `` You know , Humphrey , how many offers Patience Heatherstone has had , and has every day , I may say .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 7]: Why has she refused them all ?
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 23]: In my opinion , because she has been constant to a proud brother of mine , who does not deserve her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 12]: `` It may be so , Edith , '' replied Humphrey .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 17]: `` Women are riddles -- I only argued upon the common sense of the thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 11]: `` Much you know about women , '' replied Edith .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 24]: `` To be sure , you do not meet many in the New Forest , where you have lived all your life . ''
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 25]: `` Very true , my dear sister ; perhaps that is the reason that the New Forest has had such charms for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 17]: `` After that speech , sir , the sooner you get back again the better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 3]: retorted Edith .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 14]: But Edward made a sign to Humphrey , and they beat a retreat .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 10]: `` Have you seen the Intendant , Humphrey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 20]: `` No ; I was about to call upon him , but I wanted to see you first . ''
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 7]: `` I will go with you .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 40]: I have not done him justice , '' replied Edward , `` and yet I hardly know how to explain to him -- '' `` Say nothing , but meet him cordially ; that will be explanation sufficient . ''
