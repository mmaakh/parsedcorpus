Parsing [sent. 1 len. 149]: THE PHANTOM SHIP by CAPTAIN FREDERICK MARRYAT LONDON MDCCCXCVI Contents CHAPTER I CHAPTER II CHAPTER III CHAPTER IV CHAPTER V CHAPTER VI CHAPTER VII CHAPTER VIII CHAPTER IX CHAPTER X CHAPTER XI CHAPTER XII CHAPTER XIII CHAPTER XIV CHAPTER XV CHAPTER XVI CHAPTER XVII CHAPTER XVIII CHAPTER XIX CHAPTER XX CHAPTER XXI CHAPTER XXII CHAPTER XXIII CHAPTER XXIV CHAPTER XXV CHAPTER XXVI CHAPTER XXVII CHAPTER XXVIII CHAPTER XXIX CHAPTER XXX CHAPTER XXXI CHAPTER XXXII CHAPTER XXXIII CHAPTER XXXIV CHAPTER XXXV CHAPTER XXXVI CHAPTER XXXVII CHAPTER XXXVIII CHAPTER XXXIX CHAPTER XL CHAPTER XLI CHAPTER XLII Prefatory Note _ THE PHANTOM SHIP _ is the most notable of the three novels constructed by Marryat on an historic basis , and like its predecessor in the same category , _ Snarleyyow _ , depends largely for its interest on the element of _ diablerie _ , which is very skilfully manipulated .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 30]: Here , however , the supernatural appearances are never explained away , and the ghostly agencies are introduced in the spirit of serious , if somewhat melodramatic , romance .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 39]: Marryat 's personal experience enabled him , with little research , to produce a life-like picture of old Dutch seamanship , and his powers in racy narrative have transformed the Vanderdecken legend into a stirring tale of terror .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 35]: The plot can not be called original , but it is more carefully worked out and , from the nature of the material at hand , more effective than most of Marryat 's own .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 27]: He has put life into it , moreover , by the creation of some genuine characters , designed for nobler ends than to move the machinery .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 23]: Amine , indeed , as Mr Hannay points out , `` is by far his nearest approach to an acceptable heroine . ''
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 17]: Her romantic and curiously superstitious disposition is admirably restrained by strength of will and true courage .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 15]: The scenes of the Inquisition by which she meets her death are forcibly described .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 21]: Philip Vanderdecken is a very respectable hero ; daring , impetuous , and moody , without being too improbably capable .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 17]: The hand of destiny lends him a dignity of which he is by no means unworthy .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 28]: Krantz , the faithful friend , belongs to a familiar type , but the one-eyed pilot is quite sufficiently weird for the part he has to play .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 27]: For the rest we have the usual exciting adventures by sea and land ; the usual `` humours , '' in this case certainly not overdone .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 42]: The miser Dr Poots ; the bulky Kloots , his bear , and his supercargo ; Barentz and his crazy lady-love the _ Vrow Katerina _ ; and the little Portuguese Commandant provide the reader with a variety of good-natured entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 38]: It was an act of doubtful wisdom , perhaps , to introduce a second group of spirits from the Hartz mountains , but the story of the weir-wolves is told simply , without any straining after effect .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 15]: The general success , however , is marred by certain obvious failures in detail .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 67]: The attempt to produce an historic flavour by making the characters , during their calmer moments , talk in would-be old English is more amusing than culpable ; but the author 's philosophy of the unseen , as expounded by Amine or Krantz , is both weak and tiresome , and his religious discourses , coloured by prejudice against the Romanists , are conventional and unconvincing .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 8]: The closing scene savours of the Sunday-school .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 24]: But these faults are not obtrusive , and the novel as a whole must take a high place among its author 's second-best .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 18]: _ The Phantom Ship _ appeared in _ The New Monthly Magazine _ , 1838 , 1839 .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 13]: It is here reprinted from the first edition , in three volumes .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 5]: Henry Colburn , 1839 .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 74]: R.B.J. Chapter I About the middle of the seventeenth century , in the outskirts of the small but fortified town of Terneuse , situated on the right bank of the Scheldt , and nearly opposite to the island of Walcheren , there was to be seen , in advance of a few other even more humble tenements , a small but neat cottage , built according to the prevailing taste of the time .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 25]: The outside front had , some years back , been painted of a deep orange , the windows and shutters of a vivid green .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 21]: To about three feet above the surface of the earth , it was faced alternately with blue and white tiles .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 48]: A small garden , of about two rods of our measure of land , surrounded the edifice ; and this little plot was flanked by a low hedge of privet , and encircled by a moat full of water , too wide to be leaped with ease .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 34]: Over that part of the moat which was in front of the cottage door , was a small and narrow bridge , with ornamented iron hand-rails , for the security of the passenger .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 59]: But the colours , originally so bright , with which the cottage had been decorated , had now faded ; symptoms of rapid decay were evident in the window-sills , the door-jambs , and other wooden parts of the tenement , and many of the white and blue tiles had fallen down , and had not been replaced .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 24]: That much care had once been bestowed upon this little tenement , was as evident as that latterly it had been equally neglected .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 62]: The inside of the cottage , both on the basement and the floor above , was divided into two larger rooms in front , and two smaller behind ; the rooms in front could only be called large in comparison with the other two , as they were little more than twelve feet square , with but one window to each .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 63]: The upper floor was , as usual , appropriated to the bedrooms ; on the lower , the two smaller rooms were now used only as a wash-house and a lumber-room ; while one of the larger was fitted up as a kitchen , and furnished with dressers , on which the metal utensils for cookery shone clean and polished as silver .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 20]: The room itself was scrupulously neat ; but the furniture , as well as the utensils , were scanty .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 27]: The boards of the floor were of a pure white , and so clean that you might have laid anything down without fear of soiling it .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 35]: A strong deal table , two wooden-seated chairs , and a small easy couch , which had been removed from one of the bedrooms upstairs , were all the movables which this room contained .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 56]: The other front room had been fitted up as a parlour ; but what might be the style of its furniture was now unknown , for no eye had beheld the contents of that room for nearly seventeen years , during which it had been hermetically sealed , even to the inmates of the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 14]: The kitchen , which we have described , was occupied by two persons .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 20]: One was a woman , apparently about forty years of age , but worn down by pain and suffering .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 80]: She had evidently once possessed much beauty : there were still the regular outlines , the noble forehead , and the large dark eye ; but there was a tenuity in her features , a wasted appearance , such as to render the flesh transparent ; her brow , when she mused , would sink into deep wrinkles , premature though they were ; and the occasional flashing of her eyes strongly impressed you with the idea of insanity .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 42]: There appeared to be some deep-seated , irremovable , hopeless cause of anguish , never for one moment permitted to be absent from her memory : a chronic oppression , fixed and graven there , only to be removed by death .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 26]: She was dressed in the widow 's coif of the time ; but although clean and neat , her garments were faded from long wear .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 26]: She was seated upon the small couch which we have mentioned , evidently brought down as a relief to her , in her declining state .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 29]: On the deal table in the centre of the room sat the other person , a stout , fair-headed , florid youth of nineteen or twenty years old .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 58]: His features were handsome and bold , and his frame powerful to excess ; his eye denoted courage and determination , and as he carelessly swung his legs , and whistled an air in an emphatic manner , it was impossible not to form the idea that he was a daring , adventurous , and reckless character .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 32]: `` Do not go to sea , Philip ; oh , promise me _ that _ , my dear , dear child , '' said the female , clasping her hands .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 11]: `` And why not go to sea , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 15]: replied Philip ; `` what 's the use of my staying here to starve ?
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 6]: -- for , by Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 5]: it 's little better .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 10]: I must do something for myself and for you .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 7]: And what else can I do ?
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 19]: My uncle Van Brennen has offered to take me with him , and will give me good wages .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 21]: Then I shall live happily on board , and my earnings will be sufficient for your support at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 8]: `` Philip -- Philip , hear me .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 8]: I shall die if you leave me .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 9]: Whom have I in the world but you ?
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 41]: O my child , as you love me , and I know you _ do _ love me , Philip , do n't leave me ; but if you will , at all events do not go to sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 18]: Philip gave no immediate reply ; he whistled for a few seconds , while his mother wept .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 28]: `` Is it , '' said he at last , `` because my father was drowned at sea , that you beg so hard , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 8]: `` Oh , no -- no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 5]: exclaimed the sobbing woman .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 15]: `` Would to God -- '' `` Would to God what , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 5]: `` Nothing -- nothing .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 10]: Be merciful -- be merciful , O God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 32]: replied the mother , sliding from her seat on the couch , and kneeling by the side of it , in which attitude she remained for some time in fervent prayer .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 17]: At last she resumed her seat , and her face wore an aspect of more composure .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 18]: Philip , who , during this , had remained silent and thoughtful , again addressed his mother .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 6]: `` Look ye , mother .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 27]: You ask me to stay on shore with you , and starve , -- rather hard conditions : -- now hear what I have to say .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 73]: That room opposite has been shut up ever since I can remember -- why , you will never tell me ; but once I heard you say , when we were without bread , and with no prospect of my uncle 's return -- you were then half frantic , mother , as you know you sometimes are -- '' `` Well , Philip , what did you hear me say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 7]: enquired his mother with tremulous anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 32]: `` You said , mother , that there was money in that room which would save us ; and then you screamed and raved , and said that you preferred death .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 21]: Now , mother , what is there in that chamber , and why has it been so long shut up ?
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 12]: Either I know that , or I go to sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 90]: At the commencement of this address of Philip , his mother appeared to be transfixed , and motionless as a statue ; gradually her lips separated , and her eyes glared ; she seemed to have lost the power of reply ; she put her hand to her right side , as if to compress it , then both her hands , as if to relieve herself from excruciating torture : at last she sank , with her head forward , and the blood poured out of her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 18]: Philip sprang from the table to her assistance , and prevented her from falling on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 14]: He laid her on the couch , watching with alarm the continued effusion .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 9]: mother -- mother , what is this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 10]: cried he , at last , in great distress .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 46]: For some time his mother could make him no reply ; she turned further on her side , that she might not be suffocated by the discharge from the ruptured vessel , and the snow-white planks of the floor were soon crimsoned with her blood .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 23]: `` Speak , dearest mother , if you can , '' repeated Philip , in agony ; `` what shall I do ?
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 6]: what shall I give you ?
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 3]: God Almighty !
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 5]: what is this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 9]: `` Death , my child , death ! ''
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 14]: at length replied the poor woman , sinking into a state of unconsciousness .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 22]: Philip , now much alarmed , flew out of the cottage , and called the neighbours to his mother 's assistance .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 65]: Two or three hastened to the call ; and as soon as Philip saw them occupied in restoring his mother , he ran as fast as he could to the house of a medical man , who lived about a mile off -- one Mynheer Poots , a little , miserable , avaricious wretch , but known to be very skilful in his profession .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 13]: Philip found Poots at home , and insisted upon his immediate attendance .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 32]: `` I will come -- yes , most certainly , '' replied Poots , who spoke the language but imperfectly ; `` but Mynheer Vanderdecken , who will pay me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 4]: `` Pay you !
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 11]: my uncle will , directly that he comes home . ''
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 26]: `` Your uncle de Skipper Van Brennen : no , he owes me four guilders , and he has owed me for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 8]: Besides , his ship may sink . ''
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 38]: `` He shall pay you the four guilders , and for this attendance also , '' replied Philip , in a rage ; `` come directly , while you are disputing my mother may be dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 32]: `` But , Mr Philip , I can not come , now I recollect ; I have to see the child of the burgomaster at Terneuse , '' replied Mynheer Poots .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 35]: `` Look you , Mynheer Poots , '' exclaimed Philip , red with passion ; `` you have but to choose , -- will you go quietly , or must I take you there ?
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 8]: You 'll not trifle with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 18]: Here Mynheer Poots was under considerable alarm , for the character of Philip Vanderdecken was well known .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 14]: `` I will come by-and-bye , Mynheer Philip , if I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 33]: `` You 'll come now , you wretched old miser , '' exclaimed Philip , seizing hold of the little man by the collar , and pulling him out of his door .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 3]: `` Murder !
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 3]: murder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 19]: cried Poots , as he lost his legs , and was dragged along by the impetuous young man .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 14]: Philip stopped , for he perceived that Poots was black in the face .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 13]: `` Must I then choke you , to make you go quietly ?
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 14]: for , hear me , go you shall , alive or dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 52]: `` Well , then , '' replied Poots , recovering himself , `` I will go , but I 'll have you in prison to-night : and , as for your mother , I 'll not -- no , that I will not -- Mynheer Philip , depend upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 59]: `` Mark me , Mynheer Poots , '' replied Philip , `` as sure as there is a God in heaven , if you do not come with me , I 'll choke you now ; and when you arrive , if you do not do your best for my poor mother , I 'll murder you there .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 38]: You know that I always do what I say , so now take my advice , come along quietly , and you shall certainly be paid , and well paid -- if I sell my coat . ''
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 16]: This last observation of Philip , perhaps , had more effect than even his threats .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 20]: Poots was a miserable little atom , and like a child in the powerful grasp of the young man .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 52]: The doctor 's tenement was isolated , and he could obtain no assistance until within a hundred yards of Vanderdecken 's cottage ; so Mynheer Poots decided that he would go , first , because Philip had promised to pay him , and secondly , because he could not help it .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 44]: This point being settled , Philip and Mynheer Poots made all haste to the cottage ; and on their arrival , they found his mother still in the arms of two of her female neighbours , who were bathing her temples with vinegar .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 14]: She was in a state of consciousness , but she could not speak .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 30]: Poots ordered her to be carried upstairs and put to bed , and pouring some acids down her throat , hastened away with Philip to procure the necessary remedies .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 45]: `` You will give your mother that directly , Mynheer Philip , '' said Poots , putting a phial into his hand ; `` I will now go to the child of the burgomaster , and will afterwards come back to your cottage . ''
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 15]: `` Do n't deceive me , '' said Philip , with a threatening look .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 35]: `` No , no , Mynheer Philip , I would not trust to your uncle Van Brennen for payment , but you have promised , and I know that you always keep your word .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 19]: In one hour I will be with your mother ; but you yourself must now be quick . ''
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 4]: Philip hastened home .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 29]: After the potion had been administered , the bleeding was wholly stopped ; and in half an hour , his mother could express her wishes in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 23]: When the little doctor arrived , he carefully examined his patient , and then went downstairs with her son into the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 12]: `` Mynheer Philip , '' said Poots , `` by Allah !
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 25]: I have done my best , but I must tell you that I have little hopes of your mother rising from her bed again .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 13]: She may live one day or two days , but not more .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 18]: It is not my fault , Mynheer Philip , '' continued Poots , in a deprecating tone .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 18]: `` No , no ; it is the will of Heaven , '' replied Philip , mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 11]: `` And you will pay me , Mynheer Vanderdecken ? ''
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 9]: continued the doctor , after a short pause .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 18]: `` Yes , '' replied Philip in a voice of thunder , and starting from a reverie .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 10]: After a moment 's silence , the doctor recommenced .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 9]: `` Shall I come to-morrow , Mynheer Philip ?
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 25]: You know that will be a charge of another guilder : it is of no use to throw away money or time either . ''
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 29]: `` Come to-morrow , come every hour , charge what you please ; you shall certainly be paid , '' replied Philip , curling his lip with contempt .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 9]: `` Well , it is as you please .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 24]: As soon as she is dead , the cottage and the furniture will be yours , and you will sell them of course .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 6]: Yes , I will come .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 7]: You will have plenty of money .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 20]: Mynheer Philip , I would like the first offer of the cottage , if it is to let . ''
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 20]: Philip raised his arm in the air as if to crush Mynheer Poots , who retreated to the corner .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 20]: `` I did not mean until your mother was buried , '' said Poots , in a coaxing tone .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 8]: `` Go , wretch , go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 19]: said Philip , covering his face with his hands , as he sank down upon the blood-stained couch .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 37]: After a short interval , Philip Vanderdecken returned to the bedside of his mother , whom he found much better ; and the neighbours , having their own affairs to attend to , left them alone .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 34]: Exhausted with the loss of blood , the poor woman slumbered for many hours , during which she never let go the hand of Philip , who watched her breathing in mournful meditation .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 13]: It was about one o'clock in the morning when the widow awoke .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 38]: She had in a great degree recovered her voice , and thus she addressed her son : -- `` My dear , my impetuous boy , and have I detained you here a prisoner so long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 9]: `` My own inclination detained me , mother .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 15]: I leave you not to others until you are up and well again . ''
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 10]: `` That , Philip , I shall never be .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 28]: I feel that death claims me ; and , O , my son , were it not for you , how should I quit this world rejoicing !
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 20]: I have long been dying , Philip , -- and long , long have I prayed for death . ''
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 8]: `` And why so , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 13]: replied Philip , bluntly ; `` I 've done my best . ''
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 18]: `` You have , my child , you have : and may God bless you for it .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 24]: Often have I seen you curb your fiery temper -- restrain yourself when justified in wrath -- to spare a mother 's feelings .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 17]: 'T is now some days that even hunger has not persuaded you to disobey your mother .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 24]: And , Philip , you must have thought me mad or foolish to insist so long , and yet to give no reason .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 9]: I 'll speak -- again -- directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 41]: The widow turned her head upon the pillow , and remained quiet for some minutes ; then , as if revived , she resumed : `` I believe I have been mad at times -- have I not , Philip ?
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 19]: And God knows I have had a secret in my heart enough to drive a wife to frenzy .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 25]: It has oppressed me day and night , worn my mind , impaired my reason , and now , at last , thank Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 21]: it has overcome this mortal frame : the blow is struck , Philip , -- I 'm sure it is .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 30]: I wait but to tell you all , -- and yet I would not , -- ` twill turn your brain as it has turned mine , Philip . ''
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 21]: `` Mother , '' replied Philip , earnestly , `` I conjure you , let me hear this killing secret .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 13]: Be heaven or hell mixed up with it , I fear not .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 12]: Heaven will not hurt me , and Satan I defy . ''
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 17]: `` I know thy bold , proud spirit , Philip , -- thy strength of mind .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 15]: If anyone could bear the load of such a dreadful tale , thou couldst .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 5]: My brain , alas !
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 21]: was far too weak for it ; and I see it is my duty to tell it to thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 41]: The widow paused as her thoughts reverted to that which she had to confide ; for a few minutes the tears rained down her hollow cheeks ; she then appeared to have summoned resolution , and to have regained strength .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 12]: `` Philip , it is of your father I would speak .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 13]: It is supposed -- that he was -- drowned at sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 9]: `` And was he not , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 6]: replied Philip , with surprise .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 5]: `` O no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 11]: `` But he has long been dead , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 21]: `` No , -- yes , -- and yet -- no , '' said the widow , covering her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 21]: Her brain wanders , thought Philip , but he spoke again : `` Then where is he , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 25]: The widow raised herself , and a tremor visibly ran through her whole frame , as she replied -- `` IN LIVING JUDGMENT . ''
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 31]: The poor woman then sank down again upon the pillow , and covered her head with the bedclothes , as if she would have hid herself from her own memory .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 15]: Philip was so much perplexed and astounded , that he could make no reply .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 40]: A silence of some minutes ensued , when , no longer able to beat the agony of suspense , Philip faintly whispered -- `` The secret , mother , the secret ; quick , let me hear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 21]: `` I can now tell all , Philip , '' replied his mother , in a solemn tone of voice .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 7]: `` Hear me , my son .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 29]: Your father 's disposition was but too like your own ; -- O may his cruel fate be a lesson to you , my dear , dear child !
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 17]: He was a bold , a daring , and , they say , a first-rate seaman .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 26]: He was not born here , but in Amsterdam ; but he would not live there , because he still adhered to the Catholic religion .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 16]: The Dutch , you know , Philip , are heretics , according to our creed .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 27]: It is now seventeen years or more that he sailed for India , in his fine ship the _ Amsterdammer _ , with a valuable cargo .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 51]: It was his third voyage to India , Philip , and it was to have been , if it had so pleased God , his last , for he had purchased that good ship with only part of his earnings , and one more voyage would have made his fortune .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 2]: O !
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 61]: how often did we talk over what we would do upon his return , and how these plans for the future consoled me at the idea of his absence , for I loved him dearly , Philip , -- he was always good and kind to me ; and after he had sailed , how I hoped for his return !
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 13]: The lot of a sailor 's wife is not to be envied .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 34]: Alone and solitary for so many months , watching the long wick of the candle , and listening to the howling of the wind -- foreboding evil and accident -- wreck and widowhood .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 27]: He had been gone about six months , Philip , and there was still a long dreary year to wait before I could expect him back .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 24]: One night , you , my child , were fast asleep ; you were my only solace -- my comfort in my loneliness .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 69]: I had been watching over you in your slumbers ; you smiled and half pronounced the name of mother ; and at last I kissed your unconscious lips , and I knelt and prayed -- prayed for God 's blessing on you , my child , and upon him too -- little thinking , at the time , that he was so horribly , so fearfully CURSED . ''
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 10]: The widow paused for breath , and then resumed .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 5]: Philip could not speak .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 19]: His lips were sundered , and his eyes riveted upon his mother , as he devoured her words .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 23]: `` I left you and went downstairs into that room , Philip , which since that dreadful night has never been re-opened .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 27]: I sate me down and read , for the wind was strong , and when the gale blows , a sailor 's wife can seldom sleep .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 11]: It was past midnight , and the rain poured down .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 11]: I felt unusual fear , -- I knew not why .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 19]: I rose from the couch and dipped my finger in the blessed water , and I crossed myself .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 16]: A violent gust of wind roared round the house , and alarmed me still more .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 36]: I had a painful , horrible foreboding ; when , of a sudden , the windows and window-shutters were all blown in , the light was extinguished , and I was left in utter darkness .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 44]: I screamed with fright ; but at last I recovered myself , and was proceeding towards the window that I might reclose it , when whom should I behold , slowly entering at the casement , but -- your father , -- Philip !
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 12]: -- Yes , Philip , -- it was your father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 5]: `` Merciful God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 13]: muttered Philip , in a low tone almost subdued into a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 38]: `` I knew not what to think , -- he was in the room ; and although the darkness was intense , his form and features were as clear and as defined as if it were noon-day .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 18]: Fear would have inclined me to recoil from , -- his loved presence to fly towards him .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 14]: I remained on the spot where I was , choked with agonising sensations .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 36]: When he had entered the room , the windows and shutters closed of themselves , and the candle was relighted -- then I thought it was his apparition , and I fainted on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 22]: `` When I recovered I found myself on the couch , and perceived that a cold -LRB- O how cold ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 8]: and dripping hand was clasped in mine .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 15]: This reassured me , and I forgot the supernatural signs which accompanied his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 13]: I imagined that he had been unfortunate , and had returned home .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 17]: I opened my eyes , and beheld my loved husband and threw myself into his arms .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 31]: His clothes were saturated with the rain : I felt as if I had embraced ice -- but nothing can check the warmth of a woman 's love , Philip .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 21]: He received my caresses , but he caressed not again : he spoke not , but looked thoughtful and unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 9]: ` William -- William , ' cried I !
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 14]: ` speak , Vanderdecken , speak to your dear Catherine . ' '' '
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 18]: I will , ' replied he , solemnly , ` for my time is short . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 24]: ` No , no , you must not go to sea again : you have lost your vessel , but you are safe .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 8]: Have I not you again ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 3]: ` Alas !
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 15]: no -- be not alarmed , but listen , for my time is short .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 32]: I have not lost my vessel , Catherine , BUT I HAVE LOST !!! Make no reply , but listen ; I am not dead , nor yet am I alive .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 11]: I hover between this world and the world of Spirits .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 4]: Mark me . ''
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 28]: ` For nine weeks did I try to force my passage against the elements round the stormy Cape , but without success ; and I swore terribly .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 33]: For nine weeks more did I carry sail against the adverse winds and currents , and yet could gain no ground ; and then I blasphemed , -- ay , terribly blasphemed .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 5]: Yet still I persevered .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 44]: The crew , worn out with long fatigue , would have had me return to the Table Bay ; but I refused ; nay , more , I became a murderer , -- unintentionally , it is true , but still a murderer .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 54]: The pilot opposed me , and persuaded the men to bind me , and in the excess of my fury , when he took me by the collar , I struck at him ; he reeled ; and , with the sudden lurch of the vessel , he fell overboard , and sank .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 66]: Even this fearful death did not restrain me ; and I swore by the fragment of the Holy Cross , preserved in that relic now hanging round your neck , that I would gain my point in defiance of storm and seas , of lightning , of heaven , or of hell , even if I should beat about until the Day of Judgment . ''
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 15]: ` My oath was registered in thunder , and in streams of sulphurous fire .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 56]: The hurricane burst upon the ship , the canvas flew away in ribbons ; mountains of seas swept over us , and in the centre of a deep o'erhanging cloud , which shrouded all in utter darkness , were written in letters of livid flame , these words -- UNTIL THE DAY OF JUDGMENT . ''
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 12]: ` Listen to me , Catherine , my time is short .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 17]: _ One Hope _ alone remains , and for this am I permitted to come here .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 5]: Take this letter . '
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 9]: He put a sealed paper on the table .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 16]: ` Read it , Catherine , dear , and try if you can assist me .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 12]: Read it and now farewell -- my time is come . '
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 33]: `` Again the window and window-shutters burst open -- again the light was extinguished , and the form of my husband was , as it were , wafted in the dark expanse .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 53]: I started up and followed him with outstretched arms and frantic screams as he sailed through the window ; -- my glaring eyes beheld his form borne away like lightning on the wings of the wild gale , till it was lost as a speck of light , and then it disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 15]: Again the windows closed , the light burned , and I was left alone !
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 6]: `` Heaven , have mercy !
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 3]: My brain !
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 4]: -- my brain !
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 3]: -- Philip !
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 4]: -- Philip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 22]: shrieked the poor woman ; `` do n't leave me -- do n't -- do n't -- pray do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 28]: During these exclamations the frantic widow had raised herself from the bed , and , at the last , had fallen into the arms of her son .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 8]: She remained there some minutes without motion .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 42]: After a time Philip felt alarmed at her long quiescence ; he laid her gently down upon the bed , and as he did so her head fell back -- her eyes were turned -- the widow Vanderdecken was no more .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 59]: Chapter II Philip Vanderdecken , strong as he was in mental courage , was almost paralysed by the shock when he discovered that his mother 's spirit had fled ; and for some time he remained by the side of the bed with his eyes fixed upon the corpse , and his mind in a state of vacuity .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 31]: Gradually he recovered himself ; he rose , smoothed down the pillow , closed her eyelids , and then clasping his hands , the tears trickled down his manly cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 22]: He impressed a solemn kiss upon the pale white forehead of the departed , and drew the curtains round the bed .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 5]: `` Poor mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 31]: said he , sorrowfully , as he completed his task , `` at length thou hast found rest , -- but thou hast left thy son a bitter legacy . ''
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 23]: And as Philip 's thoughts reverted to what had passed , the dreadful narrative whirled in his imagination and scathed his brain .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 31]: He raised his hands to his temples , compressed them with force , and tried to collect his thoughts , that he might decide upon what measures he should take .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 12]: He felt that he had no time to indulge his grief .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 14]: His mother was in peace : but his father -- where was he ?
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 14]: He recalled his mother 's words -- `` One hope alone remained . ''
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 5]: Then there was hope .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 16]: His father had laid a paper on the table -- could it be there now ?
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 18]: Yes , it must be ; his mother had not had the courage to take it up .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 18]: There was hope in that paper , and it had lain unopened for more than seventeen years .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 19]: Philip Vanderdecken resolved that he would examine the fatal chamber -- at once he would know the worst .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 11]: Should he do it now , or wait till daylight ?
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 9]: -- but the key , where was it ?
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 38]: His eyes rested upon an old japanned cabinet in the room : he had never seen his mother open it in his presence : it was the only likely place of concealment that he was aware of .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 18]: Prompt in all his decisions , he took up the candle , and proceeded to examine it .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 42]: It was not locked ; the doors swung open , and drawer after drawer was examined , but Philip discovered not the object of his search ; again and again did he open the drawers , but they were all empty .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 20]: It occurred to Philip that there might be secret drawers , and he examined for some time in vain .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 27]: At last he took out all the drawers , and laid them on the floor , and lifting the cabinet off its stand he shook it .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 18]: A rattling sound in one corner told him that in all probability the key was there concealed .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 15]: He renewed his attempts to discover how to gain it , but in vain .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 69]: Daylight now streamed through the casements , and Philip had not desisted from his attempts : at last , wearied out , he resolved to force the back panel of the cabinet ; he descended to the kitchen , and returned with a small chopping-knife and hammer , and was on his knees busily employed forcing out the panel , when a hand was placed upon his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 29]: Philip started ; he had been so occupied with his search and his wild chasing thoughts , that he had not heard the sound of an approaching footstep .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 24]: He looked up and beheld the Father Seysen , the priest of the little parish , with his eyes sternly fixed upon him .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 28]: The good man had been informed of the dangerous state of the widow Vanderdecken , and had risen at daylight to visit and afford her spiritual comfort .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 23]: `` How now , my son , '' said the priest : `` fearest thou not to disturb thy mother 's rest ?
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 15]: and wouldst thou pilfer and purloin even before she is in her grave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 32]: `` I fear not to disturb my mother 's rest , good father , '' replied Philip , rising on his feet , `` for she now rests with the blessed .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 7]: Neither do I pilfer or purloin .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 20]: It is not gold I seek , although if gold there were , that gold would now be mine .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 29]: I seek but a key , long hidden , I believe , within this secret drawer , the opening of which is a mystery beyond my art . ''
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 13]: `` Thy mother is no more , sayest thou , my son ?
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 12]: and dead without receiving the rites of our most holy church !
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 9]: Why didst thou not send for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 21]: `` She died , good father , suddenly -- most suddenly , in these arms , about two hours ago .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 20]: I fear not for her soul , although I can but grieve you were not at her side . ''
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 13]: The priest gently opened the curtains , and looked upon the corpse .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 23]: He sprinkled holy water on the bed , and for a short time his lips were seen to move in silent prayer .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 7]: He then turned round to Philip .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 9]: `` Why do I see thee thus employed ?
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 9]: and why so anxious to obtain that key ?
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 15]: A mother 's death should call forth filial tears and prayers for her repose .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 27]: Yet are thine eyes dry , and thou art employed upon an indifferent search while yet the tenement is warm which but now held her spirit .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 7]: This is not seemly , Philip .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 8]: What is the key thou seekest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 19]: `` Father , I have no time for tears -- no time to spare for grief or lamentation .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 16]: I have much to do and more to think of than thought can well embrace .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 11]: That I loved my mother , you know well . ''
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 10]: `` But the key thou seekest , Philip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 37]: `` Father , it is the key of a chamber which has not been unlocked for years , which I must -- will open ; even if -- '' `` If what , my son ? ''
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 13]: `` I was about to say what I should not have said .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 15]: Forgive me , Father ; I meant that I must search that chamber . ''
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 36]: `` I have long heard of that same chamber being closed ; and that thy mother would not explain wherefore , I know well , for I have asked her , and have been denied .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 31]: Nay , when , as in duty bound , I pressed the question , I found her reason was disordered by my importunity , and therefore I abandoned the attempt .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 24]: Some heavy weight was on thy mother 's mind , my son , yet would she never confess or trust it with me .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 15]: Tell me , before she died , hadst thou this secret from her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 9]: `` I had , most holy father . ''
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 16]: `` Wouldst thou not feel comfort if thou didst confide to me , my son ?
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 46]: I might advise -- assist -- '' `` Father , I would indeed -- I could confide it to thee , and ask for thy assistance -- I know 't is not from curious feeling thou wouldst have it , but from a better motive .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 31]: But of that which has been told it is not yet manifest -- whether it is as my poor mother says , or but the phantom of a heated brain .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 26]: Should it indeed be true , fain would I share the burthen with you -- yet little you might thank me for the heavy load .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 17]: But no -- at least not now -- it must not , can not be revealed .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 13]: I must do my work -- enter that hated room alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 6]: `` Fearest thou not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 7]: `` Father , I fear nothing .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 46]: I have a duty to perform -- a dreadful one , I grant ; but I pray thee , ask no more ; for , like my poor mother , I feel as if the probing of the wound would half unseat my reason . ''
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 10]: `` I will not press thee further , Philip .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 11]: The time may come when I may prove of service .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 41]: Farewell , my child ; but I pray thee to discontinue thy unseemly labour , for I must send in the neighbours to perform the duties to thy departed mother , whose soul I trust is with its God . ''
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 37]: The priest looked at Philip ; he perceived that his thoughts were elsewhere ; there was a vacancy and appearance of mental stupefaction , and as he turned away , the good man shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 28]: `` He is right , '' thought Philip , when once more alone ; and he took up the cabinet , and placed it upon the stand .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 23]: `` A few hours more can make no difference : I will lay me down , for my head is giddy . ''
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 38]: Philip went into the adjoining room , threw himself upon his bed , and in a few minutes was in a sleep as sound as that permitted to the wretch a few hours previous to his execution .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 19]: During his slumbers the neighbours had come in , and had prepared everything for the widow 's interment .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 26]: They had been careful not to wake the son , for they held as sacred the sleep of those who must wake up to sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 48]: Among others , soon after the hour of noon arrived Mynheer Poots ; he had been informed of the death of the widow , but having a spare hour , he thought he might as well call , as it would raise his charges by another guilder .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 29]: He first went into the room where the body lay , and from thence he proceeded to the chamber of Philip , and shook him by the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 15]: Philip awoke , and , sitting up , perceived the doctor standing by him .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 20]: `` Well , Mynheer Vanderdecken , '' commenced the unfeeling little man , `` so it 's all over .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 49]: I knew it would be so , and recollect you owe me now another guilder , and you promised faithfully to pay me ; altogether , with the potion , it will be three guilders and a half -- that is , provided you return my phial . ''
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 17]: Philip , who at first waking was confused , gradually recovered his senses during this address .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 32]: `` You shall have your three guilders and a half , and your phial to boot , Mr Poots , '' replied he , as he rose from off the bed .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 17]: `` Yes , yes ; I know you mean to pay me -- if you can .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 18]: But look you , Mynheer Philip , it may be some time before you sell the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 7]: You may not find a customer .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 25]: Now , I never wish to be hard upon people who have no money , and I 'll tell you what I 'll do .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 10]: There is a something on your mother 's neck .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 16]: It is of no value , none at all , but to a good Catholic .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 20]: To help you in your strait , I will take that thing , and then we shall be quits .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 16]: You will have paid me , and there will be an end of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 35]: Philip listened calmly : he knew to what the little miser had referred , -- the relic on his mother 's neck -- that very relic upon which his father swore the fatal oath .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 16]: He felt that millions of guilders would not have induced him to part with it .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 10]: `` Leave the house , '' answered he abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 5]: `` Leave it immediately .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 7]: Your money shall be paid . ''
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 81]: Now , Mynheer Poots , in the first place , knew that the setting of the relic , which was in a square frame of pure gold , was worth much more than the sum due to him : he also knew that a large price had been paid for the relic itself , and as at that time such a relic was considered very valuable , he had no doubt but that it would again fetch a considerable sum .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 57]: Tempted by the sight of it when he entered the chamber of death , he had taken it from the neck of the corpse , and it was then actually concealed in his bosom , so he replied -- `` My offer is a good one , Mynheer Philip , and you had better take it .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 8]: Of what use is such trash ? ''
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 15]: `` I tell you , no , '' cried Philip , in a rage .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 27]: `` Well , then , you will let me have it in my possession till I am paid , Mynheer Vanderdecken -- that is but fair .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 7]: I must not lose my money .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 22]: When you bring me my three guilders and a half and the phial , I will return it to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 8]: Philip 's indignation was now without bounds .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 16]: He seized Mynheer Poots by the collar , and threw him out of the door .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 24]: `` Away immediately , '' cried he , `` or by -- '' There was no occasion for Philip to finish the imprecation .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 28]: The doctor had hastened away with such alarm , that he fell down half the steps of the staircase , and was limping away across the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 33]: He almost wished that the relic had not been in his possession ; but his sudden retreat had prevented him , even if so inclined , from replacing it on the corpse .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 28]: The result of this conversation naturally turned Philip 's thoughts to the relic , and he went into his mother 's room to take possession of it .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 22]: He opened the curtains -- the corpse was laid out -- he put forth his hand to untie the black ribbon .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 5]: It was not there .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 4]: `` Gone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 3]: exclaimed Philip .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 12]: `` They hardly would have removed it -- never would -- .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 31]: It must be that villain Poots -- wretch ; but I will have it , even if he has swallowed it , though I tear him limb from limb ! ''
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 37]: Philip darted down the stairs , rushed out of the house , cleared the moat at one bound , and without coat or hat , flew away in the direction of the doctor 's lonely residence .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 21]: The neighbours saw him as he passed them like the wind ; they wondered , and they shook their heads .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 18]: Mynheer Poots was not more than half-way to his home , for he had hurt his ankle .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 40]: Apprehensive of what might possibly take place should his theft be discovered , he occasionally looked behind him ; at length , to his horror , he beheld Philip Vanderdecken at a distance bounding on in pursuit of him .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 88]: Frightened almost out of his senses , the wretched pilferer hardly knew how to act ; to stop and surrender up the stolen property was his first thought , but fear of Vanderdecken 's violence prevented him ; so he decided on taking to his heels , thus hoping to gain his house , and barricade himself in , by which means he would be in a condition to keep possession of what he had stolen , or at least make some terms ere he restored it .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 61]: Mynheer Poots had need to run fast , and so he did ; his thin legs bearing his shrivelled form rapidly over the ground ; but Philip , who , when he witnessed the doctor 's attempt to escape , was fully convinced that he was the culprit , redoubled his exertions , and rapidly came up with the chase .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 31]: When within a hundred yards of his own door , Mynheer Poots heard the bounding step of Philip gain upon him , and he sprang and leaped in his agony .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 36]: Nearer and nearer still the step , until at last he heard the very breathing of his pursuer , and Poots shrieked in his fear , like the hare in the jaws of the greyhound .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 57]: Philip was not a yard from him ; his arm was outstretched , when the miscreant dropped down paralysed with terror , and the impetus of Vanderdecken was so great that he passed over his body , tripped , and after trying in vain to recover his equilibrium , he fell and rolled over and over .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 15]: This saved the little doctor ; it was like the double of a hare .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 31]: In a second he was again on his legs , and before Philip could rise and again exert his speed , Poots had entered his door and bolted it within .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 38]: Philip was , however , determined to repossess the important treasure ; and as he panted , he cast his eyes around , to see if any means offered for his forcing his entrance into the house .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 50]: But as the habitation of the doctor was lonely , every precaution had been taken by him to render it secure against robbery ; the windows below were well barricaded and secured , and those on the upper story were too high for anyone to obtain admittance by them .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 32]: We must here observe , that although Mynheer Poots was , from his known abilities , in good practice , his reputation as a hard-hearted , unfeeling miser was well established .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 20]: No one was ever permitted to enter his threshold , nor , indeed , did any one feel inclined .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 26]: He was as isolated from his fellow-creatures as was his tenement , and was only to be seen in the chamber of disease and death .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 9]: What his establishment consisted of no one knew .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 76]: When he first settled in the neighbourhood , an old decrepit woman occasionally answered the knocks given at the door by those who required the doctor 's services ; but she had been buried some time , and , ever since , all calls at the door had been answered by Mynheer Poots in person , if he were at home , and if not , there was no reply to the most importunate summons .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 22]: It was then surmised that the old man lived entirely by himself , being too niggardly to pay for any assistance .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 43]: This Philip also imagined ; and as soon as he had recovered his breath , he began to devise some scheme by which he would be enabled not only to recover the stolen property , but also to wreak a dire revenge .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 22]: The door was strong , and not to be forced by any means which presented themselves to the eye of Vanderdecken .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 39]: For a few minutes he paused to consider , and as he reflected , so did his anger cool down , and he decided that it would be sufficient to recover his relic without having recourse to violence .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 22]: So he called out in a loud voice : -- `` Mynheer Poots , I know that you can hear me .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 42]: Give me back what you have taken , and I will do you no hurt ; but if you will not , you must take the consequence , for your life shall pay the forfeit before I leave this spot . ''
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 99]: This speech was indeed very plainly heard by Mynheer Poots , but the little miser had recovered from his fright , and , thinking himself secure , could not make up his mind to surrender the relic without a struggle ; so the doctor answered not , hoping that the patience of Philip would be exhausted , and that by some arrangement , such as the sacrifice of a few guilders , no small matter to one so needy as Philip , he would be able to secure what he was satisfied would sell at a high price .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 27]: Vanderdecken , finding that no answer was returned , indulged in strong invective , and then decided upon measures certainly in themselves by no means undecided .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 28]: There was part of a small stack of dry fodder standing not far from the house , and under the wall a pile of wood for firing .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 30]: With these Vanderdecken resolved upon setting fire to the house , and thus , if he did not gain his relic , he would at least obtain ample revenge .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 37]: He brought several armfuls of fodder and laid them at the door of the house , and upon that he piled the fagots and logs of wood , until the door was quite concealed by them .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 34]: He then procured a light from the steel , flint , and tinder , which every Dutchman carries in his pocket , and very soon he had fanned the pile into a flame .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 18]: The smoke ascended in columns up to the rafters of the roof while the fire raged below .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 27]: The door was ignited , and was adding to the fury of the flames , and Philip shouted with joy at the success of his attempt .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 30]: `` Now , miserable despoiler of the dead -- now , wretched thief , now you shall feel my vengeance , '' cried Philip , with a loud voice .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 25]: `` If you remain within , you perish in the flames ; if you attempt to come out you shall die by my hands .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 12]: Do you hear , Mynheer Poots -- do you hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 22]: Hardly had Philip concluded this address when the window of the upper floor furthest from the burning door was thrown open .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 86]: `` Ay , -- you come now to beg and to entreat ; but no -- no , '' cried Philip -- who stopped as he beheld at the window what seemed to be an apparition , for , instead of the wretched little miser , he beheld one of the loveliest forms Nature ever deigned to mould -- an angelic creature , of about sixteen or seventeen , who appeared calm and resolute in the midst of the danger by which she was threatened .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 48]: Her long black hair was braided and twined round her beautifully-formed head ; her eyes were large , intensely dark , yet soft ; her forehead high and white , her chin dimpled , her ruby lips arched and delicately fine , her nose small and straight .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 39]: A lovelier face could not be well imagined ; it reminded you of what the best of painters have sometimes , in their more fortunate moments , succeeded in embodying , when they would represent a beauteous saint .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 36]: And as the flames wreathed and the smoke burst out in columns and swept past the window , so might she have reminded you in her calmness of demeanour of some martyr at the stake .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 9]: `` What wouldst thou , violent young man ?
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 15]: Why are the inmates of this house to suffer death by your means ? ''
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 7]: said the maiden , with composure .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 33]: For a few seconds Philip gazed , and could make no reply ; then the thought seized him that , in his vengeance , he was about to sacrifice so much loveliness .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 92]: He forgot everything but her danger , and seizing one of the large poles which he had brought to feed the flame , he threw off and scattered in every direction the burning masses , until nothing was left which could hurt the building but the ignited door itself ; and this , which as yet -- for it was of thick oak plank -- had not suffered very material injury , he soon reduced , by beating it , with clods of earth , to a smoking and harmless state .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 18]: During these active measures on the part of Philip , the young maiden watched him in silence .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 13]: `` All is safe now , young lady , '' said Philip .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 14]: `` God forgive me that I should have risked a life so precious .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 12]: I thought but to wreak my vengeance upon Mynheer Poots . ''
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 15]: `` And what cause can Mynheer Poots have given for such dreadful vengeance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 5]: replied the maiden calmly .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 7]: `` What cause , young lady ?
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 22]: He came to my house -- despoiled the dead -- took from my mother 's corpse a relic beyond price . ''
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 5]: `` Despoiled the dead !
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 15]: -- he surely can not -- you must wrong him , young sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 5]: `` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 22]: It is the fact , lady , -- and that relic -- forgive me -- but that relic I must have .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 9]: You know not what depends upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 18]: `` Wait , young sir , '' replied the maiden ; `` I will soon return . ''
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 22]: Philip waited several minutes , lost in thought and admiration : so fair a creature in the house of Mynheer Poots !
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 5]: Who could she be ?
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 43]: While thus ruminating , he was accosted by the silver voice of the object of his reveries , who , leaning out of the window , held in her hand the black ribbon to which was attached the article so dearly coveted .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 59]: `` Here is your relic , sir , '' said the young female ; `` I regret much that my father should have done a deed which well might justify your anger : but here it is , '' continued she , dropping it down on the ground by Philip ; `` and now you may depart . ''
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 6]: `` Your father , maiden !
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 9]: can he be your _ father _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 15]: said Philip , forgetting to take up the relic which lay at his feet .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 36]: She would have retired from the window without reply , but Philip spoke again -- `` Stop , lady , stop one moment , until I beg your forgiveness for my wild , foolish act .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 57]: I swear by this sacred relic , '' continued he , taking it from the ground and raising it to his lips , `` that had I known that any unoffending person had been in this house , I would not have done the deed , and much do I rejoice that no harm hath happened .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 34]: But there is still danger , lady ; the door must be unbarred , and the jambs , which still are glowing , be extinguished , or the house may yet be burnt .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 28]: Fear not for your father , maiden , for had he done me a thousand times more wrong , you will protect each hair upon his head .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 12]: He knows me well enough to know I keep my word .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 17]: Allow me to repair the injury I have occasioned , and then I will depart . ''
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 20]: `` No , no ; do n't trust him , '' said Mynheer Poots , from within the chamber .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 42]: `` Yes , he may be trusted , '' replied the daughter ; `` and his services are much needed , for what could a poor weak girl like me , and a still weaker father , do in this strait ?
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 13]: Open the door , and let the house be made secure . ''
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 25]: The maiden then addressed Philip -- `` He shall open the door , sir , and I will thank you for your kind service .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 8]: I trust entirely to your promise . ''
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 33]: `` I never yet was known to break my word , maiden , '' replied Philip ; `` but let him be quick , for the flames are bursting out again . ''
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 20]: The door was opened by the trembling hands of Mynheer Poots , who then made a hasty retreat upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 11]: The truth of what Philip had said was then apparent .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 32]: Many were the buckets of water which he was obliged to fetch before the fire was subdued ; but during his exertions neither the daughter nor the father made their appearance .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 18]: When all was safe , Philip closed the door , and again looked up at the window .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 24]: The fair girl made her appearance , and Philip , with a low obeisance , assured her that there was then no danger .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 17]: `` I thank you , sir , '' replied she -- `` I thank you much .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 15]: Your conduct , although hasty at first , has yet been most considerate . ''
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 35]: `` Assure your father , maiden , that all animosity on my part hath ceased , and that in a few days I will call and satisfy the demand he hath against me . ''
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 41]: The window closed , and Philip , more excited , but with feelings altogether different from those with which he had set out , looked at it for a minute , and then bent his steps to his own cottage .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 36]: Chapter III The discovery of the beautiful daughter of Mynheer Poots had made a strong impression upon Philip Vanderdecken , and now he had another excitement to combine with those which already overcharged his bosom .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 26]: He arrived at his own house , went upstairs , and threw himself on the bed from which he had been roused by Mynheer Poots .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 79]: At first , he recalled to his mind the scene we have just described , painted in his imagination the portrait of the fair girl , her eyes , her expression , her silver voice , and the words which she had uttered ; but her pleasing image was soon chased away by the recollection that his mother 's corpse lay in the adjoining chamber , and that his father 's secret was hidden in the room below .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 52]: The funeral was to take place the next morning , and Philip , who , since his meeting with the daughter of Mynheer Poots , appeared even to himself not so anxious for immediate examination of the room , resolved that he would not open it until after the melancholy ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 38]: With this resolution he fell asleep ; and exhausted with bodily and mental excitement , he did not wake until the next morning , when he was summoned by the priest to assist at the funeral rites .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 37]: In an hour all was over ; the crowd dispersed , and Philip , returning to the cottage , bolted the door that he might not be interrupted , and felt happy that he was alone .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 32]: There is a feeling in our nature which will arise when we again find ourselves in the tenement where death has been , and all traces of it have been removed .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 30]: It is a feeling of satisfaction and relief at having rid ourselves of the memento of mortality , the silent evidence of the futility of our pursuits and anticipations .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 17]: We know that we must one day die , but we always wish to forget it .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 48]: The continual remembrance would be too great a check upon our mundane desires and wishes ; and although we are told that we ever should have futurity in our thoughts , we find that life is not to be enjoyed if we are not permitted occasional forgetfulness .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 23]: For who would plan what rarely he is permitted to execute , if each moment of the day he thought of death ?
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 19]: We either hope that we may live longer than others , or we forget that we may not .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 25]: If this buoyant feeling had not been planted in our nature , how little would the world have been improved even from the deluge !
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 20]: Philip walked into the room where his mother had lain one short hour before , and unwittingly felt relief .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 64]: Taking down the cabinet , he now recommenced his task ; the back panel was soon removed , and a secret drawer discovered ; he drew it out , and it contained what he presumed to be the object of his search , -- a large key with a slight coat of rust upon it , which came off upon its being handled .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 60]: Under the key was a paper , the writing on which was somewhat discoloured ; it was in his mother 's hand , and ran as follows : -- `` It is now two nights since a horrible event took place which has induced me to close the lower chamber , and my brain is still bursting with terror .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 29]: Should I not , during my lifetime , reveal what occurred , still this key will be required , as at my death the room will be opened .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 41]: When I rushed from it I hastened upstairs , and remained that night with my child ; the next morning I summoned up sufficient courage to go down , turn the key , and bring it up into my chamber .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 12]: It is now closed till I close my eyes in death .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 89]: No privation , no suffering , shall induce me to open it , although in the iron cupboard under the buffet farthest from the window , there is money sufficient for all my wants ; that money will remain there for my child , to whom , if I do not impart the fatal secret , he must be satisfied that it is one which it were better should be concealed , -- one so horrible as to induce me to take the steps which I now do .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 28]: The keys of the cupboards and buffets were , I think , lying on the table , or in my workbox , when I quitted the room .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 14]: There is a letter on the table , at least I think so .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 4]: It is sealed .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 21]: Let not the seal be broken but by my son , and not by him unless he knows the secret .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 28]: Let it be burnt by the priest , -- for it is cursed ; -- and even should my son know all that I do , oh !
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 27]: let him pause , -- let him reflect well before he breaks the seal , -- for ` twere better he should know NO MORE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 6]: `` Not know more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 13]: thought Philip , as his eyes were still fixed upon the paper .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 11]: `` Yes , but I must and will know more !
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 15]: so forgive me , dearest mother , if I waste no time in reflection .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 17]: It would be but time thrown away , when one is resolved as I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 32]: Philip pressed his lips to his mother 's signature , folded up the paper , and put it into his pocket ; then , taking the key , he proceeded downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 30]: It was about noon when Philip descended to open the chamber ; the sun shone bright , the sky was clear , and all without was cheerful and joyous .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 38]: The front door of the cottage being closed , there was not much light in the passage when Philip put the key into the lock of the long-closed door , and with some difficulty turned it round .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 58]: To say that when he pushed open the door he felt no alarm , would not be correct ; he did feel alarm , and his heart palpitated ; but he felt more than was requisite of determination to conquer that alarm , and to conquer more , should more be created by what he should behold .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 44]: He opened the door , but did not immediately enter the room : he paused where he stood , for he felt as if he was about to intrude into the retreat of a disembodied spirit , and that that spirit might reappear .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 29]: He waited a minute , for the effort of opening the door had taken away his breath , and , as he recovered himself , he looked within .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 52]: He could but imperfectly distinguish the objects in the chamber , but through the joints of the shutters there were three brilliant beams of sunshine forcing their way across the room , which at first induced him to recoil as if from something supernatural ; but a little reflection reassured him .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 44]: After about a minute 's pause , Philip went into the kitchen , lighted a candle , and , sighing deeply two or three times as if to relieve his heart , he summoned his resolution , and walked towards the fatal room .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 21]: He first stopped at the threshold , and , by the light of the candle , took a hasty survey .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 27]: All was still : and the table on which the letter had been left , being behind the door , was concealed by its being opened .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 14]: It must be done , thought Philip : and why not at once ?
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 26]: continued he , resuming his courage ; and , with a firm step , he walked into the room and went to unfasten the shutters .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 24]: If his hands trembled a little when he called to mind how supernaturally they had last been opened , it is not surprising .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 16]: We are but mortal , and we shrink from contact with aught beyond this life .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 89]: When the fastenings were removed and the shutters unfolded , a stream of light poured into the room so vivid as to dazzle his eyesight ; strange to say , this very light of a brilliant day overthrew the resolution of Philip more than the previous gloom and darkness had done ; and with the candle in his hand , he retreated hastily into the kitchen to re-summon his courage , and there he remained for some minutes , with his face covered , and in deep thought .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 59]: It is singular that his reveries at last ended by reverting to the fair daughter of Mynheer Poots , and her first appearance at the window ; and he felt as if the flood of light which had just driven him from the one , was not more impressive and startling than her enchanting form at the other .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 24]: His mind dwelling upon the beauteous vision appeared to restore Philip 's confidence ; he now rose and boldly walked into the room .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 25]: We shall not describe the objects it contained as they chanced to meet the eyes of Philip , but attempt a more lucid arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 36]: The room was about twelve or fourteen feet square , with but one window ; opposite to the door stood the chimney and fireplace , with a high buffet of dark wood on each side .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 23]: The floor of the room was not dirty , although about its upper parts spiders had run their cobwebs in every direction .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 40]: In the centre of the ceiling , hung a quicksilver globe , a common ornament in those days , but the major part of it had lost its brilliancy , the spiders ' webs enclosing it like a shroud .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 33]: Over the chimney piece were hung two or three drawings framed and glazed , but a dusty mildew was spotted over the glass , so that little of them could be distinguished .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 48]: In the centre of the mantel-piece was an image of the Virgin Mary , of pure silver , in a shrine of the same metal , but it was tarnished to the colour of bronze or iron ; some Indian figures stood on each side of it .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 102]: The glass doors of the buffets on each side of the chimney-piece were also so dimmed that little of what was within could be distinguished ; the light and heat which had been poured into the room , even for so short a time , had already gathered up the damp of many years , and it lay as a mist and mingled with the dust upon the panes of glass : still here and there a glittering of silver vessels could be discerned , for the glass doors had protected them from turning black , although much dimmed in lustre .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 24]: On the wall facing the window were other prints , in frames equally veiled in damp and cobwebs , and also two bird-cages .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 10]: The bird-cages Philip approached , and looked into them .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 63]: The occupants , of course , had long been dead ; but at the bottom of the cages was a small heap of yellow feathers , through which the little white bones of the skeletons were to be seen , proving that they had been brought from the Canary Isles ; and , at that period , such birds were highly valued .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 23]: Philip appeared to wish to examine everything before he sought that which he most dreaded , yet most wished , to find .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 21]: There were several chairs round the room : on one of them was some linen ; he took it up .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 16]: It was some that must have belonged to him when he was yet a child .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 54]: At last , Philip turned his eyes to the wall not yet examined -LRB- that opposite the chimney-piece -RRB- , through which the door was pierced , and behind the door as it lay open , he was to find the table , the couch , the workbox , and the FATAL LETTER .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 31]: As he turned round , his pulse , which had gradually recovered its regular motion , beat more quickly ; but he made the effort , and it was over .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 31]: At first he examined the walls , against which were hung swords and pistols of various sorts , but chiefly Asiatic bows and arrows , and other implements of destruction .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 32]: Philip 's eyes gradually descended upon the table , and little couch behind it , where his mother stated herself to have been seated when his father made his awful visit .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 18]: The workbox and all its implements were on the table , just as she had left them .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 22]: The keys she mentioned were also lying there , but Philip looked , and looked again ; there was no letter .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 30]: He now advanced nearer , examined closely -- there was none that he could perceive , either on the couch or on the table -- or on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 15]: He lifted up the workbox to ascertain if it was beneath -- but no .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 12]: He examined among its contents , but no letter was there .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 19]: He turned over the pillows of the couch , but still there was no letter to be found .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 17]: And Philip felt as if there had been a heavy load removed from his panting chest .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 28]: `` Surely , then , '' thought he , as he leant against the wall , `` this must have been the vision of a heated imagination .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 14]: My poor mother must have fallen asleep , and dreamt this horrid tale .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 12]: I thought it was impossible , at least I hoped so .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 29]: It must have been as I suppose ; the dream was too powerful , too like a fearful reality , partially unseated my poor mother 's reason . ''
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 14]: Philip reflected again , and was then satisfied that his suppositions were correct .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 13]: `` Yes , it must have been so , poor dear mother !
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 6]: how much thou hast suffered !
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 11]: but thou art now rewarded , and with God . ''
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 68]: After a few minutes -LRB- during which he surveyed the room again and again with more coolness , and perhaps some indifference , now that he regarded the supernatural history as not true -RRB- , Philip took out of his pocket the written paper found with the key , and read it over -- `` The iron cupboard under the buffet farthest from the window . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 5]: 'T is well . ''
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 26]: He took the bunch of keys from off the table , and soon fitted one to the outside wooden doors which concealed the iron safe .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 43]: A second key on the bunch opened the iron doors ; and Philip found himself in possession of a considerable sum of money , amounting , as near as he could reckon , to ten thousand guilders , in little yellow sacks .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 6]: `` My poor mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 25]: thought he ; `` and has a mere dream scared thee to penury and want , with all this wealth in thy possession ? ''
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 30]: Philip replaced the sacks , and locked up the cupboards , after having taken out of one , already half emptied , a few pieces for his immediate wants .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 37]: His attention was next directed to the buffets above , which , with one of the keys , he opened ; he found that they contained china , silver flagons , and cups of considerable value .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 16]: The locks were again turned , and the bunch of keys thrown upon the table .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 51]: The sudden possession of so much wealth added to the conviction , to which Philip had now arrived , that there had been no supernatural appearance , as supposed by his mother , naturally revived and composed his spirits ; and he felt a reaction which amounted almost to hilarity .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 48]: Seating himself on the couch , he was soon in a reverie , and as before , reverted to the lovely daughter of Mynheer Poots , indulging in various castle-buildings , all ending , as usual , when we choose for ourselves , in competence and felicity .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 26]: In this pleasing occupation he remained for more than two hours , when his thoughts again reverted to his poor mother and her fearful death .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 7]: `` Dearest , kindest mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 51]: apostrophised Philip aloud , as he rose from his leaning position , `` here thou wert , tired with watching over my infant slumbers , thinking of my absent father and his dangers , working up thy mind and anticipating evil , till thy fevered sleep conjured up this apparition .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 40]: Yes , it must have been so , for see here , lying on the floor , is the embroidery , as it fell from thy unconscious hands , and with that labour ceased thy happiness in this life .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 6]: Dear , dear mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 33]: continued he , a tear rolling down his cheek as he stooped to pick up the piece of muslin , `` how much hast thou suffered when -- God of Heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 68]: exclaimed Philip , as he lifted up the embroidery , starting back with violence , and overturning the table , `` God of Heaven and of Judgment , there is -- there _ is _ , '' and Philip clasped his hands , and bowed his head in awe and anguish , as in a changed and fearful tone he muttered forth -- `` the LETTER ! ''
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 21]: It was but too true , -- underneath the embroidery on the floor had lain the fatal letter of Vanderdecken .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 110]: Had Philip seen it on the table when he first went into the room , and was prepared to find it , he would have taken it up with some degree of composure ; but to find it now , when he had persuaded himself that it was all an illusion on the part of his mother ; when he had made up his mind that there had been no supernatural agency ; after he had been indulging in visions of future bliss and repose , was a shock that transfixed him where he stood , and for some time he remained in his attitude of surprise and terror .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 36]: Down at once fell the airy fabric of happiness which he had built up during the last two hours ; and as he gradually recovered from his alarm , his heart filled with melancholy forebodings .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 18]: At last he dashed forward , seized the letter , and burst out of the fatal room .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 41]: `` I can not , dare not , read it here , '' exclaimed he : `` no , no , it must be under the vault of high and offended Heaven , that the message must be received . ''
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 32]: Philip took his hat , and went out of the house ; in calm despair he locked the door , took out the key , and walked he knew not whither .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 122]: Chapter IV If the reader can imagine the feelings of a man who , sentenced to death , and having resigned himself to his fate , finds himself unexpectedly reprieved ; who , having recomposed his mind after the agitation arising from a renewal of those hopes and expectations which he had abandoned , once more dwells upon future prospects , and indulges in pleasing anticipations : we say , that if the reader can imagine this , and then what would be that man 's feelings when he finds that the reprieve is revoked , and that he is to suffer , he may then form some idea of the state of Philip 's mind when he quitted the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 24]: Long did he walk , careless in which direction , with the letter in his clenched hand , and his teeth firmly set .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 50]: Gradually he became more composed : and out of breath with the rapidity of his motion , he sat down upon a bank , and there he long remained , with his eyes riveted upon the dreaded paper , which he held with both his hands upon his knees .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 12]: Mechanically he turned the letter over ; the seal was black .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 3]: Philip sighed .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 22]: -- `` I can not read it now , '' thought he , and he rose and continued his devious way .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 20]: For another half-hour did Philip keep in motion , and the sun was not many degrees above the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 11]: Philip stopped and looked at it till his vision failed .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 23]: `` I could imagine that it was the eye of God , '' thought Philip , `` and perhaps it may be .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 22]: Why then , merciful Creator , am I thus selected from so many millions to fulfil so dire a task ? ''
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 32]: Philip looked about him for some spot where he might be concealed from observation -- where he might break the seal , and read this mission from a world of spirits .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 22]: A small copse of brushwood , in advance of a grove of trees , was not far from where he stood .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 18]: He walked to it , and sat down , so as to be concealed from any passers-by .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 18]: Philip once more looked at the descending orb of day , and by degrees he became composed .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 23]: `` It is thy will , '' exclaimed he ; `` it is my fate , and both must be accomplished . ''
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 38]: Philip put his hand to the seal , -- his blood thrilled when he called to mind that it had been delivered by no mortal hand , and that it contained the secret of one in judgment .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 44]: He remembered that that one was his father ; and that it was only in the letter that there was hope , -- hope for his poor father , whose memory he had been taught to love , and who appealed for help .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 14]: `` Coward that I am , to have lost so many hours ! ''
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 22]: exclaimed Philip ; `` yon sun appears as if waiting on the hill , to give me light to read . ''
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 14]: Philip mused a short time ; he was once more the daring Vanderdecken .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 26]: Calmly he broke the seal , which bore the initials of his father 's name , and read as follows : -- `` To CATHERINE .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 30]: `` One of those pitying spirits whose eyes rain tears for mortal crimes has been permitted to inform me by what means alone my dreadful doom may be averted .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 48]: `` Could I but receive on the deck of my own ship the holy relic upon which I swore the fatal oath , kiss it in all humility , and shed one tear of deep contrition on the sacred wood , I then might rest in peace .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 22]: `` How this may be effected , or by whom so fatal a task will be undertaken , I know not .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 21]: O Catherine , we have a son -- but , no , no , let him not hear of me .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 9]: Pray for me , and now , farewell .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 5]: `` I. VANDERDECKEN . ''
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 25]: `` Then it is true , most horribly true , '' thought Philip ; `` and my father is even now IN LIVING JUDGMENT .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 12]: And he points to me -- to whom else should he ?
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 13]: Am I not his son , and is it not my duty ?
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 25]: `` Yes , father , '' exclaimed Philip aloud , falling on his knees , `` you have not written these lines in vain .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 8]: Let me peruse them once more . ''
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 30]: Philip raised up his hand ; but although it appeared to him that he had still hold of the letter , it was not there -- he grasped nothing .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 24]: He looked on the grass to see if it had fallen -- but no , there was no letter , it had disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 5]: Was it a vision ?
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 11]: -- no , no , he had read every word .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 18]: `` Then it must be to me , and me alone , that the mission was intended .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 5]: I accept the sign .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 45]: `` Hear me , dear father , -- if thou art so permitted , -- and deign to hear me , gracious Heaven -- hear the son who , by this sacred relic , swears that he will avert your doom , or perish .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 22]: To that will he devote his days ; and having done his duty , he will die in hope and peace .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 36]: Heaven , that recorded my rash father 's oath , now register his son 's upon the same sacred cross , and may perjury on my part be visited with punishment more dire than his !
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 24]: Receive it , Heaven , as at the last I trust that in thy mercy thou wilt receive the father and the son !
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 11]: and if too bold , O pardon my presumption . ''
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 16]: Philip threw himself forward on his face , with his lips to the sacred symbol .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 32]: The sun went down , and twilight gradually disappeared ; night had , for some time , shrouded all in darkness , and Philip yet remained in alternate prayer and meditation .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 27]: But he was disturbed by the voices of some men , who sat down upon the turf but a few yards from where he was concealed .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 63]: The conversation he little heeded ; but it had roused him , and his first feeling was to return to the cottage , that he might reflect over his plans ; but although the men spoke in a low tone , his attention was soon arrested by the subject of their conversation , when he heard the name mentioned of Mynheer Poots .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 38]: He listened attentively , and discovered that they were four disbanded soldiers , who intended that night to attack the house of the little doctor , who had , they knew , much money in his possession .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 27]: `` What I have proposed is the best , '' said one of them ; `` he has no one with him but his daughter . ''
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 34]: `` I value her more than his money , '' replied another ; `` so , recollect before we go , it is perfectly understood that she is to be my property . ''
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 20]: `` Yes , if you choose to purchase her , there 's no objection , '' replied a third .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 16]: `` Agreed ; how much will you in conscience ask for a puling girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 11]: `` I say five hundred guilders , '' replied another .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 41]: `` Well , be it so , but on this condition , that if my share of the booty does not amount to so much , I am to have her for my share , whatever it may be . ''
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 36]: `` That 's very fair , '' replied the other ; `` but I 'm much mistaken if we do n't turn more than two thousand guilders out of the old man 's chest . ''
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 17]: `` What do you two say -- is it agreed -- shall Baetens have her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 9]: `` O yes , '' replied the others .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 29]: `` Well , then , '' replied the one who had stipulated for Mynheer Poots ' daughter , `` now I am with you , heart and soul .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 39]: I loved that girl , and tried to get her , -- I positively offered to marry her , but the old hunks refused me , an ensign , an officer ; but now I 'll have revenge .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 7]: We must not spare him . ''
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 10]: `` No , no , '' replied the others .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 13]: `` Shall we go now , or wait till it is later ?
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 18]: In an hour or more the moon will be up , -- we may be seen . ''
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 7]: `` Who is to see us ?
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 11]: unless , indeed , some one is sent for him .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 9]: The later the better , I say . ''
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 11]: `` How long will it take us to get there ?
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 9]: Not half an hour , if we walk .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 22]: Suppose we start in half an hour hence , we shall just have the moon to count the guilders by . ''
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 6]: `` That 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 19]: In the meantime I 'll put a new flint in my lock , and have my carbine loaded .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 8]: I can work in the dark . ''
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 31]: `` You are used to it , Jan. '' `` Yes , I am , -- and I intend this ball to go through the old rascal 's head . ''
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 38]: `` Well , I 'd rather you should kill him than I , '' replied one of the others , `` for he saved my life at Middleburgh , when everyone made sure I 'd die . ''
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 41]: Philip did not wait to hear any more ; he crawled behind the bushes until he gained the grove of trees , and passing through them , made a detour , so as not to be seen by these miscreants .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 18]: That they were disbanded soldiers , many of whom were infesting the country , he knew well .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 37]: All his thoughts were now to save the old doctor and his daughter from the danger which threatened them ; and for a time he forgot his father , and the exciting revelations of the day .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 76]: Although Philip had not been aware in what direction he had walked when he set off from the cottage , he knew the country well ; and now that it was necessary to act , he remembered the direction in which he should find the lonely house of Mynheer Poots : with the utmost speed he made his way for it , and in less than twenty minutes he arrived there , out of breath .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 12]: As usual , all was silent , and the door fastened .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 9]: Philip knocked , but there was no reply .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 10]: Again and again he knocked , and became impatient .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 26]: Mynheer Poots must have been summoned , and was not in the house ; Philip therefore called out , so as to be heard within .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 29]: `` Maiden , if your father is out , as I presume he must be , listen to what I have to say -- I am Philip Vanderdecken .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 21]: But now I overheard four wretches who have planned to murder your father , and rob him of his gold .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 25]: In one hour or less they will be here , and I have hastened to warn and to protect you , if I may .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 20]: I swear upon the relic that you delivered to me this morning that what I state is true . ''
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 11]: Philip waited a short time , but received no answer .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 31]: `` Maiden , '' resumed he , `` answer me , if you value that which is more dear to you , than even your father 's gold to him .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 14]: Open the casement above , and listen to what I have to say .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 23]: In so doing there is no risk ; and even if it were not dark , already have I seen you . ''
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 38]: A short time after this second address , the casement of the upper window was unbarred , and the slight form of the fair daughter of Mynheer Poots was to be distinguished by Philip through the gloom .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 13]: `` What wouldst thou , young sir , at this unseemly hour ?
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 24]: and what is it thou wouldst impart , but imperfectly heard by me , when thou spokest this minute at the door ? ''
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 28]: Philip then entered into a detail of all that he had overheard , and concluded by begging her to admit him , that he might defend her .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 13]: `` Think , fair maiden , of what I have told you .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 20]: You have been sold to one of those reprobates , whose name I think they mentioned , was Baetens .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 37]: The gold , I know , you value not ; but think of thine own dear self -- suffer me to enter the house , and think not for one moment that my story 's feigned .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 29]: I swear to thee , by the soul of my poor dear mother , now , I trust , in heaven , that every word is true . ''
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 9]: `` Baetens , said you , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 20]: `` If I mistook them not , such was the name ; he said he loved you once . ''
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 37]: `` That name I have in memory -- I know not what to do or what to say -- my father has been summoned to a birth , and may be yet away for many hours .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 22]: Yet how can I open the door to you -- at night -- he is not at home -- I alone ?
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 13]: I ought not -- can not -- yet do I believe you .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 14]: You surely never could be so base as to invent this tale . ''
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 15]: `` No -- upon my hopes of future bliss I could not , maiden !
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 16]: You must not trifle with your life and honour , but let me in . ''
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 14]: `` And if I did , what could you do against such numbers ?
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 20]: They are four to one -- would soon overpower you , and one more life would be lost . ''
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 19]: `` Not if you have arms ; and I think your father would not be left without them .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 13]: I fear them not -- you know that I am resolute . ''
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 18]: `` I do indeed -- and now you 'd risk your life for those you did assail .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 18]: I thank you -- thank you kindly , sir -- but dare not open the door . ''
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 58]: `` Then , maiden , if you 'll not admit me , here will I now remain ; without arms , and but ill able to contend with four armed villains ; but still , here will I remain and prove my truth to one I will protect against any odds -- yes , even here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 8]: `` Then shall I be thy murderer !
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 7]: -- but that must not be .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 26]: sir -- swear , swear by all that 's holy , and by all that 's pure , that you do not deceive me . ''
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 16]: `` I swear by thyself , maiden , than all to me more sacred ! ''
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 14]: The casement closed , and in a short time a light appeared above .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 20]: In a minute or two more the door was opened to Philip by the fair daughter of Mynheer Poots .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 26]: She stood with the candle in her right hand , the colour in her cheeks varying -- now flushing red , and again deadly pale .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 19]: Her left hand was down by her side , and in it she held a pistol half concealed .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 20]: Philip perceived this precaution on her part but took no notice of it ; he wished to reassure her .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 4]: `` Maiden ! ''
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 46]: said he , not entering , `` if you still have doubts -- if you think you have been ill-advised in giving me admission -- there is yet time to close the door against me : but for your own sake I entreat you not .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 12]: Before the moon is up , the robbers will be here .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 15]: With my life I will protect you , if you will but trust me .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 9]: Who indeed could injure one like you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 40]: She was indeed -LRB- as she stood irresolute and perplexed from the peculiarity of her situation , yet not wanting in courage when , it was to be called forth -RRB- an object well worthy of gaze and admiration .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 41]: Her features thrown into broad light and shade by the candle which at times was half extinguished by the wind -- her symmetry of form and the gracefulness and singularity of her attire -- were matter of astonishment to Philip .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 53]: Her head was without covering , and her long hair fell in plaits behind her shoulders ; her stature was rather under the middle size , but her form perfect ; her dress was simple but becoming , and very different from that usually worn by the young women of the district .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 27]: Not only her features but her dress would at once have indicated to a traveller that she was of Arab blood , as was the fact .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 46]: She looked in Philip 's face as she spoke -- earnestly , as if she would have penetrated into his inmost thoughts ; but there was a frankness and honesty in his bearing , and a sincerity in his manly countenance , which reassured her .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 23]: After a moment 's hesitation she replied -- `` Come in , sir ; I feel that I can trust you . ''
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 3]: Philip entered .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 9]: The door was then closed and made secure .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 31]: `` We have no time to lose , maiden , '' said Philip : `` but tell me your name , that I may address you as I ought . ''
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 14]: `` My name is Amine , '' replied she , retreating a little .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 15]: `` I thank you for that little confidence ; but I must not dally .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 14]: What arms have you in the house , and have you ammunition ? ''
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 3]: `` Both .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 10]: I wish that my father would come home . ''
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 69]: `` And so do I , '' replied Philip , `` devoutly wish he would , before these murderers come ; but not , I trust , while the attack is making , for there 's a carbine loaded expressly for his head , and if they make him prisoner , they will not spare his life , unless his gold and your person are given in ransom .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 11]: But the arms , maiden -- where are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 19]: `` Follow me , '' replied Amine , leading Philip to an inner room on the upper floor .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 21]: It was the sanctum of her father , and was surrounded with shelves filled with bottles and boxes of drugs .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 21]: In one corner was an iron chest , and over the mantel-piece were a brace of carbines and three pistols .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 29]: `` They are all loaded , '' observed Amine , pointing to them , and laying on the table the one which she had held in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 12]: Philip took down the arms , and examined all the primings .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 21]: He then took up from the table the pistol which Amine had laid there , and threw open the pan .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 6]: It was equally well prepared .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 22]: Philip closed the pan , and with a smile observed , `` So this was meant for me , Amine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 18]: `` No -- not for you -- but for a traitor , had one gained admittance . ''
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 29]: `` Now , maiden , '' observed Philip , `` I shall station myself at the casement which you opened , but without a light in the room .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 15]: You may remain here , and can turn the key for your security . ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 10]: `` You little know me , '' replied Amine .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 31]: `` In that way at least I am not fearful ; I must remain near you and reload the arms -- a task in which I am well practised . ''
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 16]: `` No , no , '' replied Philip ; `` you might be hurt . ''
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 4]: `` I may .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 21]: But think you I will remain here idly , when I can assist one who risks his life for me ?
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 14]: I know my duty , sir , and I shall perform it . ''
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 31]: `` You must not risk your life , Amine , '' replied Philip ; `` my aim will not be steady , if I know that you 're in danger .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 18]: But I must take the arms into the other chamber , for the time is come . ''
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 28]: Philip , assisted by Amine , carried the carbines and pistols into the adjoining chamber ; and Amine then left Philip , carrying with her the light .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 32]: Philip , as soon as he was alone , opened the casement and looked out -- there was no one to be seen ; he listened , but all was silent .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 35]: The moon was just rising above the distant hill , but her light was dimmed by fleecy clouds , and Philip watched for a few minutes ; at length he heard a whispering below .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 24]: He looked out , and could distinguish through the dark the four expected assailants , standing close to the door of the house .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 25]: He walked away softly from the window , and went into the next room to Amine , whom he found busy preparing the ammunition .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 12]: `` Amine , they are at the door , in consultation .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 9]: You can see them now , without risk .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 17]: I thank them , for they will convince you that I have told the truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 17]: Amine , without reply , went into the front room and looked out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 24]: She returned , and laying her hand upon Philip 's arm , she said -- `` Grant me your pardon for my doubts .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 19]: I fear nothing now but that my father may return too soon , and they seize him . ''
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 11]: Philip left the room again , to make his reconnaissance .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 27]: The robbers did not appear to have made up their mind -- the strength of the door defied their utmost efforts , so they attempted stratagem .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 45]: They knocked , and as there was no reply , they continued to knock louder and louder : not meeting with success they held another consultation , and the muzzle of a carbine was then put to the keyhole , and the piece discharged .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 28]: The lock of the door was blown off , but the iron bars which crossed the door within , above and below , still held it fast .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 58]: Although Philip would have been justified in firing upon the robbers when he first perceived them in consultation at the door , still there is that feeling in a generous mind which prevents the taking away of life , except from stern necessity ; and this feeling made him withhold his fire until hostilities had actually commenced .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 39]: He now levelled one of the carbines at the head of the robber nearest to the door , who was busy examining the effect which the discharge of the piece had made , and what further obstacles intervened .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 23]: The aim was true , and the man fell dead , while the others started back with surprise at the unexpected retaliation .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 45]: But in a second or two a pistol was discharged at Philip , who still remained leaning out of the casement , fortunately without effect ; and the next moment he felt himself drawn away , so as to be protected from their fire .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 17]: It was Amine , who , unknown to Philip , had been standing by his side .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 18]: `` You must not expose yourself , Philip , '' said she , in a low tone .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 13]: She called me Philip , thought he , but made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 16]: `` They will be watching for you at the casement now , '' said Amine .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 13]: `` Take the other carbine , and go below in the passage .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 23]: If the lock of the door is blown off , they may put their arms in perhaps , and remove the bars .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 34]: I do not think they can , but I 'm not sure ; at all events , it is there you should now be , as there they will not expect you . ''
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 12]: `` You are right , '' replied Philip , going down .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 36]: `` But you must not fire more than once there ; if another fall , there will be but two to deal with , and they can not watch the casement and force admittance to .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 9]: Go -- I will reload the carbine . ''
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 8]: Philip descended softly and without a light .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 41]: He went up to the door and perceived that one of the miscreants , with his arms through the hole where the lock was blown off , was working at the upper iron bar , which he could just reach .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 36]: He presented his carbine , and was about to fire the whole charge into the body of the man under his raised arm , when there was a report of fire-arms from the robbers outside .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 17]: `` Amine has exposed herself , '' thought Philip , `` and may be hurt . ''
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 31]: The desire of vengeance prompted him first to fire his piece through the man 's body , and then he flew up the stairs to ascertain the state of Amine .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 22]: She was not at the casement ; he darted into the inner room , and found her deliberately loading the carbine .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 4]: `` My God !
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 7]: how you frightened me , Amine .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 15]: I thought by their firing that you had shown yourself at the window . ''
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 60]: `` Indeed I did not ; but I thought that when you fired through the door they might return your fire , and you be hurt ; so I went to the side of the casement and pushed out on a stick some of my father 's clothes , and they who were watching for you fired immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 5]: `` Indeed , Amine !
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 17]: who could have expected such courage and such coolness in one so young and beautiful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 6]: exclaimed Philip , with surprise .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 11]: `` Are none but ill-favoured people brave , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 5]: replied Amine , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 15]: `` I did not mean that , Amine -- but I am losing time .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 7]: I must to the door again .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 10]: Give me that carbine , and reload this . ''
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 26]: Philip crept downstairs that he might reconnoitre , but before he had gained the door he heard at a distance the voice of Mynheer Poots .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 22]: Amine , who also heard it , was in a moment at his side with a loaded pistol in each hand .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 30]: `` Fear not , Amine , '' said Philip , as he unbarred the door , `` there are but two , and your father shall be saved . ''
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 52]: The door was opened , and Philip , seizing his carbine , rushed out ; he found Mynheer Poots on the ground between the two men , one of whom had raised his knife to plunge it into his body , when the ball of the carbine whizzed through his head .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 38]: The last of the robbers closed with Philip , and a desperate struggle ensued ; it was , however , soon decided by Amine stepping forward and firing one of the pistols through the robber 's body .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 28]: We must here inform our readers that Mynheer Poots , when coming home , had heard the report of fire-arms in the direction of his own house .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 49]: The recollection of his daughter and of his money -- for to do him justice he did love her best -- had lent him wings ; he forgot that he was a feeble old man and without arms ; all he thought of was to gain his habitation .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 39]: On he came , reckless , frantic , and shouting , and rushed into the arms of the two robbers , who seized and would have despatched him , had not Philip so opportunely come to his assistance .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 40]: As soon as the last robber fell , Philip disengaged himself and went to the assistance of Mynheer Poots , whom he raised up in his arms , and carried into the house as if he were an infant .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 16]: The old man was still in a state of delirium from fear and previous excitement .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 10]: In a few minutes Mynheer Poots was more coherent .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 5]: `` My daughter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 7]: exclaimed he -- `` my daughter !
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 5]: where is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 14]: `` She is here , father , and safe , '' replied Amine .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 15]: my child is safe , '' said he , opening his eyes and staring .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 21]: `` Yes , it is even so -- and my money -- my money -- where is my money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 6]: continued he , starting up .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 7]: `` Quite safe , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 15]: `` Quite safe -- you say quite safe -- are you sure of it ?
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 6]: -- let me see . ''
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 27]: `` There it is , father , as you may perceive , quite safe -- thanks to one whom you have not treated so well . ''
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 8]: `` Who -- what do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 42]: -- Ah , yes , I see him now -- 't is Philip Vanderdecken -- he owes me three guilders and a half , and there is a phial -- did he save you -- and my money , child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 14]: `` He did , indeed , at the risk of his life . ''
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 36]: `` Well , well , I will forgive him the whole debt -- yes , the whole of it ; but -- the phial is of no use to him -- he must return that .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 6]: Give me some water . ''
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 14]: It was some time before the old man could regain his perfect reason .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 27]: Philip left him with his daughter , and , taking a brace of loaded pistols , went out to ascertain the fate of the four assailants .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 30]: The moon having climbed above the banks of clouds which had obscured her , was now high in the heavens , shining bright , and he could distinguish clearly .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 14]: The two men lying across the threshold of the door were quite dead .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 24]: The others , who had seized upon Mynheer Poots , were still alive , but one was expiring and the other bled fast .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 49]: Philip put a few questions to the latter , but he either would not or could not make any reply ; he removed their weapons and returned to the house , where he found the old man attended by his daughter , in a state of comparative composure .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 13]: `` I thank you , Philip Vanderdecken -- I thank you much .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 23]: You have saved my dear child , and my money -- that is little , very little -- for I am poor .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 8]: May you live long and happily ! ''
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 35]: Philip mused ; the letter and his vow were , for the first time since he fell in with the robbers , recalled to his recollection , and a shade passed over his countenance .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 21]: `` Long and happily -- no , no , '' muttered he , with an involuntary shake of the head .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 18]: `` And I must thank you , '' said Amine , looking inquiringly in Philip 's face .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 12]: `` O , how much have I to thank you for !
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 8]: -- and indeed I am grateful . ''
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 25]: `` Yes , yes , she is very grateful , '' interrupted the old man ; `` but we are poor -- very poor .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 44]: I talked about my money because I have so little , and I can not afford to lose it ; but you shall not pay me the three guilders and a half -- I am content to lose that , Mr Philip . ''
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 11]: `` Why should you lose even that , Mynheer Poots ?
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 13]: -- I promised to pay you , and will keep my word .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 20]: I have plenty of money -- thousands of guilders , and know not what to do with them . ''
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 10]: `` You -- you -- thousands of guilders ! ''
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 3]: exclaimed Poots .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 11]: `` Pooh , nonsense , that wo n't do . ''
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 31]: `` I repeat to you , Amine , '' said Philip , `` that I have thousands of guilders : you know I would not tell you a falsehood . ''
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 16]: `` I believed you when you said so to my father , '' replied Amine .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 39]: `` Then perhaps , as you have so much , and I am so very poor , Mr Vanderdecken -- '' But Amine put her hand upon her father 's lips , and the sentence was not finished .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 15]: `` Father , '' said Amine , `` it is time that we retire .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 10]: You must leave us for to-night , Philip . ''
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 22]: `` I will not , '' replied Philip ; `` nor , you may depend upon it , will I sleep .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 8]: You may both to bed in safety .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 13]: It is indeed time that you retire -- good-night , Mynheer Poots .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 18]: I will but ask a lamp , and then I leave you -- Amine , good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 19]: `` Good-night , '' said Amine , extending her hand , `` and many , many thanks . ''
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 6]: `` Thousands of guilders ! ''
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 14]: muttered the old man , as Philip left the room and went below .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 54]: Chapter V Philip Vanderdecken sat down at the porch of the door ; he swept his hair from his forehead , which he exposed to the fanning of the breeze ; for the continued excitement of the last three days had left a fever on his brain which made him restless and confused .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 16]: He longed for repose , but he knew that for him there was no rest .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 34]: He had his forebodings -- he perceived in the vista of futurity a long-continued chain of danger and disaster , even to death ; yet he beheld it without emotion and without dread .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 24]: He felt as if it were only three days that he had begun to exist ; he was melancholy , but not unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 45]: His thoughts were constantly recurring to the fatal letter -- its strange supernatural disappearance seemed pointedly to establish its supernatural origin , and that the mission had been intended for him alone ; and the relic in his possession more fully substantiated the fact .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 11]: It is my fate , my duty , thought Philip .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 28]: Having satisfactorily made up his mind to these conclusions , his thoughts reverted to the beauty , the courage , and presence of mind shown by Amine .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 28]: And , thought he , as he watched the moon soaring high in the heavens , is this fair creature 's destiny to be interwoven with mine ?
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 13]: The events of the last three days would almost warrant the supposition .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 11]: Heaven only knows , and Heaven 's will be done .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 32]: I have vowed , and my vow is registered , that I will devote my life to the release of my unfortunate father -- but does that prevent my loving Amine ?
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 26]: -- No , no ; the sailor on the Indian seas must pass months and months on shore before he can return to his duty .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 16]: My search must be on the broad ocean , but how often may I return ?
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 14]: and why am I to be debarred the solace of a smiling hearth ?
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 50]: -- and yet -- do I right in winning the affections of one who , if she loves , would , I am convinced , love so dearly , fondly , truly -- ought I to persuade her to mate herself with one whose life will be so precarious ?
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 26]: but is not every sailor 's life precarious , daring the angry waves , with but an inch of plank ` tween him and death ?
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 29]: Besides , I am chosen to fulfil a task -- and if so , what can hurt me , till in Heaven 's own time it is accomplished ?
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 12]: but then how soon , and how is it to end ?
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 3]: in death !
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 13]: I wish my blood were cooler , that I might reason better .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 19]: Such were the meditations of Philip Vanderdecken , and long did he revolve such chances in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 27]: At last the day dawned , and as he perceived the blush upon the horizon , less careful of his watch he slumbered where he sat .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 18]: A slight pressure on the shoulder made him start up and draw the pistol from his bosom .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 7]: He turned round and beheld Amine .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 24]: `` And that pistol was intended for me , '' said Amine , smiling , repeating Philip 's words of the night before .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 6]: `` For you , Amine ?
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 16]: -- yes , to defend you , if ` twere necessary , once more . ''
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 22]: `` I know it would -- how kind of you to watch this tedious night after so much exertion and fatigue !
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 8]: but it is now broad day . ''
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 16]: `` Until I saw the dawn , Amine , I kept a faithful watch . ''
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 9]: `` But now retire and take some rest .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 14]: My father is risen -- you can lie down on his bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 13]: `` I thank you , but I feel no wish for sleep .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 6]: There is much to do .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 24]: We must to the burgomaster and state the facts , and these bodies must remain where they are until the whole is known .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 12]: Will your father go , Amine , or shall I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 17]: `` My father surely is the more proper person , as the proprietor of the house .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 17]: You must remain ; and if you will not sleep , you must take some refreshment .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 19]: I will go in and tell my father ; he has already taken his morning 's meal . ''
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 20]: Amine went in , and soon returned with her father , who had consented to go to the burgomaster .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 41]: He saluted Philip kindly as he came out ; shuddered as he passed on one side to avoid stepping over the dead bodies , and went off at a quick pace to the adjacent town , where the burgomaster resided .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 74]: Amine desired Philip to follow her , and they went into her father 's room , where , to his surprise , he found some coffee ready for him -- at that time a rarity , and one which Philip did not expect to find in the house of the penurious Mynheer Poots ; but it was a luxury which , from his former life , the old man could not dispense with .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 25]: Philip , who had not tasted food for nearly twenty-four hours , was not sorry to avail himself of what was placed before him .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 14]: Amine sat down opposite to him , and was silent during his repast .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 29]: `` Amine , '' said Philip at last , `` I have had plenty of time for reflection during this night , as I watched at the door .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 6]: May I speak freely ? ''
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 3]: replied Amine .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 25]: `` I feel assured that you will say nothing that you should not say , or should not meet a maiden 's ear . ''
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 8]: `` You do me justice , Amine .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 10]: My thoughts have been upon you and your father .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 10]: You can not stay in this lone habitation . ''
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 48]: `` I feel it is too lonely ; that is , for his safety -- perhaps for mine -- but you know my father -- the very loneliness suits him , the price paid for rent is little , and he is careful of his money . ''
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 22]: `` The man who would be careful of his money should place it in security -- here it is not secure .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 6]: Now hear me , Amine .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 22]: I have a cottage surrounded , as you may have heard , by many others , which mutually protect each other .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 27]: That cottage I am about to leave -- perhaps for ever ; for I intend to sail by the first ship to the Indian seas . ''
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 5]: `` The Indian seas !
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 3]: why so ?
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 13]: -- did you not last night talk of thousands of guilders ? ''
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 22]: `` I did , and they are there ; but , Amine , I must go -- it is my duty .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 13]: Ask me no more , but listen to what I now propose .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 35]: Your father must live in my cottage ; he must take care of it for me in my absence ; he will do me a favour by consenting ; and you must persuade him .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 6]: You will there be safe .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 11]: He must also take care of my money for me .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 16]: I want it not at present -- I can not take it with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 16]: `` My father is not to be trusted with the money of other people . ''
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 7]: `` Why does your father hoard ?
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 14]: He can not take his money with him when he is called away .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 16]: It must be all for you -- and is not then my money safe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 35]: `` Leave it then in my charge , and it will be safe ; but why need you go and risk your life upon the water , when you have such ample means ? ''
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 8]: `` Amine , ask not that question .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 21]: It is my duty as a son , and more I can not tell , at least at present . ''
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 12]: `` If it is your duty , I ask no more .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 29]: It was not womanish curiosity -- no , no -- it was a better feeling , I assure you , which prompted me to put the question . ''
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 11]: `` And what was the better feeling , Amine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 23]: `` I hardly know -- many good feelings perhaps mixed up together -- gratitude , esteem , respect , confidence , good-will .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 6]: Are not these sufficient ? ''
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 30]: `` Yes , indeed , Amine , and much to gain upon so short an acquaintance ; but still I feel them all , and more , for you .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 35]: If , then , you feel so much for me , do oblige me by persuading your father to leave this lonely house this day , and take up his abode in mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 11]: `` And where do you intend to go yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 57]: `` If your father will not admit me as a boarder for the short time I remain here , I will seek some shelter elsewhere ; but if he will , I will indemnify him well -- that is , if you raise no objection to my being for a few days in the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 5]: `` Why should I ?
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 14]: Our habitation is no longer safe , and you offer us a shelter .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 20]: It were , indeed , unjust and most ungrateful to turn you out from beneath your own roof . ''
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 7]: `` Then persuade him , Amine .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 27]: I will accept of nothing , but take it as a favour ; for I should depart in sorrow if I saw you not in safety .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 7]: -- Will you promise me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 30]: `` I do promise to use my best endeavours -- nay , I may as well say at once it shall be so ; for I know my influence .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 7]: Here is my hand upon it .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 6]: Will that content you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 9]: Philip took the small hand extended towards him .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 13]: His feelings overcame his discretion ; he raised it to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 42]: He looked up to see if Amine was displeased , and found her dark eye fixed upon him , as once before when she admitted him , as if she would see his thoughts -- but the hand was not withdrawn .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 23]: `` Indeed , Amine , '' said Philip , kissing her hand once more , `` you may confide in me . ''
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 21]: `` I hope -- I think -- nay , I am sure I may , '' at last replied she .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 5]: Philip released her hand .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 18]: Amine returned to the seat , and for some time remained silent and in a pensive attitude .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 14]: Philip also had his own thoughts , and did not open his lips .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 5]: At last Amine spoke .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 38]: `` I think I have heard my father say that your mother was very poor -- a little deranged ; and that there was a chamber in the house which had been shut up for years . ''
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 9]: `` It was shut up till yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 8]: `` And there you found your money ?
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 10]: Did your mother not know of the money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 14]: `` She did , for she spoke of it on her death-bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 15]: `` There must have been some potent reasons for not opening the chamber . ''
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 5]: `` There were . ''
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 8]: `` What were they , Philip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 12]: said Amine , in a soft and low tone of voice .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 12]: `` I must not tell , at least I ought not .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 14]: This must satisfy you -- 't was the fear of an apparition . ''
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 5]: `` What apparition ? ''
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 12]: `` She said that my father had appeared to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 11]: `` And did he , think you , Philip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 9]: `` I have no doubt that he did .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 10]: But I can answer no more questions , Amine .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 16]: The chamber is open now , and there is no fear of his reappearance . ''
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 12]: `` I fear not that , '' replied Amine , musing .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 21]: `` But , '' continued she , `` is not this connected with your resolution of going to sea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 26]: `` So far will I answer you , that it has decided me to go to sea ; but I pray you ask no more .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 17]: It is painful to refuse you , and my duty forbids me to speak further . ''
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 35]: For some minutes they were both silent , when Amine resumed -- `` You were so anxious to possess that relic , that I can not help thinking it has connection with the mystery .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 6]: Is it not so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 27]: `` For the last time , Amine , I will answer your question -- it has to do with it : but now no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 49]: Philip 's blunt and almost rude manner of finishing his speech was not lost upon Amine , who replied , `` You are so engrossed with other thoughts , that you have not felt the compliment shown you by my taking such interest about you , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 15]: `` Yes , I do -- I feel and thank you too , Amine .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 29]: Forgive me , if I have been rude ; but recollect , the secret is not mine -- at least , I feel as if it were not .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 22]: God knows , I wish I never had known it , for it has blasted all my hopes in life . ''
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 21]: Philip was silent ; and when he raised his eyes , he found that Amine 's were fixed upon him .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 14]: `` Would you read my thoughts , Amine , or my secret ? ''
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 27]: `` Your thoughts perhaps -- your secret I would not ; yet do I grieve that it should oppress you so heavily as evidently it does .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 20]: It must , indeed , be one of awe to bear down a mind like yours , Philip . ''
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 13]: `` Where did you learn to be so brave , Amine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 7]: said Philip , changing the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 21]: `` Circumstances make people brave or otherwise ; those who are accustomed to difficulty and danger fear them not . ''
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 12]: `` And where have you met with them , Amine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 18]: `` In the country where I was born , not in this dank and muddy land . ''
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 15]: `` Will you trust me with the story of your former life , Amine ?
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 10]: I can be secret , if you wish . ''
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 41]: `` That you can be secret perhaps , against my wish , you have already proved to me , '' replied Amine , smiling ; `` and you have a claim to know something of the life you have preserved .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 15]: I can not tell you much , but what I can will be sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 35]: My father , when a lad on board of a trading vessel , was taken by the Moors , and sold as a slave to a Hakim , or physician , of their country .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 29]: Finding him very intelligent , the Moor brought him up as an assistant , and it was under this man that he obtained a knowledge of the art .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 23]: In a few years he was equal to his master ; but , as a slave , he worked not for himself .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 15]: You know , indeed it can not be concealed , my father 's avarice .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 34]: He sighed to become as wealthy as his master , and to obtain his freedom ; he became a follower of Mahomet , after which he was free , and practised for himself .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 28]: He took a wife from an Arab family , the daughter of a chief whom he had restored to health , and he settled in the country .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 30]: I was born ; he amassed wealth , and became much celebrated ; but the son of a Bey dying under his hands was the excuse for persecuting him .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 22]: His head was forfeited , but he escaped ; not , however , without the loss of all his beloved wealth .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 21]: My mother and I went with him ; he fled to the Bedouins , with whom we remained some years .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 23]: There I was accustomed to rapid marches , wild and fierce attacks , defeat and flight , and oftentimes to indiscriminate slaughter .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 18]: But the Bedouins paid not well for my father 's services , and gold was his idol .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 17]: Hearing that the Bey was dead , he returned to Cairo , where he again practised .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 36]: He was allowed once more to amass until the heap was sufficient to excite the cupidity of the new Bey ; but this time he was fortunately made acquainted with the intentions of the ruler .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 34]: He again escaped , with a portion of his wealth , in a small vessel , and gained the Spanish coast ; but he never has been able to retain his money long .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 26]: Before he arrived in this country he had been robbed of almost all , and has now been for these three years laying up again .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 16]: We were but one year at Middleburgh , and from thence removed to this place .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 11]: Such is the history of my life , Philip . ''
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 14]: `` And does your father still hold the Mahomedan faith , Amine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 5]: `` I know not .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 16]: I think he holds no faith whatever : at least he hath taught me none .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 6]: His god is gold . ''
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 5]: `` And yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 27]: `` Is the God who made this beautiful world , and all which it contains -- the God of nature -- name him as you will .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 32]: This I feel , Philip , but more I fain would know ; there are so many faiths , but surely they must be but different paths leading alike to heaven .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 8]: Yours is the Christian faith , Philip .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 6]: Is it the true one ?
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 16]: But everyone calls his own the true one , whatever his creed may be . ''
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 11]: `` It is the true and only one , Amine .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 30]: Could I but reveal -- I have such dreadful proofs -- '' `` That your faith is true ; then is it not your duty to reveal these proofs ?
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 15]: Tell me , are you bound by any solemn obligation never to reveal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 16]: `` No , I am not ; yet do I feel as if I were .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 23]: But I hear voices -- it must be your father and the authorities -- I must go down and meet them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 7]: Philip rose , and went downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 17]: Amine 's eyes followed him as he went , and she remained looking towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 31]: `` Is it possible , '' said she , sweeping the hair from off her brow , `` so soon , -- yes , yes , 't is even so .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 30]: I feel that I would sooner share his hidden woe -- his dangers -- even death itself were preferable with him , than ease and happiness with any other .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 11]: And it shall be strange indeed if I do not .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 17]: This night my father shall move into his cottage : I will prepare at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 29]: The report of Philip and Mynheer Poots was taken down by the authorities , the bodies examined , and one or two of them recognised as well-known marauders .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 11]: They were then removed by the order of the burgomaster .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 19]: The authorities broke up their council , and Philip and Mynheer Poots were permitted to return to Amine .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 38]: It will not be necessary to repeat the conversation which ensued : it will be sufficient to state that Poots yielded to the arguments employed by Amine and Philip , particularly the one of paying no rent .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 22]: A conveyance for the furniture and medicines was procured , and in the afternoon most of the effects were taken away .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 30]: It was not , however , till dusk that the strong box of the doctor was put into the cart , and Philip went with it as a protector .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 14]: Amine also walked by the side of the vehicle , with her father .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 23]: As may be supposed , it was late that night before they had made their arrangements , and had retired to rest .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 46]: Chapter VI `` This , then , is the chamber which has so long been closed , '' said Amine , on entering it the next morning , long before Philip had awakened from the sound sleep produced by the watching of the night before .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 16]: `` Yes , indeed , it has the air of having long been closed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 11]: Amine looked around her , and then examined the furniture .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 20]: Her eyes were attracted to the bird-cages ; she looked into them : -- `` Poor little things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 15]: continued she , `` and here it was his father appeared unto his mother .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 22]: Well , it may be so , -- Philip saith that he hath proofs ; and why should he not appear ?
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 20]: Were Philip dead , I should rejoice to see his spirit , -- at least it would be something .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 14]: What am I saying -- unfaithful lips , thus to betray my secret ?
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 65]: -- The table thrown over ; -- that looks like the work of fear ; a workbox , with all its implements scattered , -- only a woman 's fear : a mouse might have caused all this ; and yet there is something solemn in the simple fact that , for so many years , not a living being has crossed these boards .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 25]: Even that a table thus overthrown could thus remain for years , seems scarcely natural , and therefore has its power on the mind .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 34]: I wonder not that Philip feels there is so heavy a secret belonging to this room -- but it must not remain in this condition -- it must be occupied at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 25]: Amine , who had long been accustomed to attend upon her father , and perform the household duties , now commenced her intended labours .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 77]: Every part of the room , and every piece of furniture in it , were cleaned ; even the cobwebs and dust were cleared away , and the sofa and table brought from the corner to the centre of the room ; the melancholy little prisons were removed ; and when Amine 's work of neatness was complete , and the sun shone brightly into the opened window , the chamber wore the appearance of cheerfulness .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 22]: Amine had the intuitive good sense to feel that strong impressions wear away when the objects connected with them are removed .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 41]: She resolved then to make Philip more at ease ; for , with all the fire and warmth of blood inherent in her race , she had taken his image to her heart , and was determined to win him .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 26]: Again and again did she resume her labour , until the pictures about the room , and every other article , looked fresh and clean .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 48]: Not only the bird-cages , but the workbox , and all the implements , were removed ; and the piece of embroidery , the taking up of which had made Philip recoil , as if he had touched an adder , was put away with the rest .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 9]: Philip had left the keys on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 26]: Amine opened the buffets , cleaned the glazed doors , and was busy rubbing up the silver flagons when her father came into the room .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 6]: `` Mercy on me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 11]: exclaimed Mynheer Poots ; `` and is all that silver ?
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 20]: -- then it must be true , and he has thousands of guilders ; but where are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 24]: `` Never do you mind , father ; yours are now safe , and for that you have to thank Philip Vanderdecken . ''
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 25]: `` Yes , very true ; but as he is to live here -- does he eat much -- what will he pay me ?
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 14]: He ought to pay well , as he has so much money . ''
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 16]: Amine 's lips were curled with a contemptuous smile , but she made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 24]: `` I wonder where he keeps his money ; and he is going to sea as soon as he can get a ship ?
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 12]: Who will have charge of his money when he goes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 14]: `` I shall take charge of it , father , '' replied Amine .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 21]: `` Ah -- yes -- well -- we will take charge of it ; the ship may be lost . ''
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 24]: `` No , _ we _ will not take charge of it , father ; you will have nothing to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 6]: Look after your own . ''
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 41]: Amine placed the silver in the buffets , locked the doors , and took the keys with her when she went out to prepare breakfast , leaving the old man gazing through the glazed doors at the precious metal within .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 14]: His eyes were riveted upon it , and he could not remove them .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 12]: Every minute he muttered , `` Yes , all silver . ''
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 34]: Philip came downstairs ; and as he passed by the room , intending to go into the kitchen , he perceived Mynheer Poots at the buffet , and he walked into the room .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 11]: He was surprised as well as pleased with the alteration .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 15]: He felt why and by whom it was done , and he was grateful .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 36]: Amine came in with the breakfast , and their eyes spoke more than their lips could have done ; and Philip sat down to his meal with less of sorrow and gloom upon his brow .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 36]: `` Mynheer Poots , '' said Philip , as soon as he had finished , `` I intend to leave you in possession of my cottage , and I trust you will find yourself comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 18]: What little arrangements are necessary , I will confide to your daughter previous to my departure . ''
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 14]: `` Then you leave us , Mr Philip , to go to sea ?
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 18]: It must be pleasant to go and see strange countries -- much better than staying at home .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 6]: When do you go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 35]: `` I shall leave this evening for Amsterdam , '' replied Philip , `` to make my arrangements about a ship , but I shall return , I think , before I sail . ''
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 4]: you will return .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 27]: Yes -- you have your money and your goods to see to ; you must count your money -- we will take good care of it .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 9]: Where is your money , Mr Vanderdecken ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 15]: `` That I will communicate to your daughter this forenoon , before I leave .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 13]: In three weeks at the furthest you may expect me back . ''
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 27]: `` Father , '' said Amine , `` you promised to go and see the child of the burgomaster ; it is time you went . ''
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 34]: `` Yes , yes -- by-and-bye -- all in good time ; but I must wait the pleasure of Mr Philip first -- he has much to tell me before he goes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 32]: Philip could not help smiling when he remembered what had passed when he first summoned Mynheer Poots to the cottage , but the remembrance ended in sorrow and a clouded brow .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 58]: Amine , who knew what was passing in the minds of both her father and Philip , now brought her father 's hat , and led him to the door of the cottage ; and Mynheer Poots , very much against his inclination , but never disputing the will of his daughter , was obliged to depart .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 7]: `` So soon , Philip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 8]: said Amine , returning to the room .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 7]: `` Yes , Amine , immediately .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 22]: But I trust to be back once more before I sail ; if not , you must now have my instructions .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 6]: Give me the keys . ''
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 16]: Philip opened the cupboard below the buffet , and the doors of the iron safe .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 21]: `` There , Amine , is my money ; we need not count it , as your father would propose .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 16]: You see that I was right when I asserted that I had thousands of guilders .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 18]: At present they are of no use to me , as I have to learn my profession .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 15]: Should I return some day , they may help me to own a ship .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 10]: I know not what my destiny may be . ''
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 8]: `` And should you not return ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 5]: replied Amine , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 22]: `` Then they are yours -- as well as all that is in this cottage , and the cottage itself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 10]: `` You have relations , have you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 26]: `` But one , who is rich ; an uncle , who helped us but little in our distress , and who has no children .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 11]: I owe him but little , and he wants nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 24]: There is but one being in this world who has created an interest in this heart , Amine , and it is you .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 22]: I wish you to look upon me as a brother -- I shall always love you as a dear sister . ''
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 5]: Amine made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 36]: Philip took some more money out of the bag which had been opened , for the expenses of his journey , and then locking up the safe and cupboard , gave the keys to Amine .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 26]: He was about to address her , when there was a slight knock at the door , and in entered Father Seysen , the priest .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 21]: `` Save you , my son ; and you , my child , whom as yet I have not seen .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 13]: You are , I suppose , the daughter of Mynheer Poots ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 5]: Amine bowed her head .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 23]: `` I perceive , Philip , that the room is now opened , and I have heard of all that has passed .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 22]: I would now talk with thee , Philip , and must beg this maiden to leave us for awhile alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 21]: Amine quitted the room , and the priest , sitting down on the couch , beckoned Philip to his side .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 10]: The conversation which ensued was too long to repeat .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 38]: The priest first questioned Philip relative to his secret , but on that point he could not obtain the information which he wished ; Philip stated as much as he did to Amine , and no more .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 41]: He also declared his intention of going to sea , and that , should he not return , he had bequeathed his property -- the extent of which he did not make known -- to the doctor and his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 38]: The priest then made inquiries relative to Mynheer Poots , asking Philip whether he knew what his creed was , as he had never appeared at any church , and report said that he was an infidel .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 42]: To this Philip , as usual , gave his frank answer , and intimated that the daughter , at least , was anxious to be enlightened , begging the priest to undertake a task to which he himself was not adequate .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 22]: To this request Father Seysen , who perceived the state of Philip 's mind with regard to Amine , readily consented .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 31]: After a conversation of nearly two hours , they were interrupted by the return of Mynheer Poots , who darted out of the room the instant he perceived Father Seysen .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 28]: Philip called Amine , and having begged her as a favour to receive the priest 's visits , the good old man blessed them both and departed .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 13]: `` You did not give him any money , Mr Philip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 12]: said Mynheer Poots , when Father Seysen had left the room .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 19]: `` I did not , '' replied Philip ; `` I wish I had thought of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 29]: `` No , no -- it is better not -- for money is better than what he can give you ; but he must not come here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 17]: `` Why not , father , '' replied Amine , `` if Mr Philip wishes it ?
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 7]: It is his own house . ''
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 19]: `` O yes , if Mr Philip wishes it ; but you know he is going away . ''
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 16]: `` Well , and suppose he is -- why should not the Father come here ?
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 9]: He shall come here to see me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 7]: `` See you , my child !
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 8]: -- what can he want with you ?
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 25]: Well , then , if he comes , I will not give him one stiver -- and then he 'll soon go away . ''
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 18]: Philip had no opportunity of further converse with Amine ; indeed he had nothing more to say .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 37]: In an hour he bade her farewell in presence of her father , who would not leave them , hoping to obtain from Philip some communication about the money which he was to leave behind him .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 32]: In two days Philip arrived at Amsterdam , and having made the necessary inquiries , found that there was no chance of vessels sailing for the East Indies for some months .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 19]: The Dutch East India Company had long been formed , and all private trading was at an end .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 36]: The Company 's vessels left only at what was supposed to be the most favourable season for rounding the Cape of Storms , as the Cape of Good Hope was designated by the early adventurers .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 29]: One of the ships which were to sail with the next fleet was the _ Ter Schilling _ , a three-masted vessel , now laid up and unrigged .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 91]: Philip found out the captain , and stated his wishes to sail with him , to learn his profession as a seaman ; the captain was pleased with his appearance , and as Philip not only agreed to receive no wages during the voyage , but to pay a premium as an apprentice learning his duty , he was promised a berth on board as the second mate , to mess in the cabin ; and he was told that he should be informed whenever the vessel was to sail .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 32]: Philip having now done all that he could in obedience to his vow , determined to return to the cottage ; and once more he was in the company of Amine .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 36]: We must now pass over two months , during which Mynheer Poots continued to labour at his vocation , and was seldom within doors , and our two young friends were left for hours together .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 13]: Philip 's love for Amine was fully equal to hers for him .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 18]: It was more than love -- it was a devotion on both sides , each day increasing .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 22]: Who , indeed , could be more charming , more attractive in all ways than the high-spirited , yet tender Amine ?
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 41]: Occasionally the brow of Philip would be clouded when he reflected upon the dark prospect before him ; but Amine 's smile would chase away the gloom , and , as he gazed on her , all would be forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 22]: Amine made no secret of her attachment ; it was shown in every word , every look , and every gesture .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 34]: When Philip would take her hand , or encircle her waist with his arm , or even when he pressed her coral lips , there was no pretence of coyness on her part .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 27]: She was too noble , too confiding ; she felt that her happiness was centred in his love , and she lived but in his presence .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 38]: Two months had thus passed away , when Father Seysen , who often called , and had paid much attention to Amine 's instruction , one day came in as Amine was encircled in Philip 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 22]: `` My children , '' said he , `` I have watched you for some time : this is not well .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 18]: Philip , if you intend marriage , as I presume you do , still it is dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 7]: I must join your hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 4]: Philip started up .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 22]: `` Surely I am not deceived in thee , my son , '' continued the priest , in a severe tone .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 27]: `` No , no , good Father ; but I pray you leave me now : to-morrow you may come , and all will be decided .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 8]: But I must talk with Amine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 14]: The priest quitted the room , and Amine and Philip were again alone .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 23]: The colour in Amine 's cheek varied and her heart beat , for she felt how much her happiness was at stake .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 17]: `` The priest is right , Amine , '' said Philip , sitting down by her .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 23]: `` This can not last ; -- would that I could ever stay with you : how hard a fate is mine !
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 23]: You know I love the very ground you tread upon , yet I dare not ask thee to wed to misery . ''
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 22]: `` To wed with thee would not be wedding misery , Philip , '' replied Amine , with downcast eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 10]: ` Twere not kindness on my part , Amine .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 7]: I should indeed be selfish . ''
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 12]: `` I will speak plainly , Philip , '' replied Amine .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 26]: `` You say you love me , -- I know not how men love , -- but this I know , how I can love .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 26]: I feel that to leave me now were indeed unkind and selfish on your part ; for , Philip , I -- I should die .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 20]: You say that you must go away , -- that fate demands it , -- and your fatal secret .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 14]: Be it so ; -- but can not I go with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 11]: `` Go with me , Amine -- unto death ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 13]: `` Yes , death ; for what is death but a release ?
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 13]: I fear not death , Philip ; I fear but losing thee .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 17]: Nay , more ; is not your life in the hands of Him who made all ?
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 7]: then why so sure to die ?
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 40]: You have hinted to me that you are chosen -- selected for a task ; -- if chosen , there is less chance of death ; for until the end be fulfilled , if chosen , you must live .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 50]: I would I knew your secret , Philip : a woman 's wit might serve you well : and if it did not serve you , is there no comfort , no pleasure , in sharing sorrow as well as joy with one you say you dote upon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 38]: `` Amine , dearest Amine ; it is my love , my ardent love alone , which makes me pause : for , O Amine , what pleasure should I feel if we were this hour united !
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 12]: I hardly know what to say , or what to do .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 24]: I could not withhold my secret from you if you were my wife , nor will I wed you till you know it .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 13]: Well , Amine , I will cast my all upon the die .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 28]: You shall know this secret , learn what a doomed wretch I am , though from no fault of mine , and then you yourself shall decide .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 78]: But remember , my oath is registered in heaven , and I must not be dissuaded from it ; keep that in mind , and hear my tale , -- then if you choose to wed with one whose prospects are so bitter , be it so , -- a short-lived happiness will then be mine , but for you , Amine -- '' `` At once the secret , Philip , '' cried Amine , impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 14]: Philip then entered into a detail of what our readers are acquainted with .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 21]: Amine listened in silence ; not a change of feature was to be observed in her countenance during the narrative .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 12]: Philip wound up with stating the oath which he had taken .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 12]: `` I have done , '' said Philip , mournfully . ''
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 34]: 'T is a strange story , Philip , '' replied Amine : `` and now hear me ; -- but give me first that relic , -- I wish to look upon it .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 20]: And can there be such virtue -- I had nigh said , such mischief -- in this little thing ?
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 22]: Strange ; forgive me , Philip , -- but I 've still my doubts upon this tale of _ Eblis _ .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 22]: You know I am not yet strong in the new belief which you and the good priest have lately taught me .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 28]: I do not say that it _ can not _ be true : but still , one so unsettled as I am may be allowed to waver .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 12]: But , Philip , I 'll assume that all is true .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 37]: Then , if it be true , without the oath you would be doing but your duty ; and think not so meanly of Amine as to suppose she would restrain you from what is right .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 24]: No , Philip , seek your father , and , if you can , and he requires your aid , then save him .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 24]: But , Philip , do you imagine that a task like this , so high , is to be accomplished at one trial ?
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 2]: O !
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 29]: no ; -- if you have been so chosen to fulfil it , you will be preserved through difficulty and danger until you have worked out your end .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 31]: You will be preserved , and you will again and again return ; -- be comforted -- consoled -- be cherished -- and be loved by Amine as your wife .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 30]: And when it pleases Him to call you from this world , your memory , if she survive you , Philip , will equally be cherished in her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 18]: Philip , you have given me to decide ; -- dearest Philip , I am thine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 13]: Amine extended her arms , and Philip pressed her to his bosom .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 32]: That evening Philip demanded his daughter of the father , and Mynheer Poots , as soon as Philip opened the iron safe and displayed the guilders , gave his immediate consent .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 39]: Father Seysen called the next day and received his answer ; and three days afterwards , the bells of the little church of Terneuse were ringing a merry peal for the union of Amine Poots and Philip Vanderdecken .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 25]: Chapter VII It was not until late in the autumn that Philip was roused from his dream of love -LRB- for what , alas !
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 11]: is every enjoyment of this life but a dream ? -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 17]: by a summons from the captain of the vessel with whom he had engaged to sail .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 49]: Strange as it may appear , from the first day which put him in possession of his Amine , Philip had no longer brooded over his future destiny : occasionally it was recalled to his memory , but immediately rejected , and , for the time , forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 74]: Sufficient he thought it to fulfil his engagement when the time should come ; and although the hours flew away , and day succeeded day , week week , and month month , with the rapidity accompanying a life of quiet and unvarying bliss , Philip forgot his vow in the arms of Amine , who was careful not to revert to a topic which would cloud the brow of her adored husband .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 94]: Once , indeed , or twice , had old Poots raised the question of Philip 's departure , but the indignant frown and the imperious command of Amine -LRB- who knew too well the sordid motives which actuated her father , and who , at such times , looked upon him with abhorrence -RRB- made him silent , and the old man would spend his leisure hours in walking up and down the parlour with his eyes riveted upon the buffets , where the silver tankards now beamed in all their pristine brightness .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 21]: One morning , in the month of October , there was a tapping with the knuckles at the cottage door .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 33]: As this precaution implied a stranger , Amine obeyed the summons , `` I would speak with Master Philip Vanderdecken , '' said the stranger , in a half-whispering sort of voice .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 35]: The party who thus addressed Amine was a little meagre personage , dressed in the garb of the Dutch seamen of the time , with a cap made of badger-skin hanging over his brow .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 29]: His features were sharp and diminutive , his face of a deadly white , his lips pale , and his hair of a mixture between red and white .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 22]: He had very little show of beard -- indeed , it was almost difficult to say what his age might be .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 26]: He might have been a sickly youth early sinking into decrepitude , or an old man , hale in constitution , yet carrying no flesh .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 91]: But the most important feature , and that which immediately riveted the attention of Amine , was the eye of this peculiar personage -- for he had but one ; the right eye-lid was closed , and the ball within had evidently wasted away ; but his left eye was , for the size of his face and head , of unusual dimensions , very protuberant , clear and watery , and most unpleasant to look upon , being relieved by no fringe of eyelash either above or below it .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 24]: So remarkable was the feature , that when you looked at the man , you saw his eye and looked at nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 136]: It was not a man with one eye , but one eye with a man attached to it : the body was but the tower of the lighthouse , of no further value , and commanding no further attention , than does the structure which holds up the beacon to the venturous mariner ; and yet , upon examination , you would have perceived that the man , although small , was neatly made ; that his hands were very different in texture and colour from those of common seamen ; that his features in general , although sharp , were regular ; and that there was an air of superiority even in the obsequious manner of the little personage , and an indescribable something about his whole appearance which almost impressed you with awe .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 37]: Amine 's dark eyes were for a moment fixed upon the visitor , and she felt a chill at her heart for which she could not account , as she requested that he would walk in .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 42]: Philip was greatly surprised at the appearance of the stranger , who , as soon as he entered the room , without saying a word , sat down on the sofa by Philip in the place which Amine had just left .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 51]: To Philip there was something ominous in this person taking Amine 's seat ; all that had passed rushed into his recollection , and he felt that there was a summons from his short existence of enjoyment and repose to a life of future activity , danger , and suffering .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 26]: What peculiarly struck Philip was , that when the little man sat beside him , a sensation of sudden cold ran through his whole frame .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 13]: The colour fled from Philip 's cheek , but he spoke not .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 10]: For a minute or two there was a silence .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 55]: The one-eyed visitor looked round him , and turning from the buffets he fixed his eyes on the form of Amine , who stood before him ; at last the silence was broken by a sort of giggle on the part of the stranger , which ended in -- `` Philip Vanderdecken -- he !
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 2]: he !
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 11]: -- Philip Vanderdecken , you do n't know me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 14]: `` I do not , '' replied Philip , in a half-angry tone .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 34]: The voice of the little man was most peculiar -- it was a sort of subdued scream , the notes of which sounded in your ear long after he had ceased to speak .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 29]: `` I am Schriften , one of the pilots of the _ Ter Schilling _ , '' continued the man ; `` and I 'm come -- he !
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 3]: he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 26]: -- and he looked hard at Amine -- `` to take you away from love '' -- and looking at the buffets -- `` he !
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 2]: he !
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 32]: from comfort , and from this also , '' cried he , stamping his foot on the floor as he rose from the sofa -- `` from terra firma -- he !
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 2]: he !
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 7]: -- to a watery grave perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 3]: Pleasant ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 24]: continued Schriften , with a giggle ; and with a countenance full of meaning he fixed his one eye on Philip 's face .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 70]: Philip 's first impulse was to put his new visitor out of the door ; but Amine , who read his thoughts , folded her arms as she stood before the little man , and eyed him with contempt , as she observed : -- `` We all must meet our fate , good fellow ; and , whether by land or sea , death will have his due .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 24]: If death stare him in the face , the cheek of Philip Vanderdecken will never turn as white as yours is now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 47]: replied Schriften , evidently annoyed at this cool determination on the part of one so young and beautiful ; and then fixing his eye upon the silver shrine of the Virgin on the mantel-piece -- `` You are a Catholic , I perceive -- he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 17]: `` I am a Catholic , '' replied Philip ; `` but does that concern you ?
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 7]: When does the vessel sail ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 7]: `` In a week -- he !
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 2]: he !
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 18]: -- only a week for preparation -- only seven days to leave all -- short notice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 15]: `` More than sufficient , '' replied Philip , rising up from the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 12]: `` You may tell your captain that I shall not fail .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 11]: Come , Amine , we must lose no time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 29]: `` No , indeed , '' replied Amine , `` and our first duty is hospitality : Mynheer , may we offer you refreshment after your walk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 20]: `` This day week , '' said Schriften , addressing Philip , and without making a reply to Amine .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 27]: Philip nodded his head , the little man turned on his heel and left the room , and in a short time was out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 7]: Amine sank down on the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 31]: The breaking-up of her short hour of happiness had been too sudden , too abrupt , and too cruelly brought about for a fondly doting , although heroic , woman .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 34]: There was an evident malignity in the words and manner of the one-eyed messenger , an appearance as if he knew more than others , which awed and confused both Philip and herself .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 28]: Amine wept not , but she covered her face with her hands as Philip , with no steady pace , walked up and down the small room .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 19]: Again , with all the vividness of colouring , did the scenes half forgotten recur to his memory .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 13]: Again did he penetrate the fatal chamber -- again was it obscure .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 21]: The embroidery lay at his feet , and once more he started as when the letter appeared upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 21]: They had both awakened from a dream of present bliss , and shuddered at the awful future which presented itself .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 13]: A few minutes were sufficient for Philip to resume his natural self-possession .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 17]: He sat down by the side of his Amine , and clasped her in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 4]: They remained silent .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 56]: They knew too well each other 's thoughts ; and , excruciating as was the effort , they were both summoning up their courage to bear , and steeling their hearts against the conviction that , in this world , they must now expect to be for a time , perhaps for ever , separated .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 50]: Amine was the first to speak : removing her arms , which had been wound round her husband , she first put his hand to her heart , as if to compress its painful throbbings , and then observed -- `` Surely that was no earthly messenger , Philip !
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 13]: Did you not feel chilled to death when he sat by you ?
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 9]: I did , as he came in . ''
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 93]: Philip , who had the same thought as Amine , but did not wish to alarm her , answered confusedly -- `` Nay , Amine , you fancy -- that is , the suddenness of his appearance and his strange conduct have made you imagine this ; but I saw in him but a man who , from his peculiar deformity , has become an envious outcast of society -- debarred from domestic happiness , from the smiles of the other sex ; for what woman could smile upon such a creature ?
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 37]: His bile raised at so much beauty in the arms of another , he enjoyed a malignant pleasure in giving a message which he felt would break upon those pleasures from which he is cut off .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 13]: Be assured , my love , that it was nothing more . ''
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 15]: `` And even if my conjecture were correct , what does it matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 3]: replied Amine .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 19]: `` There can be nothing more -- nothing which can render your position more awful and more desperate .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 20]: As your wife , Philip , I feel less courage than I did when I gave my willing hand .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 55]: I knew not then what would be the extent of my loss ; but fear not , much as I feel here , '' continued Amine , putting her hand to her heart -- `` I am prepared , and proud that he who is selected for such a task is my husband . ''
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 3]: Amine paused .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 12]: `` You can not surely have been mistaken , Philip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 37]: Amine , I have not been mistaken , either in the summons or in my own courage , or in my selection of a wife , '' replied Philip , mournfully , as he embraced her .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 9]: `` It is the will of Heaven . ''
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 17]: `` Then may its will be done , '' replied Amine , rising from her seat .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 7]: `` The first pang is over .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 7]: I feel better now , Philip .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 7]: Your Amine knows her duty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 46]: Philip made no reply ; when , after a few moments , Amine continued : `` But one short week , Philip -- '' `` I would it had been but one day ; '' replied he ; `` it would have been long enough .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 11]: He has come too soon -- the one-eyed monster . ''
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 8]: `` Nay , not so , Philip .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 19]: I thank him for the week -- 't is but a short time to wean myself from happiness .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 58]: I grant you , that were I to tease , to vex , to unman you with my tears , my prayers , or my upbraidings -LRB- as some wives would do , Philip -RRB- , one day would be more than sufficient for such a scene of weakness on my part , and misery on yours .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 13]: But , no , Philip , your Amine knows her duty better .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 53]: You must go like some knight of old to perilous encounter , perhaps to death ; but Amine will arm you , and show her love by closing carefully each rivet to protect you in your peril , and will see you depart full of hope and confidence , anticipating your return .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 69]: A week is not too long , Philip , when employed as I trust I shall employ it -- a week to interchange our sentiments , to hear your voice , to listen to your words -LRB- each of which will be engraven on my heart 's memory -RRB- , to ponder on them , and feed my love with them in your absence and in my solitude .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 2]: no !
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 13]: Philip ; I thank God that there is yet a week . ''
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 23]: `` And so do I , then , Amine ; and , after all , we knew that this must come . ''
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 13]: but my love was so potent , that it banished memory . ''
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 16]: `` And yet during our separation your love must feed on memory , Amine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 3]: Amine sighed .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 30]: Here their conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Mynheer Poots , who , struck with the alteration in Amine 's radiant features , exclaimed , `` Holy Prophet !
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 7]: what is the matter now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 31]: `` Nothing more than what we all knew before , '' replied Philip ; `` I am about to leave you -- the ship will sail in a week . ''
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 8]: you will sail in a week ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 34]: There was a curious expression in the face of the old man as he endeavoured to suppress , before Amine and her husband , the joy which he felt at Philip 's departure .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 21]: Gradually he subdued his features into gravity , and said -- `` That is very bad news , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 15]: No answer was made by Amine or Philip , who quitted the room together .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 17]: We must pass over this week , which was occupied in preparations for Philip 's departure .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 31]: We must pass over the heroism of Amine , who controlled her feelings , racked as she was with intense agony at the idea of separating from her adored husband .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 32]: We can not dwell upon the conflicting emotions in the breast of Philip , who left competence , happiness , and love , to encounter danger , privation , and death .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 42]: Now , at one time , he would almost resolve to remain , and then at others , as he took the relic from his bosom and remembered his vow registered upon it , he was nearly as anxious to depart .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 47]: Amine , too , as she fell asleep in her husband 's arms , would count the few hours left them ; or she would shudder , as she lay awake and the wind howled , at the prospect of what Philip would have to encounter .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 92]: It was a long week to both of them , and , although they thought that time flew fast , it was almost a relief when the morning came that was to separate them ; for to their feelings , which , from regard to each other , had been pent up and controlled , they could then give vent ; their surcharged bosoms could be relieved ; certainty had driven away suspense , and hope was still left to cheer them and brighten up the dark horizon of the future .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 28]: `` Philip , '' said Amine , as they sat together with their hands entwined , `` I shall not feel so much when you are gone .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 25]: I do not forget that all this was told me before we were wed , and that for my love I took the hazard .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 28]: My fond heart often tells me that you will return ; but it may deceive me -- return you _ may _ , but not in life .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 49]: In this room I shall await you ; on this sofa , removed to its former station , I shall sit ; and if you can not appear to me alive , O refuse me not , if it be possible , to appear to me when dead .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 13]: I shall fear no storm , no bursting open of the window .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 3]: O no !
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 10]: I shall hail the presence even of your spirit .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 47]: Once more ; let me but see you -- let me be assured that you are dead -- and then I shall know that I have no more to live for in this world , and shall hasten to join you in a world of bliss .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 6]: Promise me , Philip . ''
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 32]: `` I promise all you ask , provided Heaven will so permit ; but , Amine , '' and Philip 's lips trembled , `` I can not -- merciful God !
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 5]: I am indeed tried .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 9]: Amine , I can stay no longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 42]: Amine 's dark eyes were fixed upon her husband -- she could not speak -- her features were convulsed -- nature could no longer hold up against her excess of feeling -- she fell into his arms , and lay motionless .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 19]: Philip , about to impress a last kiss upon her pale lips , perceived that she had fainted .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 37]: `` She feels not now , '' said he , as he laid her upon the sofa ; `` it is better that it should be so -- too soon will she awake to misery . ''
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 51]: Summoning to the assistance of his daughter Mynheer Poots , who was in the adjoining room , Philip caught up his hat , imprinted one more fervent kiss upon her forehead , burst from the house , and was out of sight long before Amine had recovered from her swoon .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 61]: Chapter VIII Before we follow Philip Vanderdecken in his venturous career , it will be necessary to refresh the memory of our readers by a succinct recapitulation of the circumstances that had directed the enterprise of the Dutch towards the country of the East , which was now proving to them a source of wealth which they considered as inexhaustible .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 7]: Let us begin at the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 34]: Charles the Fifth , after having possessed the major part of Europe , retired from the world , for reasons best known to himself , and divided his kingdoms between Ferdinand and Philip .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 44]: To Ferdinand he gave Austria and its dependencies ; to Philip Spain ; but to make the division more equal and palatable to the latter , he threw the Low Countries , with the few millions vegetating upon them , into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 32]: Having thus disposed of his fellow-mortals much to his own satisfaction , he went into a convent , reserving for himself a small income , twelve men , and a pony .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 28]: Whether he afterwards repented his hobby , or mounted his pony , is not recorded ; but this is certain -- that in two years he died .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 25]: Philip thought -LRB- as many have thought before and since -RRB- that he had a right to do what he pleased with his own .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 43]: He therefore took away from the Hollanders most of their liberties : to make amends , however , he gave them the Inquisition ; but the Dutch grumbled , and Philip , to stop their grumbling , burnt a few of them .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 26]: Upon which , the Dutch , who are aquatic in their propensities , protested against a religion which was much too warm for their constitutions .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 61]: In short , heresy made great progress ; and the Duke of Alva was despatched with a large army , to prove to the Hollanders that the Inquisition was the very best of all possible arrangements , and that it was infinitely better that a man should be burnt for half-an-hour in this world than for eternity in the next .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 48]: This slight difference of opinion was the occasion of a war , which lasted about eight years , and which , after having saved some hundreds of thousands the trouble of dying in their beds , at length ended in the Seven United Provinces being declared independent .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 7]: Now we must go back again .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 28]: For a century after Vasco de Gama had discovered the passage round the Cape of Good Hope , the Portuguese were not interfered with by other nations .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 12]: At last the adventurous spirit of the English nation was roused .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 25]: The passage to India by the Cape had been claimed by the Portuguese as their sole right , and they defended it by force .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 34]: For a long time no private company ventured to oppose them , and the trade was not of that apparent value to induce any government to embark in a war upon the question .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 49]: The English adventurers , therefore , turned their attention to the discovery of a north-west passage to India , with which the Portuguese could have no right to interfere , and in vain attempts to discover that passage , the best part of the fifteenth century was employed .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 19]: At last they abandoned their endeavours , and resolved no longer to be deterred by the Portuguese pretensions .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 20]: After one or two unsuccessful expeditions , an armament was fitted out and put under the orders of Drake .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 14]: This courageous and successful navigator accomplished more than the most sanguine had anticipated .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 43]: He returned to England in the month of May , 1580 , after a voyage which occupied him nearly three years ; bringing home with him great riches , and having made most favourable arrangements with the king of the Molucca Islands .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 12]: His success was followed up by Cavendish and others in 1600 .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 35]: The English East India Company , in the meanwhile , received their first charter from the government , and had now been with various success carrying on the trade for upwards of fifty years .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 81]: During the time that the Dutch were vassals to the crown of Spain , it was their custom to repair to Lisbon for the productions of the East , and afterwards to distribute them through Europe ; but when they quarrelled with Philip , they were no longer admitted as retailers of his Indian produce : the consequence was , that , while asserting , and fighting for , their independence , they had also fitted out expeditions to India .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 36]: They were successful ; and in 1602 the various speculators were , by the government , formed into a company , upon the same principles and arrangement as those which had been chartered in England .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 66]: At the time , therefore , to which we are reverting , the English and Dutch had been trading in the Indian seas for more than fifty years ; and the Portuguese had lost nearly all their power , from the alliances and friendships which their rivals had formed with the potentates of the East , who had suffered from the Portuguese avarice and cruelty .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 77]: Whatever may have been the sum of obligation which the Dutch owed to the English for the assistance they received from them during their struggle for independence , it does not appear that their gratitude extended beyond the Cape ; for , on the other side of it , the Portuguese , English , and Dutch fought and captured each other 's vessels without ceremony ; and there was no law but that of main force .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 39]: The mother countries were occasionally called upon to interfere , but the interference up to the above time had produced nothing more than a paper war ; it being very evident that all parties were in the wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 64]: In 1650 , Cromwell usurped the throne of England , and the year afterwards , having , among other points , vainly demanded of the Dutch satisfaction for the murder of his regicide ambassador , which took place in this year , and some compensation for the cruelties exercised on the English at Amboyne some thirty years before he declared war with Holland .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 29]: To prove that he was in earnest , he seized more than two hundred Dutch vessels , and the Dutch then -LRB- very unwillingly -RRB- prepared for war .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 14]: Blake and Van Tromp met , and the naval combats were most obstinate .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 26]: In the `` History of England '' the victory is almost invariably given to the English , but in that of Holland to the Dutch .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 20]: By all accounts , these engagements were so obstinate , that in each case they were both well beaten .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 49]: However , in 1654 , peace was signed ; the Dutchman promising `` to take his hat off '' whenever he should meet an Englishman on the high seas -- a mere act of politeness which Mynheer did not object to , as it _ cost nothing _ .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 25]: And now , having detailed the state of things up to the time of Philip 's embarkation , we shall proceed with our story .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 27]: As soon as Philip was clear of his own threshold , he hastened away as though he were attempting to escape from his own painful thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 39]: In two days he arrived at Amsterdam , where his first object was to procure a small , but strong , steel chain to replace the ribbon by which the relic had hitherto been secured round his neck .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 20]: Having done this , he hastened to embark with his effects on board of the _ Ter Schilling _ .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 34]: Philip had not forgotten to bring with him the money which he had agreed to pay the captain , in consideration of being received on board as an apprentice rather than a sailor .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 14]: He had also furnished himself with a further sum for his own exigencies .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 34]: It was late in the evening when he arrived on board of the _ Ter Schilling _ , which lay at single anchor , surrounded by the other vessels composing the Indian fleet .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 43]: The captain , whose name was Kloots , received him with kindness , showed him his berth , and then went below in the hold to decide a question relative to the cargo , leaving Philip on deck to his own reflections .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 35]: And this , then , thought Philip , as he leaned against the taffrail and looked forward -- this , then , is the vessel in which my first attempt is to be made .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 7]: First and -- perhaps , last .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 18]: How little do those with whom I am about to sail imagine the purport of my embarkation ?
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 10]: How different are my views from those of others ?
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 8]: Do _ I _ seek a fortune ?
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 10]: Is it to satisfy curiosity and a truant spirit ?
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 7]: I seek communion with the dead .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 16]: Can I meet the dead without danger to myself and those who sail with me ?
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 15]: I should think not , for I can not join it but in death .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 19]: Did they surmise my wishes and intentions , would they permit me to remain one hour on board ?
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 39]: Superstitious as seamen are said to be , they might find a good excuse , if they knew my mission , not only for their superstition , but for ridding themselves of one on such an awful errand .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 3]: Awful indeed !
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 6]: and how to be accomplished ?
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 14]: Heaven alone , with perseverance on my part , can solve the mystery .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 9]: And Philip 's thoughts reverted to his Amine .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 26]: He folded his arms and , entranced in meditation , with his eyes raised to the firmament , he appeared to watch the flying scud .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 9]: `` Had you not better go below ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 13]: said a mild voice , which made Philip start from his reverie .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 25]: It was that of the first mate , whose name was Hillebrant , a short , well-set man of about thirty years of age .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 45]: His hair was flaxen , and fell in long flakes upon his shoulders , his complexion fair , and his eyes of a soft blue ; although there was little of the sailor in his appearance , few knew or did their duty better .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 29]: `` I thank you , '' replied Philip ; `` I had , indeed , forgotten myself , and where I was : my thoughts were far away .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 7]: Good-night , and many thanks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 30]: The _ Ter Schilling _ , like most of the vessels of that period , was very different in her build and fitting from those of the present day .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 12]: She was ship-rigged , and of about four hundred tons burden .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 34]: Her bottom was nearly flat , and her sides fell in -LRB- as she rose above the water -RRB- , so that her upper decks were not half the width of the hold .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 34]: All the vessels employed by the Company being armed , she had her main deck clear of goods , and carried six nine-pounders on each broadside ; her ports were small and oval .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 25]: There was a great spring in all her decks , -- that is to say , she ran with a curve forward and aft .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 18]: On her forecastle another small deck ran from the knight-heads , which was called the top-gallant forecastle .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 16]: Her quarter-deck was broken with a poop , which rose high out of the water .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 29]: The bowsprit staved very much , and was to appearance almost as a fourth mast : the more so , as she carried a square spritsail and sprit-topsail .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 49]: On her quarter-deck and poop-bulwarks were fixed in sockets implements of warfare now long in disuse , but what were then known by the names of cohorns and patteraroes ; they turned round on a swivel , and were pointed by an iron handle fixed to the breech .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 23]: The sail abaft the mizen-mast -LRB- corresponding to the driver or spanker of the present day -RRB- was fixed upon a lateen-yard .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 72]: It is hardly necessary to add -LRB- after this description -RRB- that the dangers of a long voyage were not a little increased by the peculiar structure of the vessels , which -LRB- although with such top hamper , and so much wood above water , they could make good way before a favourable breeze -RRB- could hold no wind , and had but little chance if caught upon a lee-shore .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 24]: The crew of the _ Ter Schilling _ were composed of the captain , two mates , two pilots , and forty-five men .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 9]: The supercargo had not yet come on board .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 32]: The cabin -LRB- under the poop -RRB- was appropriated to the supercargo ; but the main-deck cabin to the captain and mates , who composed the whole of the cabin mess .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 20]: When Philip awoke the next morning he found that the topsails were hoisted , and the anchor short-stay apeak .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 15]: Some of the other vessels of the fleet were under weigh and standing out .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 23]: The weather was fine and the water smooth , and the bustle and novelty of the scene were cheering to his spirits .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 30]: The captain , Mynheer Kloots , was standing on the poop with a small telescope , made of pasteboard , to his eye , anxiously looking towards the town .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 31]: Mynheer Kloots , as usual , had his pipe in his mouth , and the smoke which he puffed from it for a time obscured the lenses of his telescope .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 10]: Philip went up the poop ladder and saluted him .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 26]: Mynheer Kloots was a person of no moderate dimensions , and the quantity of garments which he wore added no little to his apparent bulk .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 70]: The outer garments exposed to view were , a rough fox-skin cap upon his head , from under which appeared the edge of a red worsted nightcap ; a red plush waistcoat , with large metal buttons ; a jacket of green cloth , over which he wore another of larger dimensions of coarse blue cloth , which came down as low as what would be called a spencer .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 43]: Below he had black plush breeches , light blue worsted stockings , shoes , and broad silver buckles ; round his waist was girded , with a broad belt , a canvas apron which descended in thick folds nearly to his knee .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 16]: In his belt was a large broad-bladed knife in a sheath of shark 's skin .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 16]: Such was the attire of Mynheer Kloots , captain of the _ Ter Schilling _ .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 9]: He was as tall as he was corpulent .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 18]: His face was oval , and his features small in proportion to the size of his frame .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 65]: His grizzly hair fluttered in the breeze , and his nose -LRB- although quite straight -RRB- was , at the tip , fiery red from frequent application to his bottle of schnapps , and the heat of a small pipe which seldom left his lips , except for _ him _ to give an order , or for _ it _ to be replenished .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 23]: `` Good morning , my son , '' said the captain , taking his pipe out of his mouth for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 40]: `` We are detained by the supercargo , who appears not over-willing to come on board ; the boat has been on shore this hour waiting for him , and we shall be last of the fleet under weigh .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 37]: I wish the Company would let us sail without these _ gentlemen _ , who are -LRB- _ in my opinion -RRB- _ a great hindrance to business ; but they think otherwise on shore . ''
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 9]: `` What is their duty on board ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 3]: replied Philip .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 76]: `` Their duty is to look after the cargo and the traffic , and if they kept to that , it would not be so bad ; but they interfere with everything else and everybody , studying little except their own comforts ; in fact , they play the king on board , knowing that we dare not affront them , as a word from them would prejudice the vessel when again to be chartered .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 11]: The Company insist upon their being received with all honours .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 13]: We salute them with five guns on their arrival on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 13]: `` Do you know anything of this one whom you expect ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 7]: `` Nothing , but from report .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 36]: A brother captain of mine -LRB- with whom he has sailed -RRB- told me that he is most fearful of the dangers of the sea , and much taken up with his own importance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 22]: `` I wish he would come , '' replied Philip ; `` I am most anxious that we should sail . ''
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 29]: `` You must be of a wandering disposition , my son : I hear that you leave a comfortable home , and a pretty wife to boot . ''
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 39]: `` I am most anxious to see the world , '' replied Philip ; `` and I must learn to sail a ship before I purchase one , and try to make the fortune that I covet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 3]: -LRB- Alas !
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 17]: how different from my real wishes , thought Philip , as he made this reply . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 21]: `` Fortunes are made , and fortunes are swallowed up too , by the ocean , '' replied the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 33]: `` If I could turn this good ship into a good house , with plenty of guilders to keep the house warm , you would not find me standing on this poop .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 25]: I have doubled the Cape twice , which is often enough for any man ; the third time may not be so lucky . ''
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 9]: `` Is it so dangerous , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 3]: said Philip .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 26]: `` As dangerous as tides and currents , rocks and sand-banks , hard gales and heavy seas , can make it , -- no more !
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 53]: Even when you anchor in the bay , on this side of the Cape , you ride in fear and trembling , for you may be blown away from your anchor to sea , or be driven on shore among the savages , before the men can well put on their clothing .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 63]: But when once you 're well on the other side of the Cape , then the water dances to the beams of the sun as if it were merry , and you may sail for weeks with a cloudless sky and a flowing breeze , without starting tack or sheet , or having to take your pipe out of your mouth . ''
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 11]: `` What port shall we go into , Mynheer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 9]: `` Of that I can say but little .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 19]: Gambroon , in the Gulf of Persia , will probably be the first rendezvous of the whole fleet .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 71]: Then we shall separate : some will sail direct for Bantam , in the island of Java ; others will have orders to trade down the Straits for camphor , gum , benzoin , and wax ; they have also gold and the teeth of the elephant to barter with us : there -LRB- should we be sent thither -RRB- you must be careful with the natives , Mynheer Vanderdecken .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 26]: They are fierce and treacherous , and their curved knives -LRB- or creeses , as they , call them -RRB- are sharp and deadly poisoned .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 15]: I have had hard fighting in those Straits both with Portuguese and English . ''
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 10]: `` But we are all at peace now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 38]: `` True , my son ; but when round the Cape , we must not trust to papers signed at home : and the English press us hard , and tread upon our heels wherever we go .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 22]: They must be checked ; and I suspect our fleet is so large and well appointed in expectation of hostilities . ''
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 13]: `` How long do you expect your voyage may occupy us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 43]: `` That 's as may be : but I should say about two years ; -- nay , if not detained by the factors , as I expect we shall be , for some hostile service , it may be less . ''
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 11]: Two years , thought Philip , two years from Amine !
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 16]: and he sighed deeply , for he felt that their separation might be for ever .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 28]: `` Nay , my son , two years is not so long , '' said Mynheer Kloots , who observed the passing cloud on Philip 's brow .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 23]: `` I was once five years away , and was unfortunate , for I brought home nothing , not even my ship .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 26]: I was sent to Chittagong , on the east side of the great Bay of Bengala , and lay for three months in the river .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 27]: The chiefs of the country would detain me by force ; they would not barter for my cargo , or permit me to seek another market .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 13]: My powder had been landed , and I could make no resistance .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 17]: The worms ate through the bottom of my vessel , and she sank at her anchors .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 20]: They knew it would take place , and that then they would have my cargo at their own price .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 6]: Another vessel brought us home .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 33]: Had I not been so treacherously served , I should have had no need to sail this time ; and now my gains are small , the Company forbidding all private trading .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 26]: But here he comes at last ; they have hoisted the ensign on the staff in the boat ; there -- they have shoved off .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 16]: Mynheer Hillebrant , see the gunners ready with their linstocks to salvo the supercargo . ''
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 11]: `` What duty do you wish me to perform ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 3]: observed Philip .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 9]: `` In what can I be useful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 24]: `` At present you can be of little use , except in those heavy gales in which every pair of hands is valuable .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 53]: You must look and learn for some time yet ; but you can make a fair copy of the journal kept for the inspection of the Company , and may assist me in various ways , as soon as the unpleasant nausea , felt by those who first embark , has subsided .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 42]: As a remedy , I should propose that you gird a handkerchief tight round your body so as to compress the stomach , and make frequent application of my bottle of schnapps , which you will find always at your service .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 12]: But now to receive the factor of the most puissant Company .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 10]: Mynheer Hillebrant , let them discharge the cannon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 30]: The guns were fired , and soon after the smoke had cleared away , the boat , with its long ensign trailing on the water , was pulled alongside .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 40]: Philip watched the appearance of the supercargo , but he remained in the boat until several of the boxes with the initials and arms of the Company were first handed on the deck ; at last the supercargo appeared .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 44]: He was a small , spare , wizen-faced man , with a three-cornered cocked hat , bound with broad gold lace , upon his head , under which appeared a full-bottomed flowing wig , the curls of which descended low upon his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 30]: His coat was of crimson velvet , with broad flaps : his waistcoat of white silk , worked in coloured flowers , and descending half-way down to his knees .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 17]: His breeches were of black satin , and his legs were covered with white silk stockings .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 59]: Add to this , gold buckles at his knees and in his shoes , lace ruffles to his wrists , and a silver-mounted cane in his hand , and the reader has the entire dress of Mynheer Jacob Janz Von Stroom , the supercargo of the Hon. Company , appointed to the good ship _ Ter Schilling _ .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 53]: As he looked round him , surrounded at a respectful distance by the captain , officers , and men of the ship , with their caps in their hands , the reader might be reminded of the picture of the `` Monkey who had seen the World '' surrounded by his tribe .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 65]: There was not , however , the least inclination on the part of the seamen to laugh , even at his flowing , full-bottomed wig : respect was at that period paid to dress ; and although Mynheer Von Stroom could not be mistaken for a sailor , he was known to be the supercargo of the Company , and a very great man .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 13]: He therefore received all the respect due to so important a personage .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 16]: Mynheer Von Stroom did not , however , appear very anxious to remain on deck .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 30]: He requested to be shown into his cabin , and followed the captain aft , picking his way among the coils of ropes with which his path was encumbered .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 10]: The door was opened , and the supercargo disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 48]: The ship was then got under weigh , the men had left the windlass , the sails had been trimmed , and they were securing the anchor on board , when the bell of the poop-cabin -LRB- appropriated to the supercargo -RRB- was pulled with great violence .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 7]: `` What can that be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 17]: said Mynheer Kloots -LRB- who was forward -RRB- , taking the pipe out of his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 13]: `` Mynheer Vanderdecken , will you see what is the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 45]: Philip went aft , as the pealing of the bell continued , and opening the cabin door , discovered the supercargo perched upon the table and pulling the bell-rope , which hung over its centre , with every mark of fear in his countenance .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 16]: His wig was off , and his bare skull gave him an appearance peculiarly ridiculous .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 9]: `` What is the matter , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 3]: inquired Philip .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 4]: `` Matter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 14]: spluttered Mynheer Von Stroom ; `` call the troops in with their firelocks .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 4]: Quick , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 13]: Am I to be murdered , torn to pieces , and devoured ?
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 24]: For mercy 's sake , sir , do n't stare , but do something -- look , it 's coming to the table !
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 3]: O dear !
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 4]: O dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 11]: continued the supercargo , evidently terrified out of his wits .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 65]: Philip , whose eyes had been fixed on Mynheer Von Stroom , turned them in the direction pointed out , and , much to his astonishment perceived a small bear upon the deck who was amusing himself with the supercargo 's flowing wig , which he held in his paws , tossing it about , and now and then burying his muzzle in it .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 42]: The unexpected sight of the animal was at first a shock to Philip , but a moment 's consideration assured him that the animal must be harmless , or it never would have been permitted to remain loose in the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 31]: Nevertheless , Philip had no wish to approach the animal , whose disposition he was unacquainted with , when the appearance of Mynheer Kloots put an end to his difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 9]: `` What is the matter , Mynheer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 4]: said the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 3]: `` O !
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 33]: I see : it is Johannes , '' continued the captain , going up to the bear , and saluting him with a kick , as he recovered the supercargo 's wig .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 8]: `` Out of the cabin , Johannes !
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 5]: Out , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 19]: cried Mynheer Kloots , kicking the breech of the bear till the animal had escaped through the door .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 15]: `` Mynheer Von Stroom , I am very sorry -- here is your wig .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 23]: Shut the door , Mynheer Vanderdecken , or the beast may come back , for he is very fond of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 71]: As the door was shut between Mynheer Von Stroom and the object of his terror , the little man slid off the table to the high-backed chair near it , shook out the damaged curls of his wig , and replaced it on his head ; pulled out his ruffles , and , assuming an air of magisterial importance , struck his cane on the deck , and then spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 20]: `` Mynheer Kloots , what is the meaning of this disrespect to the supercargo of the puissant Company ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 5]: `` God in Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 25]: no disrespect , Mynheer ; -- the animal is a bear , as you see ; he is very tame , even with strangers .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 5]: He belongs to me .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 11]: I have had him since he was three months old .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 6]: It was all a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 36]: The mate , Mynheer Hillebrant , put him in the cabin , that he might be out of the way while the duty was carrying on , and he quite forgot that he was here .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 26]: I am very sorry , Mynheer Von Stroom ; but he will not come here again , unless you wish to play with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 5]: `` Play with him !
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 2]: I !
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 10]: supercargo to the Company , play with a bear !
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 12]: Mynheer Kloots , the animal must be thrown overboard immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 31]: `` Nay , nay ; I can not throw overboard an animal that I hold in much affection , Mynheer Von Stroom ; but he shall not trouble you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 23]: `` Then , Captain Kloots , you will have to deal with the Company , to whom I shall represent the affair .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 14]: Your charter will be cancelled , and your freight-money will be forfeited . ''
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 26]: Kloots was , like most Dutchmen , not a little obstinate , and this imperative behaviour on the part of the supercargo raised his bile .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 20]: `` There is nothing in the charter that prevents my having an animal on board , '' replied Kloots .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 113]: `` By the regulations of the Company , '' replied Von Stroom , falling back in his chair with an important air , and crossing his thin legs , `` you are required to receive on board strange and curious animals , sent home by the governors and factors to be presented to crowned heads , -- such as lions , tigers , elephants , and other productions of the East ; -- but in no instance is it permitted to the commanders of chartered ships to receive on board , on their own account , animals of any description , which must be considered under the offence of private trading . ''
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 13]: `` My bear is not for sale , Mynheer Von Stroom . ''
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 30]: `` It must immediately be sent out of the ship , Mynheer Kloots ; I order you to send it away , -- on your peril to refuse . ''
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 24]: `` Then we will drop the anchor again , Mynheer Von Stroom , and send on shore to head-quarters to decide the point .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 38]: If the Company insists that the brute be put on shore , be it so ; but recollect , Mynheer Von Stroom , we shall lose the protection of the fleet , and have to sail alone .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 9]: Shall I drop the anchor , Mynheer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 34]: This observation softened down the pertinacity of the supercargo ; he had no wish to sail alone , and the fear of this contingency was more powerful than the fear of the bear .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 35]: `` Mynheer Kloots , I will not be too severe ; if the animal is chained , so that it does not approach me , I will consent to its remaining on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 47]: `` I will keep it out of your way as much as I can ; but as for chaining up the poor animal , it will howl all day and night , and you will have no sleep , Mynheer Von Stroom , '' replied Kloots .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 31]: The supercargo , who perceived that the captain was positive , and that his threats were disregarded , did all that a man could do who could not help himself .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 35]: He vowed vengeance in his own mind , and then , with an air of condescension , observed : `` Upon those conditions , Mynheer Kloots , your animal may remain on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 63]: Mynheer Kloots and Philip then left the cabin ; the former , who was in no very good humour , muttering as he walked away -- `` If the Company send their _ monkeys _ on board , I think I may well have my _ bear _ '' And , pleased with his joke , Mynheer Kloots recovered his good humour .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 23]: Chapter IX We must allow the Indian fleet to pursue its way to the Cape with every variety of wind and weather .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 21]: Some had parted company ; but the rendezvous was Table Bay , from which they were again to start together .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 12]: Philip Vanderdecken was soon able to render some service on board .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 47]: He studied his duty diligently , for employment prevented him from dwelling too much upon the cause of his embarkation , and he worked hard at the duties of the ship , for the exercise procured for him that sleep which otherwise would have been denied .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 37]: He was soon a favourite of the captain , and intimate with Hillebrant , the first mate ; the second mate , Struys , was a morose young man , with whom he had little intercourse .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 19]: As for the supercargo , Mynheer Jacob Janz Von Stroom , he seldom ventured out of his cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 79]: The bear Johannes was not confined , and therefore Mynheer Von Stroom confined himself ; hardly a day passed that he did not look over a letter which he had framed upon the subject , all ready to forward to the Company ; and each time that he perused it he made some alteration , which he considered would give additional force to his complaint , and would prove still more injurious to the interests of Captain Kloots .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 31]: In the meantime , in happy ignorance of all that was passing in the poop-cabin , Mynheer Kloots smoked his pipe , drank his schnapps , and played with Johannes .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 20]: The animal had also contracted a great affection for Philip , and used to walk the watch with him .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 43]: There was another party in the ship whom we must not lose sight of -- the one-eyed pilot , Schriften , who appeared to have imbibed a great animosity towards our hero , as well as to his dumb favourite the bear .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 36]: As Philip held the rank of an officer , Schriften dared not openly affront , though he took every opportunity of annoying him , and was constantly inveighing against him before the ship 's company .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 27]: To the bear he was more openly inveterate , and seldom passed it without bestowing upon it a severe kick , accompanied with a horrid curse .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 34]: Although no one on board appeared to be fond of this man , everybody appeared to be afraid of him , and he had obtained a control over the seamen which appeared unaccountable .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 36]: Such was the state of affairs on board the good ship _ Ter Schilling _ , when , in company with two others , she lay becalmed about two days ' sail to the Cape .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 44]: The weather was intensely hot , for it was the summer in those southern latitudes , and Philip , who had been lying down under the awning spread over the poop , was so overcome with the heat that he had fallen asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 62]: He awoke with a shivering sensation of cold over his whole body , particularly at his chest , and half-opening his eyes , he perceived the pilot , Schriften , leaning over him , and holding between his finger and his thumb a portion of the chain which had not been concealed , and to which was attached the sacred relic .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 48]: Philip closed them again , to ascertain what were the man 's intentions : he found that he gradually dragged out the chain , and , when the relic was clear , attempted to pass the whole over his head , evidently to gain possession of it .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 13]: Upon his attempt Philip started up and seized him by the waist .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 19]: cried Philip , with an indignant look , as he released the chain from the pilot 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 36]: But Schriften appeared not in the least confused at being detected in his attempt : looking with his malicious one eye at Philip , he mockingly observed : `` Does that chain hold her picture ?
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 3]: -- he !
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 3]: he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 12]: Vanderdecken rose , pushed him away , and folded his arms .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 21]: `` I advise you not to be quite so curious , Master Pilot , or you may repent it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 32]: `` Or perhaps , '' continued the pilot , quite regardless of Philip 's wrath , `` it may be a child 's caul , a sovereign remedy against drowning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 13]: `` Go forward to your duty , sir , '' cried Philip .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 31]: `` Or , as you are a Catholic , the finger-nail of a saint ; or , yes , I have it -- a piece of the holy cross . ''
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 3]: Philip started .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 5]: `` That 's it !
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 5]: that 's it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 17]: cried Schriften , who now went forward to where the seamen were standing at the gangway .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 9]: `` News for you , my lads ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 23]: said he ; `` we 've a bit of the holy cross aboard , and so we may defy the devil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 32]: Philip , hardly knowing why , had followed Schriften as he descended the poop-ladder , and was forward on the quarter-deck , when the pilot made this remark to the seamen .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 3]: `` Ay !
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 3]: ay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 24]: replied an old seaman to the pilot ; `` not only the devil , but the _ Flying Dutchman _ to boot . ''
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 18]: `` The _ Flying Dutchman _ '' thought Philip , `` can that refer to -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 30]: and Philip walked a step or two forward , so as to conceal himself behind the mainmast , hoping to obtain some information , should they continue the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 7]: In this he was not disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 23]: `` They say that to meet with him is worse than meeting with the devil , '' observed another of the crew .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 7]: `` Who ever saw him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 3]: said another .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 26]: `` He has been seen , that 's sartain , and just as sartain that ill-luck follows the vessel that falls in with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 12]: `` And where is he to be fallen in with ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 3]: `` O !
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 16]: they say that 's not so sartain -- but he cruises off the Cape . ''
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 20]: `` I should like to know the whole long and short of the story , '' said a third .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 10]: `` I can only tell what I 've heard .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 21]: It 's a doomed vessel ; they were pirates , and cut the captain 's throat , I believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 3]: no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 17]: cried Schriften , `` the captain is in her now -- and a villain he was .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 30]: They say that , like somebody else on board of us now , he left a very pretty wife , and that he was very fond of her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 10]: `` How do they know that , pilot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 19]: `` Because he always wants to send letters home when he boards vessels that he falls in with .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 12]: But , woe to the vessel that takes charge of them !
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 15]: -- she is sure to be lost , with every soul on board ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 16]: `` I wonder where you heard all this , '' said one of the men .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 9]: `` Did you ever see the vessel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 7]: `` Yes , I did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 44]: screamed Schriften ; but , as if recovering himself , his scream subsided into his usual giggle , and he added , `` but we need not fear her , boys ; we 've a bit of the true cross on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 19]: Schriften then walked aft as if to avoid being questioned , when he perceived Philip by the mainmast .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 11]: `` So , I 'm not the only one curious ?
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 3]: -- he !
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 2]: he !
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 20]: Pray did you bring that on board , in case we should fall in with the _ Flying Dutchman ?
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 17]: _ '' `` I fear no _ Flying Dutchman _ , '' replied Philip , confused .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 27]: `` Now I think of it , you are of the same name ; at least they say that his name was Vanderdecken -- eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 37]: `` There are many Vanderdeckens in the world besides me , '' replied Philip , who had recovered his composure ; and having made this reply , he walked away to the poop of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 26]: `` One would almost imagine this malignant one-eyed wretch was aware of the cause of my embarkation , '' mused Philip ; `` but no !
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 5]: that can not be .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 12]: Why do I feel such a chill whenever he approaches me ?
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 21]: I wonder if others do ; or whether it is a mere fancy on the part of Amine and myself .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 6]: I dare ask no questions .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 15]: -- Strange , too , that the man should feel such malice towards me .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 5]: I never injured him .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 14]: What I have just overheard confirms all ; but there needed no confirmation .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 4]: Oh , Amine !
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 2]: Amine !
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 18]: but for thee , and I would rejoice to solve this riddle at the expense of life .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 25]: God in mercy check the current of my brain , '' muttered Philip , `` or my reason can not hold its seat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 30]: In three days the _ Ter Schilling _ and her consorts arrived at Table Bay , where they found the remainder of the fleet at anchor waiting for them .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 54]: Just at that period the Dutch had formed a settlement at the Cape of Good Hope , where the Indian fleets used to water and obtain cattle from the Hottentot tribes who lived on the coast , and who for a brass button or a large nail would willingly offer a fat bullock .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 58]: A few days were occupied in completing the water of the squadron , and then the ships , having received from the Admiral their instructions as to the rendezvous in case of parting company , and made every preparation for the bad weather which they anticipated , again weighed their anchors , and proceeded on their voyage .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 49]: For three days they beat against light and baffling winds , making but little progress ; on the third , the breeze sprang up strong from the southward , until it increased to a gale , and the fleet were blown down to the northward of the bay .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 19]: On the seventh day the _ Ter Schilling _ found herself alone , but the weather had moderated .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 25]: Sail was again made upon the vessel , and her head put to the eastward , that she might run in for the land .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 46]: `` We are unfortunate in thus parting with all our consorts , '' observed Mynheer Kloots to Philip , as they were standing at the gangway ; `` but it must be near meridian , and the sun will enable me to discover our latitude .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 22]: It is difficult to say how far we may have been swept by the gale and the currents to the northward .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 24]: Boy , bring up my cross-staff , and be mindful that you do not strike it against anything as you come up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 30]: The cross-staff at that time was the simple instrument used to discover the latitude , which it would give to a nice observer to within five or ten miles .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 12]: Quadrants and sextants were the invention of a much later period .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 53]: Indeed , considering that they had so little knowledge of navigation and the variation of the compass , and that their easting and westing could only be computed by dead reckoning , it is wonderful how our ancestors traversed the ocean in the way they did , with comparatively so few accidents .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 25]: `` We are full three degrees to the northward of the Cape , '' observed Mynheer Kloots , after he had computed his latitude .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 28]: `` The currents must be running strong ; the wind is going down fast , and we shall have a change , if I mistake not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 63]: Towards the evening it fell calm , with a heavy swell setting towards the shore ; shoals of seals appeared on the surface , following the vessel as she drove before the swell ; the fish darted and leaped in every direction , and the ocean around them appeared to be full of life as the sun slowly descended to the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 9]: `` What is that noise we hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 11]: observed Philip ; `` it sounds like distant thunder . ''
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 10]: `` I hear it , '' replied Mynheer Kloots .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 11]: `` Aloft there ; do you see the land ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 17]: `` Yes , '' replied the man , after a pause in ascending the topmast shrouds .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 16]: `` It is right ahead -- low sand-hills , and the sea breaking high . ''
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 10]: `` Then that must be the noise we hear .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 9]: We sweep in fast with this heavy ground-swell .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 9]: I wish the breeze would spring up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 45]: The sun was dipping under the horizon , and the calm still continued : the swell had driven the _ Ter Schilling _ so rapidly on the shore that now they could see the breakers , which fell over with the noise of thunder .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 10]: `` Do you know the coast , pilot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 10]: observed the captain to Schriften , who stood by .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 19]: `` Know it well , '' replied Schriften ; `` the sea breaks in twelve fathoms at least .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 21]: In half an hour the good ship will be beaten into toothpicks , without a breeze to help us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 12]: And the little man giggled as if pleased at the idea .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 23]: The anxiety of Mynheer Kloots was not to be concealed ; his pipe was every moment in and out of his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 22]: The crew remained in groups on the forecastle and gangway , listening with dismay to the fearful roaring of the breakers .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 30]: The sun had sunk down below the horizon , and the gloom of night was gradually adding to the alarm of the crew of the _ Ter Schilling _ .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 25]: `` We must lower down the boats , '' said Mynheer Kloots to the first mate , `` and try to tow her off .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 32]: We can not do much good , I 'm afraid ; but at all events the boats will be ready for the men to get into before she drives on shore .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 21]: Get the tow ropes out and lower down the boats , while I go in to acquaint the supercargo . ''
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 25]: Mynheer Von Stroom was sitting in all the dignity of his office , and it being Sunday had put on his very best wig .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 59]: He was once more reading over the letter to the Company , relative to the bear , when Mynheer Kloots made his appearance , and informed him in a few words that they were in a situation of peculiar danger , and that in all probability the ship would be in pieces in less than half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 30]: At this alarming intelligence , Mynheer Von Stroom jumped up from his chair , and in his hurry and fear knocked down the candle which had just been lighted .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 4]: `` In danger !
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 3]: Mynheer Kloots !
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 12]: -- why , the water is smooth and the wind down !
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 11]: My hat -- where is my hat and my cane ?
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 6]: I will go on deck .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 2]: Quick !
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 25]: A light -- Mynheer Kloots , if you please to order a light to be brought ; I can find nothing in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 9]: Mynheer Kloots , why do you not answer ?
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 4]: Mercy on me !
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 9]: he is gone and has left me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 15]: Mynheer Kloots had gone to fetch a light , and now returned with it .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 15]: Mynheer Von Stroom put on his hat , and walked out of the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 51]: The boats were down and the ship 's head had been turned round from the land ; but it was now quite dark , and nothing was to be seen but the white line of foam created by the breakers as they dashed with an awful noise against the shore .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 15]: `` Mynheer Kloots , if you please , I 'll leave the ship directly .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 26]: Let my boat come alongside -- I must have the largest boat for the Honourable Company 's service -- for the papers and myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 43]: `` I 'm afraid not , Mynheer Von Stroom , '' replied Kloots ; `` our boats will hardly hold the men as it is , and every man 's life is as valuable to himself as yours is to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 12]: `` But , Mynheer , I am the Company 's supercargo .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 15]: I order you -- I will have one -- refuse if you dare . ''
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 21]: `` I dare , and do refuse , '' replied the captain , taking his pipe out of his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 34]: `` Well , well , '' replied Mynheer Von Stroom , who now lost all presence of mind -- `` we will , sir as soon as we arrive -- Lord help us !
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 5]: -- we are lost .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 3]: O Lord !
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 4]: O Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 46]: And here Mynheer Von Stroom , not knowing why , hurried down to the cabin , and in his haste tumbled over the bear Johannes , who crossed his path , and in his fall his hat and flowing wig parted company with his head .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 4]: `` O mercy !
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 4]: where am I ?
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 5]: Help -- help here !
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 8]: for the Company 's honourable supercargo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 26]: `` Cast off there in the boats , and come on board , '' cried Mynheer Kloots ; `` we have no time to spare .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 26]: Quick now , Philip , put in the compass , the water , and the biscuit ; we must leave her in five minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 21]: So appalling was the roar of the breakers , that it was with difficulty that the orders could be heard .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 20]: In the meantime Mynheer Von Stroom lay upon the deck , kicking , sprawling , and crying for help .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 19]: `` There is a light breeze off the shore , '' cried Philip , holding up his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 13]: `` There is , but I 'm afraid it is too late .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 14]: Hand the things into the boats , and be cool , my men .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 15]: We have yet a chance of saving her , if the wind freshens . ''
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 40]: They were now so near to the breakers that they felt the swell in which the vessel lay becalmed turned over here and there on its long line , but the breeze freshened , and the vessel was stationary !
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 23]: the men were all in the boats , with the exception of Mynheer Kloots , the mates , and Mynheer Von Stroom .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 12]: `` She goes through the water now , '' said Philip .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 37]: `` Yes , I think we shall save her , '' replied the captain : `` steady as you go , Hillebrant , '' continued he to the first mate , who was at the helm .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 16]: `` We leave the breakers now -- only let the breeze hold ten minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 46]: The breeze was steady , the _ Ter Schilling _ stood off from the land , again it fell calm , and again she was swept towards the breakers ; at last the breeze came off strong , and the vessel cleaved through the water .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 43]: The men were called out of the boats ; Mynheer Von Stroom was picked up along with his hat and wig , carried into the cabin , and in less than an hour the _ Ter Schilling _ was out of danger .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 34]: `` Now we will hoist up the boats , '' said Mynheer Kloots , `` and let us all , before we lie down to sleep , thank God for our deliverance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 36]: During that night the _ Ter Schilling _ made an offing of twenty miles , and then stood to the southward ; towards the morning the wind again fell , and it was nearly calm .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 43]: Mynheer Kloots had been on deck about an hour , and had been talking with Hillebrant upon the danger of the evening , and the selfishness and pusillanimity of Mynheer Von Stroom , when a loud noise was heard in the poop-cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 7]: `` What can that be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 16]: said the captain ; `` has the good man lost his senses from the fright ?
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 11]: Why , he is knocking the cabin to pieces . ''
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 14]: At this moment the servant of the supercargo ran out of the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 19]: `` Mynheer Kloots , hasten in -- help my master -- he will be killed -- the bear !
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 5]: -- the bear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 4]: `` The bear !
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 5]: what ; Johannes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 4]: cried Mynheer Kloots .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 12]: `` Why , the animal is as tame as a dog .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 7]: I will go and see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 19]: But before Mynheer Kloots could walk into the cabin , out flew in his shirt the affrighted supercargo .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 4]: `` My God !
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 3]: my God !
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 6]: am I to be murdered ?
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 5]: -- eaten alive ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 13]: cried he , running forward , and attempting to climb the fore-rigging .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 45]: Mynheer Kloots followed the motions of Mynheer Von Stroom with surprise , and when he found him attempting to mount the rigging , he turned aft and walked into the cabin , when he found to his surprise that Johannes was indeed doing mischief .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 56]: The panelling of the state cabin of the supercargo had been beaten down , the wig boxes lay in fragments on the floor , the two spare wigs were lying by them , and upon them were strewed fragments of broken pots and masses of honey , which Johannes was licking up with peculiar gusto .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 31]: The fact was , that when the ship anchored at Table Bay , Mynheer Von Stroom , who was very partial to honey , had obtained some from the Hottentots .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 37]: The honey his careful servant had stowed away in jars , which he had placed at the bottom of the two long boxes , ready for his master 's use during the remainder of the voyage .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 33]: That morning , the servant fancying that the wig of the previous night had suffered when his master tumbled over the bear , opened one of the boxes to take out another .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 13]: Johannes happened to come near the door , and scented the honey .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 26]: Now , partial as Mynheer Von Stroom was to honey , all bears are still more so , and will venture everything to obtain it .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 55]: Johannes had yielded to the impulse of his species , and , following the scent , had come into the cabin , and was about to enter the sleeping-berth of Mynheer Stroom , when the servant slammed the door in his face ; whereupon Johannes beat in the panels , and found an entrance .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 37]: He then attacked the wig-boxes , and , by showing a most formidable set of teeth , proved to the servant , who attempted to drive him off , that he would not be trifled with .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 36]: In the meanwhile , Mynheer Von Stroom was in the utmost terror : not aware of the purport of the bear 's visit , he imagined that the animal 's object was to attack him .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 60]: His servant took to his heels after a vain effort to save the last box , and Mynheer Von Stroom , then finding himself alone , at length sprang out of his bed-place , and escaped as we have mentioned to the forecastle , leaving Johannes master of the field , and luxuriating upon the _ spolia opima _ .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 9]: Mynheer Kloots immediately perceived how the case stood .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 31]: He went up to the bear and spoke to him , then kicked him , but the bear would not leave the honey , and growled furiously at the interruption .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 33]: `` This is a bad job for you , Johannes , '' observed Mynheer Kloots ; `` now you will leave the ship , for the supercargo has just grounds of complaint .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 4]: Oh , well !
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 11]: you must eat the honey , because you will . ''
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 44]: So saying , Mynheer Kloots left the cabin , and went to look after the supercargo , who remained on the forecastle , with his bald head and meagre body , haranguing the men in his shirt , which fluttered in the breeze .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 27]: `` I am very sorry , Mynheer Von Stroom , '' said Kloots , `` but the bear shall be sent out of the vessel . ''
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 36]: `` Yes , yes , Mynheer Kloots , but this is an affair for the most puissant Company -- the lives of their servants are not to be sacrificed to the folly of a sea-captain .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 9]: I have nearly been torn to pieces . ''
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 19]: `` The animal did not want you ; all he wanted was the honey , '' replied Kloots .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 16]: `` He has got it , and I myself can not take it from him .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 10]: There is no altering the nature of an animal .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 17]: Will you be pleased to walk down into my cabin until the beast can be secured ?
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 8]: He shall not go loose again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 38]: Mynheer Von Stroom , who considered his dignity at variance with his appearance , and who perhaps was aware that majesty deprived of its externals was only a jest , thought it advisable to accept the offer .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 43]: After some trouble , with the assistance of the seamen , the bear was secured and dragged away from the cabin , much against his will , for he had still some honey to lick off the curls of the full-bottomed wigs .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 21]: He was put into durance vile , having been caught in the flagrant act of burglary on the high seas .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 28]: This new adventure was the topic of the day , for it was again a dead calm , and the ship lay motionless on the glassy wave .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 39]: `` The sun looks red as he sinks , '' observed Hillebrant to the captain , who with Philip was standing on the poop ; `` we shall have wind before to-morrow , if I mistake not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 12]: `` I am of your opinion , '' replied Mynheer Kloots .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 19]: `` It is strange that we do not fall in with any of the vessels of the fleet .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 10]: They must all have been driven down here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 10]: `` Perhaps they have kept a wider offing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 17]: `` It had been as well if we had done the same , '' said Kloots .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 9]: `` That was a narrow escape last night .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 18]: There is such a thing as having too little as well as having too much wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 28]: A confused noise was heard among the seamen who were collected together , and looking in the direction of the vessel 's quarter , `` A ship !
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 8]: No -- Yes , it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 6]: was repeated more than once .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 17]: `` They think they see a ship , '' said Schriften , coming on the poop .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 3]: `` He !
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 3]: he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 7]: `` There in the gloom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 19]: said the pilot , pointing to the darkest quarter in the horizon , for the sun had set .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 26]: The captain , Hillebrant , and Philip directed their eyes to the quarter pointed out , and thought they could perceive something like a vessel .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 22]: Gradually the gloom seemed to clear away , and a lambent pale blaze to light up that part of the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 37]: Not a breath of wind was on the water -- the sea was like a mirror -- more and more distinct did the vessel appear , till her hull , masts and yards were clearly visible .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 22]: They looked and rubbed their eyes to help their vision , for scarcely could they believe that which they did see .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 70]: In the centre of the pale light , which extended about fifteen degrees above the horizon , there was indeed a large ship about three miles distant ; but , although it was a perfect calm , she was to all appearance buffeting in a violent gale , plunging and lifting over a surface that was smooth as glass , now careening to her bearing , then recovering herself .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 34]: Her topsails and mainsail were furled , and the yards pointed to the wind ; she had no sail set , but a close-reefed fore-sail , a storm stay-sail , and trysail abaft .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 23]: She made little way through the water , but apparently neared them fast , driven down by the force of the gale .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 9]: Each minute she was plainer to the view .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 97]: At last , she was seen to wear , and in so doing , before she was brought to the wind on the other tack , she was so close to them that they could distinguish the men on board : they could see the foaming water as it was hurled from her bows ; hear the shrill whistle of the boatswain 's pipes , the creaking of the ship 's timbers , and the complaining of her masts ; and then the gloom gradually rose , and in a few seconds she had totally disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 6]: `` God in heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 4]: exclaimed Mynheer Kloots .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 17]: Philip felt a hand upon his shoulder , and the cold darted through his whole frame .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 28]: He turned round and met the one eye of Schriften , who screamed in his ear -- `` PHILIP VANDERDECKEN -- That 's the _ Flying Dutchman !
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 35]: _ '' Chapter X The sudden gloom which had succeeded to the pale light had the effect of rendering every object still more indistinct to the astonished crew of the _ Ter Schilling _ .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 16]: For a moment or more not a word was uttered by a soul on board .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 27]: Some remained with their eyes still strained towards the point where the apparition had been seen , others turned away full of gloomy and foreboding thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 41]: Hillebrant was the first who spoke : turning round to the eastern quarter , and observing a light on the horizon , he started , and seizing Philip by the arm , cried out , `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 19]: `` That is only the moon rising from the bank of clouds , '' replied Philip , mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 34]: observed Mynheer Kloots , wiping his forehead , which was damp with perspiration , `` I _ have _ been told of this before , but I have mocked at the narration . ''
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 5]: Philip made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 25]: Aware of the reality of the vision , and how deeply it interested him , he felt as if he were a guilty person .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 21]: The moon had now risen above the clouds , and was pouring her mild pale light over the slumbering ocean .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 30]: With a simultaneous impulse , everyone directed his eyes to the spot where the strange vision had last been seen ; and all was a dead , dead calm .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 51]: Since the apparition , the pilot , Schriften , had remained on the poop ; he now gradually approached Mynheer Kloots , and looking round , said -- `` Mynheer Kloots , as pilot of this vessel , I tell you that you must prepare for very bad weather . ''
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 5]: `` Bad weather ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 10]: said Kloots , rousing himself from a deep reverie .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 9]: `` Yes , bad weather , Mynheer Kloots .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 23]: There never was a vessel which fell in with -- what we have just seen , but met with disaster soon afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 10]: The very name of Vanderdecken is unlucky -- He !
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 3]: he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 18]: Philip would have replied to the sarcasm , but he could not , his tongue was tied .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 13]: `` What has the name of Vanderdecken to do with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 3]: observed Kloots .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 8]: `` Have you not heard , then ?
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 21]: The captain of that vessel we have just seen is a Mynheer Vanderdecken -- he is the Flying Dutchman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 9]: `` How know you that , pilot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 3]: inquired Hillebrant .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 50]: `` I know that , and much more , if I chose to tell , '' replied Schriften ; `` but never mind , I have warned you of bad weather , as is my duty ; '' and , with these words , Schriften went down the poop-ladder .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 5]: `` God in heaven !
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 16]: I never was so puzzled and so frightened in my life , '' observed Kloots .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 11]: `` I do n't know what to think or say .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 7]: -- What think you , Philip ?
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 6]: was it not supernatural ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 9]: `` Yes , '' replied Philip , mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 9]: `` I have no doubt of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 43]: `` I thought the days of miracles had passed , '' said the captain , `` and that we were now left to our own exertions , and had no other warnings but those the appearance of the heavens gave us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 11]: `` And they warn us now , '' observed Hillebrant .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 43]: `` See how that bank of clouds has risen within these five minutes -- the moon has escaped from it , but it will soon catch her again -- and see , there is a flash of lightning in the north-west . ''
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 22]: `` Well , my sons , I can brave the elements as well as any man , and do my best .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 24]: I have cared little for gales or stress of weather ; but I like not such a warning as we have had to-night .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 14]: My heart 's as heavy as lead , and that 's the truth .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 22]: Philip , send down for the bottle of schnapps , if it is only to clear my brain a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 27]: Philip was glad of an opportunity to quit the poop ; he wished to have a few minutes to recover himself and collect his own thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 79]: The appearance of the Phantom Ship had been to him a dreadful shock -- not that he had not fully believed in its existence ; but still , to have beheld , to have been so near that vessel -- that vessel in which his father was fulfilling his awful doom -- that vessel on board of which he felt sure that his own destiny was to be worked out -- had given a whirl to his brain .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 41]: When he had heard the sound of the boatswain 's whistle on board of her , eagerly had he stretched his hearing to catch the order given -- and given , he was convinced , in his father 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 25]: Nor had his eyes been less called to aid in his attempt to discover the features and dress of those moving on her decks .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 84]: As soon , then , as he had sent the boy up to Mynheer Kloots , Philip hastened to his cabin and buried his face in the coverlet of his bed , and then he prayed -- prayed until he had recovered his usual energy and courage , and had brought his mind to that state of composure which could enable him to look forward calmly to danger and difficulty , and feel prepared to meet it with the heroism of a martyr .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 10]: Philip remained below not more than half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 14]: On his return to the deck , what a change had taken place !
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 23]: He had left the vessel floating motionless on the still waters , with her lofty sails hanging down listlessly from the yards .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 25]: The moon then soared aloft in her beauty , reflecting the masts and sails of the ship in extended lines upon the smooth sea .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 64]: Now all was dark : the water rippled short and broke in foam ; the smaller and lofty sails had been taken in , and the vessel was cleaving through the water ; and the wind , in fitful gusts and angry moanings , proclaimed too surely that it had been awakened up to wrath , and was gathering its strength for destruction .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 16]: The men were still busy reducing the sails , but they worked gloomily and discontentedly .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 34]: What Schriften , the pilot , had said to them , Philip knew not , but that they avoided him and appeared to look upon him with feelings of ill-will , was evident .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 7]: And each minute the gale increased .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 32]: `` The wind is not steady , '' observed Hillebrant ; `` there is no saying from which quarter the storm may blow : it has already veered round five points .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 26]: Philip , I do n't much like the appearance of things , and I may say with the captain that my heart is heavy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 26]: `` And , indeed , so is mine , '' replied Philip ; `` but we are in the hands of a merciful Providence . ''
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 4]: `` Hard a-port !
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 4]: flatten in forward !
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 8]: brail up the trysail , my men !
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 4]: Be smart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 28]: cried Kloots , as from the wind 's chopping round to the northward and westward , the ship was taken aback , and careened low before it .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 27]: The rain now came down in torrents , and it was so dark that it was with difficulty they could perceive each other on the deck .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 17]: `` We must clew up the topsails , while the men can get upon the yards .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 9]: See to it forward , Mr Hillebrant . ''
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 13]: The lightning now darted athwart the firmament , and the thunder pealed .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 3]: `` Quick !
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 11]: quick , my men , let 's furl all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 31]: The sailors shook the water from their streaming clothes , some worked , others took advantage of the night to hide themselves away , and commune with their own fears .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 26]: All canvas was now taken off the ship , except the fore-staysail , and she flew to the southward with the wind on her quarter .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 39]: The sea had now risen , and roared as it curled in foam , the rain fell in torrents , the night was dark as Erebus , and the wet and frightened sailors sheltered themselves under the bulwarks .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 18]: Although many had deserted from their duty , there was not one who ventured below that night .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 17]: They did not collect together as usual -- every man preferred solitude and his own thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 13]: The Phantom Ship dwelt on their imaginations , and oppressed their brains .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 17]: It was an interminably long and terrible night -- they thought the day would never come .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 17]: At last the darkness gradually changed to a settled sullen grey gloom -- which was day .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 17]: They looked at each other , but found no comfort in meeting each other 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 16]: There was no one countenance in which a beam of hope could be found lurking .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 21]: They were all doomed -- they remained crouched where they had sheltered themselves during the night , and said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 18]: The sea had now risen mountains high , and more than once had struck the ship abaft .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 32]: Kloots was at the binnacle , Hillebrant and Philip at the helm , when a wave curled high over the quarter , and poured itself in resistless force upon the deck .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 54]: The captain and his two mates were swept away , and dashed almost senseless against the bulwarks -- the binnacle and compass were broken into fragments -- no one ran to the helm -- the vessel broached to -- the seas broke clear over her , and the mainmast went by the board .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 4]: All was confusion .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 24]: Captain Kloots was stunned , and it was with difficulty that Philip could persuade two of the men to assist him down below .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 38]: Hillebrant had been more unfortunate -- his right arm was broken , and he was otherwise severely bruised ; Philip assisted him to his berth , and then went on deck again to try and restore order .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 33]: Philip Vanderdecken was not yet much of a seaman , but , at all events , he exercised that moral influence over the men which is ever possessed by resolution and courage .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 24]: Obey willingly they did not , but they did obey , and in half an hour the vessel was clear of the wreck .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 25]: Eased by the loss of her heavy mast , and steered by two of her best seamen , she again flew before the gale .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 12]: Where was Mynheer Von Stroom during all this work of destruction ?
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 44]: In his bed-place , covered up with the clothes , trembling in every limb , and vowing that if ever again he put his foot on shore , not all the companies in the world should induce him to trust to salt-water again .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 11]: It certainly was the best plan for the poor man .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 51]: But although for a time the men obeyed the orders of Philip , they were soon seen talking earnestly with the one-eyed pilot , and after a consultation of a quarter of an hour , they all left the deck , with the exception of the two at the helm .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 29]: Their reasons for so doing were soon apparent -- several returned with cans full of liquor , which they had obtained by forcing the hatches of the spirit-room .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 57]: For about an hour Philip remained on deck , persuading the men not to intoxicate themselves , but in vain ; the cans of grog offered to the men at the wheel were not refused , and , in a short time , the yawing of the vessel proved that the liquor had taken its effect .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 18]: Philip then hastened down below to ascertain if Mynheer Kloots was sufficiently recovered to come on deck .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 28]: He found him sunk into a deep sleep , and with difficulty it was that he roused him , and made him acquainted with the distressing intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 39]: Mynheer Kloots followed Philip on deck , but he still suffered from his fall : his head was confused , and he reeled as he walked , as if he also had been making free with the liquor .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 39]: When he had been on deck a few minutes , he sank down on one of the guns in a state of perfect helplessness ; he had , in fact , received a severe concussion of the brain .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 26]: Hillebrant was too severely injured to be able to move from his bed , and Philip was now aware of the helplessness of their situation .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 20]: Daylight gradually disappeared , and , as darkness came upon them , so did the scene become more appalling .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 35]: The vessel still ran before the gale , but the men at the helm had evidently changed her course , as the wind that was on the starboard was now on the larboard quarter .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 34]: But compass there was none on deck , and , even if there had been , the men in their drunken state would have refused to listen to Philip 's orders or expostulations .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 32]: `` He , '' they said , `` was no sailor , and was not to teach them how to steer the ship '' The gale was now at its height .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 55]: The rain had ceased , but the wind had increased , and it roared as it urged on the vessel , which , steered so wide by the drunken sailors , shipped seas over each gunnel ; but the men laughed and joined the chorus of their songs to the howling of the gale .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 16]: Schriften , the pilot , appeared to be the leader of the ship 's company .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 47]: With the can of liquor in his hand , he danced and sang , snapped his fingers , and , like a demon , peered with his one eye upon Philip ; and then would he fall and roll with screams of laughter in the scuppers .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 13]: More liquor was handed up as fast as it was called for .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 56]: Oaths , shrieks , laughter , were mingled together ; the men at the helm lashed it amidships , and hastened to join their companions , and the _ Ter Schilling _ flew before the gale ; the fore-staysail being the only sail set , checking her as she yawed to starboard or to port .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 8]: Philip remained on deck by the poop-ladder .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 79]: `` Strange , '' thought he , `` that I should stand here , the only one left now capable of acting , -- that I should be fated to look by myself upon this scene of horror and disgust -- should here wait the severing of this vessel 's timbers , -- the loss of life which must accompany it , -- the only one calm and collected , or aware of what must soon take place .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 40]: God forgive me , but I appear , useless and impotent as I am , to stand here like the master of the storm , -- separated as it were from my brother mortals by my own peculiar destiny .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 5]: It must be so .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 40]: This wreck then must not be for me , -- I feel that it is not , -- that I have a charmed life , or rather a protracted one , to fulfil the oath I registered in heaven .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 29]: But the wind is not so loud , surely the water is not so rough : my forebodings may be wrong , and all may yet be saved .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 4]: Heaven grant it !
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 30]: For how melancholy , how lamentable is it , to behold men created in God 's own image , leaving the world , disgraced below the brute creation ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 19]: Philip was right in supposing that the wind was not so strong , nor the sea so high .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 47]: The vessel , after running to the southward till past Table Bay , had , by the alteration made in her course , entered into False Bay , where , to a certain degree , she was sheltered from the violence of the winds and waves .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 46]: But , although the water was smoother , the waves were still more than sufficient to beat to pieces any vessel that might be driven on shore at the bottom of the bay , to which point the _ Ter Schilling _ was now running .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 47]: The bay so far offered a fair chance of escape , as , instead of the rocky coast outside -LRB- against which , had the vessel run , a few seconds would have insured her destruction -RRB- , there was a shelving beach of loose sand .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 33]: But of this Philip could , of course , have no knowledge , for the land at the entrance of the Bay had been passed unperceived in the darkness of the night .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 21]: About twenty minutes more had elapsed , when Philip observed that the whole sea around them was one continued foam .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 24]: He had hardly time for conjecture before the ship struck heavily on the sands , and the remaining masts fell by the board .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 48]: The crash of the falling masts , the heavy beating of the ship on the sands , which caused many of her timbers to part , with a whole sea which swept clean over the fated vessel , checked the songs and drunken revelry of the crew .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 23]: Another minute , and the vessel was swung round on her broadside to the sea , and lay on her beam ends .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 34]: Philip , who was to windward , clung to the bulwark , while the intoxicated seamen floundered in the water to leeward , and attempted to gain the other side of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 47]: Much to Philip 's horror , he perceived the body of Mynheer Kloots sink down in the water -LRB- which now was several feet deep on the lee side of the deck -RRB- without any apparent effort on the part of the captain to save himself .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 13]: He was then gone , and there were no hopes for him .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 23]: Philip thought of Hillebrant , and hastened down below ; he found him still in his bed-place , lying against the side .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 33]: He lifted him out , and with difficulty climbed with him on deck , and laid him in the long-boat on the booms , as the best chance of saving his life .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 51]: To this boat , the only one which could be made available , the crew had also repaired ; but they repulsed Philip , who would have got into her ; and , as the sea made clean breakers over them , they cast loose the lashings which confined her .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 51]: With the assistance of another heavy sea which lifted her from the chocks , she was borne clear of the booms and dashed over the gunnel into the water , to leeward , which was comparatively smooth -- not , however , without being filled nearly up to the thwarts .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 42]: But this was little cared for by the intoxicated seamen , who , as soon as they were afloat , again raised their shouts and songs of revelry as they were borne away by the wind and sea towards the beach .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 35]: Philip , who held on by the stump of the mainmast , watched them with an anxious eye , now perceiving them borne aloft on the foaming surf , now disappearing in the trough .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 44]: More and more distant were the sounds of their mad voices , till , at last , he could hear them no more , -- he beheld the boat balanced on an enormous rolling sea , and then he saw it not again .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 26]: Philip knew that now his only chance was to remain with the vessel , and attempt to save himself upon some fragment of the wreck .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 32]: That the ship would long hold together he felt was impossible ; already she had parted her upper decks , and each shock of the waves divided her more and more .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 30]: At last , as he clung to the mast , he heard a noise abaft , and he then recollected that Mynheer Von Stroom was still in his cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 25]: Philip crawled aft , and found that the poop-ladder had been thrown against the cabin door , so as to prevent its being opened .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 36]: He removed it and entered the cabin , where he found Mynheer Von Stroom clinging to windward with the grasp of death , -- but it was not death , but the paralysis of fear .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 35]: He spoke to him , but could obtain no reply ; he attempted to move him , but it was impossible to make him let go the part of the bulk-head that he grasped .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 39]: A loud noise and the rush of a mass of water told Philip that the vessel had parted amidships , and he unwillingly abandoned the poor supercargo to his fate , and went out of the cabin door .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 30]: At the after-hatchway he observed something struggling , -- it was Johannes the bear , who was swimming , but still fastened by a cord which prevented his escape .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 49]: Philip took out his knife , and released the poor animal , and hardly had he done this act of kindness when a heavy sea turned over the after part of the vessel , which separated in many pieces , and Philip found himself struggling in the waves .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 23]: He seized upon a part of the deck which supported him , and was borne away by the surf towards the beach .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 55]: In a few minutes he was near to the land , and shortly afterwards the piece of planking to which he was clinging struck on the sand , and then , being turned over by the force of the running wave , Philip lost his hold , and was left to his own exertions .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 40]: He struggled long , but , although so near to the shore , could not gain a footing ; the returning wave dragged him back , and thus was he hurled to and fro until his strength was gone .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 19]: He was sinking under the wave to rise no more , when he felt something touch his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 9]: He seized it with the grasp of death .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 35]: It was the shaggy hide of the bear Johannes , who was making for the shore , and who soon dragged him clear of the surf , so that he could gain a footing .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 24]: Philip crawled up the beach above the reach of the waves , and , exhausted with fatigue , sank down in a swoon .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 37]: When Philip was recalled from his state of lethargy , his first feeling was intense pain in his still closed eyes , arising from having been many hours exposed to the rays of an ardent sun .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 25]: He opened them , but was obliged to close them immediately , for the light entered into them like the point of a knife .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 34]: He turned over on his side , and covering them with his hand , remained some time in that position , until , by degrees , he found that his eyesight was restored .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 17]: He then rose , and , after a few seconds could distinguish the scene around him .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 28]: The sea was still rough , and tossed about in the surf fragments of the vessel ; the whole sand was strewed with her cargo and contents .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 32]: Near him was the body of Hillebrant , and the other bodies who were scattered on the beach told him that those who had taken to the boat had all perished .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 51]: It was , by the height of the sun , about three o'clock in the afternoon , as near as he could estimate ; but Philip suffered such an oppression of mind , he felt so wearied , and in such pain , that he took but a slight survey .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 12]: His brain was whirling , and all he demanded was repose .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 51]: He walked away from the scene of destruction , and having found a sandhill , behind which he was defended from the burning rays of the sun , he again lay down , and sank into a deep sleep , from which he did not wake until the ensuing morning .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 17]: Philip was roused a second time by the sensation of something pricking him on the chest .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 12]: He started up , and beheld a figure standing over him .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 67]: His eyes were still feeble , and his vision indistinct ; he rubbed them for a time , for he first thought it was the bear Johannes , and again that it was the supercargo Von Stroom who had appeared before him ; he looked again , and found that he was mistaken , although he had warrant for supposing it to be either or both .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 54]: A tall Hottentot , with an assagai in his hand , stood by his side ; over his shoulder he had thrown the fresh-severed skin of the poor bear , and on his head , with the curls descending to his waist , was one of the wigs of the supercargo Von Stroom .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 48]: Such was the gravity of the black 's appearance in this strange costume -LRB- for in every other respect he was naked -RRB- , that , at any other time , Philip would have been induced to laugh heartily , but his feelings were now too acute .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 29]: He rose upon his feet and stood by the side of the Hottentot , who still continued immovable , but certainly without the slightest appearance of hostile intentions .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 20]: A sensation of overpowering thirst now seized upon Philip , and he made signs that he wished to drink .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 39]: The Hottentot motioned to him to follow , and led over the sand-hills to the beach , where Philip discovered upwards of fifty men , who were busy selecting various articles from the scattered stores of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 21]: It was evident by the respect paid to Philip 's conductor , that he was the chief of the kraal .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 43]: A few words , uttered with the greatest solemnity , were sufficient to produce , though not exactly what Philip required , a small quantity of dirty water from a calabash , which , however , was , to him , delicious .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 14]: His conductor then waved to him to take a seat on the sand .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 227]: It was a novel and appalling , and nevertheless a ludicrous scene : there was the white sand , rendered still more white by the strong glare of the sun , strewed with the fragments of the vessel , with casks and bales of merchandise ; there was the running surge with its foam , throwing about particles of the wreck ; there were the bones of whales which had been driven on shore in some former gale , and which now , half-buried in the sand , showed portions of huge skeletons ; there were the mangled bodies of Philip 's late companions , whose clothes , it appeared , had been untouched by the savages , with the exception of the buttons , which had been eagerly sought after ; there were naked Hottentots -LRB- for it was summer time , and they wore not their sheepskin krosses -RRB- gravely stepping up and down the sand , picking up everything that was of no value , and leaving all that civilised people most coveted ; -- to crown all , there was the chief , sitting in the still bloody skin of Johannes and the broad-bottomed wig of Mynheer Stroom , with all the gravity of a vice-chancellor in his countenance , and without the slightest idea that he was in any way ridiculous .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 19]: The whole presented , perhaps , one of the most strange and chaotic tableaux that ever was witnessed .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 41]: Although , at that time , the Dutch had not very long formed their settlement at the Cape , a considerable traffic had been , for many years , carried on with the natives for skins and other African productions .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 25]: The Hottentots were therefore no strangers to vessels , and , as hitherto they had been treated with kindness , were well-disposed towards Europeans .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 33]: After a time , the Hottentots began to collect all the wood which appeared to have iron in it , made it up into several piles , and set them on fire .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 53]: The chief then made a sign to Philip , to ask him if he was hungry ; Philip replied in the affirmative , when his new acquaintance put his hand into a bag made of goat-skin , and pulled out a handful of very large beetles , and presented them to him .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 38]: Philip refused them with marks of disgust , upon which the chief very sedately cracked and ate them ; and having finished the whole handful , rose , and made a sign to Philip to follow him .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 57]: As Philip rose , he perceived floating on the surf his own chest ; he hastened to it , and made signs that it was his , took the key out of his pocket , and opened it , and then made up a bundle of articles most useful , not forgetting a bag of guilders .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 37]: His conductor made no objection , but calling to one of the men near , pointed out the lock and hinges to him , and then set off , followed by Philip , across the sand-hills .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 57]: In about an hour they arrived at the kraal , consisting of low huts covered with skins , and were met by the women and children , who appeared to be in high admiration at their chief 's new attire : they showed every kindness to Philip , bringing him milk , which he drank eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 36]: Philip surveyed these daughters of Eve , and , as he turned from their offensive , greasy attire , their strange forms , and hideous features , he sighed and thought of his charming Amine .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 12]: The sun was now setting , and Philip still felt fatigued .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 9]: He made signs that he wished to repose .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 56]: They led him into a hut , and , though surrounded as he was with filth , and his nose assailed by every variety of bad smell , attacked moreover by insects , he laid his head on his bundle , and uttering a short prayer of thanksgiving , was soon in a sound sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 23]: The next morning he was awakened by the chief of the kraal , accompanied by another man who spoke a little Dutch .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 38]: He stated his wish to be taken to the settlement where the ships came and anchored , and was fully understood ; but the man said that there were no ships in the bay at the time .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 50]: Philip nevertheless requested he might be taken there , as he felt that his best chance of getting on board of any vessel would be by remaining at the settlement , and , at all events , he would be in the company of Europeans until a vessel arrived .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 14]: The distance he discovered was but one day 's march , or less .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 26]: After some little conversation with the chief , the man who spoke Dutch desired Philip to follow him , and he would take him there .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 40]: Philip drank plentifully from a bowl of milk brought him by one of the women , and again refusing a handful of beetles offered by the chief , he took up his bundle , and followed his new acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 27]: Towards evening they arrived at the hills , from which Philip had a view of Table Bay , and the few houses erected by the Dutch .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 17]: To his delight , he perceived that there was a vessel under sail in the offing .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 26]: On his arrival at the beach , to which he hastened , he found that she had sent a boat on shore for fresh provisions .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 32]: He accosted the people , told them who he was , told them also of the fatal wreck of the _ Ter Schilling _ , and of his wish to embark .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 24]: The officer in charge of the boat willingly consented to take him on board , and informed Philip that they were homeward bound .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 8]: Philip 's heart leaped at the intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 35]: Had she been outward bound , he would have joined her ; but now he had a prospect of again seeing his dear Amine , before he re-embarked to follow out his peculiar destiny .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 43]: He felt that there was still some happiness in store for him , that his life was to be chequered with alternate privation and repose , and that his future prospect was not to be one continued chain of suffering until death .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 44]: He was kindly received by the captain of the vessel , who freely gave him a passage home ; and in three months , without any events worth narrating , Philip Vanderdecken found himself once more at anchor before the town of Amsterdam .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 30]: Chapter XI It need hardly be observed , that Philip made all possible haste to his own little cottage , which contained all that he valued in this world .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 54]: He promised to himself some months of happiness , for he had done his duty ; and he felt that , however desirous of fulfilling his vow , he could not again leave home till the autumn , when the next fleet sailed , and it was now but the commencement of April .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 78]: Much , too , as he regretted the loss of Mynheer Kloots and Hillebrant , as well as the deaths of the unfortunate crew , still there was some solace in the remembrance that he was for ever rid of the wretch Schriften , who had shared their fate ; and besides , he almost blessed the wreck , so fatal to others , which enabled him so soon to return to the arms of his Amine .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 23]: It was late in the evening when Philip took a boat from Flushing , and went over to his cottage at Terneuse .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 12]: It was a rough evening for the season of the year .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 42]: The wind blew fresh , and the sky was covered with flaky clouds , fringed here and there with broad white edges , for the light of the moon was high in the heavens , and she was at her full .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 29]: At times her light would be almost obscured by a dark cloud passing over her disc ; at others , she would burst out in all her brightness .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 16]: Philip landed , and wrapping his cloak round him , hastened up to his cottage .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 29]: As with a beating heart he approached , he perceived that the window of the parlour was open , and that there was a female figure leaning out .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 34]: He knew that it could be no other than his Amine , and , after he crossed the little bridge , he proceeded to the window , instead of going to the door .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 45]: Amine -LRB- for it was she who stood at the window -RRB- was so absorbed in contemplation of the heavens above her , and so deep in communion with her own thoughts , that she neither saw nor heard the approach of her husband .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 16]: Philip perceived her abstraction , and paused when within four or five yards of her .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 50]: He wished to gain the door without being observed , as he was afraid of alarming her by his too sudden appearance , for he remembered his promise , `` that if dead he would , if permitted , visit her as his father had visited his mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 49]: But while he thus stood in suspense , Amine 's eyes were turned upon him : she beheld him , but a thick cloud now obscured the moon 's disc , and the dim light gave to his form , indistinctly seen , an unearthly and shadowy appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 26]: She recognised her husband ; but having no reason to expect his return , she recognised him as an inhabitant of the world of spirits .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 21]: She started , parted the hair away from her forehead with both hands , and again earnestly gazed on him .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 18]: `` It is I , Amine , do not be afraid , '' cried Philip , hastily .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 17]: `` I am not afraid , '' replied Amine , pressing her hand to her heart .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 23]: `` It is over now : spirit of my dear husband -- for such I think thou art , I thank thee !
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 11]: Welcome , even in death , Philip , welcome ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 19]: and Amine waved her hand mournfully , inviting Philip to enter , as she retired from the window .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 4]: `` My God !
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 31]: she thinks me dead , '' thought Philip , and hardly knowing how to act , he entered in at the window , and found her sitting on the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 40]: Philip would have spoken ; but Amine , whose eyes were fixed upon him as he entered , and who was fully convinced that he was but a supernatural appearance , exclaimed -- `` So soon -- so soon !
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 3]: O God !
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 12]: thy will be done : but it is hard to bear .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 5]: Philip , beloved Philip !
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 10]: I feel that I soon shall follow you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 23]: Philip was now more alarmed : he was fearful of any sudden reaction when Amine should discover that he was still alive .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 8]: `` Amine , dear , hear me .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 30]: I have appeared unexpectedly , and at an unusual hour ; but throw yourself into my arms , and you will find that your Philip is not dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 5]: `` Not dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 6]: cried Amine , starting up .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 38]: `` No , no , still warm in flesh and blood , Amine -- still your fond and doting husband , '' replied Philip , catching her in his arms , and pressing her to his heart .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 30]: Amine sank from his embrace down upon the sofa , and fortunately was relieved by a burst of tears , while Philip , kneeling by her , supported her .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 4]: `` O God !
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 3]: O God !
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 11]: I thank thee , '' replied Amine , at last .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 10]: `` I thought it was your spirit , Philip .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 18]: O I was glad to see even that , '' continued she , weeping on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 10]: `` Can you listen to me , dearest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 11]: said Philip , after a silence of a few moments .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 15]: `` O speak , speak , love ; I can listen for ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 42]: In a few words Philip then recounted what had taken place , and the occasion of his unexpected return , and felt himself more than repaid for all that he had suffered by the fond endearments of his still agitated Amine .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 8]: `` And your father , Amine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 13]: `` He is well -- we will talk of him to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 32]: `` Yes , '' thought Philip , as he awoke next morning , and dwelt upon the lovely features of his still slumbering wife : `` yes , God is merciful .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 43]: I feel that there is still happiness in store for me ; nay more , that that happiness also depends upon my due performance of my task , and that I should be punished if I were to forget my solemn vow .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 31]: Be it so , -- through danger and to death will I perform my duty , trusting to his mercy for a reward both here below and in heaven above .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 11]: Am I not repaid for all that I have suffered ?
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 41]: O yes , more than repaid , '' thought Philip , as , with a kiss , he disturbed the slumber of his wife , and met her full dark eyes fixed upon him , beaming with love and joy .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 11]: Before Philip Went downstairs , he inquired about Mynheer Poots .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 13]: `` My father has indeed troubled me much , '' replied Amine .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 30]: `` I am obliged to lock the parlour when I leave it , for more than once I have found him attempting to force the locks of the buffets .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 13]: His love of gold is insatiable : he dreams of nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 27]: He has caused me much pain , insisting that I never should see you again , and that I should surrender to him all your wealth .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 14]: But he fears me , and he fears your return much more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 8]: `` Is he well in health ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 48]: `` Not ill , but still evidently wasting away , -- like a candle burnt down to the socket , flitting and flaring alternately ; at one time almost imbecile , at others , talking and planning as if he were in the vigour of his youth .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 13]: O what a curse it must be -- that love of money !
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 60]: I believe -- I 'm shocked to say so , Philip , -- that that poor old man , now on the brink of a grave into which he can take nothing , would sacrifice your life and mine to have possession of those guilders , the whole of which I would barter for one kiss from thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 15]: `` Indeed , Amine , has he then attempted anything in my absence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 24]: `` I dare not speak my thoughts , Philip , nor will I venture upon surmises , which it were difficult to prove .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 13]: I watch him carefully ; -- but talk no more about him .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 25]: You will see him soon , and do not expect a hearty welcome , or believe that , if given , it is sincere .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 18]: I will not tell him of your return , as I wish to mark the effect . ''
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 16]: Amine then descended to prepare breakfast , and Philip walked out for a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 16]: On his return , he found Mynheer Poots sitting at the table with his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 4]: `` Merciful Allah !
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 5]: am I right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 14]: cried the old man : `` is it you , Mynheer Vanderdecken ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 15]: `` Even so , '' replied Philip , `` I returned last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 11]: `` And you did not tell me , Amine . ''
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 13]: `` I wished that you should be surprised , '' replied Amine .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 5]: `` I am surprised !
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 9]: When do you sail again , Mynheer Philip ?
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 6]: very soon , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 4]: perhaps to-morrow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 4]: said Mynheer Poots .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 13]: `` Not for many months , I trust , '' replied Philip .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 6]: `` Not for many months !
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 10]: -- that is a long while to be idle .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 5]: You must make money .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 12]: Tell me , have you brought back plenty this time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 21]: `` No , '' replied Philip ; `` I have been wrecked , and very nearly lost my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 8]: `` But you will go again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 12]: `` Yes , in good time I shall go again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 16]: `` Very well , we will take care of your house and your guilders . ''
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 36]: `` I shall perhaps save you the trouble of taking care of my guilders , '' replied Philip , to annoy the old man , `` for I mean to take them with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 7]: `` To take them with you !
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 6]: for what , pray ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 6]: replied Poots , in alarm .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 14]: `` To purchase goods where I go , and make more money . ''
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 17]: `` But you may be wrecked again , and then the money will be all lost .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 19]: No , no ; go yourself , Mynheer Philip ; but you must not take your guilders . ''
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 25]: `` Indeed I will , '' replied Philip ; `` when I leave this , I shall take all my money with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 53]: During this conversation it occurred to Philip that , if Mynheer Poots could only be led to suppose that he took away his money with him , there would be more quiet for Amine , who was now obliged , as she had informed him , to be constantly on the watch .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 24]: He determined , therefore , when he next departed , to make the doctor believe that he had taken his wealth with him .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 14]: Mynheer Poots did not renew the conversation , but sank into gloomy thought .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 40]: In a few minutes he left the parlour , and went up to his own room , when Philip stated to his wife what had induced him to make the old man believe that he should embark his property .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 31]: `` It was thoughtful of you , Philip , and I thank you for your kind feeling towards me ; but I wish you had said nothing on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 17]: You do not know my father ; I must now watch him as an enemy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 18]: `` We have little to fear from an infirm old man , '' replied Philip , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 12]: But Amine thought otherwise , and was ever on her guard .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 13]: The spring and summer passed rapidly away , for they were happy .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 29]: Many were the conversations between Philip and Amine , relative to what had passed -- the supernatural appearance of his father 's ship , and the fatal wreck .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 31]: Amine felt that more dangers and difficulties were preparing for her husband , but she never once attempted to dissuade him from renewing his attempts in fulfilment of his vow .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 35]: Like him , she looked forward with hope and confidence , aware that , at some time , his fate must be accomplished , and trusting only that that hour would be long delayed .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 34]: At the close of the summer , Philip again went to Amsterdam , to procure for himself a berth in one of the vessels which were to sail at the approach of winter .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 48]: The wreck of the _ Ter Schilling _ was well known ; and the circumstances attending it , with the exception of the appearance of the Phantom Ship , had been drawn up by Philip on his passage home , and communicated to the Court of Directors .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 61]: Not only on account of the very creditable manner in which that report had been prepared , but in consideration of his peculiar sufferings and escape , he had been promised by the Company a berth , as second mate , on board of one of their vessels , should he be again inclined to sail to the East Indies .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 25]: Having called upon the Directors , he received his appointment to the _ Batavia _ , a fine vessel of about 400 tons burden .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 28]: Having effected his purpose , Philip hastened back to Terneuse , and , in the presence of Mynheer Poots , informed Amine of what he had done .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 9]: `` So you go to sea again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 4]: observed Mynheer Poots .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 16]: `` Yes , but not for two months , I expect , '' replied Philip .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 9]: replied Poots , `` in two months ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 8]: and the old man muttered to himself .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 19]: How true it is that we can more easily bear up against a real evil than against suspense !
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 61]: Let it not be supposed that Amine fretted at the thought of her approaching separation from her husband ; she lamented it , but feeling his departure to be an imperious duty , and having it ever in her mind , she bore up against her feelings , and submitted , without repining , to what could not be averted .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 24]: There was , however , one circumstance , which caused her much uneasiness -- that was the temper and conduct of her father .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 63]: Amine , who knew his character well , perceived that he already secretly hated Philip , whom he regarded as an obstacle to his obtaining possession of the money in the house ; for the old man was well aware that , if Philip were dead , his daughter would care little who had possession of , or what became of it .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 23]: The thought that Philip was about to take that money with him had almost turned the brain of the avaricious old man .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 30]: He had been watched by Amine , and she had seen him walk for hours muttering to himself , and not , as usual , attending to his profession .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 22]: A few evenings after his return from Amsterdam , Philip , who had taken cold , complained of not being well .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 5]: `` Not well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 21]: cried the old man , starting up ; `` let me see -- yes , your pulse is very quick .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 9]: Amine , your poor husband is very ill .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 18]: He must go to bed , and I will give him something which will do him good .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 13]: I shall charge you nothing , Philip -- nothing at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 25]: `` I do not feel so very unwell , Mynheer Poots , '' replied Philip ; I have had a bad headache certainly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 38]: `` Yes , and you have fever also , Philip , and prevention is better than cure ; so go to bed , and take what I send you , and you will be well to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 21]: Philip went upstairs , accompanied by Amine ; and Mynheer Poots went into his own room to prepare the medicine .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 38]: So soon as Philip was in bed , Amine went downstairs , and was met by her father , who put a powder into her hands to give to her husband , and then left the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 21]: `` God forgive me if I wrong my father , '' thought Amine ; `` but I have my doubts .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 36]: Philip is ill , more so than he will acknowledge ; and if he does not take some remedies , he may be worse -- but my heart misgives me -- I have a foreboding .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 11]: Yet surely he can not be so diabolically wicked . ''
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 38]: Amine examined the contents of the paper : it was a very small quantity of dark brown powder , and , by the directions of Mynheer Poots , to be given in a tumbler of warm wine .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 9]: Mynheer Poots had offered to heat the wine .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 10]: His return from the kitchen broke Amine 's meditations .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 45]: `` Here is the wine , my child ; now give him a whole tumbler of wine , and the powder , and let him be covered up warm , for the perspiration will soon burst out , and it must not be checked .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 20]: Watch him , Amine , and keep the clothes on , and he will be well to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 16]: And Mynheer Poots quitted the room , saying , `` Good-night , my child . ''
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 26]: Amine poured out the powder into one of the silver mugs upon the table , and then proceeded to mix it up with the wine .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 20]: Her suspicions had , for the time , been removed by the kind tone of her father 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 20]: To do him justice as a medical practitioner , he appeared always to be most careful of his patients .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 25]: When Amine mixed the powder , she examined and perceived that there was no sediment , and the wine was as clear as before .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 9]: This was unusual , and her suspicions revived .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 20]: `` I like it not , '' said she ; `` I fear my father -- God help me !
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 16]: -- I hardly know what to do -- I will not give it to Philip .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 9]: The warm wine may produce perspiration sufficient . ''
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 7]: Amine paused , and again reflected .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 49]: She had mixed the powder with so small a portion of wine that it did not fill a quarter of the cup ; she put it on one side , filled another up to the brim with the warm wine , and then went up to the bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 19]: On the landing-place she was met by her father , whom she supposed to have retired to rest .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 11]: `` Take care you do not spill it , Amine .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 11]: That is right , let him have a whole cupful .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 16]: Stop , give it to me ; I will take it to him myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 17]: Mynheer Poots took the cup from Amine 's hands , and went into Philip 's room .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 34]: `` Here , my son , drink this off , and you will be well , '' said Mynheer Poots , whose hand trembled so that he spilt the wine on the coverlet .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 23]: Amine , who watched her father , was more than ever pleased that she had not put the powder into the cup .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 19]: Philip rose on his elbow , drank off the wine , and Mynheer Poots then wished him good-night .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 25]: `` Do not leave him , Amine , I will see all right , '' said Mynheer Poots , as he left the room .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 42]: And Amine , who had intended to go down for the candle left in the parlour , remained with her husband , to whom she confided her feelings , and also the fact that she had not given him the powder .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 24]: `` I trust that you are mistaken , Amine , '' replied Philip , `` indeed I feel sure that you must be .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 13]: No man can be so bad as you suppose your father . ''
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 24]: `` You have not lived with him as I have ; you have not seen what I have seen , '' replied Amine .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 24]: `` You know not what gold will tempt people to do in this world -- but , however , I may be wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 18]: At all events , you must go to sleep , and I shall watch you , dearest .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 28]: Pray do not speak -- I feel I can not sleep just now -- I wish to read a little -- I will lie down by-and-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 26]: Philip made no further objections , and was soon in a sound sleep , and Amine watched him in silence till midnight long had passed .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 27]: `` He breathes heavily , '' thought Amine ; `` but had I given him that powder , who knows if he had ever awoke again ?
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 16]: My father is so deeply skilled in the Eastern knowledge , that I fear him .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 23]: Too often has he , I well know , for a purse well filled with gold , prepared the sleep of death .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 53]: Another would shudder at the thought ; but he , who has dealt out death at the will of his employers , would scruple little to do so even to the husband of his own daughter ; and I have watched him in his moods , and know his thoughts and wishes .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 12]: What a foreboding of mishap has come over me this evening !
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 7]: -- what a fear of evil !
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 14]: Philip is ill , 't is true , but not so very ill .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 2]: no !
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 17]: besides , his time is not yet come ; he has his dreadful task to finish .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 6]: I would it were morning .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 5]: How soundly he sleeps !
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 8]: and the dew is on his brow .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 14]: I must cover him up warm , and watch that he remains so .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 7]: Some one knocks at the entrance-door .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 6]: Now will they wake him .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 9]: 'T is a summons for my father . ''
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 9]: Amine left the room , and hastened downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 19]: It was , as she supposed , a summons for Mynheer Poots to a woman taken in labour .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 20]: `` He shall follow you directly , '' said Amine ; `` I will now call him up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 25]: Amine went upstairs to the room where her father slept , and knocked ; hearing no answer , as usual , she knocked again .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 26]: `` My father is not used to sleep in this way , '' thought Amine , when she found no answer to her second call .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 8]: She opened the door and went in .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 11]: To her surprise , her father was not in bed .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 30]: `` Strange , '' thought she ; `` but I do not recollect having heard his footsteps coming up after he went down to take away the lights . ''
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 31]: And Amine hastened to the parlour , where , stretched on the sofa , she discovered her father apparently fast asleep ; but to her call he gave no answer .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 4]: `` Merciful Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 5]: is he dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 12]: thought she , approaching the light to her father 's face .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 6]: Yes , it was so !
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 13]: his eyes were fixed and glazed -- his lower jaw had fallen .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 26]: For some minutes , Amine leant against the wall in a state of bewilderment ; her brain whirled ; at last she recovered herself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 38]: 'T is to be proved at once , '' thought she , as she went up to the table , and looked into the silver cup in which she had mixed the powder -- it was empty !
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 10]: `` The God of Righteousness hath punished him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 8]: exclaimed Amine ; `` but , O !
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 9]: that this man should have been my father !
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 4]: it is plain .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 53]: Frightened at his own wicked , damned intentions , he poured out more wine from the flagon , to blunt his feelings of remorse ; and not knowing that the powder was still in the cup , he filled it up , and drank himself -- the death he meant for another !
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 3]: For another !
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 5]: -- and for whom ?
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 7]: one wedded to his own daughter !
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 3]: -- Philip !
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 3]: my husband !
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 27]: Wert thou not my father , '' continued Amine , looking at the dead body , `` I would spit upon thee , and curse thee !
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 11]: but thou art punished , and may God forgive thee !
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 9]: thou poor , weak , wicked creature ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 24]: Amine then left the room , and went upstairs , where she found Philip still fast asleep , and in a profuse perspiration .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 29]: Most women would have awakened their husbands , but Amine thought not of herself ; Philip was ill , and Amine would not arouse him to agitate him .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 46]: She sat down by the side of the bed , and with her hands pressed upon her forehead , and her elbows resting on her knees , she remained in deep thought until the sun had risen and poured his bright beams through the casement .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 16]: She was roused from her reflections by another summons at the door of the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 14]: She hastened down to the entrance , but did not open the door .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 17]: `` Mynheer Poots is required immediately , '' said the girl , who was the messenger .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 36]: `` My good Therese , '' replied Amine , `` my father has more need of assistance than the poor woman ; for his travail in this world , I fear , is well over .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 23]: I found him very ill when I went to call him , and he has not been able to quit his bed .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 31]: I must now entreat you to do my message , and desire Father Seysen to come hither ; for my poor father is , I fear , in extremity . ''
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 6]: `` Mercy on me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 3]: replied Therese .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 5]: `` Is it so ?
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 13]: Fear not but I will do your bidding , Mistress Amine . ''
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 22]: The second knocking had awakened Philip , who felt that he was much better , and his headache had left him .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 31]: He perceived that Amine had not taken any rest that night , and he was about to expostulate with her , when she at once told him what had occurred .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 37]: `` You must dress yourself , Philip , '' continued she , `` and must assist me to carry up his body , and place it in his bed , before the arrival of the priest .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 4]: God of mercy !
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 19]: had I given you that powder , my dearest Philip -- but let us not talk about it .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 12]: Be quick , for Father Seysen will be here soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 13]: Philip was soon dressed , and followed Amine down into the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 38]: The sun shone bright , and his rays were darted upon the haggard face of the old man , whose fists were clenched , and his tongue fixed between the teeth on one side of his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 3]: `` Alas !
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 7]: this room appears to be fatal .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 13]: How many more scenes of horror are to pass within it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 24]: `` None , I trust , '' replied Amine ; `` this is not , to my mind , the scene of horror .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 62]: It was when that old man -LRB- now called away -- and a victim of his own treachery -RRB- stood by your bedside , and with every mark of interest and kindness , offered you the cup -- _ that _ was the scene of horror , '' said Amine , shuddering -- `` one which long will haunt me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 5]: `` God forgive him !
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 30]: as I do , '' replied Philip , lifting up the body , and carrying it up the stairs to the room which had been occupied by Mynheer Poots .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 25]: `` Let it at least be supposed that he died in his bed , and that his death was natural , '' said Amine .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 26]: `` My pride can not bear that this should be known , or that I should be pointed at as the daughter of a murderer !
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 4]: O Philip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 9]: Amine sat down , and burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 16]: Her husband was attempting to console her , when Father Seysen knocked at the door .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 7]: Philip hastened down to open it .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 7]: `` Good morning , my son .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 6]: How is the sufferer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 10]: `` He has ceased to suffer , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 18]: replied the good priest , with sorrow in his countenance ; `` am I then too late ?
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 7]: yet have I not tarried . ''
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 21]: `` He went off suddenly , father , in a convulsion , '' replied Philip , leading the way upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 28]: Father Seysen looked at the body and perceived that his offices were needless , and then turned to Amine , who had not yet checked her tears .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 8]: `` Weep , my child , weep !
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 10]: for you have cause , '' said the priest .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 20]: `` The loss of a father 's love must be a severe trial to a dutiful and affectionate child .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 28]: But yield not too much to your grief , Amine ; you have other duties , other ties , my child -- you have your husband . ''
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 26]: `` I know it , father , '' replied Amine ; `` still must I weep , for I was _ his _ daughter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 20]: `` Did he not go to bed last night , then , that his clothes are still upon him ?
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 7]: When did he first complain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 35]: `` The last time that I saw him , father , '' replied Philip , `` he came into my room , and gave me some medicine , and then he wished me good-night .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 21]: Upon a summons to attend a sick-bed , my wife went to call him , and found him speechless . ''
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 26]: `` It has been sudden , '' replied the priest ; `` but he was an old man , and old men sink at once .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 9]: Were you with him when he died ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 31]: `` I was not , sir , '' replied Philip ; `` before my wife had summoned me and I had dressed myself , he had left this world . ''
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 12]: `` I trust , my children , for a better . ''
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 3]: Amine shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 22]: `` Tell me , Amine , '' continued the priest , `` did he show signs of grace before he died ?
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 30]: for you know full well that he has long been looked on as doubtful in his creed , and little attentive to the rites of our holy church . ''
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 29]: `` There are times , holy father , '' replied Amine , `` when even a sincere Christian can be excused , even if he give no sign .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 28]: Look at his clenched hands , witness the agony of death on his face , and could you , in that state , expect a sign ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 3]: `` Alas !
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 17]: 't is but too true , my child ; we must then hope for the best .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 22]: Kneel with me , my children , and let us offer up a prayer for the soul of the departed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 33]: Philip and Amine knelt with the priest , who prayed fervently ; and as they rose , they exchanged a glance which fully revealed what was passing in the mind of each .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 64]: `` I will send the people to do their offices for the dead , and prepare the body for interment , '' said Father Seysen ; `` but it were as well not to say that he was dead before I arrived , or to let it be supposed that he was called away without receiving the consolations of our holy creed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 21]: Philip motioned his head in assent as he stood at the foot of the bed , and the priest departed .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 70]: There had always been a strong feeling against Mynheer Poots in the village ; -- his neglect of all religious duties -- the doubt whether he was even a member of the church -- his avarice and extortion -- had created for him a host of enemies ; but , at the same time , his great medical skill , which was fully acknowledged , rendered him of importance .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 53]: Had it been known that his creed -LRB- if he had any -RRB- was Mahometan , and that he had died in attempting to poison his son-in-law , it is certain that Christian burial would have been refused him , and the finger of scorn would have been pointed at his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 51]: But as Father Seysen , when questioned , said , in a mild voice , that `` he had departed in peace , '' it was presumed that Mynheer Poots had died a good Christian , although he had acted little up to the tenets of Christianity during his life .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 39]: The next day the remains of the old man were consigned to the earth with the usual rites ; and Philip and Amine were not a little relieved in their minds at everything having passed off so quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 25]: It was not until after the funeral had taken place that Philip , in company with Amine , examined the chamber of his father-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 27]: The key of the iron chest was found in his pocket ; but Philip had not yet looked into this darling repository of the old man .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 37]: The room was full of bottles and boxes of drugs , all of which were either thrown away , or , if the utility of them was known to Amine , removed to a spare room .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 25]: His table contained many drawers , which were now examined , and among the heterogeneous contents were many writings in Arabic -- probably prescriptions .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 37]: Boxes and papers were also found , with Arabic characters written upon them ; and in the box which they first took up was a powder similar to that which Mynheer Poots had given to Amine .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 39]: There were many articles and writings which made it appear that the old man had dabbled in the occult sciences , as they were practised at that period , and those they hastened to commit to the flames .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 11]: `` Had all these been seen by Father Seysen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 5]: observed Amine , mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 11]: `` But here are some printed papers , Philip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 19]: Philip examined them , and found that they were acknowledgments of shares in the Dutch East India Company .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 35]: `` No , Amine , these are money , or what is as good -- these are eight shares in the Company 's capital , which will yield us a handsome income every year .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 15]: I had no idea that the old man made such use of his money .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 27]: I had some intention of doing the same with a part of mine before I went away , instead of allowing it to remain idle . ''
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 9]: The iron chest was now to be examined .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 75]: When Philip first opened it , he imagined that it contained but little ; for it was large and deep , and appeared to be almost empty ; but when he put his hands down to the bottom , he pulled out thirty or forty small bags , the contents of which , instead of being silver guilders , were all coins of gold ; there was only one large bag of silver money .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 30]: But this was not all : several small boxes and packets were also discovered , which , when opened , were found to contain diamonds and other precious stones .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 14]: When everything was collected , the treasure appeared to be of great value .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 19]: `` Amine , my love , you have indeed brought me an unexpected dower , '' said Philip .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 12]: `` You may well say _ unexpected _ '' replied Amine .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 15]: `` These diamonds and jewels my father must have brought with him from Egypt .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 14]: And yet how penuriously we were living until we came to this cottage !
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 14]: And with all this treasure he would have poisoned my Philip for more !
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 5]: God forgive him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 24]: Having counted the gold , which amounted to nearly fifty thousand guilders , the whole was replaced , and they left the room .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 27]: `` I am a rich man , '' thought Philip , after Amine had left him ; `` but of what use are riches to me ?
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 19]: I might purchase a ship and be my own captain , but would not the ship be lost ?
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 21]: That certainly does not follow ; but the chances are against the vessel ; therefore I will have no ship .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 15]: But is it right to sail in the vessels of others with this feeling ?
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 43]: -- I know not ; this , however , I know , that I have a duty to perform , and that all our lives are in the hands of a kind Providence , which calls us away when he thinks fit .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 46]: I will place most of my money in the shares of the Company , and if I sail in their vessels , and they come to misfortune by meeting with my poor father , at least I shall be a common sufferer with the rest .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 10]: And now to make my Amine more comfortable . ''
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 12]: Philip immediately made a great alteration in their style of living .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 32]: Two female servants were hired : the rooms were more comfortably furnished ; and in everything in which his wife 's comfort and convenience were concerned , he spared no expense .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 14]: He wrote to Amsterdam and purchased several shares in the Company 's stock .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 15]: The diamonds and his own money he still left in the hands of Amine .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 34]: In making these arrangements the two months passed rapidly away , and everything was complete when Philip again received his summons , by letter , to desire that he would join his vessel .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 37]: Amine would have wished Philip to go out as a passenger instead of going as an officer , but Philip preferred the latter , as otherwise he could give no reason for his voyage to India .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 41]: `` I know not why , '' observed Philip , the evening before his departure , `` but I do not feel as I did when I last went away ; I have no foreboding of evil this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 39]: `` Nor have I , '' replied Amine ; `` but I feel as if you would be long away from me , Philip ; and is not that an evil to a fond and anxious wife ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 38]: `` Yes , love , it is ; but -- '' `` O yes , I know it is your duty , and you must go , '' replied Amine , burying her face in his bosom .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 21]: The next day Philip parted from his wife , who behaved with more fortitude than on their first separation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 17]: _ All _ were lost , but _ he _ was saved , '' thought Amine .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 10]: `` I feel that he will return to me .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 10]: God of Heaven , thy will be done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 55]: Philip soon arrived at Amsterdam ; and having purchased many things which he thought might be advantageous to him in case of accident , to which he now looked forward as almost certain , he embarked on board the _ Batavia _ , which was lying at single anchor , and ready for sea .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 59]: Chapter XII Philip had not been long on board , ere he found that they were not likely to have a very comfortable passage ; for the _ Batavia _ was chartered to convey a large detachment of troops to Ceylon and Java , for the purpose of recruiting and strengthening the Company 's forces at those places .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 43]: She was to quit the fleet off Madagascar , and run direct for the Island of Java ; the number of soldiers on board being presumed sufficient to insure the ship against any attack or accidents from pirates or enemies ' cruisers .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 19]: The _ Batavia _ , moreover , mounted thirty guns , and had a crew of seventy-five men .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 27]: Besides military stores , which formed the principal part of her cargo , she had on board a large quantity of specie for the Indian market .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 30]: The detachment of soldiers was embarking when Philip went on board , and in a few minutes the decks were so crowded that it was hardly possible to move .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 52]: Philip , who had not yet spoken to the captain , found out the first mate , and immediately entered upon his duty , with which , from his close application to it during his former voyage and passage home , he was much better acquainted than might have been imagined .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 56]: In a short time all traces of hurry and confusion began to disappear , the baggage of the troops was stowed away , and the soldiers having been told off in parties , and stationed with their messing utensils between the guns of the main deck , room was thus afforded for working the ship .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 66]: Philip showed great activity as well as method in the arrangements proposed , and the captain , during a pause in his own arduous duties , said to him -- `` I thought you were taking it very easy , Mr Vanderdecken , in not joining the ship before , but , now you are on board , you are making up for lost time .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 13]: You have done more during the forenoon than I could have expected .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 39]: I am glad that you are come , though very sorry you were not here when we were stowing the hold , which , I am afraid , is not arranged quite so well as it might be .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 21]: Mynheer Struys , the first mate , has had more to do than he could well give attention to . ''
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 32]: `` I am sorry that I should not have been here , sir , '' replied Philip ; `` but I came as soon as the Company sent me word . ''
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 33]: `` Yes , and as they know that you are a married man , and do not forget that you are a great shareholder , they would not trouble you too soon .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 13]: I presume you will have the command of a vessel next voyage .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 19]: In fact , you are certain of it , with the capital you have invested in their funds .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 18]: I had a conversation with one of the senior accountants on the subject this very morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 31]: Philip was not very sorry that his money had been put out to such good interest , as to be the captain of a ship was what he earnestly desired .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 34]: He replied , that , `` he certainly did hope to command a ship after the next voyage , when he trusted that he should feel himself quite competent to the charge . ''
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 10]: `` No doubt , no doubt , Mr Vanderdecken .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 6]: I can see that clearly .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 10]: You must be very fond of the sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 21]: `` I am , '' replied Philip ; `` I doubt whether I shall ever give it up . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 7]: _ Never _ give it up !
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 5]: You think so now .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 33]: You are young , active , and full of hope : but you will tire of it by-and-bye , and be glad to lay by for the rest of your days . ''
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 9]: `` How many troops do we embark ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 3]: inquired Philip .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 13]: `` Two hundred and forty-five rank and file , and six officers .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 3]: Poor fellows !
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 21]: there are but few of them will ever return : nay , more than one-half will not see another birthday .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 6]: It is a dreadful climate .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 31]: I have landed three hundred men at that horrid hole , and in six months , even before I had sailed , there were not one hundred left alive . ''
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 14]: `` It is almost murder to send them there , '' observed Philip .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 3]: `` Psha !
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 16]: they must die somewhere , and if they die a little sooner , what matter ?
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 13]: Life is a commodity to be bought and sold like any other .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 16]: We send so much manufactured goods and so much money to barter for Indian commodities .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 19]: We also send out so much life , and it gives a good return to the Company . ''
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 13]: `` But not to the poor soldiers , I am afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 22]: `` No ; the Company buy it cheap and sell it dear , '' replied the captain , who walked forward .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 39]: True , thought Philip , they do purchase human life cheap , and make a rare profit of it , for without these poor fellows how could they hold their possessions in spite of native and foreign enemies ?
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 14]: For what a paltry and cheap annuity do these men sell their lives ?
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 47]: For what a miserable pittance do they dare all the horrors of a most deadly climate , without a chance , a hope of return to their native land , where they might haply repair their exhausted energies , and take a new lease of life !
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 3]: Good God !
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 44]: if these men may be thus heartlessly sacrificed to Mammon , why should I feel remorse if , in the fulfilment of a sacred duty imposed on me by Him who deals with us as He thinks meet , a few mortals perish ?
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 21]: Not a sparrow falls to the ground without His knowledge , and it is for Him to sacrifice or save .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 28]: I am but the creature of His will , and I but follow my duty , -- but obey the commands of One whose ways are inscrutable .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 38]: Still , if for my sake this ship be also doomed , I can not but wish that I had been appointed to some other , in which the waste of human life might have been less .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 27]: It was not until a week after Philip arrived on board that the _ Batavia _ and the remainder of the fleet were ready for sea .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 17]: It would be difficult to analyse the feelings of Philip Vanderdecken on this his second embarkation .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 34]: His mind was so continually directed to the object of his voyage , that although he attended to his religious duty , yet the business of life passed before him as a dream .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 51]: Assured of again meeting with the Phantom Ship , and almost equally assured that the meeting would be followed by some untoward event , in all probability by the sacrifice of those who sailed with him , his thoughts preyed upon him , and wore him down to a shadow .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 13]: He hardly ever spoke , except in the execution of his duty .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 80]: He felt like a criminal ; as one who , by embarking with them , had doomed all around him to death , disaster , and peril ; and when _ one _ talked of his wife , and _ another _ of his children -- when they would indulge in anticipations , and canvass happy projects , Philip would feel sick at heart , and would rise from the table and hasten to the solitude of the deck .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 78]: At one time he would try to persuade himself that his senses had been worked upon in some moment of excitement , that he was the victim of an illusion ; at another he would call to mind all the past -- he would feel its terrible reality -- and then the thought would suggest itself that with this supernatural vision Heaven had nothing to do ; that it was but the work and jugglery of Satan .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 15]: But then the relic -- by such means the devil would not have worked .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 79]: A few days after he had sailed , he bitterly repented that he had not stated the whole of his circumstances to Father Seysen , and taken his advice upon the propriety of following up his search ; but it was now too late ; already was the good ship _ Batavia _ more than a thousand miles from the port of Amsterdam , and his duty , whatever it might be , _ must _ be fulfilled .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 25]: As the fleet approached the Cape , his anxiety increased to such a degree that it was remarked by all who were on board .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 26]: The captain and officers commanding the troops embarked , who all felt interested in him , vainly attempted to learn the cause of his anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 21]: Philip would plead ill-health ; and his haggard countenance and sunken eyes silently proved that he was under acute suffering .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 54]: The major part of the night he passed on deck , straining his eyes in every quarter , and watching each change in the horizon , in anticipation of the appearance of the Phantom Ship ; and it was not till the day dawned that he sought a perturbed repose in his cabin .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 35]: After a favourable passage , the fleet anchored to refresh at Table Bay , and Philip felt some small relief , that up to the present time the supernatural visitation had not again occurred .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 22]: As soon as the fleet had watered , they again made sail , and again did Philip 's agitation become perceptible .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 44]: With a favouring breeze , however , they rounded the Cape , passed by Madagascar , and arrived in the Indian Seas , when the _ Batavia _ parted company with the rest of the fleet , which steered to Cambroon and Ceylon .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 17]: `` And now , '' thought Philip , `` will the Phantom Ship make her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 19]: It has only waited till we should be left without a consort to assist us in distress . ''
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 21]: But the _ Batavia _ sailed in a smooth sea and under a cloudless sky , and nothing was seen .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 25]: In a few weeks she arrived off Java , and , previous to entering the splendid roads of Batavia , hove-to for the night .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 31]: This was the last night they would be under sail , and Philip stirred not from the deck , but walked to and fro , anxiously waiting for the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 20]: The morning broke -- the sun rose in splendour , and the _ Batavia _ steered into the roads .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 31]: Before noon she was at anchor , and Philip , with his mind relieved , hastened down to his cabin , and took that repose which he so much required .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 15]: He awoke refreshed , for a great weight had been taken off his mind .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 45]: `` It does not follow , then , '' thought he , `` that because I am on board the vessel therefore the crew are doomed to perish ; it does not follow that the Phantom Ship is to appear because I seek her .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 12]: If so , I have no further weight upon my conscience .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 44]: I seek her , it is true , and wish to meet with her ; I stand , however , but the same chance as others ; and it is no way certain that because I seek , I am sure to find .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 26]: That she brings disaster upon all she meets , may be true , but not that I bring with me the disaster of meeting her .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 5]: Heaven I thank thee !
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 10]: Now I can prosecute my search without remorse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 13]: Philip , restored to composure by these reflections , went on deck .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 34]: The debarkation of the troops was already taking place , for they were as anxious to be relieved from their long confinement as the seamen were to regain a little space and comfort .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 5]: He surveyed the scene .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 53]: The town of Batavia lay about one mile from them , low on the beach ; from behind it rose a lofty chain of mountains , brilliant with verdure , and , here and there , peopled with country seats , belonging to the residents , delightfully embosomed in forests of trees .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 22]: The panorama was beautiful ; the vegetation was luxuriant , and , from its vivid green , refreshing to the eye .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 89]: Near to the town lay large and small vessels , a forest of masts ; the water in the bay was of a bright blue , and rippled to a soft breeze ; here and there small islets -LRB- like tufts of fresh verdure -RRB- broke the uniformity of the water-line ; even the town itself was pleasing to the eye , the white colour of the houses being opposed to the dark foliage of the trees , which grew in the gardens , and lined the streets .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 33]: `` Can it be possible , '' observed Philip to the captain of the _ Batavia _ , who stood by him , `` that this beautiful spot can be so unhealthy ?
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 12]: I should form a very different opinion from its appearance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 35]: `` Even , '' replied the captain , `` as the venomous snakes of the country start up from among its flowers , so does death stalk about in this beautiful and luxuriant landscape .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 9]: Do you feel better , Mynheer Vanderdecken ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 8]: `` Much better , '' replied Philip .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 18]: `` Still , in your enfeebled state , I should recommend you to go on shore . ''
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 12]: `` I shall avail myself of your permission , with thanks .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 8]: How long shall we stay here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 12]: `` Not long , as we are ordered to run back .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 20]: Our cargo is all ready for us , and will be on board soon after we have discharged . ''
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 38]: Philip took the advice of his captain ; he had no difficulty in finding himself received by a hospitable merchant , who had a house at some distance from the town , and in a healthy situation .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 28]: There he remained two months , during which he re-established his health , and then re-embarked a few days previous to the ship being ready for sea .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 57]: The return voyage was fortunate , and in four months from the date of their quitting Batavia , they found themselves abreast of St Helena ; for vessels , at that period , generally made what is called the eastern passage , running down the coast of Africa , instead of keeping towards the American shores .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 27]: Again they had passed the Cape without meeting with the Phantom Ship ; and Philip was not only in excellent health , but in good spirits .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 31]: As they lay becalmed , with the island in sight , they observed a boat pulling towards them , and in the course of three hours she arrived on board .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 27]: The crew were much exhausted from having been two days in the boat , during which time they had never ceased pulling to gain the island .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 44]: They stated themselves to be the crew of a small Dutch Indiaman , which had foundered at sea two days before ; she had started one of her planks , and filled so rapidly that the men had hardly time to save themselves .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 45]: They consisted of the captain , mates , and twenty men belonging to the ship , and an old Portuguese Catholic priest , who had been sent home by the Dutch governor , for having opposed the Dutch interests in the Island of Japan .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 36]: He had lived with the natives , and been secreted by them for some time , as the Japanese government was equally desirous of capturing him , with the intention of taking away his life .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 24]: Eventually he found himself obliged to throw himself into the arms of the Dutch , as being the less cruel of his enemies .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 33]: The Dutch government decided that he should be sent away from the country ; and he had , in consequence , been put on board of the Indiaman for a passage home .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 40]: By the report of the captain and crew , one person only had been lost ; but he was a person of consequence , having for many years held the situation of president in the Dutch factory at Japan .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 13]: He was returning to Holland with the riches which he had amassed .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 82]: By the evidence of the captain and crew , he had insisted , after he was put into the boat , upon going back to the ship to secure a casket of immense value , containing diamonds and other precious stones , which he had forgotten ; they added , that while they were waiting for him the ship suddenly plunged her bowsprit under , and went down head foremost , and that it was with difficulty they had themselves escaped .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 23]: They had waited for some time to ascertain if he would rise again to the surface , but he appeared no more .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 60]: `` I knew that something would happen , '' observed the captain of the sunken vessel , after he had been sitting a short time in the cabin with Philip and the captain of the _ Batavia _ ; `` we saw the Fiend or Devil 's Ship , as they call her , but three days before . ''
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 12]: the _ Flying Dutchman _ , as they name her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 3]: asked Philip .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 20]: `` Yes ; that , I believe , is the name they give her , '' replied the captain .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 45]: `` I have often heard of her ; but it never was my fate to fall in with her before , and I hope it never will be again ; for I am a ruined man , and must begin the world afresh . ''
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 18]: `` I have heard of that vessel , '' observed the captain of the _ Batavia _ .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 11]: `` Pray , how did she appear to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 24]: `` Why , the fact is , I did not see anything but the loom of her hull , '' replied the other .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 52]: `` It was very strange ; the night was fine , and the heavens clear ; we were under top-gallant sails , for I do not carry on during the night , or else we might have put the royals on her ; she would have carried them with the breeze .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 21]: I had turned in , when about two o'clock in the morning the mate called me to come on deck .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 40]: I demanded what was the matter , and he replied he could hardly tell , but that the men were much frightened , and that there was a Ghost Ship , as the sailors termed it , in sight .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 37]: I went on deck ; all the horizon was clear , but on our quarter was a sort of fog , round as a ball , and not more than two cables ' length from us .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 21]: We were going about four knots and a half free , and yet we could not escape from this mist .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 9]: ` Look there , ' said the mate .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 11]: ` Why , what the devil can it be ? '
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 7]: said I , rubbing my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 61]: ` No banks up to windward , and yet a fog in the middle of a clear sky , with a fresh breeze , and with water all around it ; ' for you see the fog did not cover more than a dozen cables ' length , as we could perceive by the horizon on each side of it .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 6]: ` Hark , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 11]: said the mate -- ` they are speaking again . '
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 4]: ` Speaking ! '
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 18]: said I , and I listened ; and from out this ball of fog I heard voices .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 18]: At last , one cried out , ` Keep a sharp look-out forward , d'ye hear ? '
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 8]: ` Ay , ay , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 4]: replied another voice .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 10]: ` Ship on the starboard bow , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 11]: ` Very well ; strike the bell there forward . '
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 8]: And then we heard the bell toll .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 14]: ` It must be a vessel , ' said I to the mate .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 12]: ` Not of this world , sir , ' replied he .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 5]: ` Hark ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 6]: A gun ready forward . '
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 8]: ` Ay , ay , sir ! '
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 21]: was now heard out of the fog , which appeared to near us ; ` all ready , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 4]: ` Fire ! '
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 23]: The report of the gun sounded on our ears like thunder , and then -- '' `` Well , and then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 11]: said the captain of the _ Batavia _ , breathless .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 38]: `` And then , '' replied the other captain , solemnly , `` the fog and all disappeared as if by magic , the whole horizon was clear , and there was nothing to be seen . ''
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 6]: `` Is it possible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 17]: `` There are twenty men on deck to tell the story , '' replied the captain .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 22]: `` And the old Catholic priest to boot , for he stood by me the whole time I was on deck .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 26]: The men said that some accident would happen ; and in the morning watch , on sounding the well , we found four feet water .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 23]: We took to the pumps , but it gained upon us , and we went down , as I have told you .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 20]: The mate says that the vessel is well known -- it is called the _ Flying Dutchman _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 19]: Philip made no remarks at the time , but he was much pleased at what he had heard .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 38]: `` If , '' thought he , `` the Phantom Ship of my poor father appears to others as well as to me , and they are sufferers , my being on board can make no difference .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 29]: I do but take my chance of falling in with her , and do not risk the lives of those who sail in the same vessel with me .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 18]: Now my mind is relieved , and I can prosecute my search with a quiet conscience . ''
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 29]: The next day Philip took an opportunity of making the acquaintance of the Catholic priest , who spoke Dutch and other languages as well as he did Portuguese .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 32]: He was a venerable old man , apparently about sixty years of age , with a white flowing beard , mild in his demeanour , and very pleasing in his conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 38]: When Philip kept his watch that night , the old man walked with him , and it was then , after a long conversation , that Philip confided to him that he was of the Catholic persuasion .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 14]: `` Indeed , my son , that is unusual in a Hollander . ''
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 34]: `` It is so , '' replied Philip ; `` nor is it known on board -- not that I am ashamed of my religion , but I wish to avoid discussion . ''
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 8]: `` You are prudent , my son .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 25]: if the reformed religion produces no better fruit than what I have witnessed in the East , it is little better than idolatry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 27]: `` Tell me , father , '' said Philip -- `` they talk of a miraculous vision -- of a ship not manned by mortal men .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 6]: Did you see it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 59]: `` I saw what others saw , '' replied the priest ; `` and certainly , as far as my senses would enable me to judge , the appearance was most unusual -- I may say supernatural ; but I had heard of this Phantom Ship before , and moreover that its appearance was the precursor of disaster .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 85]: So did it prove in our case , although , indeed , we had one on board , now no more , whose weight of guilt was more than sufficient to sink any vessel ; one , the swallowing up of whom , with all that wealth from which he anticipated such enjoyment in his own country , has manifested that the Almighty will , even in this world , sometimes wreak just and awful retribution on those who have merited His vengeance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 18]: `` You refer to the Dutch President who went down with the ship when it sank . ''
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 28]: `` I do ; but the tale of that man 's crime is long ; to-morrow night I will walk with you , and narrate the whole .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 12]: Peace be with you , my son , and good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 29]: The weather continued fine , and the _ Batavia _ hove-to in the evening with the intention of anchoring the next morning in the roadstead of St Helena .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 24]: Philip , when he went on deck to keep the middle watch , found the old priest at the gangway waiting for him .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 115]: In the ship all was quiet ; the men slumbered between the guns , and Philip , with his new acquaintance , went aft , and seating themselves on a hencoop , the priest commenced as follows : -- `` You are not , perhaps , aware that the Portuguese , although anxious to secure for themselves a country discovered by their enterprise and courage , and the possession of which , I fear , has cost them many crimes , have still never lost sight of one point dear to all good Catholics -- that of spreading wide the true faith , and planting the banner of Christ in the regions of idolatry .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 65]: Some of our countrymen having been wrecked on the coast , we were made acquainted with the islands of Japan ; and seven years afterwards , our holy and blessed St Francis , now with God , landed on the Island of Ximo , where he remained for two years and five months , during which he preached our religion and made many converts .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 33]: He afterwards embarked for China , his original destination , but was not permitted to arrive there ; he died on his passage , and thus closed his pure and holy life .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 45]: After his death , notwithstanding the many obstacles thrown in our way by the priests of idolatry , and the persecutions with which they occasionally visited the members of our faith , the converts to our holy religion increased greatly in the Japanese islands .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 13]: The religion spread fast , and many thousands worshipped the true God .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 98]: `` After a time , the Dutch formed a settlement at Japan , and when they found that the Japanese Christians around the factories would deal only with the Portuguese , in whom they had confidence , they became our enemies ; and the man of whom we have spoken , and who at that period was the head of the Dutch Factory , determined , in his lust for gold , to make the Christian religion a source of suspicion to the emperor of the country , and thus to ruin the Portuguese and their adherents .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 27]: Such , my son , was the conduct of one who professed to have embraced the reformed religion as being of greater purity than our own .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 34]: `` There was a Japanese lord of great wealth and influence who lived near us , and who , with two of his sons , had embraced Christianity , and had been baptised .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 14]: He had two other sons , who lived at the emperor 's court .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 41]: This lord had made us a present of a house for a college and school of instruction : on his death , however , his two sons at court , who were idolaters , insisted upon our quitting this property .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 73]: We refused , and thus afforded the Dutch principal an opportunity of inflaming these young noblemen against us : by this means he persuaded the Japanese emperor that the Portuguese and Christians had formed a conspiracy against his life and throne ; for , be it observed , that when a Dutchman was asked if he was a Christian , he would reply , ` No ; I am a Hollander . '
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 33]: `` The emperor , believing in this conspiracy , gave an immediate order for the extirpation of the Portuguese , and then of all the Japanese who had embraced the Christian faith .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 34]: He raised an army for this purpose , and gave the command of it to the young noblemen I have mentioned , the sons of the lord who had given us the college .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 39]: The Christians , aware that resistance was their only chance , flew to arms , and chose as their generals the other two sons of the Japanese lord , who , with their father , had embraced Christianity .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 21]: Thus were the two armies commanded by four brothers , two on the one side and two on the other .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 34]: `` The Christian army amounted to more than 40,000 men , but of this the emperor was not aware , and he sent a force of about 25,000 to conquer and exterminate them .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 52]: The armies met , and after an obstinate combat -LRB- for the Japanese are very brave -RRB- the victory was on the part of the Christians , and , with the exception of a few who saved themselves in the boats , the army of the emperor was cut to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 23]: `` This victory was the occasion of making more converts , and our army was soon increased to upwards of 50,000 men .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 70]: On the other hand , the emperor , perceiving that his troops had been destroyed , ordered new levies and raised a force of 150,000 men , giving directions to his generals to give no quarter to the Christians , with the exception of the two young lords who commanded them , whom he wished to secure alive , that he might put them to death by slow torture .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 16]: All offers of accommodation were refused , and the emperor took the field in person .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 55]: The armies again met , and on the first day 's battle the victory was on the part of the Christians ; still they had to lament the loss of one of their generals , who was wounded and taken prisoner , and , no quarter having been given , their loss was severe .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 12]: `` The second day 's combat was fatal to the Christians .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 17]: Their general was killed ; they were overpowered by numbers , and fell to a man .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 24]: The emperor then attacked the camp in the rear , and put to the sword every old man , woman , and child .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 21]: On the field of battle , in the camp , and by subsequent torture , more than 60,000 Christians perished .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 36]: But this was not all ; a rigorous search for Christians was made throughout the islands for many years ; and they were , when found , put to death by the most cruel torture .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 69]: It was not until fifteen years ago that Christianity was entirely rooted out of the Japanese empire , and during a persecution of somewhat more than sixteen years , it is supposed that upwards of 400,000 Christians were destroyed ; and all this slaughter , my son , was occasioned by the falsehood and avarice of that man who met his just punishment but a few days ago .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 30]: The Dutch company , pleased with his conduct , which procured for them such advantages , continued him for many years as the president of their factory at Japan .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 26]: He was a young man when he first went there , but his hair was grey when he thought of returning to his own country .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 23]: He had amassed immense wealth , -- immense , indeed , must it have been to have satisfied avarice such as his !
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 16]: All has now perished with him , and he has been summoned to his account .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 7]: Reflect a little , my son .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 40]: Is it not better to follow up our path of duty , to eschew the riches and pleasures of this world , and , at our summons hence , to feel that we have hopes of bliss hereafter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 13]: `` Most true , holy father , '' replied Philip , musing .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 29]: `` I have but a few years to live , '' continued the old man , `` and God knows I shall quit this world without reluctance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 11]: `` And so could I , '' replied Philip . ''
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 7]: _ You _ , my son !
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 3]: -- no .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 11]: You are young , and should be full of hopes .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 21]: You have still to do your duty in that station to which it shall please God to call you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 15]: `` I know that I have a duty to perform , '' replied Philip .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 16]: `` Father , the night air is too keen for one so aged as you .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 17]: Retire to your bed , and leave me to my watch and my own thoughts . ''
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 7]: `` I will , my son !
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 5]: may Heaven guard you !
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 7]: Take an old man 's blessing .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 3]: Good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 12]: `` Good-night , '' replied Philip , glad to be alone .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 9]: `` Shall I confess all to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 3]: thought Philip .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 9]: `` I feel I could confess to him .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 4]: -- But no .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 12]: I would not to Father Seysen , -- why to him ?
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 18]: I should put myself in his power , and he might order me -- No , no !
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 6]: my secret is my own .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 6]: I need no advisers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 18]: And Philip pulled out the relic from his bosom , and put it reverently to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 18]: The _ Batavia _ waited a few days at St Helena , and then continued her voyage .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 69]: In six weeks Philip again found himself at anchor in the Zuyder Zee , and having the captain 's permission , he immediately set off for his own home , taking with him the old Portuguese priest Mathias , with whom he had formed a great intimacy , and to whom he had offered his protection for the time he might wish to remain in the Low Countries .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 72]: Chapter XIII `` Far be it from me to wish to annoy you , my son , '' said Father Mathias , as with difficulty he kept pace with the rapid strides of Philip , who was now within a quarter of a mile of his home ; `` but still recollect that this is but a transitory world , and that much time has elapsed since you quitted this spot .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 34]: For that reason I would fain desire you , if possible , to check these bounding aspirations after happiness , these joyful anticipations in which you have indulged since we quitted the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 60]: I hope and trust in the mercy of God , that all will be right , and that in a few minutes you will be in the arms of your much-loved wife : but still , in proportion as you allow your hopes to be raised , so will you inevitably have them crushed should disappointment cross your path .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 30]: At Flushing we were told that there has been a dreadful visitation in this land , and death may not have spared even one so young and fair . ''
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 12]: `` Let us haste on , father , '' replied Philip .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 14]: `` What you say is true , and suspense becomes most dreadful . ''
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 23]: Philip increased his speed , leaving the old man to follow him : he arrived at the bridge with its wooden gate .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 22]: It was then about seven o'clock in the morning , for they had crossed the Scheldt at the dawn of day .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 10]: Philip observed that the lower shutters were still closed .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 27]: `` They might have been up and stirring before this , '' thought he , as he put his hand to the latch of the door .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 5]: It was not fastened .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 3]: Philip entered !
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 29]: there was a light burning in the kitchen ; he pushed open the door , and beheld a maid-servant leaning back in her chair in a profound sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 33]: Before he had time to go in and awaken her , he heard a voice at the top of the stairs , saying , `` Marie , is that the doctor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 33]: Philip waited no longer ; in three bounds he was on the landing-place above , and brushing by the person who had spoken , he opened the door of Amine 's room .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 46]: A floating wick in a tumbler of oil gave but a faint and glimmering light ; the curtains of the bed were drawn , and by the side of it was kneeling a figure that was well known to Philip -- that of Father Seysen .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 67]: Philip recoiled ; the blood retreated to his heart ; he could not speak : panting for breath , he supported himself against the wall , and at last vented his agony of feeling by a deep groan , which aroused the priest , who turned his head , and perceiving who it was , rose from his knees , and extended his hand in silence .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 8]: `` She is dead , then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 5]: at last exclaimed Philip .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 14]: `` No , my son , not dead ; there is yet hope .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 42]: The crisis is at hand ; in one more hour her fate will be decided : then either will she be restored to your arms , or follow the many hundreds whom this fatal epidemic has consigned to the tomb . ''
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 17]: Father Seysen then led Philip to the side of the bed , and withdrew the curtain .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 13]: Amine lay insensible , but breathing heavily ; her eyes were closed .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 23]: Philip seized her burning hand , knelt down , pressed it to his lips , and burst into a paroxysm of tears .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 26]: As soon as he had become somewhat composed , Father Seysen persuaded him to rise and sit with him by the side of the bed .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 43]: `` This is a melancholy sight to witness at your return , Philip , '' said he ; `` and to you who are so ardent , so impetuous , it must be doubly so ; but God 's will be done .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 44]: Remember there is yet hope -- not strong hope , I grant , but still there is hope , for so told me the medical man who has attended her , and who will return , I expect , in a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 39]: Her disease is a typhus fever , which has swept off whole families within these last two months , and still rages violently ; fortunate , indeed , is the house which has to mourn but one victim .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 18]: I would that you had not arrived just now , for it is a disease easily communicated .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 9]: Many have fled from the country for security .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 27]: To add to our misfortunes , we have suffered from the want of medical advice , for physician and patient have been swept away together . ''
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 33]: The door was now slowly opened , and a tall , dark man , in a brown cloak , holding to his nose a sponge saturated with vinegar , entered the room .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 17]: He bowed his head to Philip and the priest , and then went to the bedside .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 36]: For a minute he held his fingers to the pulse of the sufferer , then laying down her arm , he put his hand to her forehead , and covered her up with the bedclothes .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 27]: He handed to Philip the sponge and vinegar , making a sign that he should use it , and beckoned Father Seysen out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 7]: In a minute the priest returned .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 18]: `` I have received his directions , my son ; he thinks that she may be saved .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 32]: The clothes must be kept on her , and replaced if she should throw them off ; but everything will depend upon quiet and calm after she recovers her senses . ''
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 12]: `` Surely we can promise her that , '' replied Philip .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 21]: `` It is not the knowledge of your return , or even the sight of you , which alarms me .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 20]: Joy seldom kills , even when the shock is great , but there are other causes for uneasiness . ''
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 9]: `` What are they , holy father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 36]: `` Philip , it is now thirteen days that Amine has raved , and during that period I have seldom quitted her but to perform the duties of my office to others who required it .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 36]: I have been afraid to leave her , Philip , for in her ravings she has told such a tale , even unconnected as it has been , as has thrilled my soul with horror .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 16]: It evidently has long lain heavily on her mind , and must retard her recovery .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 48]: Philip Vanderdecken , you may remember that I would once have had the secret from you -- the secret which forced your mother to her tomb , and which now may send your young wife to follow her , for it is evident that she knows all .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 6]: Is it not true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 12]: `` She does know all , '' replied Philip , mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 10]: `` And she has in her delirium told all .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 25]: Nay , I trust she has told more than all ; but of that we will not speak now : watch her , Philip .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 38]: I will return in half an hour , for by that time , the doctor tells me , the symptoms will decide whether she will return to reason , or be lost to you for ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 44]: Philip whispered to the priest that he had been accompanied by Father Mathias , who was to remain as his guest , and requested him to explain the circumstances of his present position to him , and see that he was attended to .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 21]: Father Seysen then quitted the room , when Philip sat down by the bedside , and drew back the curtain .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 21]: Perhaps there is no situation in life so agonising to the feelings as that in which Philip was now placed .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 100]: His joyful emotions when expecting to embrace in health and beauty the object of his warmest affections , and of his continual thought during his long absence , suddenly checked by disappointment , anxiety , and grief , at finding her lying emaciated , changed , corrupted with disease -- her mind overthrown -- her eyes unconscious of his presence -- her existence hanging by a single hair -- her frame prostrate before the King of Terrors who hovers over her with uplifted dart , and longs for the fiat which should permit him to pierce his unconscious victim .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 4]: `` Alas ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 12]: thought Philip , `` is it thus we meet , Amine ?
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 28]: Truly did Father Mathias advise me , as I hurried so impetuously along , not -LRB- as I fondly thought -RRB- to happiness , but to misery .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 4]: God of Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 6]: be merciful and forgive me .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 35]: If I have loved this angelic creature of Thy formation , even more than I have Thee -- spare her -- good Heaven , spare her -- or I am lost for ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 14]: Philip covered up his face , and remained for some time in prayer .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 16]: He then bent over his Amine , and impressed a kiss upon her burning lips .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 24]: They were burning , but still there was moisture upon them , and Philip perceived that there was also moisture on her forehead .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 29]: He felt her hand , and the palm of it was moist ; and carefully covering her with the bedclothes , he watched her with anxiety and hope .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 46]: In a quarter of an hour he had the delight of perceiving that Amine was in a profuse perspiration ; gradually her breathing became less heavy , and instead of the passive state in which she had remained , she moved , and became restless .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 28]: Philip watched , and replaced the clothes as she threw them off , until she at last appeared to have fallen into a profound and sweet sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 12]: Shortly after , Father Seysen and the physician made their appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 11]: Philip stated , in few words , what had occurred .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 14]: The doctor went to the bedside , and in half a minute returned .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 55]: `` Your wife is spared to you , Mynheer , but it is not advisable that she should see you so unexpectedly ; the shock may be too great in her weak state ; she must be allowed to sleep as long as possible ; on her awaking she will have returned to reason .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 10]: You must leave her then to Father Seysen . ''
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 12]: `` May I not remain in the room until she wakes ?
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 8]: I will then hasten away unobserved . ''
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 20]: `` That will be useless ; the disease is contagious , and you have been here too long already .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 55]: Remain below ; you must change your clothes , and see that they prepare a bed for her in another room , to which she must be transported as soon as you think she can bear it ; and then let these windows be thrown open , that the room may be properly ventilated .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 32]: It will not do to have a wife just rescued from the jaws of death run the risk of falling a sacrifice to the attentions necessary to a sick husband . ''
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 38]: Philip perceived the prudence of this advice , and quitting the room with the medical man , he went and changed his clothes , and then joined Father Mathias , whom he found in the parlour below .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 17]: `` You were right , father , '' said Philip , throwing himself on the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 25]: `` I am old and suspicious , you are young and buoyant , Philip ; but I trust all may yet be well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 10]: `` I trust so too , '' replied Philip .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 45]: He then remained silent and absorbed in thought , for now that the imminent danger was over , he was reflecting upon what Father Seysen had communicated to him relative to Amine 's having revealed the secret whilst in a state of mental aberration .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 14]: The priest perceiving that his mind was occupied , did not interrupt him .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 13]: An hour had thus passed , when Father Seysen entered the room .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 9]: `` Return thanks to Heaven , my son .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 11]: Amine has awakened , and is perfectly sensible and collected .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 9]: There is now little doubt of her recovery .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 30]: She has taken the restorative ordered by the doctor , though she was so anxious to repose once more , that she could hardly be persuaded to swallow it .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 42]: She is now again fast asleep , and watched by one of the maidens , and in all probability will not move for many hours ; but every moment of such sleep is precious , and she must not be disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 16]: I will now see to some refreshment , which must be needful to us all .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 23]: Philip , you have not introduced me to your companion , who , I perceive , is of my own calling . ''
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 38]: `` Forgive me , sir , '' replied Philip ; `` you will have great pleasure in making acquaintance with Father Mathias , who has promised to reside with me , I trust , for some time .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 29]: I will leave you together , and see to the breakfast being prepared , for the delay of which I trust Father Mathias will accept my apology . ''
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 12]: Philip then left the room , and went into the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 25]: Having ordered what was requisite , to be taken into the parlour , he put on his hat and walked out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 40]: He could not eat ; his mind was in a state of confusion ; the events of the morning had been too harassing and exciting , and he felt as if the fresh air was necessary to his existence .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 57]: As he proceeded , careless in which direction , he met many with whom he had been acquainted , and from whom he had received condolence at his supposed bereavement , and congratulations when they learnt from him that the danger was over ; and from them he also learnt how fatal had been the pestilence .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 35]: Not one-third of the inhabitants of Terneuse and the surrounding country remained alive , and those who had recovered were in a state of exhaustion which prevented them from returning to their accustomed occupations .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 33]: They had combated disease , but remained the prey of misery and want ; and Philip mentally vowed that he would appropriate all his savings to the relief of those around him .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 18]: It was not until more than two hours had passed away that Philip returned to the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 19]: On his arrival he found that Amine still slumbered , and the two priests were in conversation below .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 18]: `` My son , '' said Father Seysen , `` let us now have a little explanation .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 30]: I have had a long conference with this good Father , who hath much interested me with his account of the extension of our holy religion among the Pagans .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 59]: He hath communicated to me much to rejoice at and much to grieve for ; but , among other questions put to him , I have -LRB- in consequence of what I have learnt during the mental alienation of your wife -RRB- interrogated him upon the point of a supernatural appearance of a vessel in the eastern seas .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 22]: You observe , Philip , that your secret is known to me , or I could not have put that question .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 32]: To my surprise , he hath stated a visitation of the kind to which he was eye-witness , and which can not reasonably be accounted for , except by supernatural interposition .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 8]: A strange and certainly most awful visitation !
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 86]: Philip , would it not be better -LRB- instead of leaving me in a maze of doubt -RRB- that you now confided to us both all the facts connected with this strange history , so that we may ponder on them , and give you the benefit of the advice of those who are older than yourself , and who , by their calling may be able to decide more correctly whether this supernatural power has been exercised by a good or evil intelligence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 14]: `` The holy Father speaks well , Philip Vanderdecken , '' observed Mathias .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 34]: `` If it be the work of the Almighty , to whom should you confide and by whom should you be guided , but by those who do His service on this earth ?
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 23]: If of the Evil One , to whom but to those whose duty and wish it is to counteract his baneful influence ?
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 38]: And reflect , Philip , that this secret may sit heavily on the mind of your cherished wife , and may bow her to the grave , as it did your -LRB- I trust -RRB- sainted mother .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 47]: With you , and supported by your presence , she may bear it well ; but , recollect how many are the lonely days and nights that she must pass during your absence , and how much she must require the consolation and help of others .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 43]: A secret like this must be as a gnawing worm , and , strong as she may be in courage , must shorten her existence , but for the support and the balm she may receive from the ministers of our faith .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 38]: It was cruel and selfish of you , Philip , to leave her , a lone woman , to bear up against your absence , and at the same time oppressed with so fatal a knowledge . ''
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 13]: `` You have convinced me , holy Father , '' replied Philip .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 19]: `` I feel that I should , before this , have made you acquainted with this strange history .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 41]: I will now state the whole of the circumstances which have occurred , but with little hope your advice can help me , in a case so difficult , and in a duty so peremptory , yet so perplexing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 82]: Philip then entered into a minute detail of all that had passed from the few days previous to his mother 's death , until the present time , and when he had concluded , he observed -- `` You see , Father , that I have bound myself by a solemn vow -- that that vow has been recorded and accepted ; and it appears to me that I have nothing now to do but to follow my peculiar destiny . ''
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 25]: `` My son , you have told us strange and startling things -- things not of this world -- if you are not deceived .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 4]: Leave us now .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 24]: Father Mathias and I will consult upon this serious matter , and when we are agreed , you shall know our decision . ''
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 26]: Philip went upstairs to see Amine ; she was still in a deep sleep : he dismissed the servant , and watched by the bedside .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 20]: For nearly two hours did he remain there , when he was summoned down to meet the two priests .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 26]: `` We have had a long conversation , my son , '' said Father Seysen , `` upon this strange , and perhaps supernatural occurrence .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 128]: I say _ perhaps _ , for I would have rejected the frenzied communications of your mother , as the imaginings of a heated brain ; and for the same reason I should have been equally inclined to suppose that the high state of excitement that you were in at the time of her death may have disordered your intellect ; but , as Father Mathias positively asserts , that a strange , if not supernatural , appearance of a vessel did take place , on his passage home , and which appearance tallies with and corroborates the legend , if so I may call it , to which you have given evidence ; I say that it is not impossible but that it is supernatural . ''
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 24]: `` Recollect that the same appearance of the Phantom Ship has been permitted to me and to many others , '' replied Philip .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 22]: `` Yes , '' replied Father Seysen ; `` but who is there alive of those who saw it but yourself ?
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 7]: But that is of little importance .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 21]: We will admit that the whole affair is not the work of man , but of a superior intelligence . ''
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 6]: `` Superior , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 3]: replied Philip .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 9]: `` It is the work of Heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 27]: `` That is a point not so easily admitted ; there is another power as well as that which is divine -- that of the devil !
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 6]: -- the arch-enemy of mankind !
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 46]: But as that power , inferior to the power of God , can not act without His permission , we may indirectly admit that it is the will of Heaven that such signs and portents should be allowed to be given on certain occasions . ''
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 12]: `` Then our opinions are the same , good Father . ''
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 9]: `` Nay , not exactly , my son .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 51]: Elymas , the sorcerer , was permitted to practise his arts -- gained from the devil -- that it might be proved , by his overthrow and blindness , how inferior was his master to the Divine Ruler ; but it does not therefore follow that sorcery generally was permitted .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 47]: In this instance it may be true that the Evil One has been permitted to exercise his power over the captain and crew of that ship , and , as a warning against such heavy offences , the supernatural appearance of the vessel may be permitted .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 8]: So far we are justifiable in believing .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 18]: But the great questions are , first , whether it be your father who is thus doomed ?
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 48]: and , secondly , how far you are necessitated to follow up this mad pursuit , which , it appears to me -- although it may end in your destruction -- can not possibly be the means of rescuing your father from his state of unhallowed abeyance ?
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 8]: Do you understand me , Philip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 20]: `` I certainly understand what you would say , Father ; but -- '' `` Answer me not yet .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 109]: It is the opinion of this holy father as well as of myself , that , allowing the facts to be as you suppose , the revelations made to you are not from on high , but the suggestions of the devil , to lead you into danger and ultimately to death ; for if it were your task , as you suppose , why did not the vessel appear on this last voyage , and how can you -LRB- allowing that you met her fifty times -RRB- have communication with that , or with those which are but phantoms and shadows , things not of this world ?
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 79]: Now what we propose is , that you should spend a proportion of the money left by your father , in masses for the repose of his soul , which your mother , in other circumstances , would certainly have done ; and that having so done , you should remain quietly on shore until some new sign should be given to you which may warrant our supposing that you are really chosen for this strange pursuit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 12]: `` But my oath , Father -- my recorded vow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 23]: `` From that , my son , the holy Church hath power to absolve you ; and that absolution you shall receive .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 17]: You have put yourself into our hands , and by our decision you must be guided .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 28]: If there be wrong , it is we , and not you , who are responsible ; but , at present , let us say no more .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 21]: I will now go up , and so soon as your wife awakens , prepare her for your meeting . ''
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 16]: When Father Seysen had quitted the room , Father Mathias debated the matter with Philip .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 33]: A long discussion ensued , in which similar arguments were made use of by the priest ; and Philip , although not convinced , was , at least , doubtful and perplexed .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 5]: He left the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 23]: `` A new sign -- a corroborative sign , '' thought Philip ; `` surely there have been signs and wonders enough .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 21]: Still it may be true that masses for my father 's soul may relieve him from his state of torture .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 16]: At all events , if they decide for me , I am not to blame .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 42]: Well then , let us wait for a new sign of the Divine will -- if so it must be ; '' and Philip walked on , occasionally thinking on the arguments of Father Seysen , and oftener thinking of Amine .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 12]: It was now evening , and the sun was fast descending .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 24]: Philip wandered on , until at last he arrived at the very spot where he had knelt down and pronounced his solemn vow .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 11]: He recognised it ; he looked at the distant hills .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 23]: The sun was just at the same height ; the whole scene , the place , and the time were before him .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 15]: Again Philip knelt down , took the relic from his bosom and kissed it .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 12]: He watched the sun ; he bowed himself to the earth .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 21]: He waited for a sign ; but the sun sank down and the veil of night spread over the landscape .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 27]: There was no sign ; and Philip rose and walked home towards the cottage , more inclined than before to follow the suggestions of Father Seysen .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 26]: On his return , Philip went softly upstairs and entered the room of Amine , whom he found awake and in conversation with the priests .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 11]: The curtain was closed , and he was not perceived .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 16]: With a beating heart he remained near the wall at the head of the bed .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 11]: `` Reason to believe that my husband has arrived ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 8]: said Amine , in a faint voice .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 9]: `` Oh tell me , why so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 22]: `` His ship is arrived , we know ; and one who had seen her said that all were well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 10]: `` And why is he not here , then ?
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 11]: Who should bring the news of his return but himself ?
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 26]: Father Seysen , either he has not arrived or he is here -- I know he must be , if he is safe and well .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 7]: I know my Philip too well .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 2]: Say !
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 5]: is he not here ?
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 19]: Fear not , if you say yes ; but if you say no , you kill me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 18]: `` He is here , Amine , '' replied Father Seysen -- `` here and well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 4]: `` O God !
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 9]: I thank you ; but where is he ?
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 18]: If he is here , he must be in this room , or else you deceive me .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 8]: Oh , this suspense is death ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 13]: `` I am here , '' cried Philip , opening the curtains .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 17]: Amine rose with a shriek , held out her arms , and then fell senseless back .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 30]: In a few seconds , however , she was restored , and proved the truth of the good Father 's assertion , `` that joy does not kill . ''
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 24]: We must now pass over the few days during which Philip watched the couch of his Amine , who rapidly regained her strength .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 37]: As soon as she was well enough to enter upon the subject , Philip narrated all that had passed since his departure ; the confession which he had made to Father Seysen , and the result .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 36]: Amine , too glad that Philip should remain with her , added her persuasions to those of the priests , and , for some little time , Philip talked no more of going to sea .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 39]: Chapter XIV Six weeks had flown away , and Amine , restored to health , wandered over the country , hanging on the arm of her adored Philip , or nestled by his side in their comfortable home .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 43]: Father Mathias still remained their guest ; the masses for the repose of the soul of Vanderdecken had been paid for , and more money had been confided to the care of Father Seysen to relieve the sufferings of the afflicted poor .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 31]: It may be easily supposed that one of the chief topics of conversation between Philip and Amine was the decision of the two priests relative to the conduct of Philip .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 29]: He had been absolved from his oath , but , at the same time that he submitted to his clerical advisers , he was by no means satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 46]: His love for Amine , her wishes for his remaining at home , certainly added weight to the fiat of Father Seysen ; but , although he in consequence obeyed it more willingly , his doubts of the propriety of his conduct remained the same .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 45]: The arguments of Amine , who , now that she was supported by the opinion of the priests , had become opposed to Philip 's departure ; even her caresses , with which those arguments were mingled , were effective but for the moment .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 34]: No sooner was Philip left to himself , no sooner was the question , for a time , dismissed , than he felt an inward accusation that he was neglecting a sacred duty .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 41]: Amine perceived how often the cloud was upon his brow ; she knew too well the cause , and constantly did she recommence her arguments and caresses , until Philip forgot that there was aught but Amine in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 46]: One morning , as they were seated upon a green bank picking the flowers that blossomed round them , and tossing them away in pure listlessness , Amine took the opportunity that she had often waited for , to enter upon a subject hitherto unmentioned .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 14]: `` Philip , '' said she , `` do you believe in dreams ?
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 13]: think you that we may have supernatural communications by such means ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 23]: `` Of course we may , '' replied Philip ; `` we have proof abundant of it in the holy writings . ''
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 16]: `` Why , then , do you not satisfy your scruples by a dream ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 46]: `` My dearest Amine , dreams come unbidden ; we can not command or prevent them -- '' `` We can command them , Philip ; say that you would dream upon the subject nearest to your heart , and you _ shall _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 5]: `` I shall ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 15]: I have that power , Philip , although I have not spoken of it .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 19]: I had it from my mother , with much more that of late I have never thought of .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 13]: You know , Philip , I never say that which is not .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 17]: I tell you , that , if you choose , you shall dream upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 8]: `` And to what good , Amine ?
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 17]: If you have power to make me dream , that power must be from somewhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 27]: `` It is , of course : there are agencies you little think of , which , in my country , are still called into use .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 12]: I have a charm , Philip , which never fails . ''
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 6]: `` A charm , Amine !
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 9]: do you , then , deal in sorcery ?
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 10]: for such powers can not be from Heaven . ''
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 6]: `` I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 9]: I only know the power is given . ''
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 11]: `` It must be from the devil , Amine . ''
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 7]: `` And why so , Philip ?
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 43]: May I not use the argument of your own priests , who say , ` that the power of the devil is only permitted to be used by Divine intelligence , and that it can not be used without that permission ? '
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 21]: Allow it then to be sorcery , or what you please , unless by Heaven permitted , it would fail .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 17]: But I can not see why we should suppose that it is from an evil source .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 16]: We ask for a warning in a dream to guide our conduct in doubtful circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 13]: Surely the evil one would rather lead us wrong than right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 39]: `` Amine , we may be warned in a dream , as the patriarchs were of old ; but to use mystic or unholy charms to procure a vision , is making a compact with the devil . ''
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 16]: `` Which compact the devil could not fulfil if not permitted by a higher power .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 7]: Philip , your reasoning is false .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 20]: We are told that , by certain means , duly observed , we may procure the dreams we wish .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 19]: Our observance of these means is certainly the least we can attend to , to prove our sincerity .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 20]: Forgive me , Philip , but are not observances as necessary in your religion -- which I have embraced ?
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 28]: Are we not told that the omission of the mere ceremony of water to the infant will turn all future chance of happiness to misery eternal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 7]: Philip answered not for some time .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 40]: `` I am afraid , Amine , '' said he , at last , in a low tone ; `` I -- '' `` I fear nothing , Philip , when my intentions are good , '' replied Amine .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 10]: `` I follow certain means to obtain an end .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 5]: What is that end ?
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 21]: It is to find out -LRB- if possible -RRB- what may be the will of Heaven in this perplexing case .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 14]: If it should be through the agency of the devil -- what then ?
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 35]: He becomes my servant , and not my master ; he is permitted by Heaven to act against himself ; '' and Amine 's eyes darted fire , as she thus boldly expressed herself .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 10]: `` Did your mother often exercise her art ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 7]: inquired Philip , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 16]: `` Not to my knowledge ; but it was said that she was most expert .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 17]: She died young -LRB- as you know -RRB- , or I should have known much more .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 18]: Think you , Philip , that this world is solely peopled by such dross as we are ?
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 9]: -- things of clay -- perishable and corruptible ?
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 10]: Lords over beasts -- and ourselves but little better .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 27]: Have you not , from your own sacred writings , repeated acknowledgments and proofs of higher intelligences mixing up with mankind , and acting here below ?
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 10]: Why should what was then , not be now !
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 20]: and what more harm is there to apply for their aid now , than a few thousand years ago ?
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 18]: Why should you suppose that they were permitted on the earth then -- and not permitted now ?
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 6]: What has become of them ?
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 4]: Have they perished ?
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 12]: have they been ordered back -- to where -- to heaven ?
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 21]: If to heaven -- the world and mankind have been left to the mercy of the devil and his agents .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 14]: Do you suppose that we , poor mortals , have been thus abandoned ?
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 9]: I tell you plainly , I think not .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 57]: We no longer have the communications with those intelligences that we once had , because , as we become more enlightened , we become more proud , and seek them not ; but that they still exist -- a host of good against a host of evil , invisibly opposing each other -- is my conviction .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 30]: But , tell me , Philip , do you in your conscience believe that all that has been revealed to you is a mere dream of the imagination ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 18]: `` I do not believe so , Amine : you know well I wish I could . ''
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 22]: `` Then is my reasoning proved : for if such communications can be made to you , why can not others ?
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 27]: You can not tell by what agency ; your priests say it is that of the evil one ; you think it is from on high .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 18]: By the same rule , who is to decide from whence the dream shall come ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 15]: 'T is true , Amine ; but are you certain of your power ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 25]: `` Certain of this : that if it pleases superior intelligence to communicate with you , _ that _ communication may be relied upon .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 29]: Either you will not dream , but pass away the hours in deep sleep , or what you dream will be connected with the question at issue . ''
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 29]: `` Then , Amine , I have made up my mind -- I will dream : for at present my mind is racked by contending and perplexing doubts .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 10]: I would know whether I am right or wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 9]: This night your art shall be employed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 12]: `` Not this night , nor yet to-morrow night , Philip .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 18]: Think you one moment that , in proposing this , I serve you against my own wishes ?
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 56]: I feel as if the dream will decide against me , and that you will be commanded to return to your duty ; for I tell you honestly , I think not with the priests ; but I am your wife , Philip , and it is my duty that you should not be deceived .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 17]: Having the means , as I suppose , to decide your conduct , I offer them .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 24]: Promise me that , if I do this , you will grant me a favour which I shall ask as my reward . ''
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 30]: `` It is promised , Amine , without its being known , '' replied Philip , rising from the turf ; `` and now let us go home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 62]: We observed that Philip , previous to his sailing in the _ Batavia _ , had invested a large proportion of his funds in Dutch East India stock : the interest of the money was more than sufficient for the wants of Amine , and , on his return , he found that the funds left in her charge had accumulated .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 41]: After paying to Father Seysen the sums for the masses , and for the relief of the poor , there was a considerable residue , and Philip had employed this in the purchase of more shares in the India stock .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 9]: The subject of their conversation was not renewed .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 35]: Philip was rather averse to Amine practising those mystical arts , which , if known to the priests , would have obtained for her , in all probability , the anathema of the Church .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 25]: He could not but admire the boldness and power of Amine 's reasonings , but still he was averse to reduce them into practice .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 17]: The third day had passed away , and no more had been said upon the subject .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 16]: Philip retired to bed , and was soon fast asleep ; but Amine slept not .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 22]: So soon as she was convinced that Philip would not be awakened , she slipped from the bed and dressed herself .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 47]: She left the room , and in a quarter of an hour returned , bringing in her hand a small brazier of lighted charcoal , and two small pieces of parchment , rolled up and fixed by a knot to the centre of a narrow fillet .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 19]: They exactly resembled the philacteries that were once worn by the Jewish nation , and were similarly applied .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 21]: One of them she gently bound upon the forehead of her husband , and the other upon his left arm .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 68]: She threw perfumes into the brazier , and as the form of her husband was becoming indistinct from the smoke which filled the room , she muttered a few sentences , waved over him a small sprig of some shrub which she held in her white hand , and then closing the curtains , and removing the brazier she sat down by the side of the bed .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 41]: `` If there be harm , '' thought Amine , `` at least the deed is not his -- 't is mine ; they can not say that he has practised arts that are unlawful and forbidden by his priests .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 7]: On my head be it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 26]: And there was a contemptuous curl on Amine 's beautiful arched lip , which did not say much for her devotion to her new creed .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 9]: Morning dawned , and Philip still slumbered . ''
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 29]: 'T is enough , '' said Amine , who had been watching the rising of the sun , as she beheld his upper limb appear above the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 24]: Again she waved her arm over Philip , holding the sprig in her hand ; and cried , `` Philip , awake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 34]: Philip started up , opened his eyes , and shut them again to avoid the glare of the broad daylight , rested upon his elbow , and appeared to be collecting his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 6]: `` Where am I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 3]: exclaimed he .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 6]: `` In my own bed ?
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 3]: Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 13]: He passed his hand across his forehead , and felt the scroll .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 6]: `` What is this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 11]: continued he , pulling it off , and examining it .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 8]: `` And Amine , where is she ?
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 7]: Good Heavens , what a dream !
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 3]: Another ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 11]: cried he , perceiving the scroll tied to his arm .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 6]: `` I see it now .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 8]: Amine , this is your doing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 14]: And Philip threw himself down , and buried his face in the pillow .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 21]: Amine , in the meantime , had slipped into bed , and had taken her place by Philip 's side .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 7]: `` Sleep , Philip , dear !
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 3]: sleep ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 19]: said she , putting her arms round him ; `` we will talk when we wake again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 8]: `` Are you there , Amine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 5]: replied Philip , confused .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 25]: `` I thought I was alone ; I have dreamed -- '' And Philip again was fast asleep before he could complete his sentence .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 13]: Amine , too , tired with watching , slumbered and was happy .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 31]: Father Mathias had to wait a long while for his breakfast that morning ; it was not till two hours later than usual that Philip and Amine made their appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 16]: `` Welcome , my children , '' said he ; `` you are late . ''
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 24]: `` We are , Father , '' replied Amine ; `` for Philip slept , and I watched till break of day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 15]: `` He hath not been ill , I trust , '' replied the priest .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 16]: `` No , not ill ; but I could not sleep , '' replied Amine .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 27]: `` Then didst thou do well to pass the night -- as I doubt not thou hast done , my child -- in holy watchings . ''
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 29]: Philip shuddered ; he knew that the watching , had its cause been known , would have been , in the priest 's opinion , anything but holy .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 26]: Amine quickly replied -- `` I have , indeed , communed with higher powers , as far as my poor intellect hath been able . ''
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 14]: `` The blessing of our holy Church upon thee , my child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 21]: said the old man , putting his hand upon her head ; `` and on thee too , Philip . ''
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 16]: Philip , confused , sat down to the table ; Amine was collected as ever .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 17]: She spoke little , it is true , and appeared to commune with her own thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 27]: As soon as the repast was finished , the old priest took up his breviary , and Amine beckoning to Philip , they went out together .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 26]: They walked in silence until they arrived at the green spot where Amine had first proposed to him that she should use her mystic power .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 21]: She sat down , and Philip , fully aware of her purpose , took his seat by her in silence .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 25]: `` Philip , '' said Amine , taking his hand , and looking earnestly in his face , `` last night you dreamed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 14]: `` I did , indeed , Amine , '' replied Philip , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 17]: `` Tell me your dream ; for it will be for me to expound it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 11]: `` I fear it needs but little exposition , Amine .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 16]: All I would know is , from what intelligence the dream has been received ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 12]: `` Tell me your dream , '' replied Amine , calmly .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 84]: `` I thought , '' replied Philip , mournfully , `` that I was sailing as captain of a vessel round the Cape : the sea was calm and the breeze light ; I was abaft ; the sun went down , and the stars were more than usually brilliant ; the weather was warm , and I lay down on my cloak , with my face to the heavens , watching the gems twinkling in the sky and the occasionally falling meteors .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 17]: I thought that I fell asleep , and awoke with a sensation as if sinking down .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 43]: I looked around me ; the masts , the rigging , the hull of the vessel -- _ all _ had disappeared , and I was floating by myself upon a large , beautifully shaped shell on the wide waste of waters .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 19]: I was alarmed , and afraid to move , lest I should overturn my frail bark and perish .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 34]: At last , I perceived the fore-part of the shell pressed down , as if a weight were hanging to it ; and soon afterwards a small white hand , which grasped it .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 21]: I remained motionless , and would have called out that my little bark would sink , but I could not .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 30]: Gradually a figure raised itself from the waters , and leaned with both arms over the fore-part of the shell , where I first had seen but the hand .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 61]: It was a female , in form beautiful to excess ; the skin was white as driven snow ; her long loose hair covered her , and the ends floated in the water ; her arms were rounded and like ivory : she said , in a soft sweet voice -- '' ` Philip Vanderdecken , what do you fear ?
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 10]: Have you not a charmed life ? ' '' '
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 30]: I know not , ' replied I , ` whether my life be charmed or not ; but this I know , that it is in danger . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 5]: ` In danger ! '
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 79]: replied she ; ` it might have been in danger when you were trusting to the frail works of men , which the waves love to rend to fragments -- your _ good _ ships , as you call them , which but float about upon sufferance ; but where can be the danger when in a mermaid 's shell , which the mountain wave respects , and upon which the cresting surge dare not throw its spray ?
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 14]: Philip Vanderdecken , you have come to seek your father ? ' '' '
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 18]: I have , ' replied I ; ` is it not the will of Heaven ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 14]: ` It is your destiny -- and destiny rules all above and below .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 6]: Shall we seek him together ?
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 20]: This shell is mine ; you know not how to navigate it ; shall I assist you ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 9]: ` Will it bear us both ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 41]: ` You will see , '' replied she , laughing , as she sank down from the fore-part of the shell , and immediately afterwards appeared at the side , which was not more than three inches above the water .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 24]: To my alarm , she raised herself up , and sat upon the edge , but her weight appeared to have no effect .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 44]: As soon as she was seated in this way -- for her feet still remained in the water -- the shell moved rapidly along , and each moment increased its speed , with no other propelling power than that of her volition . ''
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 11]: ` Do you fear now , Philip Vanderdecken ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 33]: replied I. `` She passed her hands across her forehead , threw aside the tresses which had partly concealed her face , and said -- '' ` Then look at me . '
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 12]: `` I looked , Amine , and I beheld you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 4]: `` Me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 10]: observed Amine , with a smile upon her lips .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 9]: `` Yes , Amine , it was you .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 14]: I called you by your name , and threw my arms round you .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 17]: I felt that I could remain with you and sail about the world for ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 11]: `` Proceed , Philip , '' said Amine , calmly .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 66]: `` I thought we ran thousands and thousands of miles -- we passed by beautiful islands , set like gems on the ocean bed ; at one time bounding against the rippling current , at others close to the shore -- skimming on the murmuring wave which rippled on the sand , whilst the cocoa-tree on the beach waved to the cooling breeze . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 25]: ` It is not in smooth seas that your father must be sought , ' said she , ` we must try elsewhere . '
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 51]: `` By degrees the waves rose , until at last they were raging in their fury , and the shell was tossed by the tumultuous waters ; but still not a drop entered , and we sailed in security over billows which would have swallowed up the proudest vessel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 9]: ` Do you fear now , Philip ? '
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 6]: said you to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 19]: ` No , ' replied I ; ` with you , Amine , I fear nothing . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 22]: ` We are now off the Cape again , ' said she ; ` and here you may find your father .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 20]: Let us look well round us , for if we meet a ship it must be _ his _ .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 14]: None but the Phantom Ship could swim in a gale like this . '
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 50]: `` Away we flew over the mountainous waves -- skimming from crest to crest between them , our little bark sometimes wholly out of the water ; now east , now west , north , south , in every quarter of the compass , changing our course each minute .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 21]: We passed over hundreds of miles : at last we saw a vessel , tossed by the furious gale . ''
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 23]: ` There , ' cried she , pointing with her finger , ` there is your father 's vessel , Philip . '
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 21]: `` Rapidly did we approach -- they saw us from on board , and brought the vessel to the wind .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 23]: We were alongside -- the gangway was clearing away -- for though no boat could have boarded , our shell was safe .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 4]: I looked up .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 7]: I saw my father , Amine !
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 14]: Yes , saw him , and heard him as he gave his orders .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 15]: I pulled the relic from my bosom , and held it out to him .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 17]: He smiled , as he stood on the gunnel , holding on by the main shrouds .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 36]: I was just rising to mount on board , for they had handed to me the man-ropes , when there was a loud yell , and a man jumped from the gangway into the shell .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 42]: You shrieked , slipped from the side , and disappeared under the wave , and in a moment the shell , guided by the man who had taken your place , flew away from the vessel with the rapidity of thought .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 9]: I felt a deadly chill pervade my frame .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 16]: I turned round to look at my new companion -- it was the Pilot Schriften !
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 16]: -- the one-eyed wretch who was drowned when we were wrecked in Table Bay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 3]: ` No !
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 2]: no !
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 4]: not yet ! '
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 3]: cried he .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 27]: `` In an agony of despair and rage I hurled him off his seat on the shell , and he floated on the wild waters . ''
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 19]: ` Philip Vanderdecken , ' said he , as he swam , ` we shall meet again ! '
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 21]: `` I turned away my head in disgust , when a wave filled my bark , and down it sank .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 21]: I was struggling under the water , sinking still deeper and deeper , but without pain , when I awoke .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 22]: `` Now , Amine , '' said Philip , after a pause , `` what think you of my dream ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 24]: `` Does it not point out that I am your friend , Philip , and that the Pilot Schriften is your enemy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 11]: `` I grant it ; but he is dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 7]: `` Is that so certain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 11]: `` He hardly could have escaped without my knowledge . ''
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 12]: `` That is true , but the dream would imply otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 29]: Philip , it is my opinion that the only way in which this dream is to be expounded is -- that you remain on shore for the present .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 8]: The advice is that of the priests .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 9]: In either case you require some further intimation .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 20]: In your dream , _ I _ was your safe guide -- be guided now by me again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 7]: `` Be it so , Amine .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 26]: If your strange art be in opposition to our holy faith , you expound the dream in conformity with the advice of its ministers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 4]: `` I do .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 14]: And now , Philip , let us dismiss the subject from our thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 33]: Should the time come , your Amine will not persuade you from your duty ; but recollect , you have promised to grant _ one _ favour when I ask it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 17]: `` I have : say , then , Amine , what may be your wish ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 3]: `` O !
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 4]: nothing at present .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 11]: I have no wish on earth but what is gratified .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 9]: Have I not you , dear Philip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 12]: replied Amine , fondly throwing herself on her husband 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 34]: Chapter XV It was about three months after this conversation that Amine and Philip were again seated upon the mossy bank which we have mentioned , and which had become their favourite resort .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 25]: Father Mathias had contracted a great intimacy with Father Seysen , and the two priests were almost as inseparable as were Philip and Amine .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 35]: Having determined to wait a summons previous to Philip 's again entering upon his strange and fearful task ; and , happy in the possession of each other , the subject was seldom revived .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 53]: Philip , who had , on his return , expressed his wish to the Directors of the Company for immediate employment , and , if possible , to have the command of a vessel , had , since that period , taken no further steps , nor had any communication with Amsterdam .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 25]: `` I am fond of this bank , Philip , '' said Amine ; `` I appear to have formed an intimacy with it .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 42]: It was here , if you recollect , that we debated the subject of the lawfulness of inducing dreams ; and it was here , dear Philip , that you told me your dream , and that I expounded it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 40]: `` You did so , Amine ; but if you ask the opinion of Father Seysen , you will find that he would give rather a strong decision against you -- he would call it heretical and damnable . ''
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 8]: `` Let him , if he pleases .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 9]: I have no objection to tell him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 16]: `` I pray not , Amine ; let the secret remain with ourselves only . ''
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 10]: `` Think you Father Mathias would blame me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 6]: `` I certainly do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 21]: `` Well , I do not ; there is a kindness and liberality about the old man that I admire .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 11]: I should like to argue the question with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 20]: As Amine spoke , Philip felt something touch his shoulder , and a sudden chill ran through his frame .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 55]: In a moment his ideas reverted to the probable cause : he turned round his head , and , to his amazement , beheld the -LRB- supposed to be drowned -RRB- mate of the _ Ter Schilling _ , the one-eyed Schriften , who stood behind him , with a letter in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 16]: The sudden appearance of this malignant wretch induced Philip to exclaim , `` Merciful heaven !
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 5]: is it possible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 24]: Amine , who had turned her head round at the exclamation of Philip , covered up her face , and burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 30]: It was not fear that caused this unusual emotion on her part , but the conviction that her husband was never to be at rest but in the grave .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 11]: `` Philip Vanderdecken , '' said Schriften , `` he !
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 2]: he !
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 14]: I 've a letter for you -- it is from the Company . ''
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 19]: Philip took the letter , but , previous to opening it , he fixed his eyes upon Schriften .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 22]: `` I thought , '' said he , `` that you were drowned when the ship was wrecked in False Bay .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 6]: How did you escape ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 7]: `` How did I escape ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 3]: replied Schriften .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 11]: `` Allow me to ask how did you escape ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 27]: `` I was thrown up by the waves , '' replied Philip ; `` but -- '' `` But , '' interrupted Schriften , `` he !
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 2]: he !
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 13]: the waves ought _ not _ to have thrown me up . ''
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 7]: `` And why not , pray ?
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 7]: I did not say that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 36]: but I presume you wish it had been so ; but , on the contrary , I escaped in the same way that you did -- I was thrown up by the waves -- he !
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 2]: he !
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 7]: but I ca n't wait here .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 7]: I have done my bidding . ''
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 12]: `` Stop , '' replied Philip ; answer me one question .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 14]: `` Do you sail in the same vessel with me this time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 44]: `` I 'd rather be excused , '' replied Schriften ; `` I am not looking for the Phantom Ship , Mynheer Vanderdecken ; '' and , with this reply , the little man turned round and went away at a rapid pace .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 10]: `` Is not this a summons , Amine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 20]: said Philip , after a pause , still holding the letter in his hand , with the seal unbroken .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 10]: `` I will not deny it , dearest Philip .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 22]: It is most surely so ; the hateful messenger appears to have risen from the grave that he might deliver it .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 12]: Forgive me , Philip ; but I was taken by surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 13]: I will not again annoy you with a woman 's weakness . ''
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 11]: `` My poor Amine , '' replied Philip , mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 3]: `` Alas !
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 9]: why did I not perform my pilgrimage alone ?
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 29]: It was selfish of me to link you with so much wretchedness , and join you with me in bearing the fardel of never-ending anxiety and suspense . ''
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 23]: `` And who should bear it with you , my dearest Philip , if it is not the wife of your bosom ?
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 14]: You little know my heart if you think I shrink from the duty .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 57]: No , Philip , it is a pleasure , even in its most acute pangs ; for I consider that I am , by partaking with , relieving you of a portion of your sorrow , and I feel proud that I am the wife of one who has been selected to be so peculiarly tried .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 9]: But , dearest , no more of this .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 7]: You must read the letter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 5]: Philip did not answer .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 57]: He broke the seal , and found that the letter intimated to him that he was appointed as first mate to the _ Vrow Katerina _ , a vessel which sailed with the next fleet ; and requesting he would join as quickly as possible , as she would soon be ready to receive her cargo .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 44]: The letter which was from the secretary , further informed him that , after this voyage , he might be certain of having the command of a vessel as captain , upon conditions which would be explained when he called upon the Board .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 25]: `` I thought , Philip , that you had requested the command of a vessel for this voyage , '' observed Amine , mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 26]: `` I did , '' replied Philip ; `` but not having followed up my application , it appears not to have been attended to .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 8]: It has been my own fault . ''
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 9]: `` And now it is too late ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 30]: `` Yes , dearest , most assuredly so : but it matters not ; I would as willingly , perhaps rather , sail this voyage as first mate . ''
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 10]: `` Philip , I may as well speak now .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 55]: That I am disappointed , I must confess ; I fully expected that you would have had the command of a vessel , and you may remember that I exacted a promise from you , on this very bank upon which we now sit , at the time that you told me your dream .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 19]: That promise I shall still exact , and I now tell you what I had intended to ask .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 13]: It was , my dear Philip , permission to sail with you .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 8]: With you , I care for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 64]: I can be happy under every privation or danger ; but to be left alone for so long , brooding over my painful thoughts , devoured by suspense , impatient , restless , and incapable of applying to any one thing -- that , dear Philip , is the height of misery , and that is what I feel when you are absent .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 9]: Recollect , I have your promise , Philip .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 14]: As captain , you have the means of receiving your wife on board .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 39]: I am bitterly disappointed in being left this time ; do , therefore , to a certain degree , console me by promising that I shall sail with you next voyage , if Heaven permit your return . ''
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 13]: `` I promise it , Amine , since you are so earnest .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 22]: I can refuse you nothing ; but I have a foreboding that yours and my happiness will be wrecked for ever .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 40]: I am not a visionary , but it does appear to me that , strangely mixed up as I am , at once with this world and the next , some little portion of futurity is opened to me .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 18]: I have given my promise , Amine , but from it I would fain be released . ''
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 16]: `` And if ill _ do _ come , Philip , it is our destiny .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 6]: Who can avert fate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 22]: `` Amine , we are free agents , and to a certain extent are permitted to direct our own destinies . ''
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 27]: `` Ay , so would Father Seysen fain have made me believe ; but what he said in support of his assertion was to me incomprehensible .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 14]: And yet he said that it was a part of the Catholic faith .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 14]: It may be so -- I am unable to understand many other points .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 9]: I wish your faith were made more simple .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 20]: As yet the good man -- for good he really is -- has only led me into doubt . ''
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 14]: `` Passing through doubt , you will arrive at conviction , Amine . ''
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 27]: `` Perhaps so , '' replied Amine ; `` but it appears to me that I am as yet but on the outset of my journey .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 9]: But come , Philip , let us return .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 12]: You must to Amsterdam , and I will go with you .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 22]: After your labours of the day , at least until you sail , your Amine 's smiles must still enliven you .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 6]: Is it not so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 11]: `` Yes , dearest , I would have proposed it .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 9]: I wonder much how Schriften could come here .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 18]: I did not see his body it is certain , but his escape is to me miraculous .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 8]: Why did he not appear when saved ?
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 6]: where could he have been ?
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 7]: What think you , Amine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 9]: `` What I have long thought , Philip .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 37]: He is a ghoul with an evil eye , permitted for some cause to walk the earth in human form ; and , is , certainly , in some way , connected with your strange destiny .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 25]: If it requires anything to convince me of the truth of all that has passed , it is his appearance -- the wretched Afrit !
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 10]: Oh , that I had my mother 's powers !
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 25]: -- but I forget ; it displeases you , Philip , that I ever talk of such things , and I am silent . ''
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 19]: Philip replied not ; and absorbed in their own meditations they walked back in silence to the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 38]: Although Philip had made up his own mind , he immediately sent the Portuguese priest to summon Father Seysen , that he might communicate with them and take their opinion as to the summons he had received .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 36]: Having entered into a fresh detail of the supposed death of Schriften , and his reappearance as a messenger , he then left the two priests to consult together , and went upstairs to Amine .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 25]: It was more than two hours before Philip was called down , and Father Seysen appeared to be in a state of great perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 14]: `` My son , '' said he , `` we are much perplexed .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 61]: We had hoped that our ideas upon this strange communication were correct , and that , allowing all that you have obtained from your mother and have seen yourself to have been no deception , still that it was the work of the evil one ; and , if so , our prayers and masses would have destroyed this power .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 14]: We advised you to wait another summons , and you have received it .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 24]: The letter itself is of course nothing , but the reappearance of the bearer of the letter is the question to be considered .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 13]: Tell me , Philip , what is your opinion on this point ?
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 17]: It is possible he might have been saved -- why not as well as yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 27]: `` I acknowledge the possibility , Father , '' replied Philip ; `` he may have been cast on shore and have wandered in another direction .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 38]: It is possible , although anything but probable ; but since you ask me my opinion , I must say candidly that I consider he is no earthly messenger -- nay , I am sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 11]: That he is mysteriously connected with my destiny is certain .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 18]: But who he is , and what he is , of course I can not tell . ''
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 21]: `` Then , my son , we have come to the determination , in this instance , not to advise .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 13]: You must act now upon your own responsibility and your own judgment .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 13]: In what way soever you may decide we shall not blame you .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 16]: Our prayers shall be that Heaven may still have you in its holy keeping . ''
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 14]: `` My decision , holy Father , is to obey the summons . ''
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 45]: `` Be it so , my son ; something may occur which may assist to work out the mystery , -- a mystery which I acknowledge to be beyond my comprehension , and of too painful a nature for me to dwell upon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 19]: Philip said no more , for he perceived that the priest was not at all inclined to converse .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 30]: Father Mathias took this opportunity of thanking Philip for his hospitality and kindness , and stated his intention of returning to Lisbon by the first opportunity that might offer .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 30]: In a few days Amine and Philip took leave of the priests , and quitted for Amsterdam -- Father Seysen taking charge of the cottage until Amine 's return .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 44]: On his arrival , Philip called upon the Directors of the Company , who promised him a ship on his return from the voyage he was about to enter upon , making a condition that he should become part owner of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 29]: To this Philip consented , and then went down to visit the _ Vrow Katerina _ , the ship to which he had been appointed as first mate .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 17]: She was still unrigged , and the fleet was not expected to sail for two months .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 23]: Only part of the crew were on board , and the captain , who lived at Dort , had not yet arrived .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 79]: So far as Philip could judge , the _ Vrow Katerina _ was a very inferior vessel ; she was larger than many of the others , but old , and badly constructed ; nevertheless , as she had been several voyages to the Indies , and had returned in safety , it was to be presumed that she would not have been taken up by the Company if they had not been satisfied as to her seaworthiness .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 28]: Having given a few directions to the men who were on board , Philip returned to the hostelry where he had secured apartments for himself and Amine .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 77]: The next day , as Philip was superintending the fitting of the rigging , the captain of the _ Vrow Katerina _ arrived , and , stepping on board of her by the plank which communicated with the quay , the first thing that he did was to run to the mainmast and embrace it with both arms , although there was no small portion of tallow on it to smear the cloth of his coat .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 11]: `` Oh ; my dear Vrow , my Katerina ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 12]: cried he , as if he were speaking to a female .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 6]: `` How do you do ?
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 17]: I 'm glad to see you again ; you have been quite well , I hope ?
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 11]: You do not like being laid up in this way .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 7]: Never mind , my dear creature !
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 8]: you shall soon be handsome again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 17]: The name of this personage who thus made love to his vessel , was Wilhelm Barentz .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 20]: He was a young man , apparently not thirty years of age , of diminutive stature and delicate proportions .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 8]: His face was handsome , but womanish .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 39]: His movements were rapid and restless , and there was that appearance in his eye which would have warranted the supposition that he was a little flighty , even if his conduct had not fully proved the fact .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 23]: No sooner were the ecstacies of the captain over than Philip introduced himself to him , and informed him of his appointment .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 12]: you are the first mate of the _ Vrow Katerina _ .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 9]: Sir , you are a very fortunate man .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 19]: Next to being captain of her , first mate is the most enviable situation in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 23]: `` Certainly not on account of her beauty , '' observed Philip ; `` she may have many other good qualities . ''
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 8]: `` Not on account of her beauty !
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 35]: Why , sir , I say -LRB- as my father has said before me , and it was his Vrow before it was mine -RRB- that she is the handsomest vessel in the world .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 24]: At present you can not judge ; and besides being the handsomest vessel , she has every good quality under the sun . ''
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 25]: `` I am glad to hear it , sir , '' replied Philip ; `` it proves that one should never judge by appearances .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 8]: But is she not very old ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 3]: `` Old !
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 11]: not more than twenty-eight years -- just in her prime .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 47]: Stop , my dear sir , till you see her dancing on the waters , and then you will do nothing all day but discourse with me upon her excellence , and I have no doubt that we shall have a very happy time together . ''
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 12]: `` Provided the subject be not exhausted , '' replied Philip .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 37]: `` That it never will be , on my part : and , allow me to observe , Mr Vanderdecken , that any officer who finds fault with the _ Vrow Katerina _ quarrels with me .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 30]: I am her knight , and I have already fought three men in her defence , -- I trust , I shall not have to fight a fourth . ''
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 42]: Philip smiled : he thought that she was not worth fighting for ; but he acted upon the suggestion , and , from that time forward , he never ventured to express an opinion against the beautiful _ Vrow Katerina _ .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 35]: The crew were soon complete , the vessel rigged , her sails bent , and she was anchored in the stream , surrounded by the other ships composing the fleet about to be despatched .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 50]: The cargo was then received on board , and , as soon as her hold was full , there came , to Philip 's great vexation , an order to receive on board 150 soldiers and other passengers , many of whom were accompanied by their wives and families .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 32]: Philip worked hard , for the captain did nothing but praise the vessel , and , at last , they had embarked everything , and the fleet was ready to sail .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 30]: It was now time to part with Amine , who had remained at the hostelry , and to whom Philip had dedicated every spare moment that he could obtain .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 23]: The fleet was expected to sail in two days , and it was decided , that on the morrow they should part .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 6]: Amine was cool and collected .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 42]: She felt convinced that she should see her husband again , and with that feeling , she embraced him as they separated on the beach , and he stepped into the boat in which he was to be pulled on board .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 34]: `` Yes , '' thought Amine , as she watched the form of her husband , as the distance between them increased -- `` yes , I know that we shall meet again .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 51]: It is not this voyage which is to be fatal to you or me ; but I have a dark foreboding that the next , in which I shall join you , will separate us for ever -- in which way , I know not -- but it is destined .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 6]: The priests talk of free-will .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 10]: Is it free-will which takes him away from me ?
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 10]: Would he not rather remain on shore with me ?
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 13]: But he is not permitted , for he must fulfil his destiny .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 2]: Free-will !
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 11]: Why , if it were not destiny it were tyranny .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 35]: I feel , and have felt , as if these priests are my enemies ; but why I know not : they are both good men , and the creed they teach is good .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 16]: Good-will and charity , love to all , forgiveness of injuries , not judging others .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 28]: All this is good ; and yet my heart whispers to me that -- but the boat is alongside , and Philip is climbing up the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 8]: Farewell , farewell , my dearest husband .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 7]: I would I were a man !
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 4]: No , no !
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 8]: 't is better as it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 18]: Amine watched till she could no longer perceive Philip , and then walked slowly to the hostelry .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 34]: The next day , when she arose , she found that the fleet had sailed at daylight , and the channel , which had been so crowded with vessels , was now untenanted .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 37]: `` He is gone , '' muttered Amine ; `` now for many months of patient , calm enduring , -- I can not say of living , for I exist but in his presence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 17]: Chapter XVI We must leave Amine to her solitude , and follow the fortunes of Philip .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 40]: The fleet had sailed with a flowing sheet , and bore gallantly down the Zuyder Zee ; but they had not been under way an hour before the _ Vrow Katerina _ was left a mile or two astern .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 61]: Mynheer Barentz found fault with the setting and trimming of the sails , and with the man at the helm , who was repeatedly changed ; in short , with everything but his dear _ Vrow Katerina _ : but all would not do ; she still dropped astern , and proved to be the worst-sailing vessel in the fleet .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 35]: `` Mynheer Vanderdecken , '' said he , at last , `` the _ Vrow _ , as my father used to say , is not so very _ fast before _ the wind .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 42]: Vessels that are good on a wind seldom are : but this I will say , that , in every other point of sailing , there is no other vessel in the fleet equal to the _ Vrow Katerina _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 33]: `` Besides , '' observed Philip , who perceived how anxious his captain was on the subject , `` we are heavily laden , and have so many troops on deck . ''
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 25]: The fleet cleared the sands and were then close-hauled , when the _ Vrow Katerina _ proved to sail even more slowly than before .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 47]: `` When we are so _ very _ close-hauled , '' observed Mynheer Barentz , `` the _ Vrow _ does not do so well ; but a point free , and then you will see how she will show her stern to the whole fleet .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 14]: She is a fine vessel , Mynheer Vanderdecken , is she not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 24]: `` A very fine , roomy vessel , '' replied Philip , which was all that , in conscience , he could say .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 81]: The fleet sailed on , sometimes on a wind , sometimes free , but let the point of sailing be what it might , the _ Vrow Katerina _ was invariably astern , and the fleet had to heave-to at sunset to enable her to keep company ; still , the captain continued to declare that the point of sailing on which they happened to be , was the only point in which the _ Vrow Katerina _ was deficient .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 37]: Unfortunately , the vessel had other points quite as bad as her sailing ; she was crank , leaky , and did not answer the helm well : but Mynheer Barentz was not to be convinced .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 23]: He adored his ship , and , like all men desperately in love , he could see no fault in his mistress .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 44]: But others were not so blind , and the admiral , finding the voyage so much delayed by the bad sailing of one vessel , determined to leave her to find her way by herself so soon as they had passed the Cape .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 76]: He was , however , spared the cruelty of deserting her , for a heavy gale came on which dispersed the whole fleet , and on the second day the good ship _ Vrow Katerina _ found herself alone , labouring heavily in the trough of the sea , leaking so much as to require hands constantly at the pumps , and drifting before the gale as fast to leeward almost as she usually sailed .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 17]: For a week the gale continued , and each day did her situation become more alarming .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 31]: Crowded with troops , encumbered with heavy stores , she groaned and laboured , while whole seas washed over her , and the men could hardly stand at the pumps .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 37]: Philip was active , and exerted himself to the utmost , encouraging the worn-out men , securing where aught had given way , and little interfered with by the captain , who was himself no sailor .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 37]: `` Well , '' observed the captain to Philip , as they held on by the belaying-pins , `` you 'll acknowledge that she is a fine weatherly vessel in a gale -- is she not ?
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 29]: Softly , my beauty , softly , '' continued he , speaking to the vessel , as she plunged heavily into the waves , and every timber groaned .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 8]: `` Softly , my dear , softly !
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 14]: How those poor devils in the other ships must be knocking about now .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 2]: Heh !
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 23]: Mynheer Vanderdecken , we have the start of them this time : they must be a terrible long way down to leeward .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 7]: Do n't you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 15]: `` I really can not pretend to say , '' replied Philip , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 12]: `` Why , there 's not one of them in sight .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 8]: Yes , by Heavens , there is !
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 6]: Look on our lee beam .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 5]: I see one now .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 21]: Well , she must be a capital sailor at all events : look there , a point abaft the beam .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 4]: Mercy on me !
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 14]: how stiff she must be to carry such a press of canvas ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 6]: Philip had already seen her .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 18]: It was a large ship on a wind , and on the same tack as they were .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 57]: In a gale in which no vessel could carry the topsails , the _ Vrow Katerina _ being under close-reefed foresails and staysails , the ship seen to leeward was standing under a press of sail -- top-gallant-sail , royals , flying-jib , and every stitch of canvas which could be set in a light breeze .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 44]: The waves were running mountains high , bearing each minute the _ Vrow Katerina _ down to the gunwale : and the ship seen appeared not to be affected by the tumultuous waters , but sailed steadily and smoothly on an even keel .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 21]: At once Philip knew it must be the Phantom Ship , in which his father 's doom was being fulfilled .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 9]: `` Very odd , is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 4]: observed Mynheer Barentz .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 14]: Philip felt such an oppression on his chest that he could not reply .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 17]: As he held on with one hand , he covered up his eyes with the other .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 17]: But the seamen had now seen the vessel , and the legend was too well known .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 56]: Many of the troops had climbed on deck when the report was circulated , and all eyes were now fixed upon the supernatural vessel ; when a heavy squall burst over the _ Vrow Katerina _ , accompanied with peals of thunder and heavy rain , rendering it so thick that nothing could be seen .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 26]: In a quarter of an hour it cleared away , and , when they looked to leeward , the stranger was no longer in sight .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 4]: `` Merciful Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 19]: she must have been upset , and has gone down in the squall , '' said Mynheer Barentz .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 13]: `` I thought as much , carrying such a press of sail .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 16]: There never was a ship that could carry more than the _ Vrow Katerina _ .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 24]: It was madness on the part of the captain of that vessel ; but I suppose he wished to keep up with us .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 6]: Heh , Mynheer Vanderdecken ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 17]: Philip did not reply to these remarks , which fully proved the madness of his captain .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 25]: He felt that his ship was doomed , and when he thought of the numbers on board who might be sacrificed , he shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 37]: After a pause , he said -- `` Mynheer Barentz , this gale is likely to continue , and the best ship that ever was built can not , in my opinion , stand such weather .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 17]: I should advise that we bear up , and run back to Table Bay to refit .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 15]: Depend upon it , we shall find the whole fleet there before us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 28]: `` Never fear for the good ship , _ Vrow Katerina _ , '' replied the captain ; `` see what weather she makes of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 27]: `` Cursed bad , '' observed one of the seamen , for the seamen had gathered near to Philip to hear what his advice might be .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 24]: `` If I had known that she was such an old , crazy beast , I never would have trusted myself on board .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 16]: Mynheer Vanderdecken is right ; we must back to Table Bay ere worse befall us .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 37]: That ship to leeward has given us warning -- she is not seen for nothing , -- ask Mr Vanderdecken , captain ; he knows that well , for he _ is _ a sailor . ''
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 26]: This appeal to Philip made him start ; it was , however , made without any knowledge of Philip 's interest in the Phantom Ship .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 27]: `` I must say , '' replied Philip , `` that , whenever I have fallen in with that vessel , mischief has ever followed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 3]: `` Vessel !
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 12]: why , what was there in that vessel to frighten you ?
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 13]: She carried too much sail , and she has gone down . ''
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 13]: `` She never goes down , '' replied one of the seamen .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 3]: no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 17]: exclaimed many voices ; `` but we shall , if we do not run back . ''
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 3]: `` Pooh !
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 2]: nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 8]: Mynheer Vanderdecken , what say you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 46]: `` I have already stated my opinion , '' replied Philip , who was anxious , if possible , to see the ship once more in port , `` that the best thing we can do , is to bear up for Table Bay . ''
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 51]: `` And , captain , '' continued the old seaman who had just spoken , `` we are all determined that it shall be so , whether you like it or not ; so up with the helm , my hearty , and Mynheer Vanderdecken will trim the sails . ''
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 3]: `` Why !
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 5]: what is this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 4]: cried Captain Barentz .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 12]: `` A mutiny on board of the _ Vrow Katerina _ ?
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 2]: Impossible !
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 17]: The _ Vrow Katerina _ the best ship , the fastest in the whole fleet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 14]: `` The dullest old rotten tub , '' cried one of the seamen .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 10]: cried the captain , `` what do I hear ?
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 11]: Mynheer Vanderdecken , confine that lying rascal for mutiny . ''
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 3]: `` Pooh !
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 2]: nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 10]: he 's mad , '' replied the old seaman .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 24]: `` Never mind him ; come , Mynheer Vanderdecken , we will obey you ; but the helm must be up immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 44]: The captain stormed , but Philip , by acknowledging the superiority of his vessel , at the same time that he blamed the seamen for their panic , pointed out to him the necessity of compliance , and Mynheer Barentz at last consented .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 22]: The helm was put up , the sails trimmed , and the _ Vrow Katerina _ rolled heavily before the gale .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 43]: Towards the evening the weather moderated , and the sky cleared up ; both sea and wind subsided fast ; the leaking decreased , and Philip was in hopes that in a day or two they would arrive safely in the Bay .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 50]: As they steered their course , so did the wind gradually decrease , until , at last , it fell calm ; nothing remained of the tempest but a long heavy swell which set to the westward , and before which the _ Vrow Katerina _ was gradually drifting .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 28]: This was a respite to the worn-out seamen , and also to the troops and passengers , who had been cooped below or drenched on the main-deck .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 55]: The upper deck was crowded ; mothers basked in the warm sun with their children in their arms ; the rigging was filled with the wet clothes , which were hung up to dry on every part of the shrouds ; and the seamen were busily employed in repairing the injuries of the gale .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 30]: By their reckoning , they were not more than fifty miles from Table Bay , and each moment they expected to see the land to the southward of it .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 23]: All was again mirth , and everyone on board , except Philip , considered that danger was no more to be apprehended .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 52]: The second mate , whose name was Krantz , was an active , good seaman , and a great favourite with Philip , who knew that he could trust to him , and it was on the afternoon of this day that he and Philip were walking together on the deck .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 15]: `` What think you , Vanderdecken , of the strange vessel we saw ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 17]: `` I have seen her before , Krantz ; and -- '' `` And what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 28]: `` Whatever vessel I have been in when I have seen her , that vessel has never returned into port -- others tell the same tale . ''
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 13]: `` Is she , then , the ghost of a vessel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 59]: `` I am told so ; and there are various stories afloat concerning her : but of this , I assure you -- that I am fully persuaded than some accident will happen before we reach port , although everything , at this moment , appears so calm , and our port is so near at hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 28]: `` You are superstitious , '' replied Krantz ; `` and yet I must say that , to me , the appearance was not like a reality .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 26]: No vessel could carry such sail in the gale ; but yet , there are madmen afloat who will sometimes attempt the most absurd things .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 24]: If it was a vessel , she must have gone down , for when it cleared up she was not to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 31]: I am not very credulous , and nothing but the occurrence of the consequences which you anticipate will make me believe that there was anything supernatural in the affair . ''
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 31]: I shall not be sorry if the event proves me wrong , '' replied Philip ; `` but I have my forebodings -- we are not in port yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 23]: but we are but a trifling distance from it , and there is every prospect of a continuance of fine weather . ''
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 32]: `` There is no saying from what quarter the danger may come , '' replied Philip ; `` we have other things to fear than the violence of the gale . ''
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 18]: `` True , '' replied Krantz ; `` but , nevertheless , do n't let us croak .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 25]: Notwithstanding all you say , I prophesy that in two days , at the farthest , we are safely anchored in Table Bay . ''
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 14]: The conversation here dropped , and Philip was glad to be left alone .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 19]: A melancholy had seized him -- a depression of spirits even greater than he had ever felt before .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 13]: He leant over the gangway and watched the heaving of the sea .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 5]: `` Merciful Heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 55]: ejaculated he , `` be pleased to spare this vessel ; let not the wail of women , the shrieks of the poor children , now embarked , be heard ; the numerous body of men , trusting to her planks , -- let them not be sacrificed for my father 's crimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 4]: And Philip mused .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 13]: `` The ways of Heaven are indeed mysterious , '' thought he .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 12]: -- `` Why should others suffer because my father has sinned ?
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 9]: And yet , is it not so everywhere ?
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 27]: How many thousands fall on the field of battle in a war occasioned by the ambition of a king , or the influence of a woman !
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 14]: How many millions have been destroyed for holding a different creed of faith !
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 18]: _ He _ works in His own way , leaving us to wonder and to doubt . ''
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 15]: The sun had set before Philip had quitted the gangway and gone down below .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 57]: Commending himself and those embarked with him to the care of Providence , he at last fell asleep ; but , before the bell was struck eight times to announce midnight , he was awakened by a rude shove of the shoulder , and perceived Krantz , who had the first watch , standing by him .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 7]: `` By the Heaven above us !
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 7]: Vanderdecken , you have prophesied right !
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 4]: Up -- quick !
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 9]: _ The ship 's on fire _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 5]: `` On fire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 13]: exclaimed Vanderdecken , jumping out of his berth -- `` where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 5]: `` The main-hold . ''
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 8]: `` I will up immediately , Krantz .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 14]: In the meantime , keep the hatches on and rig the pumps . ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 29]: In less than a minute Philip was on deck , where he found Captain Barentz , who had also been informed of the case by the second mate .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 82]: -- In a few words all was explained by Krantz : there was a strong smell of fire proceeding from the main-hold ; and , on removing one of the hatches , which he had done without calling for any assistance , from a knowledge of the panic it would create , he found that the hold was full of smoke ; he had put it on again immediately , and had only made it known to Philip and the captain .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 27]: `` Thanks for your presence of mind , '' replied Philip ; `` we have now time to reflect quietly on what is to be done .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 33]: If the troops and the poor women and children knew their danger , their alarm would have much impeded us : but how could she have taken fire in the main-hold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 26]: `` I never heard of the _ Vrow Katerina _ taking fire before , '' observed the captain ; `` I think it is impossible .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 33]: It must be some mistake -- she is -- '' `` I now recollect that we have , in our cargo , several cases of vitriol in bottles , '' interrupted Philip .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 13]: `` In the gale , they must have been disturbed and broken .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 33]: I kept them above all , in case of accident : this rolling , gunwale under , for so long a time must have occasioned one of them to fetch way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 13]: `` That 's it , depend upon it , '' observed Krantz .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 51]: `` I did object to receive them , stating that they ought to go out in some vessel which was not so encumbered with troops , so that they might remain on the main-deck ; but they replied , that the invoices were made out and could not be altered .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 5]: But now to act .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 18]: My idea is to keep the hatches on , so as to smother it if possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 42]: `` Yes , '' replied Krantz ; and , at the same time , cut a hole in the deck just large enough to admit the hose , and pump as much water as we can down into the hold . ''
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 18]: `` You are right , Krantz ; send for the carpenter , and set him to work .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 12]: I will turn the hands up and speak to the men .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 15]: I smell the fire now very strong ; there is no time to lose .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 18]: -- If we can only keep the troops and the women quiet we may do something . ''
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 20]: The hands were turned up , and soon made their appearance on deck , wondering why they were summoned .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 36]: The men had not perceived the state of the vessel , for , the hatches having been kept on , the little smoke that issued ascended the hatchway and did not fill the lower deck .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 32]: `` My lads , '' said Philip , `` I am sorry to say that we have reason to suspect that there is some danger of fire in the main-hold . ''
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 6]: `` I smell it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 6]: cried one of the seamen .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 25]: `` So do I , '' cried several others , with every show of alarm , and moving away as if to go below .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 12]: `` Silence , and remain where you are , my men .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 32]: Listen to what I say : if you frighten the troops and passengers we shall do nothing ; we must trust to ourselves ; there is no time to be lost .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 48]: -- Mr Krantz and the carpenter are doing all that can be done at present ; and now , my men , do me the favour to sit down on the deck , every one of you , while I tell you what we must do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 83]: This order of Philip 's was obeyed , and the effect was excellent : it gave the men time to compose themselves after the first shock ; for , perhaps , of all shocks to the human frame , there is none which creates a greater panic than the first intimation of fire on board of a vessel -- a situation , indeed , pitiable , when it is considered that you have to choose between the two elements seeking your destruction .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 10]: Philip did not speak for a minute or two .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 39]: He then pointed out to the men the danger of their situation , what were the measures which he and Krantz had decided upon taking , and how necessary it was that all should be cool and collected .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 80]: He also reminded them that they had but little powder in the magazine , which was far from the site of the fire , and could easily be removed and thrown overboard ; and that , if the fire could not be extinguished , they had a quantity of spars on deck to form a raft , which , with the boats , would receive all on board , and that they were but a short distance from land .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 95]: Philip 's address had the most beneficial effects ; the men rose up when he ordered them ; one portion went down to the magazine , and handed up the powder , which was passed along and thrown overboard ; another went to the pumps ; and Krantz , coming up , reported the hole to have been cut in the planking of the deck above the main-hold : the hoses were fixed , and a quantity of water soon poured down , but it was impossible that the danger could be kept secret .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 43]: The troops were sleeping on the deck , and the very employment of the seamen pointed out what had occurred , even if the smoke , which now increased very much , and filled the lower deck , had not betrayed it .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 11]: In a few minutes the alarm of _ Fire _ !
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 46]: was heard throughout the vessel , and men , women , and children were seen , some hurrying on their clothes , some running frightened about the decks , some shrieking , some praying , and the confusion and terror were hardly to be described .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 36]: The judicious conduct of Philip was then made evident : had the sailors been awakened by the appalling cry , they would have been equally incapable of acting , as were the troops and passengers .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 63]: All subordination would have ceased : some would have seized the boats , and left the majority to perish : others would have hastened to the spirit-room , and , by their drunkenness , added to the confusion and horror of the scene : nothing would have been effected , and almost all would , in all probability , have perished miserably .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 42]: But this had been prevented by the presence of mind shown by Philip and the second mate , for the captain was a cypher : -- not wanting in courage certainly , but without conduct or a knowledge of his profession .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 60]: The seamen continued steady to their duty , pushing the soldiers out of the way as they performed their allotted tasks : and Philip perceiving this , went down below , leaving Krantz in charge ; and by reasoning with the most collected , by degrees he brought the majority of the troops to a state of comparative coolness .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 49]: The powder had been thrown overboard , and another hole having been cut in the deck on the other side , the other pump was rigged , and double the quantity of water poured into the hold ; but it was evident to Philip that the combustion increased .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 66]: The smoke and steam now burst through the interstices of the hatchways and the holes cut in the deck , with a violence that proved the extent of the fire which raged below , and Philip thought it advisable to remove all the women and children to the poop and quarter-deck of the ship , desiring the husbands of the women to stay with them .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 79]: It was a melancholy sight , and the tears stood in Philip 's eyes as he looked upon the group of females -- some weeping and straining their children to their bosoms ; some more quiet and more collected than the men : the elder children mute or crying because their mothers cried , and the younger ones , unconscious of danger , playing with the first object which attracted their attention , or smiling at their parents .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 60]: The officers commanding the troops were two ensigns newly entered , and very young men , ignorant of their duty and without any authority -- for men in cases of extreme danger will not obey those who are more ignorant than themselves -- and , at Philip 's request , they remained with and superintended the women and children .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 74]: So soon as Philip had given his orders that the women and children should be properly clothed -LRB- which many of them were not -RRB- , he went again forward to superintend the labour of the seamen , who already began to show symptoms of fatigue , from the excess of their exertions ; but many of the soldiers now offered to work at the pumps , and their services were willingly accepted .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 6]: Their efforts were in vain .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 37]: In about half an hour more the hatches were blown up with a loud noise , and a column of intense and searching flame darted up perpendicularly from the hold , high as the lower mast-head .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 51]: Then was heard the loud shriek of the women , who pressed their children in agony to their breasts , as the seamen and soldiers who had been working the pumps , in their precipitate retreat from the scorching flames , rushed aft , and fell among the huddled crowd .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 24]: `` Be steady , my lads -- steady , my good fellows , '' exclaimed Philip ; `` there is no danger yet .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 61]: Recollect , we have our boats and raft , and although we can not subdue the fire , and save the vessel , still we may , if you are cool and collected , not only save ourselves , but everyone -- even the poor infants , who now appeal to you as men to exert yourselves in their behalf .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 28]: Come , come , my lads , let us do our duty -- we have the means of escape in our power if we lose no time .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 12]: Carpenter , get your axes , and cut away the boom-lashings .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 32]: Now , my men , let us get our boats out , and make a raft for these poor women and children ; we are not ten miles from the land .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 22]: Krantz , see to the boats with the starboard watch ; larboard watch with me , to launch over the booms .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 14]: Gunners , take any of the cordage you can , ready for lashing .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 19]: Come , my lads , there is no want of light -- we can work without lanterns . ''
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 39]: The men obeyed , as Philip , to encourage them , had almost jocularly remarked -LRB- for a joke is often well-timed , when apparently on the threshold of eternity -RRB- , there was no want of light .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 55]: The column of fire now ascended above the main-top -- licking with its forky tongue the top-mast rigging -- and embracing the mainmast in its folds : and the loud roar with which it ascended proved the violence and rapidity of the combustion below , and how little time there was to be lost .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 39]: The lower and main decks were now so filled with smoke that no one could remain there : some few poor fellows , sick in their cots , had long been smothered , for they had been forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 43]: The swell had much subsided , and there was not a breath of wind : the smoke which rose from the hatchways ascended straight up in the air , which , as the vessel had lost all steerage way , was fortunate .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 33]: The boats were soon in the water , and trusty men placed in them : the spars were launched over , arranged by the men in the boats , and lashed together .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 40]: All the gratings were then collected and firmly fixed upon the spars for the people to sit upon ; and Philip 's heart was glad at the prospect which he now had of saving the numbers which were embarked .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 50]: Chapter XVII But their difficulties were not surmounted -- the fire now had communicated to the main-deck , and burst out of the port-holes amidships -- and the raft which had been forming alongside was obliged to be drifted astern , where it was more exposed to the swell .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 103]: This retarded their labour , and , in the meantime , the fire was making rapid progress ; the mainmast , which had long been burning , fell over the side with the lurching of the vessel , and the flames out of the main-deck ports soon showed their points above the bulwarks , while volumes of smoke were poured in upon the upper deck , almost suffocating the numbers which were crowded there ; for all communication with the fore-part of the ship had been , for some time , cut off by the flames , and everyone had retreated aft .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 37]: The women and children were now carried on to the poop ; not only to remove them farther from the suffocating smoke , but that they might be lowered down to the raft from the stern .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 65]: It was about four o'clock in the morning when all was ready , and by the exertions of Philip and the seamen , notwithstanding the swell , the women and children were safely placed on the raft , where it was considered that they would be less in the way , as the men could relieve each other in pulling when they were tired .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 68]: After the women and children had been lowered down , the troops were next ordered to descend by the ladders ; some few were lost in the attempt , falling under the boat 's bottom and not reappearing ; but two-thirds of the men were safely put in the berths they were ordered to take by Krantz , who had gone down to superintend this important arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 60]: Such had been the vigilance of Philip , who had requested Captain Barentz to stand over the spirit-room hatch , with pistols , until the smoke on the main-deck rendered the precaution unnecessary , that not a single person was intoxicated , and to this might be ascribed the order and regularity which had prevailed during this trying scene .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 82]: But before one-third of the soldiers had descended by the stern ladder , the fire burst out of the stern windows with a violence that nothing could withstand ; spouts of vivid flame extended several feet from the vessel , roaring with the force of a blow-pipe ; at the same time , the flames burst through all the after-ports of the main-deck , and those remaining on board found themselves encircled with fire , and suffocated with smoke and heat .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 83]: The stern ladders were consumed in a minute and dropped into the sea ; the boats which had been receiving the men were obliged , also , to back astern from the intense heat of the flames ; even those on the raft shrieked as they found themselves scorched by the ignited fragments which fell on them as they were enveloped in an opaque cloud of smoke , which hid from them those who still remained on the deck of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 15]: Philip attempted to speak to those on board , but he was not heard .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 14]: A scene of confusion took place which ended in great loss of life .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 23]: The only object appeared to be who should first escape ; though , except by jumping overboard , there was no escape .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 101]: Had they waited , and -LRB- as Philip would have pointed out to them -RRB- have one by one thrown themselves into the sea , the men in the boats were fully prepared to pick them up ; or had they climbed out to the end of the lateen mizen-yard which was lowered down , they might have descended safely by a rope , but the scorching of the flames which surrounded them and the suffocation from the smoke was overpowering , and most of the soldiers sprang over the taffrail at once , or as nearly so as possible .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 102]: The consequence was that there were thirty or forty in the water at the same time , and the scene was as heart-rending as it was appalling ; the sailors in the boats dragging them in as fast as they could -- the women on the raft , throwing to them loose garments to haul them in ; at one time a wife shrieking as she saw her husband struggling and sinking into eternity ; -- at another , curses and execrations from the swimmer who was grappled with by the drowning man , and dragged with him under the surface .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 31]: Of eighty men who were left of the troops on board at the time of the bursting out of the flames from the stern windows , but twenty-five were saved .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 43]: There were but few seamen left on board with Philip , the major part having been employed in making the raft or manning the three boats ; those who were on board remained by his side , regulating their motions by his .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 57]: After allowing full time for the soldiers to be picked up , Philip ordered the men to climb out to the end of the lateen yard which hung on the taffrail , and either to lower themselves down on the raft if it was under , or to give notice to the boats to receive them .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 44]: The raft had been dropped farther astern by the seamen , that those on board of it might not suffer from the smoke and heat ; and the sailors , one after another , lowered themselves down and were received by the boats .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 14]: Philip desired Captain Barentz to go before him , but the captain refused .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 30]: He was too much choked with smoke to say why , but no doubt but that it would have been something in praise of the _ Vrow Katerina _ .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 23]: Philip then climbed out ; he was followed by the captain , and they were both received into one of the boats .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 58]: The rope which had hitherto held the raft to the ship , was now cast off , and it was taken in by the boats ; and in a short time the _ Vrow Katerina _ was borne to leeward of them ; and Philip and Krantz now made arrangements for the better disposal of the people .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 38]: The sailors were almost all put into boats , that they might relieve one another in pulling ; the remainder were placed on the raft , along with the soldiers , the women , and the children .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 74]: Notwithstanding that the boats were all as much loaded as they could well bear , the numbers on the raft were so great that it sunk nearly a foot under water when the swell of the sea poured upon it ; but stanchions and ropes to support those on board had been fixed , and the men remained at the sides , while the women and children were crowded together in the middle .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 33]: As soon as these arrangements were made , the boats took the raft in tow , and just as the dawn of day appeared , pulled in the direction of the land .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 91]: The _ Vrow Katerina _ was , by this time , one volume of flame ; she had drifted about half a mile to leeward , and Captain Barentz , who was watching her as he sat in the boat with Philip , exclaimed -- `` Well , there goes a lovely ship , a ship that could do everything but speak -- I 'm sure that not a ship in the fleet would have made such a bonfire as she has -- does she not burn beautifully -- nobly ?
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 7]: My poor _ Vrow Katerina _ !
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 16]: perfect to the last , we never shall see such a ship as you again !
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 27]: Well , I 'm glad my father did not live to see this sight , for it would have broken his heart , poor man . ''
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 20]: Philip made no reply , he felt a respect even for Captain Barentz 's misplaced regard for the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 23]: They made but little way , for the swell was rather against them , and the raft was deep in the water .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 22]: The day dawned , and the appearance of the weather was not favourable ; it promised the return of the gale .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 21]: Already a breeze ruffled the surface of the water , and the swell appeared to increase rather than go down .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 9]: The sky was overcast and the horizon thick .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 32]: Philip looked out for the land but could not perceive it , for there was a haze on the horizon , so that he could not see more than five miles .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 49]: He felt that to gain the shore before the coming night was necessary for the preservation of so many individuals , of whom more than sixty were women and children , who , without any nourishment , were sitting on a frail raft , immersed in the water .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 22]: No land in sight -- a gale coming on , and in all probability , a heavy sea and dark night .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 40]: The chance was indeed desperate , and Philip was miserable -- most miserable -- when he reflected that so many innocent beings might , before the next morning , be consigned to a watery tomb , -- and why ?
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 44]: -- yes , there was the feeling -- that although Philip could reason against , he never could conquer ; for his own life he cared nothing -- even the idea of his beloved Amine was nothing in the balance at these moments .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 32]: The only point which sustained him , was the knowledge that he had his duty to perform , and , in the full exercise of his duty , he recovered himself .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 5]: `` Land ahead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 31]: was now cried out by Krantz , who was in the headmost boat , and the news was received with a shout of joy from the raft and the boats .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 57]: The anticipation and the hope the news gave was like manna in the wilderness ; and the poor women on the raft , drenched sometimes above the waist by the swell of the sea , clasped the children in their arms still closer , and cried -- `` My darling , you shall be saved . ''
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 34]: Philip stood upon the stern-sheets to survey the land , and he had the satisfaction of finding that it was not five miles distant , and a ray of hope warmed his heart .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 12]: The breeze now had gradually increased , and rippled the water .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 18]: The quarter from which the wind came was neither favourable nor adverse , being on the beam .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 26]: Had they had sails for the boats , it would have been otherwise , but they had been stowed away and could not be procured .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 60]: The sight of land naturally rejoiced them all , and the seamen in the boats cheered , and double-banked the oars to increase their way ; but the towing of a large raft sunk under water was no easy task ; and they did not , with all their exertions , advance more than half a mile an hour .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 70]: Until noon they continued their exertions , not without success ; they were not three miles from the land ; but , as the sun passed the meridian , a change took place ; the breeze blew strong ; the swell of the sea rose rapidly ; and the raft was often so deeply immersed in the waves as to alarm them for the safety of those upon her .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 23]: Their way was proportionally retarded , and by three o'clock they had not gained half-a-mile from where they had been at noon .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 26]: The men not having had refreshment of any kind during the labour and excitement of so many hours , began to flag in their exertions .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 27]: The wish for water was expressed by all -- from the child who appealed to its mother , to the seaman who strained at the oar .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 59]: Philip did all he could to encourage the men ; but finding themselves so near to the land , and so overcome with fatigue , and that the raft in tow would not allow them to approach their haven , they murmured , and talked of the necessity of casting loose the raft and looking out for themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 49]: A feeling of self prevailed , and they were mutinous : but Philip expostulated with them , and out of respect for him , they continued their exertions for another hour , when a circumstance occurred which decided the question , upon which they had recommenced a debate .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 35]: The increased swell and the fresh breeze had so beat about and tossed the raft , that it was with difficulty , for some time , that its occupants could hold themselves on it .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 46]: A loud shout , mingled with screams , attracted the attention of those in the boats , and Philip , looking back , perceived that the lashings of the raft had yielded to the force of the waves , and that it had separated amidships .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 42]: The scene was agonising ; husbands were separated from their wives and children -- each floating away from each other -- for the part of the raft which was still towed by the boats had already left the other far astern .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 46]: The women rose up and screamed , and held up their children ; some , more frantic , dashed into the water between them , and attempted to gain the floating wreck upon which their husbands stood , and sank before they could be assisted .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 50]: But the horror increased -- one lashing having given way , all the rest soon followed ; and , before the boats could turn and give assistance the sea was strewed with the spars which composed the raft , with men , women , and children clinging to them .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 30]: Loud were the yells of despair , and the shrieks of the women , as they embraced their offspring , and in attempting to save them were lost themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 29]: The spars of the raft still close together , were hurled one upon the other by the swell , and many found death by being jammed between them .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 43]: Although all the boats hastened to their assistance , there was so much difficulty and danger in forcing them between the spars , that but few were saved , and even those few were more than the boats could well take in .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 23]: The seamen and a few soldiers were picked up , but all the females and the children had sank beneath the waves .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 13]: The effect of this catastrophe may be imagined , but hardly described .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 21]: The seamen who had debated as to casting them adrift to perish , wept as they pulled towards the shore .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 26]: Philip was overcome , he covered his face , and remained , for some time , without giving directions , and heedless of what passed .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 26]: It was now five o'clock in the evening ; the boats had cast off the tow-lines , and vied with each other in their exertions .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 42]: Before the sun had set they all had arrived at the beach , and were safely landed in the little sand bay into which they had steered ; for the wind was off the shore , and there was no surf .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 46]: The boats were hauled up , and the exhausted men lay down on the sands , till warm with the heat of the sun , and forgetting that they had neither eaten nor drank for so long a time , they were soon fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 56]: Captain Barentz , Philip , and Krantz , as soon as they had seen the boats secured , held a short consultation , and were then glad to follow the example of the seamen ; harassed and worn out with the fatigue of the last twenty-four hours , their senses were soon drowned in oblivion .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 61]: For many hours they all slept soundly , dreamt of water , and awoke to the sad reality that they were tormented with thirst , and were on a sandy beach with the salt waves mocking them ; but they reflected how many of their late companions had been swallowed up , and felt thankful that they had been spared .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 46]: It was early dawn when they all rose from the forms which they had impressed on the yielding sand ; and , by the directions of Philip , they separated in every direction , to look for the means of quenching their agony of thirst .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 44]: As they proceeded over the sand-hills , they found growing in the sand a low spongy-leaf sort of shrub , something like what in our greenhouses is termed the ice-plant ; the thick leaves of which were covered with large drops of dew .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 29]: They sank down on their knees , and proceeded from one to the other licking off the moisture which was abundant , and soon felt a temporary relief .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 34]: They continued their search till noon without success , and hunger was now added to their thirst ; they then returned to the beach to ascertain if their companions had been more successful .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 60]: They had also quenched their thirst with the dew of heaven , but had found no water or means of subsistence ; but some of them had eaten the leaves of the plant which had contained the dew in the morning , and had found them , although acid , full of watery sap and grateful to the palate .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 40]: The plant in question is the one provided by bounteous Providence for the support of the camel and other beasts in the arid desert , only to be found there , and devoured by all ruminating animals with avidity .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 23]: By the advice of Philip they collected a quantity of this plant and put it into the boats , and then launched .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 25]: They were not more than fifty miles from Table Bay , and although they had no sails , the wind was in their favour .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 32]: Philip pointed out to them how useless it was to remain , when before morning they would , in all probability , arrive at where they would obtain all they required .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 19]: The advice was approved of and acted upon ; the boats were shoved off and the oars resumed .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 54]: So tired and exhausted were the men , that their oars dipped mechanically into the water , for there was no strength left to be applied ; it was not until the next morning at daylight , that they had arrived opposite False Bay , and they had still many miles to pull .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 18]: The wind in their favour had done almost all -- the men could do little or nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 55]: Encouraged , however , by the sight of land which they knew , they rallied ; and at about noon they pulled exhausted to the beach at the bottom of Table Bay , near to which were the houses , and the fort protecting the settlers who had for some few years resided there .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 26]: They landed close to where a broad rivulet at that season -LRB- but a torrent in the winter -RRB- poured its stream into the Bay .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 60]: At the sight of fresh water , some of the men dropped their oars , threw themselves into the sea when out of their depth -- others when the water was above their waists -- yet they did not arrive so soon as those who waited till the boat struck the beach , and jumped out upon dry land .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 51]: And then they threw themselves into the rivulet , which coursed over the shingle , about five or six inches in depth , allowing the refreshing stream to pour into their mouths till they could receive no more , immersing their hot hands , and rolling in it with delight .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 17]: Despots and fanatics have exerted their ingenuity to invent torments for their victims -- how useless !
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 27]: -- the rack , the boot , fire , -- all that they have imagined are not to be compared to the torture of extreme thirst .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 50]: In the extremity of agony the sufferers cry for water and it is not refused : they might have spared themselves their refined ingenuity of torment and the disgusting exhibition of it , had they only confined the prisoner in his cell , and refused him _ water _ .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 66]: As soon as they had satisfied the most pressing of all wants , they rose dripping from the stream , and walked up to the houses of the factory ; the inhabitants of which , perceiving that boats had landed , when there was no vessel in the Bay , naturally concluded that some disaster had happened , and were walking down to meet them .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 8]: -- Their tragical history was soon told .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 30]: The thirty-six men that stood before them were all that were left of nearly three hundred souls embarked , and they had been more than two days without food .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 37]: At this intimation no further questions were asked by the considerate settlers , until the hunger of the sufferers had been appeased , when the narrative of their sufferings was fully detailed by Philip and Krantz .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 31]: `` I have an idea that I have seen you before , '' observed one of the settlers ; `` did you come on shore when the fleet anchored ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 17]: `` I did not , '' replied Philip ; `` but I have been here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 32]: `` I recollect , now , '' replied the man ; `` you were the only survivor of the _ Ter Schilling _ , which was lost in False Bay . ''
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 46]: `` Not the only survivor , '' replied Philip ; `` I thought so myself , but I afterwards met the pilot , a one-eyed man , of the name of Schriften , who was my shipmate -- he must have arrived here after me .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 8]: You saw him , of course ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 46]: `` No , I did not ; no one belonging to the _ Ter Schilling _ ever came here after you , for I have been a settler here ever since , and it is not likely that I should forget such a circumstance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 16]: `` He must , then , have returned to Holland by some other means . ''
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 6]: `` I know not how .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 20]: -- Our ships never go near the coast after they leave the Bay ; it is too dangerous . ''
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 13]: `` Nevertheless , I saw him , '' replied Philip , musing .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 45]: `` If you saw him , that is sufficient : perhaps some vessel had been blown down to the eastern side , and picked him up ; but the natives in that part are not likely to have spared the life of a European .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 8]: The Caffres are a cruel people . ''
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 20]: The information that Schriften had not been seen at the Cape , was a subject of meditation to Philip .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 32]: He had always an idea , as the reader knows , that there was something supernatural about the man , and this opinion was corroborated by the report of the settler .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 77]: We must pass over the space of two months , during which the wrecked seamen were treated with kindness by the settlers , and , at the expiration of which , a small brig arrived at the Bay , and took in refreshments : she was homeward bound , with a full cargo , and being chartered by the Company , could not refuse to receive on board the crew of the _ Vrow Katerina _ .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 20]: Philip , Krantz , and the seamen embarked , but Captain Barentz remained behind to settle at the Cape .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 28]: `` Should I go home , '' said he to Philip , who argued with him , `` I have nothing in this world to return for .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 61]: I have no wife -- no children -- I had but one dear object , my _ Vrow Katerina _ , who was my wife , my child , my everything -- she is gone , and I never shall find another vessel like her ; and if I could , I should not love it as I did her .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 16]: No , my affections are buried with her ; are entombed in the deep sea .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 5]: How beautifully she burnt !
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 14]: she went out of the world like a phoenix , as she was .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 2]: no !
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 39]: I will be faithful to her -- I will send for what little money I have , and live as near to her tomb as I can -- I never shall forget her as long as I live .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 25]: I shall mourn over her , and ` Vrow Katerina , ' when I die , will be found engraven on my heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 59]: Philip could not help wishing that his affections had been fixed upon a more deserving object , as then , probably , the tragical loss had not taken place ; but he changed the subject , feeling that , being no sailor , Captain Barentz was much better on shore , than in the command of a vessel .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 45]: They shook hands and parted -- Philip promising to execute Barentz 's commission , which was to turn his money into articles most useful to a settler , and have them sent out by the first fleet which should sail from the Zuyder Zee .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 13]: But this commission it was not Philip 's good fortune to execute .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 18]: The brig , named the _ Wilhelmina _ , sailed , and soon arrived at St Helena .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 8]: After watering she proceeded on her voyage .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 114]: They had made the Western Isles , and Philip was consoling himself with the anticipation of soon joining his Amine , when to the northward of the Islands , they met with a furious gale , before which they were obliged to scud for many days , with the vessel 's head to the south-east ; and as the wind abated and they were able to haul to it , they fell in with a Dutch fleet , of five vessels , commanded by an Admiral , which had left Amsterdam more than two months , and had been buffeted about , by contrary gales , for the major part of that period .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 27]: Cold , fatigue , and bad provisions had brought on the scurvy , and the ships were so weakly manned that they could hardly navigate them .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 127]: When the captain of the _ Wilhelmina _ reported to the Admiral that he had part of the crew of the _ Vrow Katerina _ on board , he was ordered to send them immediately to assist in navigating his crippled fleet -- remonstrance was useless -- Philip had but time to write to Amine , acquainting her with his misfortunes and disappointment ; and , confiding the letter to his wife , as well as his narrative of the loss of the _ Vrow Katerina _ for the directors , to the charge of the captain of the _ Wilhelmina _ , he hastened to pack up his effects , and repaired on board of the Admiral 's ship , with Krantz and the crew .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 41]: To them were added six of the men belonging to the _ Wilhelmina _ , which the Admiral insisted on retaining ; and the brig , having received the Admiral 's despatches , was then permitted to continue her voyage .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 43]: Perhaps there is nothing more trying to the seaman 's feelings , than being unexpectedly forced to recommence another series of trials , at the very time when they anticipate repose from the former ; yet , how often does this happen !
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 4]: Philip was melancholy .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 25]: `` It is my destiny , '' thought he , using the words of Amine , `` and why should I not submit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 16]: Krantz was furious , and the seamen discontented and mutinous -- but it was useless .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 22]: Might is right on the vast ocean , where there is no appeal -- no trial or injunction to be obtained .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 18]: But hard as their case appeared to them , the Admiral was fully justified in his proceeding .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 37]: His ships were almost unmanageable with the few hands who could still perform their duty ; and this small increase of physical power might be the means of saving hundreds who lay helpless in their hammocks .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 46]: In his own vessel , the _ Lion _ , which was manned with two hundred and fifty men , when she sailed from Amsterdam , there were not more than seventy capable of doing duty ; and the other ships had suffered in proportion .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 47]: The first captain of the _ Lion _ was dead , the second captain in his hammock , and the Admiral had no one to assist him but the mates of the vessel , some of whom crawled up to their duty more dead than alive .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 21]: The ship of the second in command , the _ Dort _ , was even in a more deplorable plight .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 27]: The Commodore was dead ; the first captain was still doing his duty ; but he had but one more officer capable of remaining on deck .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 89]: The Admiral sent for Philip into his cabin , and having heard his narrative of the loss of the _ Vrow Katerina _ , he ordered him to go on board of the Commodore 's ship as captain , giving the rank of Commodore to the captain at present on board of her ; Krantz was retained on board his own vessel , as second captain ; for , by Philip 's narrative , the Admiral perceived at once that they were both good officers and brave men .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 56]: Chapter XVIII The fleet under Admiral Rymelandt 's command was ordered to proceed to the East Indies by the western route , through the Straits of Magellan into the Pacific Ocean -- it being still imagined , notwithstanding previous failures , that this route offered facilities which might shorten the passage of the Spice Islands .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 69]: The vessels composing the fleet were the _ Lion _ of forty-four guns , bearing the Admiral 's flag ; the _ Dort _ of thirty-six guns , with the Commodore 's pendant -- to which Philip was appointed ; the _ Zuyder Zee _ of twenty ; the _ Young Frau _ of twelve , and a ketch of four guns , called the _ Schevelling _ .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 29]: The crew of the _ Vrow Katerina _ were divided between the two larger vessels ; the others , being smaller , were easier worked with fewer hands .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 18]: Every arrangement having been made , the boats were hoisted up , and the ships made sail .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 25]: For ten days they were baffled by light winds , and the victims to the scurvy increased considerably on board of Philip 's vessel .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 16]: Many died and were thrown overboard , and others were carried down to their hammocks .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 66]: The newly-appointed Commodore , whose name was Avenhorn , went on board of the Admiral , to report the state of the vessel , and to suggest , as Philip had proposed to him , that they should make the coast of South America , and endeavour , by bribery or by force , to obtain supplies either from the Spanish inhabitants or the natives .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 9]: But to this the Admiral would not listen .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 28]: He was an imperious , bold , and obstinate man , not to be persuaded or convinced , and with little feeling for the sufferings of others .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 48]: Tenacious of being advised , he immediately rejected a proposition which , had it originated with himself , would probably have been immediately acted upon ; and the Commodore returned on board his vessel , not only disappointed , but irritated by the language used towards him .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 10]: `` What are we to do , Captain Vanderdecken ?
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 44]: you know too well our situation -- it is impossible we can continue long at sea ; if we do , the vessel will be drifting at the mercy of the waves , while the crew die a wretched death in their hammocks .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 36]: At present , we have forty men left ; in ten days more we shall probably have but twenty ; for as the labour becomes more severe , so do they drop down the faster .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 22]: Is it not better to risk our lives in combat with the Spaniards , than die here like rotten sheep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 21]: `` I perfectly agree with you , Commodore , '' replied Philip ; `` but still we must obey orders .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 8]: The Admiral is an inflexible man . ''
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 6]: `` And a cruel one .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 31]: I have a great mind to part company in the night , and , if he finds fault , I will justify myself to the directors on my return . ''
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 32]: `` Do nothing rashly -- perhaps , when day by day he finds his own ship 's company more weakened , he will see the necessity of following your advice . ''
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 17]: A week had passed away after this conversation , and the fleet had made little progress .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 32]: In each ship the ravages of the fatal disease became more serious , and , as the Commodore had predicted , he had but twenty men really able to do duty .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 13]: Nor had the Admiral 's ship and the other vessels suffered less .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 11]: The Commodore again went on board to reiterate his proposition .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 13]: Admiral Rymelandt was not only a stern , but a vindictive man .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 69]: He was aware of the propriety of the suggestion made by his second in command , but , having refused it , he would not acquiesce ; and he felt revengeful against the Commodore , whose counsel he must now either adopt , or by refusing it be prevented from taking the steps so necessary for the preservation of his crew , and the success of his voyage .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 24]: Too proud to acknowledge himself in error , again did he decidedly refuse , and the Commodore went back to his own ship .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 55]: The fleet was then within three days of the coast , steering to the southward for the Straits of Magellan , and that night , after Philip had retired to his cot , the Commodore went on deck and ordered the course of the vessel to be altered some points more to the westward .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 44]: The night was very dark , and the _ Lion _ was the only ship which carried a poop-lantern , so that the parting company of the _ Dort _ was not perceived by the Admiral and the other ships of the fleet .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 18]: When Philip went on deck next morning , he found that their consorts were not in sight .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 24]: He looked at the compass , and , perceiving that the course was altered , inquired at what hour and by whose directions .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 15]: Finding that it was by his superior officer , he of course said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 37]: When the Commodore came on deck , he stated to Philip that he felt himself warranted in not complying with the Admiral 's orders , as it would have been sacrificing the whole ship 's company .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 7]: This was , indeed , true .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 25]: In two days they made the land , and , running into the shore , perceived a large town and Spaniards on the beach .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 31]: They anchored at the mouth of the river , and hoisted English colours , when a boat came on board to ask them who they were and what they required ?
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 49]: The Commodore replied that the vessel was English , for he knew that the hatred of the Spanish to the Dutch was so great that , if known to belong to that nation , he would have had no chance of procuring any supplies , except by force .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 80]: He stated that he had fallen in with a Spanish vessel , a complete wreck , from the whole of the crew being afflicted with the scurvy ; that he had taken the men out , who were now in their hammocks below , as he considered it cruel to leave so many of his fellow-creatures to perish , and that he had come out of his course to land them at the first Spanish fort he could reach .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 65]: He requested that they would immediately send on board vegetables and fresh provisions for the sick men , whom it would be death to remove , until after a few days , when they would be a little restored ; and added , that in return for their assisting the Spaniards , he trusted the Governor would also send supplies for his own people .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 17]: This well made-up story was confirmed by the officer sent on board by the Spanish Governor .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 74]: Being requested to go down below and see the patients , the sight of so many poor fellows in the last stage of that horrid disease -- their teeth fallen out , gums ulcerated , bodies full of tumours and sores -- was quite sufficient , and , hurrying up from the lower deck , as he would have done from a charnel-house , the officer hastened on shore and made his report .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 35]: In two hours a large boat was sent off with fresh beef and vegetables sufficient for three days ' supply for the ship 's company , and these were immediately distributed among the men .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 112]: A letter of thanks was returned by the Commodore , stating that his health was so indifferent as to prevent his coming on shore in person to thank the Governor , and forwarding a pretended list of the Spaniards on board , in which he mentioned some officers and people of distinction , whom he imagined might be connected with the family of the Governor , whose name and titles he had received from the messenger sent on board ; for the Dutch knew full well the majority of the noble Spanish families -- indeed , alliances had continually taken place between them , previous to their assertion of their independence .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 47]: The Commodore concluded his letter by expressing a hope that , in a day or two , he should be able to pay his respects and make arrangements for the landing of the sick , as he was anxious to proceed on his voyage of discovery .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 83]: On the third day , a fresh supply of provisions was sent on board , and , so soon as they were received , the Commodore , in an English uniform , went on shore and called upon the Governor , gave a long detail of the sufferings of the people he had rescued , and agreed that they should be sent on shore in two days , and they would , by that time , be well enough to be moved .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 32]: After many compliments , he went on board , the Governor having stated his intention to return his visit on the following day , if the weather were not too rough .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 26]: Fortunately , the weather was rough for the next two days , and it was not until the third that the Governor made his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 8]: This was precisely what the Commodore wished .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 40]: There is no disease , perhaps , so dreadful or so rapid in its effects upon the human frame , and at the same time so instantaneously checked , as the scurvy , if the remedy can be procured .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 24]: A few days were sufficient to restore those , who were not able to turn in their hammocks , to their former vigour .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 32]: In the course of the six days nearly all the crew of the _ Dort _ were convalescent and able to go on deck ; but still they were not cured .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 44]: The Commodore waited for the arrival of the Governor , received him with all due honours , and then , so soon as he was in the cabin , told him very politely that he and all his officers with him were prisoners .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 28]: That the vessel was a Dutch man-of-war , and that it was his own people , and not Spaniards , who had been dying of the scurvy .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 89]: He consoled him , however , by pointing out that he had thought it preferable to obtain provisions by this _ ruse _ , than to sacrifice lives on both sides by taking them by force , and that his Excellency 's captivity would endure no longer than until he had received on board a sufficient number of live bullocks and fresh vegetables to insure the recovery of the ship 's company ; and , in the meantime , not the least insult would be offered to him .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 46]: Whereupon the Spanish Governor first looked at the Commodore and then at the file of armed men at the cabin door , and then to his distance from the town ; and then called to mind the possibility of his being taken out to sea .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 46]: Weighing all these points in his mind , and the very moderate ransom demanded -LRB- for bullocks were not worth a dollar apiece in that country -RRB- , he resolved , as he could not help himself , to comply with the Commodore 's terms .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 21]: He called for pen and ink , and wrote an order to send on board immediately all that was demanded .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 55]: Before sunset the bullocks and vegetables were brought off , and , so soon as they were alongside , the Commodore , with many bows and many thanks , escorted the Governor to the gangway , complimenting him with a salvo of great guns , as he had done before , on his arrival .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 49]: The people on shore thought that his Excellency had paid a long visit , but , as he did not like to acknowledge that he had been deceived , nothing was said about it at least , in his hearing , although the facts were soon well known .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 51]: As soon as the boats were cleared , the Commodore weighed anchor and made sail , well satisfied with having preserved his ship 's company ; and , as the Falkland Islands , in case of parting company , had been named as the rendezvous , he steered for them .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 16]: In a fortnight he arrived , and found that his Admiral was not yet there .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 30]: His crew were now all recovered , and his fresh beef was not yet expended , when he perceived the Admiral and the three other vessels in the offing .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 36]: It appeared that so soon as the _ Dort _ had parted company , the Admiral had immediately acted upon the advice that the Commodore had given him , and had run for the coast .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 49]: Not being so fortunate in a _ ruse _ as his second in command , he had landed an armed force from the four vessels , and had succeeded in obtaining several head of cattle , at the expense of an equal number of men killed and wounded .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 39]: But at the same time they had collected a large quantity of vegetables of one sort or another , which they had carried on board and distributed with great success to the sick , who were gradually recovering .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 32]: Immediately that the Admiral had anchored , he made the signal for the Commodore to repair on board , and taxed him with disobedience of orders in having left the fleet .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 72]: The Commodore did not deny that he had so done , but excused himself upon the plea of necessity , offering to lay the whole matter before the Court of Directors so soon as they returned ; but the Admiral was vested with most extensive powers , not only of the trial , but the _ condemnation _ and punishment of any person guilty of mutiny and insubordination in his fleet .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 28]: In reply , he told the Commodore that he was a prisoner , and , to prove it , he confined him in irons under the half-deck .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 24]: A signal was then made for all the captains : they went on board , and of course Philip was of the number .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 24]: On their arrival the Admiral held a summary court-martial , proving to them by his instructions that he was so warranted to do .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 29]: The result of the court-martial could be but one , -- condemnation for a breach of discipline , to which Philip was obliged reluctantly to sign his name .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 55]: The Admiral then gave Philip the appointment of second in command , and the Commodore 's pendant , much to the annoyance of the captains commanding the other vessels , -- but in this the Admiral proved his judgment , as there was no one of them so fit for the task as Philip .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 8]: Having so done , he dismissed them .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 37]: Philip would have spoken to the late Commodore , but the sentry opposed it , as against his orders ; and with a friendly nod , Philip was obliged to leave him without the desired communication .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 17]: The fleet remained three weeks at the Falkland Islands , to recruit the ships ' companies .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 15]: Although there was no fresh beef , there was plenty of scurvy-grass and penguins .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 34]: These birds were in myriads on some parts of the island , which , from the propinquity of their nests , built of mud , went by the name of _ towns _ .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 27]: There they sat , close together -LRB- the whole area which they covered being bare of grass -RRB- , hatching their eggs and rearing their young .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 38]: The men had but to select as many eggs and birds as they pleased , and so numerous were they , that , when they had supplied themselves , there was no apparent diminution of the numbers .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 43]: This food , although in a short time not very palatable to the seamen , had the effect of restoring them to health , and , before the fleet sailed , there was not a man who was afflicted with the scurvy .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 19]: In the meantime the Commodore remained in irons , and many were the conjectures concerning his ultimate fate .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 35]: The power of life and death was known to be in the Admiral 's hands , but no one thought that such power would be exerted upon a delinquent of so high a grade .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 19]: The other captains kept aloof from Philip , and he knew little of what was the general idea .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 72]: Occasionally when on board of the Admiral 's ship , he ventured to bring up the question , but was immediately silenced ; and feeling that he might injure the late Commodore -LRB- for whom he had a regard -RRB- , he would risk nothing by importunity ; and the fleet sailed for the Straits of Magellan , without anybody being aware of what might be the result of the court-martial .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 19]: It was about a fortnight after they had left the Falkland Islands , that they entered the Straits .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 42]: At first they had a leading wind which carried them half through , but this did not last , and they then had to contend not only against the wind , but against the current , and they daily lost ground .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 14]: The crews of the ships also began to sicken from fatigue and cold .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 106]: Whether the Admiral had before made up his mind , or whether , irritated by his fruitless endeavours to continue his voyage , it is impossible to say ; but , after three weeks ' useless struggle against the wind and currents , he hove-to and ordered all the captains on board , when he proposed that the prisoner should receive his punishment -- and that punishment was -- _ to be deserted _ -- that is , to be sent on shore with a day 's food , where there was no means of obtaining support , so as to die miserably of hunger .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 51]: This was a punishment frequently resorted to by the Dutch at that period , as will be seen by reading an account of their voyages : but , at the same time , seldom , if ever , awarded to one of so high a rank as that of Commodore .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 60]: Philip immediately protested against it , and so did Krantz , although they were both aware , that by so doing they would make the Admiral their enemy ; but the other captains , who viewed both of them with a jealous eye , and considered them as interlopers and interfering with their advancement , sided with the Admiral .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 12]: Notwithstanding this majority , Philip thought it his duty to expostulate .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 37]: `` You know well , Admiral , '' said he , `` that I joined in his condemnation for a breach of discipline : but , at the same time , there was much in extenuation .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 36]: He committed a breach of discipline to save his ship 's company , but not an error in judgment , as you yourself proved , by taking the same measure to save your own men .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 17]: Do not , therefore , visit an offence of so doubtful a nature with such cruelty .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 24]: Let the Company decide the point when you send him home , which you can do so soon as you arrive in India .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 28]: He is sufficiently punished by losing his command : to do what you propose will be ascribed to feelings of revenge more than to those of justice .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 40]: What success can we deserve if we commit an act of such cruelty ; and how can we expect a merciful Providence to protect us from the winds and waves when we are thus barbarous towards each other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 8]: Philip 's arguments were of no avail .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 30]: The Admiral ordered him to return on board his ship , and had he been able to find an excuse , he would have deprived him of his command .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 20]: This he could not well do ; but Philip was aware that the Admiral was now his inveterate enemy .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 22]: The Commodore was taken out of irons and brought into the cabin , and his sentence was made known to him .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 29]: `` Be it so , Admiral , '' replied Avenhorn ; `` for , to attempt to turn you from your purpose , I know would be unavailing .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 36]: I am not punished for disobedience of orders , but for having , by my disobedience , pointed out to you your duty -- a duty which you were forced to perform afterwards by necessity .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 32]: Then be it so ; let me perish on these black rocks , as I shall , and my bones be whitened by the chilly blasts which howl over their desolation .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 9]: But mark me , cruel and vindictive man !
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 13]: I shall not be the only one whose bones will bleach there .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 38]: I prophesy that many others will share my fate , and even you , Admiral , _ may _ be of the number , -- if I mistake not , we shall lie side by side . ''
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 17]: The Admiral made no reply , but gave a sign for the prisoner to be removed .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 83]: He then had a conference with the captains of the three smaller vessels ; and , as they had been all along retarded by the heavier sailing of his own ship and the _ Dort _ commanded by Philip , he decided that they should part company , and proceed on as fast as they could to the Indies -- sending on board of the two larger vessels all the provisions they could spare , as they already began to run short .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 14]: Philip had left the cabin with Krantz after the prisoner had been removed .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 58]: He then wrote a few lines upon a slip of paper -- `` Do not leave the beach when you are put on shore , until the vessels are out of sight ; '' and , requesting Krantz to find an opportunity to deliver this to the Commodore , he returned on board of his own ship .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 26]: When the crew of the _ Dort _ heard of the punishment about to be inflicted upon their old Commander , they were much excited .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 22]: They felt that he had sacrificed himself to save them , and they murmured much at the cruelty of the Admiral .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 35]: About an hour after Philip 's return to his ship , the prisoner was sent on shore and landed on the desolate and rocky coast , with a supply of provisions for two days .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 19]: Not a single article of extra clothing , or the means of striking a light was permitted him .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 14]: When the boat 's keel grazed the beach , he was ordered out .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 17]: The boat shoved off , and the men were not permitted even to bid him farewell .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 26]: The fleet , as Philip expected , remained hove-to , shifting the provisions , and it was not till after dark that everything was arranged .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 6]: This opportunity was not lost .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 55]: Philip was aware that it would be considered a breach of discipline , but to that he was indifferent ; neither did he think it likely that it would come to the ears of the Admiral , as the crew of the _ Dort _ were partial both to the Commodore and to him .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 82]: He had desired a seaman whom he could trust , to put into one of the boats a couple of muskets and a quantity of ammunition , several blankets , and various other articles , besides provisions for two or three months for one person , and , as soon as it was dark , the men pulled on shore with the boat , found the Commodore on the beach waiting for them , and supplied him with all these necessaries .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 37]: They then rejoined their ship , without the Admiral 's having the least suspicion of what had been done , and shortly after the fleet made sail on a wind , with their heads off shore .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 29]: The next morning , the three smaller vessels parted company , and by sunset had gained many miles to windward , after which they were not again seen .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 38]: The Admiral had sent for Philip to give him his instructions , which were very severe , and evidently framed so as to be able to afford him hereafter some excuse for depriving him of his command .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 62]: Among others , his orders were , as the _ Dort _ drew much less water than the Admiral 's ship , to sail ahead of him during the night , that , if they approached too near the land as they beat across the Channel , timely notice might be given to the Admiral , if in too shallow water .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 24]: This responsibility was the occasion of Philip 's being always on deck when they approached the land of either side of the Straits .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 62]: It was the second night after the fleet had separated that Philip had been summoned on deck as they were nearing the land of Terra del Fuego ; he was watching the man in the chains heaving the lead , when the officer of the watch reported to him that the Admiral 's ship was ahead of them instead of astern .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 40]: Philip made enquiry as to when he passed , but could not discover ; he went forward , and saw the Admiral 's ship with her poop-light , which , when the Admiral was astern , was not visible .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 12]: `` What can be the Admiral 's reason for this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 21]: thought Philip ; `` has he run ahead on purpose to make a charge against me of neglect of duty ?
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 5]: it must be so .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 58]: Well , let him do as he pleases ; he must wait now till we arrive in India , for I shall not allow him to _ desert _ me ; and , with the Company , I have as much , and I rather think , as a large proprietor , more interest than he has .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 19]: Well , as he has thought proper to go ahead , I have nothing to do but follow .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 12]: ` You may come out of the chains there . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 30]: Philip went forward : they were now , as he imagined , very near to the land , but the night was dark and they could not distinguish it .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 34]: For half an hour they continued their course , much to Philip 's surprise , for he now thought he could make out the loom of the land , dark as it was .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 35]: His eyes were constantly fixed upon the ship ahead , expecting every minute that she would go about ; but no , she continued her course , and Philip followed with his own vessel .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 27]: `` We are very close to the land , sir , '' observed Vander Hagen , the lieutenant , who was the officer of the watch .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 26]: `` So it appears to me : but the Admiral is closer , and draws much more water than we do , '' replied Philip .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 16]: `` I think I see the rocks on the beam to leeward , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 18]: `` I believe you are right , '' replied Philip : `` I can not understand this .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 24]: Ready about , and get a gun ready -- they must suppose us to be ahead of them , depend upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 16]: Hardly had Philip given the order , when the vessel struck heavily on the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 20]: Philip hastened aft ; he found that the rudder had been unshipped , and the vessel was immovably fixed .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 8]: His thoughts then reverted to the Admiral .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 7]: `` Was he on shore ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 25]: He ran forward , and the Admiral was still sailing on , with his poop-light , about two cables ' length ahead of him .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 15]: `` Fire the gun , there , '' cried Philip , perplexed beyond measure .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 22]: The gun was fired , and immediately followed up by the flash and report of another gun close astern of them .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 28]: Philip looked with astonishment over the quarter and perceived the Admiral 's ship close astern to him , and evidently on shore as well as his own .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 5]: `` Merciful Heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 13]: exclaimed Philip , rushing forward , `` what can this be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 17]: He beheld the other vessel with her light ahead , still sailing on and leaving them .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 17]: The day was now dawning , and there was sufficient light to make out the land .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 35]: The _ Dort _ was on shore not fifty yards from the beach , and surrounded by the high and barren rocks ; yet the vessel ahead was apparently sailing on over the land .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 19]: The seamen crowded on the forecastle watching this strange phenomenon ; at last it vanished from their sight .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 16]: `` That 's the _ Flying Dutchman _ , by all that 's holy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 11]: cried one of the seamen , jumping off the gun .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 12]: Hardly had the man uttered these words when the vessel disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 19]: Philip felt convinced that it was so , and he walked away aft in a very perturbed state .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 17]: It must have been his father 's fatal ship which had decoyed them to probable destruction .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 7]: He hardly knew how to act .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 17]: The Admiral 's wrath he did not wish , just at that moment , to encounter .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 53]: He sent for the officer of the watch , and , having desired him to select a crew for the boat , out of those men who had been on deck , and could substantiate his assertions , ordered him to go on board of the Admiral and state what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 21]: As soon as the boat had shoved off , Philip turned his attention to the state of his own vessel .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 33]: The daylight had increased , and Philip perceived that they were surrounded by rocks , and had run on shore between two reefs , which extended half a mile from the mainland .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 33]: He sounded round his vessel , and discovered that she was fixed from forward to aft , and that , without lightening her , there was no chance of getting her off .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 53]: He then turned to where the Admiral 's ship lay aground , and found that , to all appearance , she was in even a worse plight , as the rocks to leeward of her were above the water , and she was much more exposed , should bad weather come on .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 80]: Never , perhaps , was there a scene more cheerless and appalling : a dark wintry sky -- a sky loaded with heavy clouds -- the wind cold and piercing -- the whole line of the coast one mass of barren rocks , without the slightest appearance of vegetation ; the inland part of the country presented an equally sombre appearance , and the higher points were capped with snow , although it was not yet the winter season .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 37]: Sweeping the coast with his eye , Philip perceived , not four miles to leeward of them -LRB- so little progress had they made -RRB- , the spot where they had _ deserted _ the Commodore .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 39]: `` Surely this has been a judgment on him for his cruelty , '' thought Philip , `` and the prophecy of poor Avenhorn will come true -- more bones than his will bleach on those rocks . ''
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 53]: Philip turned round again to where the Admiral 's ship was on shore , and started back , as he beheld a sight even more dreadful than all that he had viewed -- the body of Vander Hagen , the officer sent on board of the Admiral , hanging at the main-yard-arm .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 4]: `` My God !
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 5]: is it possible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 9]: exclaimed Philip , stamping with sorrow and indignation .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 14]: His boat was returning on board , and Philip awaited it with impatience .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 75]: The men hastened up the side , and breathlessly informed Philip that the Admiral , as soon as he had heard the Lieutenant 's report , and his acknowledgment that he was officer of the watch , had ordered him to be hung , and that he had sent them back with a summons for him to repair on board immediately , and that they had seen another rope preparing at the other yard-arm .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 36]: `` But not for you , sir , '' cried the men ; `` that shall never be -- you shall not go on board -- and we will defend you with our lives . ''
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 19]: The whole ship 's company joined in this resolution , and expressed their determination to resist the Admiral .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 33]: Philip thanked them kindly -- stated his intention of not going on board , and requested that they would remain quiet , until it was ascertained what steps the Admiral might take .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 17]: He then went down to his cabin , to reflect upon what plan he should pursue .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 62]: As he looked out of the stern-windows , and perceived the body of the young man still swinging in the wind , he almost wished that he was in his place , for then there would be an end to his wayward fate : but he thought of Amine , and felt that , for her , he wished to live .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 31]: That the Phantom Ship should have decoyed him to destruction was also a source of much painful feeling , and Philip meditated , with his hands pressed to his temples .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 37]: `` It is my destiny , '' thought he at last , `` and the will of Heaven must be done : we could not have been so deceived if Heaven had not permitted it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 10]: And then his thoughts reverted to his present situation .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 62]: That the Admiral had exceeded his powers in taking the life of the officer was undeniable , as , although his instructions gave him power of life and death , still it was only to be decided by the sentence of the court-martial held by the captains commanding the vessels of the fleet ; he therefore felt himself justified in resistance .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 42]: But Philip was troubled with the idea that such resistance might lead to much bloodshed ; and he was still debating how to act , when they reported to him that there was a boat coming from the Admiral 's ship .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 42]: Philip went upon deck to receive the officer , who stated that it was the Admiral 's order that he should immediately come on board , and that he must consider himself now under arrest , and deliver up his sword .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 3]: no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 11]: exclaimed the ship 's company of the _ Dort _ .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 7]: He shall not go on board .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 11]: We will stand by our Captain to the last . ''
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 5]: `` Silence , men !
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 3]: silence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 3]: cried Philip .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 97]: `` You must be aware , sir , '' said he to the officer , `` that in the cruel punishment of that innocent young man , the Admiral has exceeded his powers : and , much as I regret to see any symptoms of mutiny and insubordination , it must be remembered that , if those in command disobey the orders they have received , by exceeding them , they not only set the example , but give an excuse for those who otherwise would be bound to obey them , to do the same .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 46]: Tell the Admiral that his murder of that innocent man has determined me no longer to consider myself under his authority , and that I will hold myself , as well as him , answerable to the Company whom we serve , for our conduct .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 26]: I do not intend to go on board and put myself in his power , that he might gratify his resentment by my ignominious death .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 66]: It is a duty that I owe these men under my command to preserve my life , that I may , if possible , preserve theirs in this strait ; and you may also add , that a little reflection must point out to him that this is no time for us to war with , but to assist each other with all our energies .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 28]: We are here , ship-wrecked on a barren coast , with provisions insufficient for any lengthened stay , no prospect of succour , and little of escape .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 28]: As the Commodore truly prophesied , many more are likely to perish as well as him -- and even the Admiral himself may be of the number .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 73]: I shall wait his answer ; if he choose to lay aside all animosity , and refer our conduct to a higher tribunal , I am willing to join with him in rendering that assistance to each other which our situation requires -- if not , you must perceive , and of course will tell him , that I have those with me who will defend me against any attempt at force .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 14]: You have my answer , sir , and may go on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 63]: The officer went to the gangway , but found that none of his crew , except the bowman , were in the boat ; they had gone up to gain from the men of the _ Dort _ the true history of what they had but imperfectly heard : and , before they were summoned to return , had received full intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 47]: They coincided with the seamen of the _ Dort _ , that the appearance of the Phantom Ship , which had occasioned their present disaster , was a judgment upon the Admiral , for his conduct in having so cruelly _ deserted _ the poor Commodore .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 21]: Upon the return of the officer with Philip 's answer , the rage of the Admiral was beyond all bounds .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 82]: He ordered the guns aft , which would bear upon the _ Dort _ , to be double-shotted , and fired into her ; but Krantz pointed out to him that they could not bring more guns to bear upon the _ Dort _ , in their present situation , than the _ Dort _ could bring to bear upon them ; that their superior force was thus neutralised , and that no advantage could result from taking such a step .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 18]: The Admiral immediately put Krantz under arrest , and proceeded to put into execution his insane intentions .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 34]: In this he was , however , prevented by the seamen of the _ Lion _ , who neither wished to fire upon their consort , nor to be fired at in return .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 45]: The report of the boat 's crew had been circulated through the ship , and the men felt too much ill-will against the Admiral , and perceived at the same time the extreme difficulty of their situation , to wish to make it worse .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 71]: They did not proceed to open mutiny , but they went down below , and when the officers ordered them up , they refused to go upon deck ; and the officers , who were equally disgusted with the Admiral 's conduct , merely informed him of the state of the ship 's company , without naming individuals , so as to excite his resentment against any one in particular .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 12]: Such was the state of affairs when the sun went down .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 31]: Nothing had been done on board the Admiral 's ship , for Krantz was under arrest , and the Admiral had retired in a state of fury to his cabin .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 53]: In the meantime Philip and the ship 's company had not been idle -- they had laid an anchor out astern , and hove taut : they had started all the water , and were pumping it out , when a boat pulled alongside , and Krantz made his appearance on deck .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 52]: `` Captain Vanderdecken , I have come to put myself under your orders , if you will receive me -- if not , render me your protection ; for , as sure as fate , I should have been hanged to-morrow morning , if I had remained in my own ship .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 24]: The men in the boat have come with the same intention -- that of joining you , if you will permit them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 26]: Although Philip would have wished it had been otherwise , he could not well refuse to receive Krantz , under the circumstances of the case .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 26]: He was very partial to him , and to save his life , which certainly was in danger , he would have done much more .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 62]: He desired that the boat 's crew should return ; but when Krantz had stated to him what had occurred on board the _ Lion _ , and the crew earnestly begged him not to send them back to almost certain death , which their having effected the escape of Krantz would have assured , Philip reluctantly allowed them to remain .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 19]: The night was tempestuous , but the wind being now off shore , the water was not rough .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 49]: The crew of the _ Dort _ , under the directions of Philip and Krantz , succeeded in lightening the vessel so much during the night that the next morning they were able to haul her off , and found that her bottom had received no serious injury .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 53]: It was fortunate for them that they had not discontinued their exertions , for the wind shifted a few hours before sunrise , and by the time that they had shipped their rudder , it came on to blow fresh down the Straits , the wind being accompanied with a heavy swell .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 19]: The Admiral 's ship still lay aground , and apparently no exertions were used to get her off .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 67]: Philip was much puzzled how to act : leave the crew of the _ Lion _ he could not ; nor indeed could he refuse , or did he wish to refuse the Admiral , if he proposed coming on board ; but he now made up his mind that it should only be as a passenger , and that he would himself retain the command .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 66]: At present he contented himself with dropping his anchor outside , clear of the reef , where he was sheltered by a bluff cape , under which the water was smooth , about a mile distant from where the Admiral 's ship lay on shore ; and he employed his crew in replenishing his water-casks from a rivulet close to where the ship was anchored .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 25]: He waited to see if the other vessel got off , being convinced that if she did not some communication must soon take place .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 62]: As soon as the water was complete , he sent one of the boats to the place where the Commodore had been landed , having resolved to take him on board , if they could find him ; but the boat returned without having seen anything of him , although the men had clambered over the hills to a considerable distance .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 69]: On the second morning after Philip had hauled his vessel off , they observed that the boats of the Admiral 's ship were passing and repassing from the shore , landing her stores and provisions ; and the next day , from the tents pitched on shore , it was evident that she was abandoned , although the boats were still employed in taking articles out of her .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 43]: That night it blew fresh , and the sea was heavy ; the next morning her masts were gone , and she turned on her broadside ; she was evidently a wreck , and Philip now consulted with Krantz how to act .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 29]: To leave the crew of the _ Lion _ on shore was impossible : they must all perish when the winter set in upon such a desolate coast .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 28]: On the whole , it was considered advisable that the first communication should come from the other party , and Philip resolved to remain quietly at anchor .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 53]: It was very plain that there was no longer any subordination among the crew of the _ Lion _ , who were to be seen , in the day-time , climbing over the rocks in every direction , and at night , when their large fires were lighted , carousing and drinking .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 13]: This waste of provisions was a subject of much vexation to Philip .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 52]: He had not more than sufficient for his own crew , and he took it for granted that , so soon as what they had taken on shore should be expended , the crew of the _ Lion _ would ask to be received on board of the _ Dort _ .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 47]: For more than a week did affairs continue in this state , when , one morning , a boat was seen pulling towards the ship , and , in the stern-sheets Philip recognised the officer who had been sent on board to put him under arrest .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 15]: When the officer came on deck , he took off his hat to Philip .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 16]: `` You do , then , acknowledge me as in command , '' observed Philip .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 27]: `` Yes , sir , most certainly ; you were second in command , but now you are first -- for the Admiral is dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 4]: `` Dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 8]: exclaimed Philip ; `` and how ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 33]: `` He was found dead on the beach , under a high cliff , and the body of the Commodore was in his arms ; indeed , they were both grappled together .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 58]: It is supposed , that in his walk up to the top of the hill , which he used to take every day , to see if any vessels might be in the Straits , he fell in with the Commodore -- that they had come to contention , and had both fallen over the precipice together .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 23]: No one saw the meeting , but they must have fallen over the rocks , as the bodies are dreadfully mangled . ''
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 100]: On inquiry , Philip ascertained that all chance of saving the _ Lion _ had been lost after the second night , when she had beat in her larboard streak , and had six feet of water in the hold -- that the crew had been very insubordinate , and had consumed almost all the spirits ; and that not only all the sick had already perished , but also many others who had either fallen over the rocks when they were intoxicated , or had been found dead in the morning , from their exposure during the night .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 12]: `` Then the poor Commodore 's prophecy has been fulfilled ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 5]: observed Philip to Krantz .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 20]: `` Many others , and even the Admiral himself , have perished with him -- peace be with them !
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 16]: And now let us get away from this horrible place as soon as possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 22]: Philip then gave orders to the officer to collect his men , and the provisions that remained , for immediate embarkation .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 17]: Krantz followed soon after with all the boats , and before night everything was on board .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 41]: The bodies of the Admiral and Commodore were buried where they lay , and the next morning the _ Dort _ was under weigh , and , with a slanting wind , was laying a fair course through the Straits .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 21]: Chapter XIX It appeared as if their misfortunes were to cease , after the tragical death of the two commanders .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 33]: In a few days , the _ Dort _ had passed through the Straits of Magellan , and was sailing in the Pacific Ocean , with a blue sky and quiet sea .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 26]: The ship 's company recovered their health and spirits , and the vessel being now well manned , the duty was carried on with cheerfulness .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 41]: In about a fortnight , they had gained well up on the Spanish coast , but although they had seen many of the inhabitants on the beach , they had not fallen in with any vessels belonging to the Spaniards .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 32]: Aware that if he met with a Spanish ship of superior force it would attack him , Philip had made every preparation , and had trained his men to the guns .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 45]: He had now , with the joint crews of the vessels , a well-manned ship , and the anticipation of prize-money had made his men very eager to fall in with some Spaniard , which they knew that Philip would capture if he could .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 60]: Light winds and calms detained them for a month on the coast , when Philip determined upon running for the Isle St Marie , where , though he knew it was in possession of the Spaniards , he yet hoped to be able to procure refreshments for the ship 's company , either by fair means or by force .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 33]: The _ Dort _ was , by their reckoning , about thirty miles from the island , and having run in until after dark , they had hove-to till the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 30]: Krantz was on deck ; he leant over the side , and as the sails flapped to the masts , he attempted to define the line of the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 26]: It was very dark , but as he watched , he thought that he perceived a light for a moment , and which then disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 24]: Fixing his eyes on the spot , he soon made out a vessel , hove-to , and not two cables ' length distant .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 12]: He hastened down to apprise Philip , and procure a glass .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 27]: By the time Philip was on deck , the vessel had been distinctly made out to be a three-masted xebeque , very low in the water .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 37]: After a short consultation , it was agreed that the boats on the quarter should be lowered down , and manned and armed without noise , and that they should steal gently alongside and surprise her .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 45]: The men were called up , silence enjoined , and in a few minutes the boats ' crew had possession of the vessel ; having boarded her and secured the hatches before the alarm could be given by the few who were on deck .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 33]: More men were then taken on board by Krantz , who , as agreed upon , lay to under the lee of the _ Dort _ until the daylight made its appearance .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 19]: The hatches were then taken off , and the prisoners sent on board of the _ Dort _ .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 17]: There were sixty people on board , a large number for a vessel of that description .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 69]: On being interrogated , two of the prisoners , who were well-dressed and gentlemanlike persons , stepped forward and stated that the vessel was from St Mary 's , bound to Lima , with a cargo of flour and passengers ; that the crew and captain consisted of twenty-five men , and all the rest who were on board , had taken that opportunity of going to Lima .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 29]: That they themselves were among the passengers , and trusted that the vessel and cargo would be immediately released , as the two nations were not at war .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 45]: `` Not at war at home , I grant , '' replied Philip , `` but in these seas , the constant aggressions of your armed ships compel me to retaliate , and I shall therefore make a prize of your vessel and cargo .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 64]: At the same time , as I have no wish to molest private individuals , I will land all the passengers and crew at St Mary 's , to which place I am bound in order to obtain refreshments , which now I shall expect will be given cheerfully as your ransom , so as to relieve me from resorting to force . ''
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 11]: The prisoners protested strongly against this , but without avail .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 52]: They then requested leave to ransom the vessel and cargo , offering a larger sum than they both appeared to be worth ; but Philip , being short of provisions , refused to part with the cargo , and the Spaniards appeared much disappointed at the unsuccessful issue of their request .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 36]: Finding that nothing would induce him to part with the provisions , they then begged hard to ransom the vessel ; and to this , after a consultation with Krantz , Philip gave his assent .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 20]: The two vessels then made sail , and steered on for the island , then about four leagues distant .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 36]: Although Philip had not wished to retain the vessel , yet , as they stood in together , her superior speed became so manifest that he almost repented that he had agreed to ransom her .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 53]: At noon , the _ Dort _ was anchored in the roads , out of gunshot , and a portion of the passengers allowed to go on shore and make arrangements for the ransom of the remainder , while the prize was hauled alongside , and her cargo hoisted into the ship .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 85]: Towards evening , three large boats with live stock and vegetables and the sum agreed upon for the ransom of the xebeque , came alongside ; and as soon as one of the boats was cleared , the prisoners were permitted to go on shore in it , with the exception of the Spanish pilot , who , at the suggestion of Krantz , was retained , with a promise of being released directly the _ Dort _ was clear of the Spanish seas .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 52]: A negro slave was also , at his own request , allowed to remain on board , much to the annoyance of the two passengers before mentioned , who claimed the man as their property , and insisted that it was an infraction of the agreement which had been entered into .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 38]: `` You prove my right by your own words , '' replied Philip ; `` I agreed to deliver up all the passengers , but no _ property _ ; the slave will remain on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 12]: Finding their endeavours ineffectual , the Spaniards took a haughty leave .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 35]: The _ Dort _ remained at anchor that night to examine her rigging , and the next morning they discovered that the xebeque had disappeared , having sailed unperceived by them during the night .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 31]: As soon as the anchor was up and sail made on the ship , Philip went down to his cabin with Krantz , to consult as to their best course .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 27]: They were followed by the negro slave , who , shutting the door and looking watchfully round , said that he wished to speak with them .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 12]: His information was most important , but given rather too late .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 18]: The vessel which had been ransomed was a government advice-boat , the fastest sailer the Spaniards possessed .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 21]: The two pretended passengers were officers of the Spanish navy , and the others were the crew of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 42]: She had been sent down to collect the bullion and take it to Lima , and at the same time to watch for the arrival of the Dutch fleet , intelligence of whose sailing had been some time before received overland .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 28]: When the Dutch fleet made its appearance , she was to return to Lima with the news , and a Spanish force would be despatched against it .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 32]: They further learnt that some of the supposed casks of flour contained 2000 gold doubloons each , others bars of silver ; this precaution having been taken in case of capture .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 13]: That the vessel had now sailed for Lima there was no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 36]: The reason why the Spaniards were so anxious not to leave the negro on board of the _ Dort _ , was , that they knew that he would disclose what he now had done .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 41]: As for the pilot , he was a man whom the Spaniards knew they could trust , and for that reason they had better be careful of him , or he would lead the _ Dort _ into some difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 48]: Philip now repented that he had ransomed the vessel , as he would , in all probability , have to meet and cope with a superior force , before he could make his way clear out of these seas ; but there was no help for it .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 57]: He consulted with Krantz , and it was agreed that they should send for the ship 's company and make them acquainted with these facts ; arguing that a knowledge of the valuable capture which they had made , would induce the men to fight well , and stimulate them with the hopes of further success .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 45]: The ship 's company heard the intelligence with delight , professed themselves ready to meet double their force , and then , by the directions of Philip , the casks were brought up on the quarter-deck , opened , and the bullion taken out .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 57]: The whole , when collected , amounted to about half a million of dollars , as near as they could estimate it , and a distribution of the coined money was made from the capstan the very next day ; the bars of metal being reserved until they could be sold , and their value ascertained .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 20]: For six weeks Philip worked his vessel up the coast , without falling in with any vessel under sail .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 27]: Notice had been given by the advice-boat , as it appeared , and every craft , large and small , was at anchor under the batteries .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 40]: They had nearly run up the whole coast , and Philip had determined that the next day he would stretch across to Batavia , when a ship was seen in-shore under a press of sail , running towards Lima .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 21]: Chase was immediately given , but the water shoaled , and the pilot was asked if they could stand on .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 23]: He replied in the affirmative , stating that they were now in the shallowest water , and that it was deeper within .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 37]: The leadsman was ordered into the chains , but at the first heave the lead-line broke ; another was sent for , and the _ Dort _ still carried on under a heavy press of sail .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 56]: Just then , the negro slave went up to Philip , and told him that he had seen the pilot with his knife in the chains , and that he thought he must have cut the lead-line so far through as to occasion it being carried away , and told Philip not to trust him .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 26]: The helm was immediately put down ; but as the ship went round she touched on the bank , dragged , and was again clear .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 5]: -- `` Scoundrel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 3]: cried Philip .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 7]: `` So you cut the lead-line ?
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 11]: The negro saw you , and has saved us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 28]: The Spaniard leaped down from off the gun , and , before he could be prevented , had buried his knife in the heart of the negro .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 10]: `` Maldetto , take that for your pains ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 15]: cried he , in a fury , grinding his teeth and flourishing his knife .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 5]: The negro fell dead .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 34]: The pilot was seized and disarmed by the crew of the _ Dort _ , who were partial to the negro , as it was from his information that they had become rich .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 16]: `` Let them do with him as they please , '' said Krantz to Philip .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 12]: `` Yes , '' replied Philip ; `` summary justice . ''
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 24]: The crew debated a few minutes , and then lashed the pilot to the negro , and carried him off to the taffrail .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 20]: There was a heavy plunge , and he disappeared under the eddying waters in the wake of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 10]: Philip now determined to shape his course for Batavia .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 27]: He was within a few days ' sail of Lima , and had every reason to believe that vessels had been sent out to intercept him .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 21]: With a favourable wind he now stood away from the coast , and for three days made a rapid passage .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 18]: On the fourth , at daylight , two vessels appeared to windward , bearing down upon him .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 36]: That they were large armed vessels was evident ; and the display of Spanish ensigns and pennants , as they rounded to , about a mile to windward , soon showed that they were enemies .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 23]: They proved to be a frigate of a larger size than the _ Dort _ , and a corvette of twenty-two guns .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 48]: The crew of the _ Dort _ showed no alarm at this disparity of force : they clinked their doubloons in their pockets ; vowed not to return them to their lawful owners , if they could help it ; and flew with alacrity to their guns .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 77]: The Dutch ensign was displayed in defiance , and the two Spanish vessels , again putting their heads towards the _ Dort _ , that they might lessen their distance , received some raking shot , which somewhat discomposed them ; but they rounded to at a cable 's length , and commenced the action with great spirit , the frigate lying on the beam , and the corvette on the bow of Philip 's vessel .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 32]: After half an hour 's determined exchange of broadsides , the foremast of the Spanish frigate fell , carrying away with it the maintop-mast ; and this accident impeded her firing .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 45]: The _ Dort _ immediately made sail , stood on to the corvette , which she crippled with three or four broadsides , then tacked , and fetched alongside of the frigate , whose lee-guns were still impeded with the wreck of the foremast .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 27]: The two vessels now lay head and stern , within ten feet of each other , and the action recommenced to the disadvantage of the Spaniard .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 48]: In a quarter of an hour the canvas , hanging overside , caught fire from the discharge of the guns , and very soon communicated to the ship , the _ Dort _ still pouring in a most destructive broadside , which could not be effectually returned .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 24]: After every attempt to extinguish the flames , the captain of the Spanish vessel resolved that both vessels should share the same fate .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 30]: He put his helm up , and , running her on to the _ Dort _ , grappled with her , and attempted to secure the two vessels together .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 31]: Then raged the conflict ; the Spaniards attempting to pass their grappling-chains so as to prevent the escape of their enemy , and the Dutch endeavouring to frustrate their attempt .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 37]: The chains and sides of both vessels were crowded with men fighting desperately ; those struck down falling between the two vessels , which the wreck of the foremast still prevented from coming into actual collision .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 11]: During this conflict , Philip and Krantz were not idle .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 73]: By squaring the after-yards , and putting all sail on forward they contrived that the _ Dort _ should pay off before the wind with her antagonist , and by this manoeuvre they cleared themselves of the smoke which so incommoded them ; and , having good way on the two vessels , they then rounded to so as to get on the other tack , and bring the Spaniard to leeward .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 13]: This gave them a manifest advantage , and soon terminated the conflict .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 83]: The smoke and flames were beat back on the Spanish vessel -- the fire which had communicated to the _ Dort _ was extinguished -- the Spaniards were no longer able to prosecute their endeavours to fasten the two vessels together , and retreated to within the bulwarks of their own vessel ; and , after great exertions , the _ Dort _ was disengaged , and forged ahead of her opponent , who was soon enveloped in a sheet of flame .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 16]: The corvette remained a few cables ' length to windward , occasionally firing a gun .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 13]: Philip poured in a broadside , and she hauled down her colours .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 23]: The action might now be considered at an end , and the object was to save the crew of the burning frigate .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 19]: The boats of the _ Dort _ were hoisted out , but only two of them could swim .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 41]: One of them was immediately despatched to the corvette , with orders for her to send all her boats to the assistance of the frigate , which was done , and the major part of the surviving crew were saved .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 46]: For two hours the guns of the frigate , as they were heated by the flames , discharged themselves ; and then , the fire having communicated to the magazine , she blew up , and the remainder of her hull sank slowly and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 27]: Among the prisoners in the uniform of the Spanish service Philip perceived the two pretended passengers , this proving the correctness of the negro 's statement .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 27]: The two men-of-war had been sent out of Lima on purpose to intercept him , anticipating , with such a preponderating force , an easy victory .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 41]: After some consultation with Krantz , Philip agreed that , as the corvette was in such a crippled state , and the nations were not actually at war , it would be advisable to release her with all the prisoners .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 29]: This was done , and the _ Dort _ again made sail for Batavia , and anchored in the roads three weeks after the combat had taken place .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 36]: He found the remainder of the fleet , which had been despatched before them , and had arrived there some weeks , had taken in their cargoes , and were ready to sail for Holland .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 51]: Philip wrote his despatches , in which he communicated to the directors the events of the voyage ; and then went on shore , to reside at the house of the merchant who had formerly received him , until the _ Dort _ could be freighted for her voyage home .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 29]: Chapter XX We must return to Amine , who is seated on the mossy bank where she and Philip conversed when they were interrupted by Schriften the pilot .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 20]: She is in deep thought , with her eyes cast down , as if trying to recall the past .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 3]: `` Alas !
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 20]: for my mother 's power , '' exclaimed she ; `` but it is gone -- gone for ever !
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 15]: This torment and suspense I can not bear -- those foolish priests too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 12]: And Amine rose from the bank and walked towards her cottage .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 8]: Father Mathias had not returned to Lisbon .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 41]: At first he had not found an opportunity , and afterwards , his debt of gratitude towards Philip induced him to remain by Amine , who appeared each day to hold more in aversion the tenets of the Christian faith .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 42]: Many and many were the consultations with Father Seysen , many were the exhortations of both the good old men to Amine , who , at times , would listen without reply , and at others , argue boldly against them .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 19]: It appeared to them that she rejected their religion with an obstinacy as unpardonable as it was incomprehensible .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 24]: But to her the case was more simple : she refused to believe , she said , that which she could not understand .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 46]: She went so far as to acknowledge the beauty of the principles , the purity of the doctrine ; but when the good priests would enter into the articles of their faith , Amine would either shake her head or attempt to turn the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 58]: This only increased the anxiety of the good Father Mathias to convert and save the soul of one so young and beautiful ; and he now no longer thought of returning to Lisbon , but devoted his whole time to the instruction of Amine , who , wearied by his incessant importunities , almost loathed his presence .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 21]: Upon reflection , it will not appear surprising that Amine rejected a creed so dissonant to her wishes and intentions .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 30]: The human mind is of that proud nature , that it requires all its humility to be called into action before it will bow , even to the Deity .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 17]: Amine knew that her mother had possessed superior knowledge , and an intimacy with unearthly intelligences .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 70]: She had seen her practise her art with success , although so young at the time that she could not now call to mind the mystic preparations by which her mother had succeeded in her wishes ; and it was now that her thoughts were wholly bent upon recovering what she had forgotten , that Father Mathias was exhorting her to a creed which positively forbade even the attempt .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 105]: The peculiar and awful mission of her husband strengthened her opinion in the lawfulness of calling in the aid of supernatural agencies ; and the arguments brought forward by these worthy , but not over-talented , professors of the Christian creed , had but little effect upon a mind so strong and so decided as that of Amine -- a mind which , bent as it was upon one object , rejected with scorn tenets , in proof of which they could offer no visible manifestation , and which would have bound her blindly to believe what appeared to her contrary to common sense .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 43]: That her mother 's art could bring evidence of _ its _ truth she had already shown , and satisfied herself in the effect of the dream which she had proved upon Philip ; -- but what proof could they bring forward ?
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 14]: -- Records -- _ which they would not permit her to read _ !
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 33]: that I had my mother 's art , '' repeated Amine once more , as she entered the cottage ; `` then would I know where my Philip was at this moment .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 24]: for the black mirror in which I used to peer at her command , and tell her what passed in array before me .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 55]: How well do I remember that time -- the time of my father 's absence , when I looked into the liquid on the palm of my hand , and told her of the Bedouin camp -- of the skirmish -- the horse without a rider -- and the turban on the sand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 8]: And again Amine fell into deep thought .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 19]: `` Yes , '' cried she , after a time , `` thou canst assist me , mother !
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 16]: Give me in a dream thy knowledge ; thy daughter begs it as a boon .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 5]: Let me think again .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 8]: The word -- what was the word ?
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 10]: what was the name of the spirit -- Turshoon ?
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 7]: Yes , methinks it was Turshoon .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 2]: Mother !
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 2]: mother !
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 5]: help your daughter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 13]: `` Dost thou call upon the Blessed Virgin , my child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 16]: said Father Mathias , who had entered the room as she pronounced the last words .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 27]: `` If so , thou dost well , for she may appear to thee in thy dreams , and strengthen thee in the true faith . ''
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 23]: `` I called upon my own mother , who is in the land of spirits , good father , '' replied Amine .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 26]: `` Yes ; but , as an infidel ; not , I fear , in the land of the blessed spirits , my child . ''
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 27]: `` She hardly will be punished for following the creed of her fathers , living where she did , where no other creed was known ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 5]: replied Amine , indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 50]: `` If the good on earth are blessed in the next world -- if she had , as you assert she had , a soul to be saved -- an immortal spirit -- He who made that spirit will not destroy it because she worshipped as her fathers did .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 26]: -- Her life was good : why should she be punished for ignorance of that creed which she never had an opportunity of rejecting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 12]: `` Who shall dispute the will of Heaven , my child ?
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 23]: Be thankful that you are permitted to be instructed , and to be received into the bosom of the holy church . ''
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 23]: `` I am thankful for many things , father ; but I am weary , and must wish you a good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 11]: Amine retired to her room -- but not to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 23]: Once more did she attempt the ceremonies used by her mother , changing them each time , as doubtful of her success .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 60]: Again the censer was lighted -- the charm essayed ; again the room was filled with smoke as she threw in the various herbs which she had knowledge of , for all the papers thrown aside at her father 's death had been carefully collected , and on many were directions found as to the use of those herbs .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 4]: `` The word !
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 3]: the word !
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 9]: I have the first -- the second word !
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 6]: Help me , mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 30]: cried Amine , as she sat by the side of the bed , in the room , which was now so full of smoke that nothing could be distinguished .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 28]: `` It is of no use , '' thought she at last , letting her hands fall at her side ; `` I have forgotten the art .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 2]: Mother !
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 2]: mother !
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 9]: help me in my dreams this night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 23]: The smoke gradually cleared away , and , when Amine lifted up her eyes , she perceived a figure standing before her .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 48]: At first she thought she had been successful in her charm ; but , as the figure became more distinct , she perceived that it was Father Mathias , who was looking at her with a severe frown and contracted brow , his arms folded before him .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 4]: `` Unholy child !
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 5]: what dost thou ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 66]: Amine had roused the suspicions of the priests , not only by her conversation , but by several attempts which she had before made to recover her lost art ; and on one occasion , in which she had defended it , both Father Mathias and Father Seysen had poured out the bitterest anathemas upon her , or anyone who had resort to such practices .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 51]: The smell of the fragrant herbs thrown into the censer , and the smoke , which afterwards had escaped through the door and ascended the stairs , had awakened the suspicions of Father Mathias , and he had crept up silently , and entered the room without her perceiving it .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 7]: Amine at once perceived her danger .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 25]: Had she been single , she would have dared the priest ; but , for Philip 's sake , she determined to mislead him .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 38]: `` I do no wrong , father , '' replied she , calmly ; `` but it appears to me not seemly that you should enter the chamber of a young woman during her husband 's absence .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 8]: I might have been in my bed .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 7]: It is a strange intrusion . ''
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 9]: `` Thou canst not mean this , woman !
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 23]: My age -- my profession -- are a sufficient warranty , '' replied Father Mathias , somewhat confused at this unexpected attack .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 23]: `` Not always , Father , if what I have been told of monks and priests be true , '' replied Amine .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 17]: `` I ask again , why comest thou here into an unprotected woman 's chamber ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 13]: `` Because I felt convinced that she was practising unholy arts . ''
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 4]: `` Unholy arts !
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 5]: -- what mean you ?
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 7]: Is the leech 's skill unholy ?
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 11]: is it unholy to administer relief to those who suffer ?
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 22]: -- to charm the fever and the ague which rack the limbs of those who live in this unwholesome climate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 8]: `` All charms are most unholy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 23]: `` When I said charms , Father , I meant not what you mean ; I simply would have said a remedy .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 59]: If a knowledge of certain wonderful herbs , which , properly combined will form a specific to ease the suffering wretch -- an art well known unto my mother , and which I now would fain recall -- if that knowledge , or a wish to regain that knowledge , be unholy , then are you correct . ''
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 13]: `` I heard thee call upon thy mother for her help . ''
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 24]: `` I did , for she well knew the ingredients ; but I , I fear have not the knowledge that she had .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 9]: Is that sinful , good Father ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 13]: 'T is , then , a remedy that you would find ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 18]: replied the priest ; `` I thought that thou didst practise that which is most unlawful . ''
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 12]: `` Can the burning of a few weeds be then unlawful ?
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 7]: What did you expect to find ?
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 30]: Look you , Father , at these ashes -- they may , with oil , be rubbed into the pores and give relief -- but can they do more ?
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 10]: What do you expect from them -- a ghost ?
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 4]: -- a spirit ?
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 12]: -- like the prophet raised for the King of Israel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 5]: And Amine laughed aloud .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 14]: `` I am perplexed , but not convinced , '' replied the priest .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 17]: `` I , too , am perplexed and not convinced , '' responded Amine , scornfully .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 48]: `` I can not satisfy myself that a man of your discretion could really suppose that there was mischief in burning weeds ; nor am I convinced that such was the occasion of your visit at this hour of the night to a lone woman 's chamber .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 13]: There may be natural charms more powerful than those you call supernatural .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 10]: I pray you , Father , leave this chamber .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 5]: It is not seemly .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 10]: Should you again presume , you leave the house .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 6]: I thought better of you .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 14]: In future , I will not be left at any time alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 16]: This attack of Amine 's upon the reputation of the old priest was too severe .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 27]: Father Mathias immediately quitted the room , saying , as he went out , `` May God forgive you for your false suspicions and great injustice !
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 15]: I came here for the cause I have stated , and no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 24]: soliloquised Amine , as the door closed , `` I know you did ; but I must rid myself of your unwelcome company .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 18]: I will have no spy upon my actions -- no meddler to thwart me in my will .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 19]: In your zeal you have committed yourself , and I will take the advantage you have given me .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 18]: Is not the privacy of a woman 's chamber to be held sacred by you sacred men ?
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 18]: In return for assistance in distress -- for food and shelter -- you would become a spy .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 14]: How grateful , and how worthy of the creed which you profess ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 47]: Amine opened her door as soon as she had removed the censer , and summoned one of the women of the house to stay that night in her room , stating that the priest had entered her chamber , and she did not like the intrusion .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 4]: `` Holy father !
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 5]: is it possible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 4]: replied the woman .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 24]: Amine made no reply , but went to bed ; but Father Mathias heard all that passed as he paced the room below .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 24]: The next day he called upon Father Seysen , and communicated to him what had occurred , and the false suspicions of Amine .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 27]: `` You have acted hastily , '' replied Father Seysen , `` to visit a woman 's chamber at such an hour of the night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 11]: `` I had my suspicions , good Father Seysen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 7]: `` And she will have hers .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 7]: She is young and beautiful . ''
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 39]: `` Now , by the Blessed Virgin -- '' `` I absolve you , good Mathias , '' replied Father Seysen ; `` but still , if known , it would occasion much scandal to our church . ''
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 76]: And known it soon was ; for the woman who had been summoned by Amine did not fail to mention the circumstance ; and Father Mathias found himself everywhere so coldly received , and , besides , so ill at ease with himself , that he very soon afterwards quitted the country , and returned to Lisbon ; angry with himself for his imprudence , but still more angry with Amine for her unjust suspicions .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 25]: Chapter XXI The cargo of the _ Dort _ was soon ready , and Philip sailed and arrived at Amsterdam without any further adventure .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 19]: That he reached his cottage , and was received with delight by Amine , need hardly be said .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 56]: She had been expecting him ; for the two ships of the squadron , which had sailed on his arrival at Batavia , and which had charge of his despatches , had , of course , carried letters to her from Philip , the first letters she had ever received from him during his voyages .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 16]: Six weeks after the letters Philip himself made his appearance , and Amine was happy .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 64]: The directors were , of course , highly satisfied with Philip 's conduct , and he was appointed to the command of a large armed ship , which was to proceed to India in the spring , and one-third of which , according to agreement , was purchased by Philip out of the funds which he had in the hands of the Company .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 45]: He had now five months of quiet and repose to pass away , previous to his once more trusting to the elements ; and this time , as it was agreed , he had to make arrangements on board for the reception of Amine .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 27]: Amine narrated to Philip what had occurred between her and the priest Mathias , and by what means she had rid herself of his unwished-for surveillance .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 13]: `` And were you practising your mother 's arts , Amine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 23]: `` Nay , not practising them , for I could not recall them , but I was trying to recover them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 6]: `` Why so , Amine ?
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 5]: this must not be .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 13]: It is , as the good father said , ` unholy . '
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 13]: Promise me you will abandon them , now and for ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 14]: `` If that act be unholy , Philip , so is your mission .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 18]: You would deal and co-operate with the spirits of another world -- I would do no more .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 29]: Abandon your terrific mission -- abandon your seeking after disembodied spirits -- stay at home with your Amine , and she will cheerfully comply with your request . ''
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 12]: `` Mine is an awful summons from the Most High . ''
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 18]: `` Then the Most High permits your communion with those who are not of this world ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 23]: `` He does ; you know even the priests do not gainsay it , although they shudder at the very thought . ''
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 27]: `` If then He permits to one , He will to another ; nay , aught that I can do is but with His permission . ''
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 23]: `` Yes , Amine , so does He permit evil to stalk on the earth , but He countenances it not . ''
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 24]: `` He countenances your seeking after your doomed father , your attempts to meet him ; nay , more , He commands it .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 12]: If you are thus permitted , why may not I be ?
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 66]: I am your wife , a portion of yourself ; and when I am left over a desolate hearth , while you pursue your course of danger , may not I appeal also to the immaterial world to give me that intelligence which will soothe my sorrow , lighten my burden , and which , at the same time , can hurt no living creature ?
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 49]: Did I attempt to practise these arts for evil purposes , it were just to deny them me , and wrong to continue them ; but I would but follow in the steps of my husband , and seek as he seeks , with a good intent . ''
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 10]: `` But it is contrary to our faith . ''
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 12]: `` Have the priests declared your mission contrary to their faith ?
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 21]: or , if they have , have they not been convinced to the contrary , and been awed to silence ?
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 8]: But why argue , my dear Philip ?
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 8]: Shall I not now be with you ?
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 10]: and while with you I will attempt no more .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 39]: You have my promise ; but if separated , I will not say , but I shall then require of the invisible a knowledge of my husband 's motions , when in search of the invisible also . ''
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 38]: The winter passed rapidly away , for it was passed by Philip in quiet and happiness ; the spring came on , the vessel was to be fitted out , and Philip and Amine repaired to Amsterdam .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 32]: The _ Utrecht _ was the name of the vessel to which he had been appointed , a ship of 400 tons , newly launched , and pierced for twenty-four guns .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 32]: Two more months passed away , during which Philip superintended the fitting and loading of the vessel , assisted by his favourite Krantz , who served in her as first mate .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 69]: Every convenience and comfort that Philip could think of was prepared for Amine ; and in the month of May he started , with orders to stop at Gambroon and Ceylon , run down the Straits of Sumatra , and from thence to force his way into the China seas , the Company having every reason to expect from the Portuguese the most determined opposition to the attempt .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 44]: His ship 's company was numerous , and he had a small detachment of soldiers on board to assist the supercargo , who carried out many thousand dollars to make purchases at ports in China , where their goods might not be appreciated .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 40]: Every care had been taken in the equipment of the vessel , which was perhaps the finest , the best manned , and freighted with the most valuable cargo , which had been sent out by the India Company .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 56]: The _ Utrecht _ sailed with a flowing sheet , and was soon clear of the English Channel ; the voyage promised to be auspicious , favouring gales bore them without accident to within a few hundred miles of the Cape of Good Hope , when , for the first time , they were becalmed .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 53]: Amine was delighted : in the evenings she would pace the deck with Philip ; then all was silent , except the splash of the wave as it washed against the side of the vessel -- all was in repose and beauty , as the bright southern constellations sparkled over their heads .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 21]: `` Whose destinies can be in these stars , which appear not to those who inhabit the northern regions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 26]: said Amine , as she cast her eyes above , and watched them in their brightness ; `` and what does that falling meteor portend ?
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 9]: what causes its rapid descent from heaven ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 14]: `` Do you , then , put faith in stars , Amine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 10]: `` In Araby we do ; and why not ?
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 16]: They were not spread over the sky to give light -- for what then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 6]: `` To beautify the world .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 8]: They have their uses , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 21]: `` Then you agree with me -- they have their uses , and the destinies of men are there concealed .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 12]: My mother was one of those who could read them well .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 9]: for me they are a sealed book . ''
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 10]: `` Is it not better so , Amine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 3]: `` Better !
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 34]: -- say better to grovel on this earth with our selfish , humbled race , wandering in mystery , and awe , and doubt , when we can communicate with the intelligences above !
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 14]: Does not the soul leap at her admission to confer with superior powers ?
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 25]: Does not the proud heart bound at the feeling that its owner is one of those more gifted than the usual race of mortals ?
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 8]: Is it not a noble ambition ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 9]: `` A dangerous one -- most dangerous . ''
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 6]: `` And therefore most noble .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 22]: They seem as if they would speak to me : look at yon bright star -- it beckons to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 21]: For some time Amine 's eyes were raised aloft ; she spoke not , and Philip remained at her side .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 26]: She walked to the gangway of the vessel , and looked down upon the placid wave , pierced by the moonbeams far below the surface .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 38]: `` And does your imagination , Amine , conjure up a race of beings gifted to live beneath that deep blue wave , who sport amid the coral rocks , and braid their hair with pearls ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 5]: said Philip , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 19]: `` I know not , but it appears to me that it would be sweet to live there .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 26]: You may call to mind your dream , Philip ; I was then , according to your description , one of those same beings . ''
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 10]: `` You were , '' replied Philip , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 20]: `` And yet I feel as if water would reject me , even if the vessel were to sink .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 43]: In what manner this mortal frame of mine may be resolved into its elements , I know not ; but this I do feel , that it never will become the sport of , or be tossed by , the mocking waves .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 21]: But come in , Philip , dearest ; it is late , and the decks are wet with dew . ''
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 32]: When the day dawned , the look-out man at the mast-head reported that he perceived something floating on the still surface of the water , on the beam of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 26]: Krantz went up with his glass to examine , and made it out to be a small boat , probably cut adrift from some vessel .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 37]: As there was no appearance of wind , Philip permitted a boat to be sent to examine it , and after a long pull , the seamen returned on board , towing the small boat astern .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 44]: `` There is a body of a man in it , sir , '' said the second mate to Krantz , as he gained the gangway ; `` but whether he is quite dead , or not , I can not tell . ''
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 45]: Krantz reported this to Philip , who was , at that time , sitting at breakfast with Amine in the cabin , and then proceeded to the gangway , to where the body of the man had been already handed up by the seamen .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 68]: The surgeon , who had been summoned , declared that life was not yet extinct , and was ordering him to be taken below for recovery , when , to their astonishment , the man turned as he lay , sat up , and ultimately rose upon his feet and staggered to a gun , when , after a time , he appeared to be fully recovered .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 47]: In reply to questions put to him , he said that he was in a vessel which had been upset in a squall , that he had time to cut away the small boat astern , and that all the rest of the crew had perished .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 61]: He had hardly made this answer , when Philip with Amine came out of the cabin , and walked up to where the seamen were crowded round the man ; the seamen retreated so as to make an opening , when Philip and Amine , to their astonishment and horror , recognised their old acquaintance , the one-eyed pilot Schriften .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 3]: `` He !
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 2]: he !
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 21]: Captain Vanderdecken , I believe -- glad to see you in command , and you too , fair lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 25]: Philip turned away with a chill at his heart ; Amine 's eye flashed as she surveyed the wasted form of the wretched creature .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 27]: After a few seconds , she turned round and followed Philip into the cabin , where she found him with his face buried in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 8]: `` Courage , Philip , courage ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 28]: said Amine ; `` it was indeed a heavy shock , and I fear me forbodes evil -- but what then ; it is our destiny . ''
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 47]: `` It is -- it ought perhaps to be mine , '' replied Philip , raising his head ; `` but you , Amine , why should you be a partner -- '' `` I am your partner , Philip , in life and in death .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 32]: I would not die first , Philip , because it would grieve you ; but your death will be the signal for mine , and I will join you quickly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 13]: `` Surely , Amine , you would not hasten your own ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 15]: and require but one moment for this little steel to do its duty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 3]: `` Nay !
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 13]: Amine , that is not lawful -- our religion forbids it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 13]: `` It may do so , but I can not tell why .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 22]: I came into this world without my own consent -- surely I may leave it without asking the leave of priests !
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 17]: But let that pass for the present : what will you do with that Schriften ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 19]: `` Put him on shore at the Cape ; I can not bear the odious wretch 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 16]: Did you not feel the chill , as before , when you approached him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 35]: `` I did -- I knew that he was there before I saw him ; but still , I know not why , I feel as if I would not send him away . ''
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 19]: `` I believe it is because I am inclined to brave destiny , not to quail at it .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 8]: The wretch can do no harm . ''
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 32]: `` Yes , he can -- much : he can render the ship 's company mutinous and disaffected ; -- besides , he attempted to deprive me of my relic . ''
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 19]: `` I almost wish he had done so ; then must you have discontinued this wild search . ''
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 70]: `` Nay , Amine , say not so ; it is my duty , and I have taken my solemn oath -- '' `` But this Schriften -- you can not well put him ashore at the Cape ; being a Company 's officer , you might send him home if you found a ship there homeward-bound ; still , were I you , I would let destiny work .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 11]: He is woven in with ours , that is certain .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 10]: Courage , Philip , and let him remain . ''
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 25]: `` Perhaps you are right , Amine ; I may retard , but can not escape , whatever may be my intended fate . ''
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 14]: `` Let him remain , then , and let him do his worst .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 15]: Treat him with kindness -- who knows what we may gain from him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 15]: `` True , true , Amine ; he has been my enemy without cause .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 4]: Who can tell ?
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 9]: -- perhaps he may become my friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 12]: `` And if not , you will have done your duty .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 6]: Send for him now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 20]: `` No , not now -- to-morrow ; in the meantime , I will order him every comfort . ''
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 52]: `` We are talking as if he were one of us , which I feel that he is not , '' replied Amine ; `` but still , mundane or not , we can not but offer mundane kindness , and what this world , or rather what this ship affords .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 21]: I long now to talk with him , to see if I can produce any effect upon his ice-like frame .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 9]: Shall I make love to the ghoul ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 8]: and Amine burst into a bitter laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 12]: Here the conversation dropped , but its substance was not disregarded .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 22]: The next morning , the surgeon having reported that Schriften was apparently quite recovered , he was summoned into the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 23]: His frame was wasted away to a skeleton , but his motions and his language were as sharp and petulant as ever .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 25]: `` I have sent for you , Schriften , to know if there is anything that I can do to make you more comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 8]: Is there anything that you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 4]: `` Want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 10]: replied Schriften , eyeing first Philip and then Amine .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 4]: -- `` He !
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 2]: he !
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 10]: I think I want filling out a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 24]: `` That you will , I trust , in good time ; my steward has my orders to take care of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 22]: `` Poor man , '' said Amine , with a look of pity , `` how much he must have suffered !
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 17]: Is not this the man who brought you the letter from the Company , Philip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 3]: `` He !
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 2]: he !
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 2]: yes !
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 10]: Not very welcome , was it , lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 25]: `` No , my good fellow , it 's never a welcome message to a wife , that sends her husband away from her .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 8]: But that was not your fault . ''
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 33]: `` If a husband will go to sea and leave a handsome wife , when he has , as they say , plenty of money to live upon on shore , he !
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 3]: he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 15]: `` Yes , indeed , you may well say that , '' replied Amine .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 6]: `` Better give it up .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 11]: All folly , all madness -- eh , captain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 24]: `` I must finish this voyage , at all events , '' replied Philip to Amine , `` whatever I may do afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 12]: I have suffered much , and so have you , Schriften .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 16]: You have been twice wrecked ; now tell me what do you wish to do ?
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 32]: Go home in the first ship , or go ashore at the Cape -- or -- '' `` Or do anything , so I get out of this ship -- he !
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 3]: he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 4]: `` Not so .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 38]: If you prefer sailing with me , as I know you are a good seaman , you shall have your rating and pay of pilot -- that is , if you choose to follow my fortunes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 3]: `` Follow ?
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 4]: -- Must follow .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 19]: I 'll sail with you , Mynheer Vanderdecken , I wish to be always near you -- he !
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 3]: he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 35]: `` Be it so , then : as soon as you are strong again , you will go to your duty ; till then , I will see that you want for nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 8]: `` Nor I , my good fellow .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 18]: Come to me if you do , and I will be your help , '' said Amine .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 20]: `` You have suffered much , but we will do what we can to make you forget it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 4]: `` Very good !
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 4]: very kind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 12]: replied Schriften , surveying the lovely face and figure of Amine .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 16]: After a time , shrugging up his shoulders , he added -- `` A pity !
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 4]: Yes it is !
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 7]: -- Must be , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 14]: `` Farewell , '' continued Amine , holding out her hand to Schriften .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 29]: The man took it , and a cold shudder went to her heart ; but she , expecting such a result , would not appear to feel it .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 25]: Schriften held her hand for a second or two in his own , looking at it earnestly , and then at Amine 's face .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 8]: -- `` So fair , so good !
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 7]: Mynheer Vanderdecken , I thank you .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 8]: Lady , may Heaven preserve you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 21]: -- Then , squeezing the hand of Amine which he had not released , Schriften hastened out of the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 32]: So great was the sudden icy shock which passed through Amine 's frame when Schriften pressed her hand , that when with difficulty she gained the sofa she fell upon it .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 45]: After remaining with her hand pressed against her heart for some time , during which Philip bent over her , she said in a breathless voice , `` That creature must be supernatural , I am sure of it , I am now convinced .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 36]: -- Well , '' continued she , after a pause of some little while , `` all the better , if we can make him a friend ; and if I can I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 29]: `` But think you , Amine , that those who are not of this world have feelings of kindness , gratitude , and ill-will , as we have ?
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 7]: Can they be made subservient ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 5]: `` Most surely so .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 21]: If they have ill-will , as we know they have , they must also be endowed with the better feelings .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 8]: Why are there good and evil intelligences ?
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 18]: They may have disencumbered themselves of their mortal clay , but the soul must be the same .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 10]: A soul without feeling were no soul at all .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 15]: The soul is active in this world and must be so in the next .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 11]: If angels can pity , they must feel like us .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 11]: If demons can vex , they must feel like us .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 9]: Our feelings change , then why not theirs ?
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 11]: Without feelings , there were no heaven , no hell .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 60]: Here our souls are confined , cribbed , and overladen , borne down by the heavy flesh by which they are , for the time , polluted ; but the soul that has winged its flight from clay is , I think , not one jot more pure , more bright , or more perfect than those within ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 9]: Can they be made subservient , say you !
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 16]: they can ; they can be forced , when mortals possess the means and power .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 14]: The evil-inclined may be forced to good , as well as to evil .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 22]: It is not the good and perfect spirits that we subject by art , but those that are inclined to wrong .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 10]: It is over them that mortals have the power .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 38]: Our arts have no power over the perfect spirits , but over those which are ever working evil , and which are bound to obey and do good , if those who master them require it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 10]: `` You still resort to forbidden arts , Amine .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 5]: Is that right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 3]: `` Right !
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 16]: If we have power given to us , it is right to use it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 15]: `` Yes , most certainly , for good -- but not for evil . ''
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 36]: `` Mortals in power , possessing nothing but what is mundane , are answerable for the use of that power ; so those gifted by superior means , are answerable as they employ those means .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 18]: Does the God above make a flower to grow , intending that it should not be gathered ?
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 24]: neither does He allow supernatural aid to be given , if He did not intend that mortals should avail themselves of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 54]: As Amine 's eyes beamed upon Philip 's , he could not for the moment subdue the idea rising in his mind , that she was not like other mortals , and he calmly observed , `` Am I sure , Amine , that I am wedded to one mortal as myself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 2]: yes !
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 17]: Philip , compose yourself , I am but mortal ; would to Heaven I were not .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 109]: Would to Heaven I were one of those who could hover over you , watch you in all your perils , save and protect you in this your mad career ; but I am but a poor weak woman , whose heart beats fondly , devotedly for you -- who , for you , would dare all and everything -- who , changed in her nature , has become courageous and daring from her love ; and who rejects all creeds which would prevent her from calling upon heaven , or earth , or hell , to assist her in retaining with her her soul 's existence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 3]: `` Nay !
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 2]: nay !
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 9]: Amine , say not you reject the creed .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 35]: Does not this , '' -- and Philip pulled from his bosom the holy relic , `` does not this , and the message sent by it , prove our creed is true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 10]: `` I have thought much of it , Philip .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 20]: At first it startled me almost into a belief , but even your own priests helped to undeceive me .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 39]: They would not answer you ; they would have left you to guide yourself ; the message and the holy word , and the wonderful signs given were not in unison with their creed , and they halted .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 9]: May I not halt , if they did ?
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 50]: The relic may be as mystic , as powerful as you describe ; but the agencies may be false and wicked , the power given to it may have fallen into wrong hands -- the power remains the same , but it is applied to uses not intended . ''
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 23]: `` The power , Amine , can only be exercised by those who are friends to Him who died upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 34]: `` Then is it no power at all ; or if a power , not half so great as that of the arch-fiend ; for his can work for good and evil both .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 21]: But on this point , dear Philip , we do not well agree , nor can we convince each other .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 11]: You have been taught in one way , I another .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 27]: That which our childhood has imbibed , which has grown up with our growth , and strengthened with our years , is not to be eradicated .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 12]: I have seen my mother work great charms , and succeed .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 11]: You have knelt to priests : I blame not you !
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 7]: -- blame not then your Amine .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 12]: We both mean well -- I trust , do well . ''
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 24]: `` If a life of innocence and purity were all that were required , my Amine would be sure of future bliss . ''
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 15]: `` I think it is ; and thinking so , it is my creed .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 14]: There are many creeds : who shall say which is the true one ?
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 5]: And what matters it ?
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 14]: they all have the same end in view -- a future Heaven . ''
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 25]: `` True , Amine , true , '' replied Philip , pacing the cabin thoughtfully ; `` and yet our priests say otherwise . ''
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 12]: `` What is the basis of their creed , Philip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 7]: `` Charity , and good-will . ''
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 34]: `` Does charity condemn to eternal misery those who have never heard this creed , who have lived and died worshipping the Great Being after their best endeavours , and little knowledge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 6]: `` No , surely . ''
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 25]: Amine made no further observations ; and Philip , after pacing for a few minutes in deep thought , walked out of the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 30]: The _ Utrecht _ arrived at the Cape , watered , and proceeded on her voyage and , after two months of difficult navigation , cast anchor off Gambroon .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 18]: During this time , Amine had been unceasing in her attempts to gain the good-will of Schriften .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 29]: She had often conversed with him on deck , and had done him every kindness , and had overcome that fear which his near approach had generally occasioned .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 19]: Schriften gradually appeared mindful of this kindness , and at last to be pleased with Amine 's company .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 22]: To Philip he was at times civil and courteous , but not always ; but to Amine he was always deferent .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 18]: His language was mystical , she could not prevent his chuckling laugh , his occasional `` He !
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 3]: he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 4]: from breaking forth .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 46]: But when they anchored at Gambroon , he was on such terms with her , that he would occasionally come into the cabin ; and , although he would not sit down , would talk to Amine for a few minutes , and then depart .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 24]: While the vessel lay at anchor at Gambroon , Schriften one evening walked up to Amine , who was sitting on the poop .
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 25]: `` Lady , '' said he , after a pause , `` yon ship sails for your own country in a few days . ''
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 10]: `` So I am told , '' replied Amine .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 13]: `` Will you take the advice of one who wishes you well ?
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 25]: Return in that vessel , go back to your own cottage , and stay there till your husband comes to you once more . ''
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 8]: `` Why is this advice given ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 23]: `` Because I forbode danger , nay , perhaps death , a cruel death , to one I would not harm . ''
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 5]: `` To me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 15]: replied Amine , fixing her eyes upon Schriften , and meeting his piercing gaze .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 6]: `` Yes , to you .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 11]: Some people can see into futurity farther than others . ''
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 11]: `` Not if they are mortal , '' replied Amine .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 8]: `` Yes , if they are mortal .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 14]: But mortal or not , I do see that which I would avert .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 6]: Tempt not destiny farther . ''
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 6]: `` Who can avert it ?
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 16]: If I take your counsel , still was it my destiny to take your counsel .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 13]: If I take it not , still it was my destiny . ''
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 11]: `` Well , then , avoid what threatens you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 11]: `` I fear not , yet do I thank you .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 18]: Tell me , Schriften , hast thou not thy fate someway interwoven with that of my husband ?
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 7]: I feel that thou hast . ''
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 9]: `` Why think you so , lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 23]: `` For many reasons : twice you have summoned him , twice have you been wrecked , and miraculously reappeared and recovered .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 14]: You know , too , of his mission , that is evident . ''
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 6]: `` But proves nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 22]: it proves much ; for it proves that you knew what was supposed to be known but to him alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 21]: `` It was known to you , and holy men debated on it , '' replied Schriften with a sneer .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 9]: `` How knew you that , again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 3]: `` He !
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 3]: he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 17]: replied Schriften ; `` forgive me , lady , I meant not to affront you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 20]: `` You can not deny that you are connected mysteriously and incomprehensibly with this mission of my husband 's .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 14]: Tell me , is it as he believes , true and holy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 16]: `` If he thinks that it is true and holy , it becomes so . ''
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 10]: `` Why then do you appear his enemy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 13]: `` I am not _ his _ enemy , fair lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 30]: `` You are not his enemy -- why then did you once attempt to deprive him of the mystic relic by which the mission is to be accomplished ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 16]: `` I would prevent his further search , for reasons which must not be told .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 9]: Does that prove that I am his enemy ?
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 27]: Would it not be better that he should remain on shore with competence and you , than be crossing the wild seas on this mad search ?
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 10]: Without the relic it is not to be accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 14]: It were a kindness , then , to take it from him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 11]: Amine answered not , for she was lost in thought .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 17]: `` Lady , '' continued Schriften , after a time ; `` I wish you well .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 15]: For your husband I care not , yet do I wish him no harm .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 107]: Now hear me ; if you wish for your future life to be one of ease and peace -- if you wish to remain long in this world with the husband of your choice -- of your first and warmest love -- if you wish that he should die in his bed at a good old age , and that you should close his eyes with children 's tears lamenting , and their smiles reserved to cheer their mother -- all this I see and can promise is in futurity , if you will take that relic from his bosom and give it up to me .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 80]: But if you would that he should suffer more than man has ever suffered , pass his whole life in doubt , anxiety , and pain , until the deep wave receive his corpse , then let him keep it -- If you would that your own days be shortened , and yet those remaining be long in human sufferings , if you would be separated from him and die a cruel death , then let him keep it .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 14]: I can read futurity , and such must be the destiny of both .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 11]: Lady , consider well , I must leave you now .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 8]: To-morrow I will have your answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 11]: Schriften walked away and left Amine to her own reflections .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 42]: For a long while she repeated to herself the conversation and denunciations of the man , whom she was now convinced was not of this world , and was in some way or another deeply connected with her husband 's fate .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 19]: `` To me he wishes well , no harm to my husband , and would prevent his search .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 4]: Why would he ?
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 7]: -- that he will not tell .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 10]: He has tempted me , tempted me most strangely .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 19]: How easy ` twere to take the relic whilst Philip sleeps upon my bosom -- but how treacherous !
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 27]: And yet a life of competence and ease , a smiling family , a good old age ; what offers to a fond and doting wife !
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 17]: And if not , toil , anxiety , and a watery grave ; and for me !
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 2]: Pshaw !
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 4]: that 's nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 12]: And yet to die separated from Philip , is that nothing ?
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 9]: Oh , no , the thought is dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 6]: -- I do believe him .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 13]: Yes , he has foretold the future , and told it truly .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 5]: Could I persuade Philip ?
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 16]: I know him well ; he has vowed , and is not to be changed .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 20]: And yet , if the relic were taken without his knowledge , he would not have to blame himself .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 6]: Who then would he blame ?
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 5]: Could I deceive him ?
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 11]: I , the wife of his bosom tell a lie .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 2]: no !
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 5]: it must not be .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 14]: Come what will , it is our destiny , and I am resigned .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 8]: I would that Schriften had not spoken .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 22]: we search into futurity , and then would fain retrace our steps , and wish we had remained in ignorance . ''
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 10]: `` What makes you so pensive , Amine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 15]: said Philip , who some time afterwards walked up to where she was seated .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 6]: Amine replied not at first .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 8]: `` Shall I tell him all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 3]: thought she .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 11]: `` It is my only chance -- I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 9]: Amine repeated the conversation between her and Schriften .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 15]: Philip made no reply ; he sat down by Amine and took her hand .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 10]: Amine dropped her head upon her husband 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 8]: `` What think you , Amine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 7]: said Philip , after a time .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 19]: `` I could not steal your relic , Philip ; perhaps you 'll give it to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 18]: `` And my father , Amine , my poor father -- his dreadful doom to be eternal !
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 20]: He who appealed , was permitted to appeal to his son , that that dreadful doom might be averted .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 17]: Does not the conversation of this man prove to you that my mission is not false ?
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 9]: Does not his knowledge of it strengthen all ?
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 9]: Yet , why would he prevent it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 5]: continued Philip , musing .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 17]: `` Why , I can not tell , Philip , but I would fain prevent it .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 17]: I feel that he has power to read the future , and has read aright . ''
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 13]: `` Be it so ; he has spoken , but not plainly .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 20]: He has promised me what I have long been prepared for -- what I vowed to Heaven to suffer .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 13]: Already have I suffered much , and am prepared to suffer more .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 29]: I have long looked upon this world as a pilgrimage , and -LRB- selected as I have been -RRB- trust that my reward will be in the other .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 19]: But , Amine , you are not bound by oath to Heaven , you have made no compact .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 7]: He advised you to go home .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 7]: He talked of a cruel death .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 8]: Follow his advice and avoid it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 33]: `` I am not bound by oath , Philip ; but hear me ; as I hope for future bliss , I now bind myself -- '' `` Hold , Amine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 26]: `` Nay , Philip , you can not prevent me ; for if you do now , I will repeat it when you are absent .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 17]: A cruel death were a charity to me , for I shall not see you suffer .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 29]: Then may I never expect future bliss , may eternal misery be my portion , if I leave you as long as fate permits us to be together .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 36]: I am yours -- your wife ; my fortunes , my present , my future , my all are embarked with you , and destiny may do its worst , for Amine will not quail .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 14]: I have no recreant heart to turn aside from danger or from suffering .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 18]: In that one point , Philip , at least , you chose , you wedded well . ''
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 17]: Philip raised her hand to his lips in silence , and the conversation was not resumed .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 11]: The next evening , Schriften came up again to Amine .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 6]: `` Well , lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 21]: `` Schriften , it can not be , '' replied Amine ; `` yet do I thank you much . ''
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 16]: `` Lady , if he must follow up his mission , why should you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 20]: `` Schriften , I am his wife -- his for ever , in this world , and the next .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 7]: You can not blame me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 17]: `` No , '' replied Schriften , `` I do not blame , I admire you .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 4]: I feel sorry .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 9]: But , after all , what is death ?
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 2]: Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 2]: He !
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 3]: he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 11]: and Schriften hastened away , and left Amine to herself .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 24]: Chapter XXII The _ Utrecht _ sailed from Gambroon , touched at Ceylon , and proceeded on her voyage in the Eastern Seas .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 56]: Schriften still remained on board , but since his last conversation with Amine he had kept aloof , and appeared to avoid both her and Philip ; still there was not , as before , any attempt to make the ship 's company disaffected , nor did he indulge in his usual taunts and sneers .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 75]: The communication he had made to Amine had also its effect upon her and Philip ; they were more pensive and thoughtful ; each attempted to conceal their gloom from the other ; and when they embraced , it was with the mournful feeling that perhaps it was an indulgence they would soon be deprived of : at the same time , they steeled their hearts to endurance and prepared to meet the worst .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 15]: Krantz wondered at the change , but of course could not account for it .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 30]: The _ Utrecht _ was not far from the Andaman Isles , when Krantz , who had watched the barometer , came in early one morning and called Philip .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 26]: `` We have every prospect of a typhoon , sir , '' said Krantz ; `` the glass and the weather are both threatening . ''
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 8]: `` Then we must make all snug .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 9]: Send down top-gallant yards and small sails directly .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 6]: We will strike top-gallant masts .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 9]: I will be out in a minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 5]: Philip hastened on deck .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 19]: The sea was smooth , but already the moaning of the wind gave notice of the approaching storm .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 48]: The vacuum in the air was about to be filled up , and the convulsion would be terrible ; a white haze gathered fast , thicker and thicker ; the men were turned up , everything of weight was sent below , and the guns were secured .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 33]: Now came a blast of wind which careened the ship , passed over , and in a minute she righted as before ; then another and another , fiercer and fiercer still .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 72]: The sea , although smooth , at last appeared white as a sheet with foam , as the typhoon swept along in its impetuous career ; it burst upon the vessel , which bowed down to her gunwale and there remained ; in a quarter of an hour the hurricane had passed over , and the vessel was relieved ; but the sea had risen , and the wind was strong .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 65]: In another hour the blast again came , more wild , more furious than the first , the waves were dashed into their faces , torrents of rain descended , the ship was thrown on her beam ends , and thus remained till the wild blast had passed away , to sweep destruction far beyond them , leaving behind it a tumultuous angry sea .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 14]: `` It is nearly over I believe , sir , '' said Krantz .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 11]: `` It is clearing up a little to windward . ''
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 16]: `` We have had the worst of it , I believe , '' said Philip .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 15]: there is worse to come , '' said a low voice near to Philip .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 6]: It was Schriften who spoke .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 14]: `` A vessel to windward scudding before the gale , '' cried Krantz .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 28]: Philip looked to windward , and in the spot where the horizon was clearest , he saw a vessel under topsails and foresail , standing right down .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 13]: `` She is a large vessel ; bring me my glass . ''
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 33]: The telescope was brought from the cabin , but before Philip could use it , a haze had again gathered up to windward , and the vessel was not to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 35]: `` Thick again , '' observed Philip , as he shut in his telescope ; `` we must look out for that vessel , that she does not run too close to us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 15]: `` She has seen us , no doubt , sir , '' said Krantz .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 18]: After a few minutes the typhoon again raged , and the atmosphere was of a murky gloom .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 51]: It seemed as if some heavy fog had been hurled along by the furious wind ; nothing was to be distinguished except the white foam of the sea , and that not the distance of half a cable 's length , where it was lost in one dark gray mist .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 28]: The storm-staysail yielding to the force of the wind , was rent into strips , and flogged and cracked with a noise even louder than the gale .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 15]: The furious blast again blew over , and the mist cleared up a little .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 18]: `` Ship on the weather beam close aboard of us , '' cried one of the men .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 26]: Krantz and Philip sprung upon the gunwale , and beheld the large ship bearing right down upon them , not three cables ' length distant .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 4]: `` Helm up !
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 15]: she does not see us , and she will be aboard of us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 3]: cried Philip .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 13]: `` Helm up , I say , hard up , quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 67]: The helm was put up , as the men , perceiving their imminent danger , climbed upon the guns to look if the vessel altered her course ; but no -- down she came , and the head-sails of the _ Utrecht _ having been carried away , to their horror they perceived that she would not answer her helm and pay off as they required .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 6]: `` Ship , ahoy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 14]: roared Philip through his trumpet -- but the gale drove the sound back .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 6]: `` Ship , ahoy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 10]: cried Krantz on the gunwale , waving his hat .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 27]: It was useless -- down she came , with the waters foaming under her bows , and was now within pistol-shot of the _ Utrecht _ .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 6]: `` Ship , ahoy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 41]: roared all the sailors , with a shout that must have been heard : it was not attended to ; down came the vessel upon them , and now her cutwater was within ten yards of the _ Utrecht _ .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 46]: The men of the _ Utrecht _ , who expected that their vessel would be severed in half by the concussion , climbed upon the weather gunwale , all ready to catch at the ropes of the other vessel and climb on board of her .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 22]: Amine who had been surprised at the noise on deck , had come out and had taken Philip by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 12]: `` Trust to me -- the shock '' -- said Philip .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 152]: He said no more ; the cutwater of the stranger touched their sides ; one general cry was raised by the sailors of the _ Utrecht _ , they sprang to catch at the rigging of the other vessel 's bowsprit which was now pointed between their masts -- they caught at nothing -- nothing -- there was no shock -- no concussion of the two vessels -- the stranger appeared to cleave through them -- her hull passed along in silence -- no cracking of timbers -- no falling of masts -- the foreyard passed through their mainsail , yet the canvas was unrent -- the whole vessel appeared to cut through the _ Utrecht _ , yet left no trace of injury -- not fast , but slowly , as if she were really sawing through her by the heaving and tossing of the sea with her sharp prow .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 14]: The stranger 's forechains had passed their gunwale before Philip could recover himself .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 15]: `` Amine , '' cried he , at last , `` the Phantom Ship !
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 4]: my father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 41]: The seamen of the _ Utrecht _ , more astounded by the marvellous result than by their former danger , threw themselves down upon deck ; some hastened below , some prayed , others were dumb with astonishment and fear .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 105]: Amine appeared more calm than any , not excepting Philip ; she surveyed the vessel as it slowly forced its way through ; she beheld the seamen on board of her coolly leaning over her gunwale , as if deriding the destruction they had occasioned ; she looked for Vanderdecken himself , and on the poop of the vessel , with his trumpet under his arm , she beheld the image of her Philip -- the same hardy , strong build -- the same features -- about the same age apparently -- there could be no doubt it was the _ doomed _ Vanderdecken !
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 12]: `` See , Philip , '' said she , `` see !
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 5]: -- your father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 7]: `` Even so -- Merciful Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 19]: It is -- it is '' -- and Philip , overpowered by his feelings , sank upon deck .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 55]: The vessel had now passed over the _ Utrecht _ ; the form of the elder Vanderdecken was seen to walk aft and look over the taffrail ; Amine perceived it to start and turn away suddenly -- she looked down , and saw Schriften shaking his fist in defiance at the supernatural being !
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 33]: Again the Phantom Ship flew to leeward before the gale , and was soon lost in the mist ; but before that , Amine had turned and perceived the situation of Philip .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 12]: No one but herself and Schriften appeared able to actor move .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 22]: She caught the pilot 's eye , beckoned to him , and with his assistance Philip was led into the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 37]: Chapter XXIII `` I have then seen him , '' said Philip , after he had lain down on the sofa in the cabin for some minutes to recover himself , while Amine bent over him .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 10]: `` I have at last seen him , Amine !
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 6]: Can you doubt now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 25]: `` No , Philip , I have now no doubt , '' replied Amine , mournfully ; `` but take courage , Philip . ''
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 29]: `` For myself , I want not courage -- but for you , Amine -- you know that his appearance portends a mischief that will surely come . ''
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 26]: `` Let it come , '' replied Amine , calmly ; `` I have long been prepared for it , and so have you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 12]: `` Yes , for myself ; but not for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 19]: `` You have been wrecked often , and have been saved -- then why should not I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 6]: `` But the sufferings ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 15]: `` Those suffer least , who have most courage to bear up against them .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 30]: I am but a woman , weak and frail in body , but I trust I have that within me which will not make you feel ashamed of Amine .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 62]: No , Philip , you will have no wailing , no expression of despair from Amine 's lips ; if she can console you , she will ; if she can assist you , she will ; but , come what may , if she can not serve you , at least , she will prove no burden to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 12]: `` Your presence in misfortune would un-nerve me , Amine . ''
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 12]: `` It shall not ; it shall add to your resolution .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 7]: Let fate do its worst . ''
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 14]: `` Depend upon it , Amine , that will be ere long . ''
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 37]: `` Be it so , '' replied Amine ; `` but , Philip , it were as well you showed yourself on deck -- the men are frightened , and your absence will be observed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 20]: `` You are right , '' said Philip ; and rising and embracing her , he left the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 13]: `` It is but too true , then , '' thought Amine .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 14]: `` Now to prepare for disaster and death -- the warning has come .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 7]: I would I could know more .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 67]: mother , mother , look down upon thy child , and in a dream reveal the mystic arts which I have forgotten , then should I know more ; but I have promised Philip , that unless separated -- yes , that idea is worse than death , and I have a sad foreboding ; my courage fails me only when I think of that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 19]: Philip , on his return to the deck , found the crew of the vessel in great consternation .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 28]: Krantz himself appeared bewildered -- he had not forgotten the appearance of the Phantom Ship off Desolation Harbour , and the vessels following her to their destruction .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 34]: This second appearance , more awful than the former , quite unmanned him ; and when Philip came out of the cabin , he was leaning in gloomy silence against the weather bulkhead .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 23]: `` We shall never reach port again , sir , '' said he to Philip , as he came up to him .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 12]: `` Silence , silence ; the men may hear you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 14]: `` It matters not -- they think the same , '' replied Krantz .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 15]: `` But they are wrong , '' replied Philip , turning to the seamen .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 4]: `` My lads !
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 58]: that some disaster may happen to us , after the appearance of this vessel , is most probable ; I have seen her before more than once , and disasters did then happen ; but here I am alive and well , therefore it does not prove that we can not escape as I have before done .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 11]: We must do our best , and trust in Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 17]: The gale is breaking fast , and in a few hours we shall have fine weather .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 18]: I have met this Phantom Ship before , and care not how often I meet it again .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 21]: Mr Krantz , get up the spirits -- the men have had hard work , and must be fatigued . ''
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 51]: The very prospect of obtaining liquor , appeared to give courage to the men ; they hastened to obey the order , and the quantity served out was sufficient to give courage to the most fearful , and induce others to defy old Vanderdecken and his whole crew of imps .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 23]: The next morning the weather was fine , the sea smooth , and the _ Utrecht _ went gaily on her voyage .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 35]: Many days of gentle breezes and favouring winds gradually wore off the panic occasioned by the supernatural appearance , and if not forgotten , it was referred to either in jest or with indifference .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 16]: They now had run through the Straits of Malacca , and entered the Polynesian Archipelago .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 24]: Philip 's orders were to refresh and call for instructions at the small island of Boton , then in possession of the Dutch .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 32]: They arrived there in safety , and after remaining two days , again sailed on their voyage , intending to make their passage between the Celebes and the island of Galago .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 79]: The weather was still clear and the wind light : they proceeded cautiously , on account of the reefs and currents , and with a careful watch for the piratical vessels , which have for centuries infested those seas ; but they were not molested , and had gained well up among the islands to the north of Galago , when it fell calm , and the vessel was borne to the eastward of it by the current .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 32]: The calm lasted several days , and they could procure no anchorage ; at last they found themselves among the cluster of islands near to the northern coast of New Guinea .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 83]: The anchor was dropped , and the sails furled for the night ; a drizzling small rain came on , the weather was thick , and watches were stationed in every part of the ship , that they might not be surprised by the pirate proas , for the current ran past the ship , at the rate of eight or nine miles per hour , and these vessels , if hid among the islands , might sweep down upon them unperceived .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 40]: It was twelve o'clock at night when Philip , who was in bed , was awakened by a shock ; he thought it might be a proa running alongside , and he started from his bed and ran out .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 28]: He found Krantz , who had been awakened by the same cause , running up undressed -- another shock succeeded , and the ship careened to port .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 10]: Philip then knew that the ship was on shore .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 85]: The thickness of the night prevented them from ascertaining where they were , but the lead was thrown over the side , and they found that they were lying on shore on a sand bank , with not more than fourteen feet water on the deepest side , and that they were broadside on , with a strong current pressing them further up on the bank ; indeed the current ran like a mill-race , and each minute they were swept into shallower water .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 44]: On examination they found that the ship had dragged her anchor , which , with the cable , was still taut from the starboard bow , but this did not appear to prevent the vessel from being swept further up on the bank .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 19]: It was supposed that the anchor had parted at the shank , and another anchor was let go .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 18]: Nothing more could be done till daybreak , and impatiently did they wait till the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 42]: As the sun rose , the mist cleared away , and they discovered that they were on shore on a sand bank , a small portion of which was above water , and round which the current ran with great impetuosity .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 24]: About three miles from them was a cluster of small islands with cocoa-trees growing on them , but with no appearance of inhabitants .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 14]: `` I fear we have little chance , '' observed Krantz to Philip .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 37]: `` If we lighten the vessel the anchor may not hold , and we shall be swept further on , and it is impossible to lay out an anchor against the force of this current . ''
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 19]: `` At all events we must try ; but I grant that our situation is anything but satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 7]: Send all the hands aft . ''
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 9]: The men came aft , gloomy and dispirited .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 5]: `` My lads ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 10]: said Philip , `` why are you disheartened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 15]: `` We are doomed , sir ; we knew it would be so . ''
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 61]: `` I thought it probable that the ship would be lost -- I told you so ; but the loss of the ship does not involve that of the ship 's company -- nay , it does not follow that the ship is to be lost , although she may be in great difficulty , as she is at present .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 10]: What fear is there for us , my men ?
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 41]: -- the water is smooth -- we have plenty of time before us -- we can make a raft and take to our boats -- it never blows among these islands , and we have land close under our lee .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 25]: Let us first try what we can do with the ship ; if we fail , we must then take care of ourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 66]: The men caught at the idea and went to work willingly ; the water casks were started , the pumps set going , and everything that could be spared was thrown over to lighten the ship ; but the anchor still dragged from the strength of the current and bad holding-ground ; and Philip and Krantz perceived that they were swept further on the bank .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 41]: Night came on before they quitted their toil , and then a fresh breeze sprung up and created a swell , which occasioned the vessel to beat on the hard sand ; thus did they continue until the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 35]: At daylight the men resumed their labours , and the pumps were again manned to clear the vessel of the water which had been started , but after a time they pumped up sand .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 74]: This told them that a plank had started , and that their labours were useless ; the men left their work , but Philip again encouraged them , and pointed out that they could easily save themselves , and all that they had to do was to construct a raft , which would hold provisions for them , and receive that portion of the crew who could not be taken into the boats .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 39]: After some repose the men again set to work ; the topsails were struck , the yards lowered down , and the raft was commenced under the lee of the vessel , where the strong current was checked .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 76]: Philip , recollecting his former disaster , took great pains in the construction of this raft , and aware that as the water and provisions were expended there would be no occasion to tow so heavy a mass , he constructed it in two parts , which might easily be severed , and thus the boats would have less to tow , as soon as circumstances would enable them to part with one of them .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 23]: Night again terminated their labours , and the men retired to rest , the weather continuing fine , with very little wind .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 61]: By noon the next day the raft was complete ; water and provisions were safely stowed on board ; a secure and dry place was fitted up for Amine in the centre of one portion ; spare ropes , sails , and everything which could prove useful , in case of their being forced on shore , were put in .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 53]: Muskets and ammunition were also provided , and everything was ready , when the men came aft and pointed out to Philip that there was plenty of money on board , which it was folly to leave , and that they wished to carry as much as they could away with them .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 61]: As this intimation was given in a way that made it evident they intended that it should be complied with , Philip did not refuse ; but resolved , in his own mind , that when they arrived at a place where he could exercise his authority , the money should be reclaimed for the Company to whom it belonged .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 47]: The men went down below , and while Philip was making arrangements with Amine , handed the casks of dollars out of the hold , broke them open and helped themselves -- quarrelling with each other for the first possession , as each cask was opened .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 36]: At last every man had obtained as much as he could carry , and had placed his spoil on the raft with his baggage , or in the boat to which he had been appointed .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 61]: All was now ready -- Amine was lowered down , and took her station -- the boats took in tow the raft , which was cast off from the vessel , and away they went with the current , pulling with all their strength , to avoid being stranded upon that part of the sand bank which appeared above water .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 18]: This was the great danger which they had to encounter , and which they very narrowly escaped .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 44]: They numbered eighty-six souls in all : in the boats there were thirty-two ; the rest were on the raft , which being well-built and full of timber , floated high out of the water , now that the sea was so smooth .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 75]: It had been agreed upon by Philip and Krantz , that one of them should remain on the raft and the other in one of the boats ; but , at the time the raft quitted the ship , they were both on the raft , as they wished to consult , as soon as they discovered the direction of the current , which would be the most advisable course for them to pursue .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 23]: It appeared that as soon as the current had passed the bank , it took a more southerly direction towards New Guinea .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 30]: It was then debated between them whether they should or should not land on that island , the natives of which were known to be pusillanimous , yet treacherous .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 27]: A long debate ensued , which ended , however , in their resolving not to decide as yet , but wait and see what might occur .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 23]: In the meantime , the boats pulled to the westward , while the current set them fast down in a southerly direction .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 42]: Night came on , and the boats dropped the grapnels , with which they had been provided ; and Philip was glad to find that the current was not near so strong , and the grapnels held both boats and raft .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 27]: Covering themselves up with the spare sails with which they had provided themselves , and setting a watch , the tired seamen were soon fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 13]: `` Had I not better remain in one of the boats ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 3]: observed Krantz .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 16]: `` Suppose , to save themselves , the boats were to leave the raft . ''
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 37]: `` I have thought of that , '' replied Philip , `` and have , therefore , not allowed any provisions or water in the boats ; they will not leave us for that reason . ''
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 9]: `` True , I had forgotten that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 17]: Krantz remained on watch , and Philip retired to the repose which he so much needed .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 7]: Amine met him with open arms .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 21]: `` I have no fear , Philip , '' said she , `` I rather like this wild adventurous change .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 33]: We will go on shore and build our hut beneath the cocoa-trees , and I shall repine when the day comes which brings succour , and releases us from our desert isle .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 8]: What do I require but you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 21]: `` We are in the hands of One above , dear , who will act with us as He pleases .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 15]: We have to be thankful that it is no worse , '' replied Philip .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 16]: `` But now to rest , for I shall soon be obliged to watch . ''
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 75]: The morning dawned , with a smooth sea and a bright blue sky ; the raft had been borne to leeward of the cluster of uninhabited islands of which we spoke , and was now without hopes of reaching them ; but to the westward were to be seen on the horizon the refracted heads and trunks of cocoa-nut trees , and in that direction it was resolved that they should tow the raft .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 37]: The breakfast had been served out , and the men had taken to the oars , when they discovered a proa , full of men , sweeping after them from one of the islands to windward .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 34]: That it was a pirate vessel there could be no doubt ; but Philip and Krantz considered that their force was more than sufficient to repel them , should an attack be made .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 53]: This was pointed out to the men ; arms were distributed to all in the boats , as well as to those on the raft ; and that the seamen might not be fatigued , they were ordered to lie on their oars , and await the coming up of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 34]: As soon as the pirate was within range , having reconnoitred her antagonists , she ceased pulling and commenced firing from a small piece of cannon , which was mounted on her bows .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 32]: The grape and langridge which she poured upon them wounded several of the men , although Philip had ordered them to lie down flat on the raft and in the boats .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 26]: The pirate advanced nearer , and her fire became more destructive , without any opportunity of returning it by the _ Utrecht 's _ people .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 21]: At last it was proposed , as the only chance of escape , that the boats should attack the pirate .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 32]: This was agreed to by Philip -- more men were sent in the boats -- Krantz took the command -- the raft was cast off , and the boats pulled away .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 27]: But scarcely had they cleared the raft , when , as by one sudden thought , they turned round and pulled away in the opposite direction .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 34]: Krantz 's voice was heard by Philip , and his sword was seen to flash through the air -- a moment afterwards he plunged into the sea , and swam to the raft .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 35]: It appeared that the people in the boats , anxious to preserve the money which they had possession of , had agreed among themselves to pull away and leave the raft to its fate .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 31]: The proposal for attacking the pirate had been suggested with that view , and as soon as they were clear of the raft , they put their intentions into execution .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 33]: In vain had Krantz expostulated and threatened ; they would have taken his life ; and when he found that his efforts were of no avail , he leaped from the boat .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 13]: `` Then are we lost , I fear , '' said Philip .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 17]: `` Our numbers are so reduced , that we can not hope to hold out long .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 7]: What think you , Schriften ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 12]: ventured Philip , addressing the pilot who stood near to him .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 14]: `` Lost -- but not lost by the pirates -- no harm there .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 2]: He !
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 3]: he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 7]: The remark of Schriften was correct .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 36]: The pirates , imagining that in taking to their boat , the people had carried with them everything that was valuable , instead of firing at the raft , immediately gave chase to the boats .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 74]: The sweeps were now out , and the proa flew over the smooth water like a sea-bird , passed the raft , and was at first evidently gaining on the boats ; but their speed soon slackened , and as the day passed , the boats , and then the pirate vessel disappeared in the southward ; the distance between them being apparently much the same as at the commencement of the chase .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 53]: The raft being now at the mercy of the winds and waves , Philip and Krantz collected the carpenter 's tools which had been brought from the ship , and selecting two spars from the raft , they made every preparation for stepping a mast and setting sail by the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 28]: The morning dawned , and the first objects that met their view , were the boats pulling back towards the raft , followed closely by the pirate .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 15]: The men had pulled the whole night , and were worn out with fatigue .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 66]: It was presumed that a consultation had been held , in which it was agreed that they should make a sweep , so as to return to the raft ; as , if they gained it , they would be able to defend themselves , and moreover , obtain provisions and water , which they had not on board at the time of their desertion .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 33]: But it was fated otherwise ; gradually the men dropped from their oars , exhausted , into the bottom of the boat , and the pirate vessel followed them with renewed ardour .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 31]: The boats were captured one by one ; the booty found was more than the pirates anticipated , and it hardly need be said that not one man was spared .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 31]: All this took place within three miles of the raft , and Philip anticipated that the next movement of the vessel would be towards them , but he was mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 38]: Satisfied with their booty , and imagining that there could be no more on the raft , the pirate pulled away to the eastward , towards the islands from amongst which she had first made her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 38]: Thus were those who expected to escape and who had deserted their companions , deservedly punished , whilst those who anticipated every disaster from this desertion , discovered that it was the cause of their being saved .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 38]: The remaining people on board the raft amounted to about forty-five ; Philip , Krantz , Schriften , Amine , the two mates , sixteen seamen , and twenty-four soldiers , who had been embarked at Amsterdam .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 33]: Of provisions they had sufficient for three or four weeks , but of water they were very short , already not having sufficient for more than three days at the usual allowance .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 71]: As soon as the mast had been stepped and rigged , and the sails set -LRB- although there was hardly a breath of wind -RRB- , Philip explained to the men the necessity of reducing the quantity of water , and it was agreed that it should be served out so as to extend the supply to twelve days , the allowance being reduced to half a pint per day .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 106]: There was a debate at this time , as the raft was in two parts , whether it would not be better to cast off the smaller one and put all the people on board the other ; but this proposal was overruled , as in the first place , although the boats had deserted them , the number on the raft had not much diminished , and moreover , the raft would steer much better under sail , now that it had length , than it would do if they reduced its dimensions and altered its shape to a square mass of floating wood .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 37]: For three days it was a calm , the sun poured down his hot beams upon them , and the want of water was severely felt ; those who continued to drink spirits suffered the most .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 52]: On the fourth day the breeze sprung up favourably , and the sail was filled ; it was a relief to their burning brows and blistered backs ; and as the raft sailed on at the rate of four miles an hour , the men were gay and full of hope .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 32]: The land below the cocoa-nut trees was now distinguishable , and they anticipated that the next day they could land and procure the water , which they now so craved for .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 61]: All night they carried sail , but the next morning they discovered that the current was strong against them , and that what they gained when the breeze was fresh , they lost from the adverse current as soon as it went down ; the breeze was always fresh in the morning , but it fell calm in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 35]: Thus did they continue for four days more , every noon being not ten miles from the land but the next morning swept away to a distance , and having their ground to retrace .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 24]: Eight days had now passed , and the men , worn out with exposure to the burning sun , became discontented and mutinous .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 44]: At one time they insisted that the raft should be divided , that they might gain the land with the other half ; at another , that the provisions which they could no longer eat should be thrown overboard to lighten the raft .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 34]: The difficulty under which they lay , was the having no anchor or grapnel to the raft , the boats having carried away with them all that had been taken from the ship .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 86]: Philip then proposed to the men , that , as every one of them had such a quantity of dollars , the money should be sewed up in canvas bags , each man 's property separate ; and that with this weight to the ropes they would probably be enabled to hold the raft against the current for one night , when they would be able the next day to gain the shore ; but this was refused -- they would not risk their money .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 6]: No , no -- fools !
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 15]: they would sooner part with their lives by the most miserable of all deaths .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 17]: Again and again was this proposed to them by Philip and Krantz , but without success .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 27]: In the meantime , Amine had kept up her courage and her spirits ; proving to Philip a valuable adviser and a comforter in his misfortunes .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 60]: `` Cheer up , Philip , '' would she say ; `` we shall yet build our cottage under the shade of those cocoa-nut trees , and pass a portion , if not the remainder of our lives in peace ; for who indeed is there who would think to find us in these desolate and untrodden regions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 16]: Schriften was quiet and well-behaved ; talked much with Amine , but with nobody else .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 19]: Indeed he appeared to have a stronger feeling in favour of Amine than he had ever shown before .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 43]: He watched over her and attended her ; and Amine would often look up after being silent , and perceived Schriften 's face wear an air of pity and melancholy , which she had believed it impossible that he could have exhibited .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 27]: Another day passed ; again they neared the land , and again did the breeze die away , and they were swept back by the current .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 62]: The men now rose , and in spite of the endeavours of Philip and Krantz , they rolled into the sea all the provisions and stores , everything but one cask of spirits and the remaining stock of water ; they then sat down at the upper end of the raft with gloomy , threatening looks , and in close consultation .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 11]: Another night closed in : Philip was full of anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 58]: Again he urged them to anchor with their money , but in vain ; they ordered him away , and he returned to the after part of the raft , upon which Amine 's secure retreat had been erected ; he leant on it in deep thought and melancholy , for he imagined that Amine was asleep .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 8]: `` What disturbs you , Philip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 5]: `` What disturbs me ?
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 8]: The avarice and folly of these men .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 11]: They will die , rather than risk their hateful money .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 15]: They have the means of saving themselves and us , and they will not .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 30]: There is weight enough in bullion on the fore part of the raft to hold a dozen floating masses such as this , yet they will not risk it .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 5]: Cursed love of gold !
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 9]: it makes men fools , madmen , villains .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 18]: We have now but two days ' water -- doled out as it is drop by drop .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 36]: Look at their emaciated , broken down , wasted forms , and yet see how they cling to money , which probably they will never have occasion for , even if they gain the land .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 5]: I am distracted ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 50]: `` You suffer , Philip , you suffer from privation ; but I have been careful , I thought that this would come ; I have saved both water and biscuit -- I have here four bottles ; -- drink , Philip , and it will relieve you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 20]: Philip drank ; it did relieve him , for the excitement of the day had pressed heavily on him .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 9]: `` Thanks , Amine -- thanks , dearest !
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 5]: I feel better now .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 4]: -- Good Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 28]: are there such fools as to value the dross of metal above one drop of water in a time of suffering and privation such as this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 32]: The night closed in as before ; the stars shone bright but there was no moon , Philip had risen at midnight to relieve Krantz from the steerage of the raft .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 23]: Usually the men had lain about in every part of the raft , but this night the majority of them remained forward .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 28]: Philip was communing with his own bitter thoughts , when he heard a scuffle forward , and the voice of Krantz crying out to him for help .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 24]: He quitted the helm , and seizing his cutlass ran forward , where he found Krantz down , and the men securing him .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 14]: He fought his way to him , but was himself seized and disarmed .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 52]: `` Cut away -- cut away , '' was called out by those who held him ; and , in a few seconds , Philip had the misery to behold the after part of the raft , with Amine upon it , drifted apart from the one on which he stood .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 6]: `` For mercy 's sake !
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 14]: my wife -- my Amine -- for Heaven 's sake save her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 10]: cried Philip , struggling in vain to disengage himself .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 33]: Amine also , who had run to the side of the raft , held out her arms -- it was in vain -- they were separated more than a cable 's length .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 17]: Philip made one more desperate struggle , and then fell down deprived of sense and motion .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 55]: Chapter XXIV It was not until the day had dawned that Philip opened his eyes , and discovered Krantz kneeling at his side ; at first his thoughts were scattered and confused ; he felt that some dreadful calamity had happened to him , but he could not recall to mind what it was .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 16]: At last it rushed upon him , and he buried his face in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 32]: `` Take comfort , '' said Krantz ; `` we shall probably gain the shore to-day , and we will go in search of her as soon as we can . ''
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 107]: `` This , then , is the separation and the cruel death to her which that wretch Schriften prophesied to us , '' thought Philip ; `` cruel indeed to waste away to a skeleton , under a burning sun , without one drop of water left to cool her parched tongue ; at the mercy of the winds and waves ; drifting about -- alone -- all alone -- separated from her husband , in whose arms she would have died without regret ; maddened with suspense and with the thoughts of what I may be suffering , or what may have been my fate .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 20]: Pilot , you are right ; there can be no more cruel death to a fond and doting wife .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 4]: my head reels .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 10]: What has Philip Vanderdecken to live for now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 14]: Krantz offered such consolation as his friendship could suggest , but in vain .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 12]: He then talked of revenge , and Philip raised his head .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 11]: After a few minutes ' thought , he rose up .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 10]: `` Yes , '' replied he , `` revenge !
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 8]: -- revenge upon those dastards and traitors !
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 12]: Tell me , Krantz , how many can we trust ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 13]: `` Half of the men , I should think , at least .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 6]: It was a surprise . ''
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 25]: A spar had been fitted as a rudder , and the raft had now gained nearer the shore than it ever had done before .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 41]: The men were in high spirits at the prospect , and every man was sitting on his own store of dollars , which , in their eyes , increased in value , in proportion as did their prospect of escape .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 40]: Philip discovered from Krantz , that it was the soldiers and the most indifferent seamen who had mutinied on the night before , and cut away the other raft ; and that all the best men had remained neuter .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 38]: `` And so they will be now , I imagine , '' continued Krantz ; `` the prospect of gaining the shore has , in a manner , reconciled them to the treachery of their companions . ''
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 21]: `` Probably , '' replied Philip , with a bitter laugh ; `` but I know what will rouse them .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 7]: Send them here to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 14]: Philip talked to the seamen , whom Krantz had sent over to him .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 126]: He pointed out to them that the other men were traitors , not to be relied upon ; that they would sacrifice everything and everybody for their own gain ; that they had already done so for money , and that they themselves would have no security , either on the raft or on shore , with such people ; that they dare not sleep for fear of having their throats cut , and that it were better at once to get rid of those who could not be true to each other ; that it would facilitate their escape , and that they could divide between themselves the money which the others had secured , and by which they would double their own shares .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 69]: That it had been his intention , although he had said nothing , to enforce the restoration of the money for the benefit of the Company , as soon as they had gained a civilised port , where the authorities could interfere ; but that , if they consented to join and aid him , he would now give them the whole of it for their own use .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 9]: What will not the desire of gain effect ?
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 41]: Is it , therefore , to be wondered at , that these men , who were indeed but little better than those who were thus , in his desire of retaliation , denounced by Philip , consented to his proposal ?
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 28]: It was agreed , that if they did not gain the shore , the others should be attacked that very night , and tossed into the sea .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 29]: But the consultation with Philip had put the other party on the alert ; they , too , held council , and kept their arms by their sides .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 25]: As the breeze died away , they were not two miles from the land , and once more they drifted back into the ocean .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 50]: Philip 's mind was borne down with grief at the loss of Amine ; but it recovered to a certain degree when he thought of revenge : that feeling stayed him up , and he often felt the edge of his cutlass , impatient for the moment of retribution .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 52]: It was a lovely night ; the sea was now smooth as glass , and not a breath of air moved in the heavens ; the sail of the raft hung listless down the mast , and was reflected upon the calm surface by the brilliancy of the starry night alone .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 44]: It was a night for contemplation -- for examination of oneself , and adoration of the Deity ; and here , on a frail raft , were huddled together more than forty beings ready for combat , for murder , and for spoil .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 24]: Each party pretended to repose ; yet each were quietly watching the motions of the other , with their hands upon their weapons .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 40]: The signal was to be given by Philip : it was , to let go the halyards of the yard , so that the sail should fall down upon a portion of the other party , and entangle them .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 18]: By Philip 's directions , Schriften had taken the helm , and Krantz remained by his side .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 35]: The yard and sail fell clattering down , and then the work of death commenced ; there was no parley , no suspense ; each man started upon his feet and raised his sword .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 19]: The voices of Philip and of Krantz alone were heard , and Philip 's sword did its work .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 23]: He was nerved to his revenge , and never could be satiated as long as one remained who had sacrificed his Amine .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 27]: As Philip had expected , many had been covered up and entangled by the falling of the sail , and their work was thereby made easier .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 28]: Some fell where they stood ; others reeled back , and sunk down under the smooth water ; others were pierced as they floundered under the canvas .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 12]: In a few minutes , the work of carnage was complete .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 21]: Schriften meanwhile looked on , and ever and anon gave vent to his chuckling laugh -- his demoniacal `` He !
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 3]: he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 16]: The strife was over , and Philip stood against the mast to recover his breath .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 19]: `` So far art thou revenged , my Amine , '' thought he ; `` but , oh !
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 10]: what are these paltry lives compared to thine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 45]: And now that his revenge was satiated , and he could do no more , he covered his face up in his hands , and wept bitterly , while those who had assisted him were already collecting the money of the slain for distribution .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 35]: These men , when they found that three only of their side had fallen , lamented that there had not been more , as their own shares of the dollars would have been increased .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 18]: There were now but thirteen men besides Philip , Krantz , and Schriften left upon the raft .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 33]: As the day dawned , the breeze again sprung up , and they shared out the portions of water , which would have been the allowance of their companions who had fallen .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 12]: Hunger they felt not ; but the water revived their spirits .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 36]: Although Philip had had little to say to Schriften since the separation from Amine , it was very evident to him and to Krantz , that all the pilot 's former bitter feelings had returned .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 10]: His chuckle , his sarcasms , his `` He !
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 3]: he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 21]: were incessant ; and his eye was now as maliciously directed to Philip as it was when they first met .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 32]: It was evident that Amine alone had for the time conquered his disposition ; and that , with her disappearance , had vanished all the good-will of Schriften towards her husband .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 34]: For this Philip cared little ; he had a much more serious weight on his heart -- the loss of his dear Amine ; and he felt reckless and indifferent concerning anything else .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 48]: The breeze now freshened , and they expected that , in two hours , they would run on the beach , but they were disappointed : the step of the mast gave way from the force of the wind , and the sail fell upon the raft .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 29]: This occasioned great delay ; and before they could repair the mischief , the wind again subsided , and they were left about a mile from the beach .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 25]: Tired and worn out with his feelings , Philip at last fell asleep by the side of Krantz , leaving Schriften at the helm .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 55]: He slept soundly -- he dreamt of Amine -- he thought she was under a grove of cocoa-nuts in a sweet sleep ; that he stood by and watched her , and that she smiled in her sleep , and murmured `` Philip , '' when suddenly he was awakened by some unusual movement .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 54]: Half-dreaming still , he thought that Schriften , the pilot , had in his sleep been attempting to gain his relic , had passed the chain over his head , and was removing quietly from underneath his neck the portion of the chain which , in his reclining posture , he lay upon .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 44]: Startled at the idea , he threw up his hand to seize the arm of the wretch , and found that he had really seized hold of Schriften , who was kneeling by him , and in possession of the chain and relic .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 31]: The struggle was short , the relic was recovered , and the pilot lay at the mercy of Philip , who held him down with his knee on his chest .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 37]: Philip replaced the relic on his bosom , and , excited to madness , rose from the body of the now breathless Schriften , caught it in his arms , and hurled it into the sea .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 5]: `` Man or devil !
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 20]: I care not which , '' exclaimed Philip , breathless ; `` escape now , if you can ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 24]: The struggle had already roused up Krantz and others , but not in time to prevent Philip from wreaking his vengeance upon Schriften .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 40]: In few words , he told Krantz what had passed ; as for the men , they cared not ; they laid their heads down again , and , satisfied that their money was safe , inquired no further .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 33]: Philip watched to see if Schriften would rise up again , and try to regain the raft ; but he did not make his appearance above water , and Philip felt satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 27]: Chapter XXV What pen could portray the feelings of the fond and doting Amine , when she first discovered that she was separated from her husband ?
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 18]: In a state of bewilderment , she watched the other raft as the distance between them increased .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 21]: At last the shades of night hid it from her aching eyes , and she dropped down in mute despair .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 18]: Gradually she recovered herself , and turning round , she exclaimed , `` Who 's here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 3]: No answer .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 6]: `` Who 's here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 16]: cried she in a louder voice ; `` alone -- alone -- and Philip gone .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 12]: Mother , mother , look down upon your unhappy child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 30]: and Amine frantically threw herself down so near to the edge of the raft , that her long hair , which had fallen down , floated on the wave .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 4]: `` Ah me !
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 5]: where am I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 14]: cried Amine , after remaining in a state of torpor for some hours .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 45]: The sun glared fiercely upon her , and dazzled her eyes as she opened them -- she cast them on the blue wave close by her , and beheld a large shark motionless by the side of the raft , waiting for his prey .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 9]: Recoiling from the edge , she started up .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 17]: She turned round , and beheld the raft vacant , and the truth flashed on her .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 5]: Philip , Philip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 16]: cried she , `` then it is true , and you are gone for ever !
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 13]: I thought it was only a dream , I recollect all now .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 7]: Yes -- all -- all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 27]: And Amine sank down again upon her cot , which had been placed in the centre of the raft , and remained motionless for some time .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 18]: But the demand for water became imperious ; she seized one of the bottles , and drank .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 9]: `` Yet why should I drink or eat ?
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 9]: Why should I wish to preserve life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 17]: She rose , and looked round the horizon -- `` Sky and water , nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 31]: Is this the death I am to die -- the cruel death prophesied by Schriften -- a lingering death under a burning sun , while my vitals are parched within ?
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 4]: Be it so !
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 24]: Fate I dare thee to thy worst -- we can die but once -- and without him , what care I to live !
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 18]: But yet I may see him again , '' continued Amine , hurriedly , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 6]: I may -- who knows ?
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 21]: Then welcome life , I 'll nurse thee for that bare hope -- bare indeed with nought to feed on .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 10]: Let me see , is it here still ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 15]: Amine looked at her zone , and perceived her dagger was still in it .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 27]: `` Well then , I will live since death is at my command , and be guardful of life for my dear husband 's sake . ''
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 13]: And Amine threw herself on her resting-place that she might forget everything .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 22]: She did : from that morning till the noon of the next day , she remained in a state of torpor .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 25]: When she again rose , she was faint ; again she looked round her -- there was but sky and water to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 7]: this solitude -- it is horrible !
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 21]: death would be a release -- but no , I must not die -- I must live for Philip . ''
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 20]: She refreshed herself with water and a few pieces of biscuit , and folded her arms across her breast .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 14]: `` A few more days without relief , and all must be over .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 16]: Was ever woman situated as I am , and yet I dare to indulge hope ?
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 6]: Why , 't is madness !
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 15]: And why am I thus singled out : because I have wedded with Philip ?
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 12]: It may be so ; if so , I welcome it .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 2]: Wretches !
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 21]: who thus severed me from my husband ; who , to save their own lives , sacrificed a helpless woman !
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 2]: Nay !
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 23]: they might have saved me , if they had had the least pity ; -- but no , they never felt it .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 5]: And these are Christians !
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 13]: The creed that the old priests would have had me -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 8]: that Philip would have had me embrace .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 4]: Charity and good-will !
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 14]: They talk of it , but I have never seen them practise it !
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 4]: Loving one another !
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 5]: -- forgiving one another !
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 10]: -- say rather hating and preying upon one another !
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 17]: A creed never practised : why , if not practised , of what value is it ?
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 22]: Any creed were better -- I abjure it , and if I be saved , will abjure it still for ever .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 5]: Shade of my mother !
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 74]: is it that I have listened to these men -- that I have , to win my husband 's love , tried to forget that which thou taughtest , even when a child at thy feet -- that faith which our forefathers for thousands of years lived and died in -- that creed proved by works , and obedience to the prophet 's will -- is it for this that I am punished ?
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 7]: Tell me , mother -- oh !
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 7]: tell me in my dreams . ''
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 28]: The night closed in , and with the gloom rose heavy clouds ; the lightning darted through the firmament , ever and anon lighting up the raft .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 52]: At last , the flashes were so rapid , not following each other -- but darting down from every quarter at once , that the whole firmament appeared as if on fire , and the thunder rolled along the heavens , now near and loud , then rumbling in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 31]: The breeze rose up fresh , and the waves tossed the raft , and washed occasionally even to Amine 's feet , as she stood in the centre of it .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 42]: `` I like this -- this is far better than that calm and withering heat -- this rouses me , '' said Amine , as she cast her eyes up , and watched the forked lightning till her vision became obscured .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 10]: `` Yes , this is as it should be .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 32]: Lightning , strike me if you please -- waves wash me off and bury me in a briny tomb -- pour the wrath of the whole elements upon this devoted head .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 14]: -- I care not , I laugh at , I defy it all .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 13]: Thou canst but kill , this little steel can do as much .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 37]: Let those who hoard up wealth -- those who live in splendour -- those that are happy -- those who have husbands , children , aught to love -- let them tremble , I have nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 2]: Elements !
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 17]: be ye fire , or water , or earth , or air , Amine defies you !
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 34]: And yet -- no , no , deceive not thyself , Amine , there is no hope ; thus will I mount my funeral bier , and wait the will of destiny . ''
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 32]: And Amine regained the secure place which Philip had fitted up for her in the centre of the raft , threw herself down upon her bed , and shut her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 35]: The thunder and lightning was followed up by torrents of heavy rain , which fell till daylight ; the wind still continued fresh , but the sky cleared , and the sun shone out .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 26]: Amine remained shivering in her wet garments ; the heat of the sun proved too powerful for her exhausted state , and her brain wandered .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 81]: She rose up in a sitting posture , looked around her , saw verdant fields in every direction , the cocoa-nuts waving to the wind -- imagined even that she saw her own Philip in the distance hastening to her ; she held out her arms ; strove to get up , and run to meet him , but her limbs refused their office ; she called to him , she screamed , and sank back exhausted on her resting-place .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 17]: Chapter XXVI We must for a time return to Philip , and follow his strange destiny .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 26]: A few hours after he had thrown the pilot into the sea they gained the shore , so long looked at with anxiety and suspense .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 32]: The spars of the raft , jerked by the running swell , undulated and rubbed against each other , as they rose and fell to the waves breaking on the beach .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 18]: The breeze was fresh , but the surf was trifling , and the landing was without difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 42]: The beach was shelving , of firm white sand , interspersed and strewed with various brilliant-coloured shells ; and here and there , the bleached fragments and bones of some animal which had been forced out of its element to die .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 80]: The island was , like all the others , covered with a thick wood of cocoa-nut trees , whose tops waved to the breeze , or bowed to the blast , producing a shade and a freshness which would have been duly appreciated by any other party than the present , with the exception only of Krantz ; for Philip thought of nothing but his lost wife , and the seamen thought of nothing but of their sudden wealth .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 48]: Krantz supported Philip to the beach and led him to the shade ; but after a minute he rose , and running down to the nearest point , looked anxiously for the portion of the raft which held Amine , which was now far , far away .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 26]: Krantz had followed , aware that , now the first paroxysms were past , there was no fear of Philip 's throwing away his life .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 8]: `` Gone , gone for ever ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 13]: exclaimed Philip , pressing his hands to the balls of his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 19]: `` Not so , Philip , the same Providence which has preserved us , will certainly assist her .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 29]: It is impossible that she can perish among so many islands , many of which are inhabited ; and a woman will be certain of kind treatment . ''
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 12]: `` If I could only think so , '' replied Philip .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 43]: `` A little reflection may induce you to think that it is rather an advantage than otherwise , that she is thus separated -- not from you , but from so many lawless companions , whose united force we could not resist .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 29]: Do you think that , after any lengthened sojourn on this island , these people with us would permit you to remain in quiet possession of your wife ?
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 29]: -- they would respect no laws ; and Amine has , in my opinion , been miraculously preserved from shame and ill-treatment , if not from death . ''
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 7]: `` They durst not , surely !
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 30]: Well , but Krantz , we must make a raft and follow her ; we must not remain here -- I will seek her through the wide world . ''
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 42]: `` Be it so , if you wish , Philip , and I will follow your fortunes , '' replied Krantz , glad to find that there was something , however wild the idea , for his mind to feed on .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 34]: `` But now let us return to the raft , seek the refreshment we so much require , and after that we will consider what may be the best plan to pursue . ''
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 25]: To this , Philip , who was much exhausted , tacitly consented , and he followed Krantz to where the raft had been beached .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 26]: The men had left it , and were each of them sitting apart from one another under the shade of his own chosen cocoa-nut tree .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 36]: The articles which had been saved on the raft had not been landed , and Krantz called upon them to come and carry the things on shore -- but no one would answer or obey .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 24]: They each sat watching their money , and afraid to leave it , lest they should be dispossessed of it by the others .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 57]: Now that their lives were , comparatively speaking , safe , the demon of avarice had taken full possession of their souls ; there they sat , exhausted , pining for water , and longing for sleep , and yet they dared not move -- they were fixed as if by the wand of the enchanter .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 46]: `` It is the cursed dollars which have turned their brains , '' observed Krantz to Philip ; `` let us try if we can not manage to remove what we most stand in need of , and then we will search for water . ''
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 66]: Philip and Krantz collected the carpenter 's tools , the best arms , and all the ammunition , as the possession of the latter would give them advantage in case of necessity ; they then dragged on shore the sail and some small spars , all of which they carried up to a clump of cocoa-nut trees , about a hundred yards from the beach .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 77]: In half an hour they had erected an humble tent , and put into it what they had brought with them , with the exception of the major part of the ammunition , which , as soon as he was screened by the tent , Krantz buried in a heap of dry sand behind it ; he then , for their immediate wants , cut down with an axe a small cocoa-nut tree in full bearing .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 41]: It must be for those who have suffered the agony of prolonged thirst , to know the extreme pleasure with which the milk of the nuts were one after the other poured down the parched throats of Krantz and Philip .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 13]: The men witnessed their enjoyment in silence , and with gloating eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 50]: Every time that a fresh cocoa-nut was seized and its contents quaffed by their officers , more sharp and agonising was their own devouring thirst -- still closer did their dry lips glue themselves together -- yet they moved not , although they felt the tortures of the condemned .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 34]: Evening closed in ; Philip had thrown himself down on the spare sails , and had fallen asleep , when Krantz set off to explore the island upon which they had been thrown .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 23]: It was small , not exceeding three miles in length , and at no one part more than five hundred yards across .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 25]: Water there was none , unless it were to be obtained by digging ; fortunately the young cocoa-nuts prevented the absolute necessity for it .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 13]: On his return , Krantz passed the men in their respective stations .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 27]: Each was awake , and raised himself on his elbow to ascertain if it were an assailant ; but perceiving Krantz , they again dropped down .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 32]: Krantz passed the raft -- the water was now quite smooth , for the wind had shifted off shore , and the spars which composed the raft hardly jostled each other .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 42]: He stepped upon it , and , as the moon was bright in the heavens , he took the precaution of collecting all the arms which had been left , and throwing them as far as he could into the sea .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 27]: He then walked to the tent , where he found Philip still sleeping soundly , and in a few minutes he was reposing by his side .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 36]: And Philip 's dreams were of Amine ; he thought that he saw the hated Schriften rise again from the waters , and , climbing up to the raft , seat himself by her side .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 24]: He thought that he again heard his unearthly chuckle and his scornful laugh , as his unwelcome words fell upon her distracted ears .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 27]: He thought that she fled into the sea to avoid Schriften , and that the waters appeared to reject her -- she floated on the surface .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 18]: The storm rose , and once more he beheld her in the sea-shell skimming over the waves .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 52]: Again , she was in a furious surf on the beach , and her shell sank , and she was buried in the waves ; and then he saw her walking on shore without fear and without harm , for the water which spared no one , appeared to spare her .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 43]: Philip tried to join her , but was prevented by some unknown power , and Amine waved her hand and said , `` We shall meet again , Philip ; yes , once more on this earth shall we meet again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 24]: The sun was high in the heavens and scorching in his heat , when Krantz first opened his eyes , and awakened Philip .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 11]: The axe again procured for them their morning 's meal .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 18]: Philip , was silent ; he was ruminating upon his dreams , which had afforded him consolation .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 7]: `` We shall meet again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 3]: thought he .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 12]: `` Yes , once more at least we shall meet again .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 2]: Providence !
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 5]: I thank thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 12]: Krantz then stepped out to ascertain the condition of the men .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 26]: He found them faint , and so exhausted , that they could not possibly survive much longer , yet still watching over their darling treasure .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 22]: It was melancholy to witness such perversion of intellect , and Krantz thought of a plan which might save their lives .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 65]: He proposed to them each separately , that they should bury their money so deep , that it was not to be recovered without time : this would prevent any one from attacking the treasure of the other , without its being perceived and the attempt frustrated , and would enable them to obtain their necessary food and refreshment without danger of being robbed .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 6]: To this plan they acceded .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 31]: Krantz brought out of the tent the only shovel in their possession , and they , one by one , buried their dollars many feet deep in the yielding sand .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 32]: When they had all secured their wealth , he brought them one of the axes , and the cocoa-nut trees fell , and they were restored to new life and vigour .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 33]: Having satiated themselves , they then lay down upon the several spots under which they had buried their dollars , and were soon enjoying that repose which they all so much needed .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 49]: Philip and Krantz had now many serious consultations as to the means which should be taken for quitting the island , and going in search of Amine ; for although Krantz thought the latter part of Philip 's proposal useless , he did not venture to say so .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 26]: To quit this island was necessary ; and provided they gained one of those which were inhabited , it was all that they could expect .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 39]: As for Amine , he considered that she was dead before this , either having been washed off the raft , or that her body was lying on it exposed to the decomposing heat of a torrid sun .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 37]: To cheer Philip , he expressed himself otherwise ; and whenever they talked about leaving the island , it was not to save their own lives , but invariably to search after Philip 's lost wife .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 49]: The plan which they proposed and acted upon was , to construct a light raft , the centre to be composed of three water-casks , sawed in half , in a row behind each other , firmly fixed by cross pieces to two long spars on each side .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 25]: This , under sail , would move quickly through the water , and be manageable so as to enable them to steer a course .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 43]: The outside spars had been selected and hauled on shore , and the work was already in progress ; but they were left alone in their work , for the seamen appeared to have no idea at present of quitting the island .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 23]: Restored by food and repose , they were not content with the money which they had -- they were anxious for more .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 38]: A portion of each party 's wealth had been dug up , and they now gambled all day with pebbles , which they had collected on the beach , and with which they had invented a game .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 63]: Another evil had crept among them : they had cut steps in the largest cocoa-nut trees , and with the activity of seamen had mounted them , and by tapping the top of the trees , and fixing empty cocoa-nuts underneath , had obtained the liquor , which in its first fermentation is termed toddy , and is afterwards distilled into arrack .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 33]: But as toddy , it is quite sufficient to intoxicate ; and every day the scenes of violence and intoxication , accompanied with oaths and execrations , became more and more dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 45]: The losers tore their hair , and rushed like madmen upon those who had gained their dollars ; but Krantz had fortunately thrown their weapons into the sea , and those he had saved , as well as the ammunition , he had secreted .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 38]: Blows and bloodshed , therefore , were continual , but loss of life there was none , as the contending parties were separated by the others , who were anxious that the play should not be interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 23]: Such had been the state of affairs for now nearly a fortnight , while the work of the raft had slowly proceeded .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 38]: Some of the men had lost their all , and had , by the general consent of those who had won their wealth , been banished to a certain distance that they might not pilfer from them .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 29]: These walked gloomily round the island , or on the beach , seeking some instrument by which they might avenge themselves , and obtain repossession of their money .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 23]: Krantz and Philip had proposed to these men to join them , and leave the island , but they had sullenly refused .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 10]: The axe was now never parted with by Krantz .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 27]: He cut down what cocoa-nut trees they required for subsistence , and prevented the men from notching more trees , to procure the means of inebriation .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 25]: On the sixteenth day , all the money had passed into the hands of three men who had been more fortunate than the rest .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 48]: The losers were now by far the more numerous party , and the consequence was , that the next morning these three men were found lying strangled on the beach ; the money had been redivided , and the gambling had recommenced with more vigour than ever .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 7]: `` How can this end ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 17]: exclaimed Philip to Krantz , as he looked upon the blackened countenances of the murdered men .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 11]: `` In the death of all , '' replied Krantz .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 7]: `` We can not prevent it .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 6]: It is a judgment . ''
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 45]: The raft was now ready ; the sand had been dug from beneath it , so as to allow the water to flow in and float it , and it was now made fast to a stake , and riding on the peaceful waters .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 38]: A large store of cocoa-nuts , old and young , had been procured and put on board of her , and it was the intention of Philip and Krantz to have quitted the island the next day .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 20]: Unfortunately , one of the men , when bathing , had perceived the arms lying in the shallow water .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 21]: He had dived down and procured a cutlass ; others had followed his example , and all had armed themselves .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 40]: This induced Philip and Krantz to sleep on board of the raft , and keep watch ; and that night , as the play was going on , a heavy loss on one side ended in a general fray .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 15]: The combat was furious , for all were more or less excited by intoxication .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 12]: The result was melancholy , for only three were left alive .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 40]: Philip , with Krantz , watched the issue ; every man who fell wounded was put to the sword , and the three left , who had been fighting on the same side , rested panting on their weapons .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 30]: After a pause , two of them communicated with each other , and the result was an attack upon the third man , who fell dead beneath their blows .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 4]: `` Merciful Father !
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 6]: are these Thy creatures ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 3]: exclaimed Philip .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 11]: replied Krantz , `` they worshipped the devil as Mammon .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 31]: Do you imagine that those two , who could now divide more wealth than they could well spend if they return to their country , will consent to a division ?
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 2]: Never !
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 11]: -- they must have all -- yes , all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 32]: Krantz had hardly expressed his opinion , when one of the men , taking advantage of the other turning round a moment from him , passed his sword through his back .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 17]: The man fell with a groan , and the sword was again passed through his body .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 6]: `` Said I not so ?
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 29]: But the treacherous villain shall not reap his reward , '' continued Krantz , levelling the musket which he held in his hand , and shooting him dead .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 18]: `` You have done wrong , Krantz ; you have saved him from the punishment he deserved .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 38]: Left alone on the island , without the means of obtaining his subsistence , he must have perished miserably and by inches , with all his money round him -- that would have been torture indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 6]: `` Perhaps I was wrong .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 14]: If so , may Providence forgive me , I could not help it .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 14]: Let us go ashore , for we are now on this island alone .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 41]: We must collect the treasure and bury it , so that it may be recovered ; and , at the same time , take a portion with us -- for who knows but that we may have occasion for it .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 33]: To-morrow we had better remain here , for we shall have enough to do in burying the bodies of these infatuated men , and the wealth which has caused their destruction . ''
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 44]: Philip agreed to the propriety of the suggestion ; the next day they buried the bodies where they lay ; and the treasure was all collected in a deep trench , under a cocoa-nut tree , which they carefully marked with their axe .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 35]: About five hundred pieces of gold were selected and taken on board of the raft , with the intention of secreting them about their persons , and resorting to them in case of need .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 12]: The following morning they hoisted their sail and quitted the island .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 10]: Need it be said in what direction they steered ?
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 21]: As may be well imagined , in that quarter where they had last seen the raft with the isolated Amine .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 31]: Chapter XXVII The raft was found to answer well ; and although her progress through the water was not very rapid , she obeyed the helm and was under command .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 29]: Both Philip and Krantz were very careful in taking such marks and observations of the island as should enable them , if necessary , to find it again .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 30]: With the current to assist them , they now proceeded rapidly to the southward , in order that they might examine a large island which lay in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 74]: Their object , after seeking for Amine , was to find out the direction of Ternate ; the king of which they knew to be at variance with the Portuguese , who had a fort and factory at Tidore , not very far distant from it ; and from thence to obtain a passage in one of the Chinese junks , which , on their way to Bantam , called at that island .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 20]: Towards evening they had neared the large island , and they soon ran down it close to the beach .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 38]: Philip 's eyes wandered in every direction to ascertain whether anything on the shore indicated the presence of Amine 's raft , but he could perceive nothing of the kind , nor did he see any inhabitants .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 51]: That they might not pass the object of their search during the night , they ran their raft on shore , in a small cove , where the waters were quite smooth , and remained there until the next morning , when they again made sail and prosecuted their voyage .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 43]: Krantz was steering with the long sweep they had fitted for the purpose , when he observed Philip , who had been for some time silent , take from his breast the relic which he wore , and gaze attentively upon it .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 9]: `` Is that your picture , Philip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 3]: observed Krantz .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 3]: `` Alas !
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 15]: No , it is my destiny , '' replied Philip , answering without reflection .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 4]: `` Your destiny !
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 5]: What mean you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 7]: `` Did I say my destiny ?
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 18]: I hardly know what I said , '' replied Philip , replacing the relic in his bosom .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 27]: `` I rather think you said more than you intended , '' replied Krantz , `` but at the same time , something near the truth .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 34]: I have often perceived you with that trinket in your hand , and I have not forgotten how anxious Schriften was to obtain it , and the consequences of his attempt upon it .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 12]: Is there not some secret -- some mystery attached to it ?
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 24]: Surely , if so , you must now sufficiently know me as your friend , to feel me worthy of your confidence . ''
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 56]: `` That you are my friend , Krantz , I feel -- my sincere and much valued friend , for we have shared much danger together , and that is sufficient to make us friends -- that I could trust you , I believe , but I feel as if I dare not trust anyone .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 31]: There is a mystery attached to this relic -LRB- for a relic it is -RRB- , which as yet has been confided to my wife and holy men alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 25]: `` And if trusted to holy men , surely it may be trusted to sincere friendship , than which nothing is more holy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 18]: `` But I have a presentiment that the knowledge of my secret would prove fatal to you .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 31]: Why I feel such a presentiment I know not ; but I feel it , Krantz ; and I can not afford to lose you , my valued friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 20]: `` You will not , then , make use of my friendship , it appears , '' replied Krantz .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 42]: `` I have risked my life with you before now , and I am not to be deterred from the duties of friendship by a childish foreboding on your part , the result of an agitated mind and a weakened body .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 39]: Can anything be more absurd than to suppose , that a secret confided to me can be pregnant with danger , unless it be , indeed , that my zeal to assist you may lead me into difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 62]: I am not of a prying disposition ; but we have been so long connected together , and are now so isolated from the rest of the world , that it appears to me it would be a solace to you , were you to confide in one whom you can trust , what evidently has long preyed upon your mind .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 35]: The consolation and advice of a friend , Philip , are not to be despised , and you will feel relieved if able to talk over with him a subject which evidently oppresses you .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 19]: If , therefore , you value my friendship , let me share with you in your sorrows . ''
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 40]: There are few who have passed through life so quietly , as not to recollect how much grief has been assuaged by confiding its cause to , and listening to the counsels and consolations of , some dear friend .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 39]: It must not therefore appear surprising , that , situated as he was , and oppressed with the loss of Amine , Philip should regard Krantz as one to whom he might venture to confide his important secret .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 78]: He commenced his narrative with no injunctions , for he felt that if Krantz could not respect his secret for his secret 's sake , or from good-will towards him , he was not likely to be bound by any promise ; and as , during the day , the raft passed by the various small capes and headlands of the island , he poured into Krantz 's ear the history which the reader is acquainted with .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 20]: `` Now you know all , '' said Philip with a deep sigh , as the narrative was concluded .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 5]: `` What think you ?
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 29]: Do you credit my strange tale , or do you imagine , as some well would , that it is a mere phantom of a disordered brain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 34]: `` That it is not so , Philip , I believe , '' replied Krantz ; `` for I too have had ocular proof of the correctness of a part of your history .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 35]: Remember how often I have seen this Phantom Ship -- and if your father is permitted to range over the seas , why should you not be selected and permitted to reverse his doom ?
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 48]: I fully believe every word that you have told me , and since you have told me this , I can comprehend much that in your behaviour at times appeared unaccountable ; there are many who would pity you , Philip , but I envy you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 5]: `` Envy me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 3]: cried Philip .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 23]: envy you : and gladly would I take the burden of your doom on my own shoulders , were it only possible .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 134]: Is it not a splendid thought that you are summoned to so great a purpose , -- that instead of roaming through the world as we all do in pursuit of wealth , which possibly we may lose after years of cost and hardship , by the venture of a day , and which , at all events , we must leave behind us , -- you are selected to fulfil a great and glorious work -- the work of angels , I may say -- that of redeeming the soul of a father , _ suffering _ indeed , for his human frailties , but not doomed to perish for eternity ; you have , indeed , an object of pursuit worthy of all the hardships and dangers of a maritime life .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 10]: If it ends in your death , what then ?
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 14]: Where else end our futile cravings , our continual toil , after nothing ?
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 31]: We all must die -- but how few -- who indeed besides yourself -- was ever permitted before his death to ransom the soul of the author of his existence !
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 9]: Yes , Philip , I envy you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 8]: `` You think and speak like Amine .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 29]: She too is of a wild and ardent soul , that would mingle with the beings of the other world , and hold intelligence with disembodied spirits . ''
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 39]: `` She is right , '' replied Krantz ; `` there are events in my life , or rather connected with my family , which have often fully convinced me that this is not only possible but permitted .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 11]: Your story has only corroborated what I already believed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 3]: `` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 3]: Krantz ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 44]: `` Indeed , yes ; but of that hereafter : the night is closing in , we must again put our little bark in safety for the night , and there is a cove which I think appears suited for the purpose . ''
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 61]: Before morning , a strong breeze right on shore had sprung up , and the surf became so high as to endanger the raft ; to continue their course was impossible ; they could only haul up their raft to prevent its being dashed to pieces by the force of the waves , as the seas broke on the shore .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 33]: Philip 's thoughts were , as usual , upon Amine , and as he watched the tossing waters , as the sunbeams lightened up their crests , he exclaimed , `` Ocean !
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 5]: hast thou my Amine ?
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 8]: If so , give up thy dead !
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 5]: What is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 11]: continued he , pointing to a speck on the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 37]: `` The sail of a small craft of some description or another , '' replied Krantz ; `` and apparently coming down before the wind to shelter herself in the very nook we have selected . ''
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 31]: `` You are right ; it is the sail of a vessel , of one of those peroquas which skim over these seas -- how she rises on the swell !
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 10]: -- she is full of men , apparently . ''
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 27]: The peroqua rapidly approached , and was soon close to the beach ; the sail was lowered , and she was backed in through the surf .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 13]: `` Resistance is useless should they prove enemies , '' observed Philip .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 9]: `` We shall soon know our fate . ''
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 44]: The people in the peroqua took no notice of them , until the craft had been hauled up and secured ; three of them then advanced towards Philip and Krantz , with spears in their hands , but evidently with no hostile intentions .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 12]: One addressed them in Portuguese , asking them who they were ?
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 9]: `` We are Hollanders , '' replied Philip .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 14]: `` A part of the crew of the vessel which was wrecked ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 3]: inquired he .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 19]: `` You have nothing to fear -- you are enemies to the Portuguese , and so are we .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 21]: We belong to the island of Ternate -- our king is at war with the Portuguese , who are villains .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 5]: Where are your companions ?
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 5]: on which island ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 36]: `` They are all dead , '' replied Philip ; `` may I ask you whether you have fallen in with a woman , who was adrift on a part of the raft by herself ?
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 8]: or have you heard of her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 39]: `` We have heard that a woman was picked up on the beach to the southward , and carried away by the Tidore people to the Portuguese settlement , on the supposition that she was a Portuguese . ''
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 14]: `` Then God be thanked , she is saved , '' cried Philip .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 4]: `` Merciful Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 4]: accept my thanks .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 7]: -- To Tidore you said ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 19]: `` Yes ; we are at war with the Portuguese , we can not take you there . ''
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 7]: but we shall meet again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 11]: The person who accosted them was evidently of some consequence .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 55]: His dress was , to a certain degree , Mahometan , but mixed up with Malay -- he carried arms in his girdle and a spear in his hand ; his turban was of printed chintz ; and his deportment , like most persons of rank in that country , was courteous and dignified .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 15]: `` We are now returning to Ternate , and will take you with us .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 20]: Our king will be pleased to receive any Hollanders , especially as you are enemies to the Portuguese dogs .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 36]: I forgot to tell you that we have one of your companions with us in the boat ; we picked him up at sea , much exhausted , but he is now doing well . ''
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 7]: `` Who can it be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 16]: observed Krantz , `` it must be some one belonging to some other vessel . ''
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 16]: `` No , '' replied Philip , shuddering , `` it must be Schriften . ''
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 16]: `` Then my eyes must behold him before I believe it , '' replied Krantz .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 24]: `` Then believe your eyes , '' replied Philip , pointing to the form of Schriften , who was now walking towards them .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 9]: `` Mynheer Vanderdecken , glad to see you .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 9]: Mynheer Krantz , I hope you are well .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 9]: How lucky that we should all be saved .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 2]: He !
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 3]: he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 21]: `` The ocean has then , indeed , given up its dead , as I requested , '' thought Philip .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 35]: In the meantime , Schriften , without making any reference to the way in which they had so unceremoniously parted company , addressed Krantz with apparent good-humour , and some slight tinge of sarcasm .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 12]: It was some time before Krantz could rid himself of him .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 10]: `` What think you of him , Krantz ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 21]: `` That he is a part of the whole , and has his destiny to fulfil as well as you .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 19]: He has his part to play in this wondrous mystery , and will remain until it is finished .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 5]: Think not of him .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 8]: Recollect , your Amine is safe . ''
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 47]: `` True , '' replied Philip , `` the wretch is not worth a thought ; we have now nothing to do but to embark with these people ; hereafter we may rid ourselves of him , and strive then to rejoin my dearest Amine . ''
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 26]: Chapter XXVIII When Amine again came to her senses , she found herself lying on the leaves of the palmetto , in a small hut .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 13]: A hideous black child sat by her , brushing off the flies .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 4]: Where was she ?
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 23]: The raft had been tossed about for two days , during which Amine remained in a state of alternate delirium and stupor .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 25]: Driven by the current and the gale , it had been thrown on shore on the eastern end of the coast of New Guinea .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 25]: She had been discovered by some of the natives , who happened to be on the beach trafficking with some of the Tidore people .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 94]: At first , they hastened to rid her of her garments , although they perceived that she was not dead ; but before they had left her as naked as themselves , a diamond of great value , which had been given to her by Philip , attracted the attention of one of the savages ; failing in his attempt to pull it off , he pulled out a rusty , blunt knife , and was busily sawing at the finger , when an old woman of authority interfered and bade him desist .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 61]: The Tidore people , also , who were friends with the Portuguese , pointed out , that to save one of that nation would ensure a reward ; they stated moreover , that they would , on their return , inform the people of the factory establishment that one of their country-women had been thrown on shore on a raft .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 49]: -- To this Amine owed the care and attention that was paid to her ; that part of New Guinea being somewhat civilised by occasional intercourse with the Tidore people , who came there to exchange European finery and trash for the more useful productions of the island .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 50]: The Papoos woman carried Amine into her hut , and there she lay for many days , wavering between life and death , carefully attended , but requiring little , except the moistening of her parched lips with water , and the brushing off of the mosquitoes and flies .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 22]: When Amine opened her eyes , the little Papoos ran out to acquaint the woman who followed her into the hut .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 57]: She was of large size , very corpulent and unwieldy , with little covering on her body ; her hair , which was woolly in its texture , was partly parted , partly frizzled ; a cloth round her waist , and a piece of faded yellow silk on her shoulders , was all her dress .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 19]: A few silver rings on her fat fingers , and a necklace of mother-of-pearl , were her ornaments .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 29]: Her teeth were jet black , from the use of the betel-nut , and her whole appearance was such as to excite disgust in the breast of Amine .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 35]: She addressed Amine , but her words were unintelligible : and the sufferer , exhausted with the slight effort she had made , fell back into her former position , and closed her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 40]: But if the woman was disgusting , she was kind ; and by her attention and care Amine was able , in the course of three weeks , to crawl out of the hut and enjoy the evening breeze .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 25]: The natives of the island would at times surround her , but they treated her with respect , from fear of the old woman .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 14]: Their woolly hair was frizzled or plaited , sometimes powdered white with chunam .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 47]: A few palmetto leaves round the waist and descending to the knee , was their only attire ; rings through the nose and ears , and feathers of birds , particularly the bird of paradise , were their ornaments : but their language was wholly unintelligble .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 43]: Amine felt grateful for life ; she sat under the shade of the trees , and watched the swift peroquas as they skimmed the blue sea which was expanded before her ; but her thoughts were elsewhere -- they were on Philip .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 24]: One morning Amine came out of the hut , with joy on her countenance , and took her usual seat under the trees .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 55]: `` Yes , mother , dearest mother , I thank thee ; thou hast appeared to me ; thou hast recalled to me thy arts , which I had forgotten , and had I but the means of conversing with these people , even now would I know where my Philip might be . ''
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 14]: For two months did Amine remain under the care of the Papoos woman .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 37]: When the Tidore people returned , they had an order to bring the white woman , who had been cast on shore , to the Factory , and repay those who had taken charge of her .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 22]: They made signs to Amine , who had now quite recovered her beauty , that she was to go with them .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 60]: Any change was preferable to staying where she was , and Amine followed them down to a peroqua , on which she was securely fixed , and was soon darting through the water with her new companions ; and , as they flew along the smooth seas , Amine thought of Philip 's dream and the mermaid 's shell .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 41]: By the evening they had arrived at the southern point of Galolo , where they landed for the night ; the next day they gained the place of their destination , and Amine was led up to the Portuguese factory .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 32]: That the curiosity of those who were stationed there was roused is not to be wondered at , the history given by the natives of Amine 's escape appeared so miraculous .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 16]: From the Commandant to the lowest servant , every one was waiting to receive her .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 12]: The beauty of Amine , her perfect form , astonished them .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 45]: The Commandant addressed a long compliment to her in Portuguese , and was astonished that she did not make a suitable reply ; but as Amine did not understand a word that he said , it would have been more surprising if she had .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 30]: As Amine made signs that she could not understand the language , it was presumed that she was either English or Dutch , and an interpreter was sent for .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 34]: She then explained that she was the wife of a Dutch captain , whose vessel had been wrecked , and that she did not know whether the crew had been saved or not .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 29]: The Portuguese were very glad to hear that a Dutch vessel had been wrecked , and very glad that so lovely a creature as Amine had been saved .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 99]: She was informed by the Commandant that she was welcome , and that during her stay there everything should be done to make her comfortable ; that in three months they expected a vessel from the Chinese seas , proceeding to Goa , and that , if inclined , she should have a passage to Goa in that vessel , and from that city she would easily find other vessels to take her wherever she might please to go ; she was then conducted to an apartment , and left with a little negress to attend upon her .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 26]: The Portuguese Commandant was a small , meagre , little man , dried up to a chip , from long sojourning under a tropical sun .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 25]: He had very large whiskers , and a very long sword ; these were the two most remarkable features in his person and dress .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 26]: His attentions could not be misinterpreted , and Amine would have laughed at him , had she not been fearful that she might be detained .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 37]: In a few weeks , by due attention , she gained the Portuguese language so far as to ask for what she required , and before she quitted the island of Tidore she could converse fluently .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 49]: But her anxiety to leave , and to ascertain what had become of Philip , became greater every day ; and at the expiration of the three months , her eyes were continually bent to seaward , to catch the first glimpse of the vessel which was expected .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 46]: At last it appeared , and as Amine watched the approach of the canvas from the west , the Commandant fell on his knees , and declaring his passion , requested her not to think of departure , but to unite her fate with his .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 17]: Amine was cautious in her reply , for she knew that she was in his power .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 40]: `` She must first receive intelligence of her husband 's death , which was not yet certain ; she would proceed to Goa , and if she discovered that she was single , she would write to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 64]: This answer , as it will be discovered , was the cause of great suffering to Philip : the Commandant , fully assured that he could compass Philip 's death , was satisfied -- declared that , as soon as he had any positive intelligence , he would bring it to Goa himself , and made a thousand protestations of truth and fidelity .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 4]: `` Fool ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 17]: thought Amine , as she watched the ship , which was now close to the anchorage .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 13]: In half-an-hour the vessel had anchored , and the people had landed .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 15]: Amine observed a priest with them , as they walked up to the fort .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 22]: She shuddered -- she knew not why ; when they arrived , she found herself in the presence of Father Mathias .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 19]: Chapter XXIX Both Amine and Father Mathias started , and drew back with surprise at this unexpected meeting .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 33]: Amine was the first to extend her hand ; she had almost forgotten at the moment how they had parted , in the pleasure she experienced in meeting with a well-known face .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 37]: Father Mathias coldly took her hand , and laying his own upon her head , said : `` May God bless thee , and forgive thee , my daughter , as I have long done . ''
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 19]: Then the recollection of what had passed , rushed into Amine 's mind , and she coloured deeply .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 6]: Had Father Mathias forgiven her ?
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 43]: The event would show ; but this is certain , he now treated her as an old friend : listened with interest to her history of the wreck , and agreed with her upon the propriety of her accompanying him to Goa .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 18]: In a few days the vessel sailed , and Amine quitted the Factory and its enamoured Commandant .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 28]: They ran through the Archipelago in safety , and were crossing the mouth of the Bay of Bengal , without having had any interruption to fine weather .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 29]: Father Mathias had returned to Lisbon , when he quitted Ternicore , and , tired of idleness , had again volunteered to proceed as a missionary to India .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 39]: He had arrived at Formosa , and shortly after his arrival , had received directions from his superior to return on important business to Goa , and thus it was that he fell in with Amine at Tidore .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 19]: It would be difficult to analyse the feelings of Father Mathias towards Amine -- they varied so often .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 96]: At one moment , he would call to mind the kindness shown to him by her and Philip -- the regard he had for the husband , and the many good qualities which he acknowledged that she possessed -- and _ now _ he would recollect the disgrace , the unmerited disgrace , he had suffered through her means ; and he would then canvass , whether she really did believe him an intruder in her chamber for other motives than those which actuated him , or whether she had taken advantage of his indiscretion .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 54]: These accounts were nearly balanced in his mind ; he could have forgiven all , if he had thought that Amine was a sincere convert to the church ; but his strong conviction that she was not only an unbeliever , but that she practised forbidden arts , turned the scale against her .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 61]: He watched her narrowly , and when , in her conversation , she shewed any religious feeling , his heart warmed towards her ; but when , on the contrary , any words escaped her lips which seemed to show that she thought lightly of his creed , then the full tide of indignation and vengeance poured into his bosom .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 50]: It was in crossing the Bay of Bengal , to pass round the southern cape of Ceylon , that they first met with bad weather ; and when the storm increased , the superstitious seamen lighted candles before the small image of the saint which was shrined on deck .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 32]: Amine observed it , and smiled with scorn ; and as she did so , almost unwittingly , she perceived that the eye of Father Mathias was earnestly fixed upon her .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 24]: `` The Papooses I have just left do no worse than worship their idols , and are termed idolaters , '' muttered Amine .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 8]: `` What then are these Christians ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 9]: `` Would you not be better below ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 34]: said Father Mathias , coming over to Amine ; `` this is no time for women to be on deck -- they would be better employed in offering up prayers for safety . ''
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 53]: `` Nay , Father , I can pray better here ; I like this conflict of the elements ; and as I view , I bow down in admiration of the Deity who rules the storm ; who sends the winds forth in their wrath , or soothes them into peace . ''
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 42]: `` It is well said , my child , '' replied Father Mathias ; `` but the Almighty is not only to be worshipped in His works , but , in the closet , with meditation , self-examination , and faith .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 12]: Hast thou followed up the precepts which thou hast been taught ?
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 14]: hast thou reverenced the sublime mysteries which have been unfolded to thee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 24]: `` I have done my best , Father , '' replied Amine , turning away her head , and watching the rolling wave .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 23]: `` Hast thou called upon the Holy Virgin , and upon the saints -- those intercessors for mortals erring like thyself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 21]: Amine made no answer ; she did not wish to irritate the priest , neither would she tell an untruth .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 13]: `` Answer me , child , '' continued the priest with severity .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 29]: `` Father , '' replied Amine , `` I have appealed to God alone -- the God of the Christians -- the God of the whole universe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 12]: `` Who believes not everything , believes nothing , young woman .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 5]: I thought as much !
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 15]: I saw thee smile with scorn just now ; why didst thou smile ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 10]: `` At my own thoughts , good Father . ''
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 13]: `` Say rather , at the true faith shown by others . ''
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 5]: Amine made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 11]: `` Thou art still an unbeliever , and a heretic .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 5]: Beware , young woman !
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 3]: beware ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 8]: `` Beware of what , good Father ?
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 5]: why should I beware ?
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 19]: Are there not millions in these climes more unbelieving , and more heretic , perhaps , than I ?
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 9]: How many have you converted to your faith ?
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 25]: What trouble , what toil , what dangers have you not undergone to propagate that creed -- and why do you succeed so ill ?
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 7]: Shall I tell you , Father ?
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 32]: It is because the people have already had a creed of their own : a creed taught to them from their infancy , and acknowledged by all who live about them .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 8]: Am I not in the same position ?
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 28]: I was brought up in another creed : and can you expect that that can be dismissed , and the prejudices of early years at once eradicated ?
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 32]: I have thought much of what you have told me -- have felt that much is true -- that the tenets of your creed are god-like -- is not that much ?
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 7]: and yet you are not content .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 16]: You would have blind acknowledgment , blind obedience -- I were then an unworthy convert .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 32]: We shall soon be in port , then teach me , and convince me , if you will ; I am ready to examine and confess , but on conviction only .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 44]: Have patience , good Father , and the time may come when I _ may _ feel , what now I _ do not _ ; -- that yon bit of painted wood is a thing to bow down to and adore . ''
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 28]: Notwithstanding this taunt at the close of this speech , there was so much truth in the observations of Amine , that Father Mathias felt their power .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 37]: As the wife of a Catholic , he had been accustomed to view Amine as one who had backslided from the church of Rome -- not as one who had been brought up in another creed .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 47]: He now recalled to mind , that she had never yet been received into the church , for Father Seysen had not considered her as in a proper state to be admitted , and had deferred her baptism until he was satisfied of her full belief .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 23]: `` You speak boldly ; but you speak as you feel , my child , '' replied Father Mathias after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 33]: `` We will , when we arrive at Goa , talk over these things , and with the blessing of God , the new faith shall be made manifest to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 9]: `` So be it , '' replied Amine .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 52]: Little did the priest imagine that Amine 's thoughts were at that moment upon a dream she had had at New Guinea , in which her mother appeared , and revealed to her her magic arts -- and that Amine was longing to arrive at Goa that she might practise them .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 24]: Every hour the gale increased , and the vessel laboured and leaked ; the Portuguese sailors were frightened , and invoked their saints .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 42]: Father Mathias , and the other passengers , gave themselves up for lost , for the pumps could not keep the vessel free ; and their cheeks blanched as the waves washed furiously over the vessel : they prayed and trembled .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 31]: Father Mathias gave them absolution ; some cried like children , some tore their hair , some cursed , and cursed the saints they had but the day before invoked .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 17]: But Amine stood unmoved ; and as she heard them curse , she smiled in scorn .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 48]: `` My child , '' said Father Mathias , checking his tremulous voice that he might not appear agitated before one whom he saw so calm and unmoved amidst the roaring of the elements -- `` My child , let not this hour of peril pass away .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 30]: Before thou art summoned , let me receive thee into the bosom of our church -- give thee pardon for thy sins , and certainty of bliss hereafter . ''
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 54]: `` Good Father , Amine is not to be frightened into belief , even if she feared the storm , '' replied she ; `` nor will she credit your power to forgive her sins , merely because she says , in fear , that which in her calm reason she might reject .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 56]: If ever fear could have subjected me , it was when I was alone upon the raft -- that was indeed a trial of my strength of mind , the bare recollection of which is , at this moment , more dreadful than the storm now raging , and the death which may await us .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 24]: There is a God on high in whose mercy I trust -- in whose love I confide -- to whose will I bow .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 7]: Let Him do His will . ''
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 11]: `` Die not , my child , in unbelief ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 44]: `` Father , '' replied Amine , pointing to the passengers and seamen who were on the deck crying and wailing : `` these are Christians -- these men have been promised by you , but now , the inheritance of perfect bliss .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 17]: What is their faith , that it does not give them strength to die like men ?
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 18]: Why is it that a woman quails not , while they lie grovelling on the deck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 21]: `` Life is sweet , my child -- they leave their wives , their children , and they dread hereafter .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 7]: Who is prepared to die ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 8]: `` I am , '' replied Amine .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 15]: `` I have no husband -- at least I fear I have no husband .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 21]: For me life has no sweets ; yet , one little hope remains -- a straw to the sinking wretch .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 13]: I fear not death , for I have nought to live for .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 27]: Were Philip here , why , then indeed -- but he is gone before me , and now to follow him is all I ask . ''
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 21]: `` He died in the faith , my child -- if you would meet him , do the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 18]: `` He never died like these , '' replied Amine , looking with scorn at the passengers .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 15]: `` Perhaps he lived not as they have lived , '' replied Father Mathias .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 14]: `` A good man dies in peace , and hath no fear . ''
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 30]: `` So die the good men of all creeds , Father , '' replied Amine ; `` and in all creeds death is equally terrible to the wicked . ''
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 20]: `` I will pray for thee , my child , '' said Father Mathias , sinking on his knees .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 42]: `` Many thanks -- thy prayers will be heard , even though offered for one like me , '' replied Amine , who , clinging to the man-ropes , made her way up to the ladder , and gained the deck .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 3]: `` Lost !
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 5]: signora , lost ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 14]: exclaimed the captain , wringing his hands as he crouched under the bulwark .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 24]: replied Amine , who had gained the weather side , and held on by a rope ; `` not lost this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 8]: `` How say you , signora ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 15]: replied the captain , looking with admiration at Amine 's calm and composed countenance .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 8]: `` How say you , signora ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 37]: `` Something tells me , good captain , that you will not be lost , if you exert yourselves -- something tells it to me here , '' and Amine laid her hand to her heart .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 40]: Amine had a conviction that the vessel would not be lost , for it had not escaped her observation that the storm was less violent , although , in their terror , this had been unnoticed by the sailors .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 40]: The coolness of Amine , her beauty , perhaps , the unusual sight of a woman so young , calm and confiding , when all others were in despair , had its due effect upon the captain and seamen .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 26]: Supposing her to be a Catholic they imagined that she had had some warrant for her assertion , for credulity and superstition are close friends .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 19]: They looked upon Amine with admiration and respect , recovered their energies , and applied to their duties .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 25]: The pumps were again worked ; the storm abated during the night , and the vessel was , as Amine had predicted , saved .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 25]: The crew and passengers looked upon her almost as a saint , and talked of her to Father Mathias , who was sadly perplexed .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 21]: The courage which she had displayed was extraordinary ; even when he trembled , she showed no sign of fear .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 20]: He made no reply , but communed with his own mind , and the result was unfavourable to Amine .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 7]: What had given her such coolness ?
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 9]: what had given her the spirit of prophecy ?
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 13]: Not the God of the Christians , for she was no believer .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 3]: Who then ?
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 15]: and Father Mathias thought of her chamber at Terneuse , and shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 24]: Chapter XXX We must now again return to Philip and Krantz , who had a long conversation upon the strange reappearance of Schriften .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 28]: All that they could agree upon was , that he should be carefully watched , and that they should dispense with his company as soon as possible .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 81]: Krantz had interrogated him as to his escape , and Schriften had informed him , in his usual sneering manner , that one of the sweeps of the raft had been allowed to get adrift during the scuffle , and that he had floated on it , until he had gained a small island ; that on seeing the peroqua , he had once more launched it and supported himself by it , until he was perceived and picked up .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 20]: As there was nothing impossible although much of the improbable in this account , Krantz asked no more questions .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 23]: The next morning , the wind having abated , they launched the peroqua , and made sail for the island of Ternate .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 23]: It was four days before they arrived : as every night they landed and hauled up their craft on the sandy beach .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 40]: Philip 's heart was relieved at the knowledge of Amine 's safety , and he could have been happy at the prospect of again meeting her , had he not been so constantly fretted by the company of Schriften .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 43]: There was something so strange , so contrary to human nature that the little man , though diabolical as he appeared to be in his disposition , should never hint at , or complain of , Philip 's attempts upon his life .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 64]: Had he complained -- had he accused Philip of murder -- had he vowed vengeance and demanded justice on his return to the authorities , it had been different ; but no -- there he was , making his uncalled-for and impertinent observations , with his eternal chuckle and sarcasm , as if he had not the least cause of anger or ill-will .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 45]: As soon as they arrived at the principal port and town of Ternate , they were conducted to a large cabin , built of palmetto leaves and bamboo , and requested not to leave it until their arrival had been announced to the king .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 40]: The peculiar courtesy and good breeding of these islanders was the constant theme of remark of Philip and Krantz ; their religion , as well as their dress , appeared to be a compound of the Mahometan and Malayan .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 22]: After a few hours , they were summoned to attend the audience of the king , held in the open air .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 18]: The king was seated under a portico , attended by a numerous concourse of priests and soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 9]: There was much company , but little splendour .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 22]: All who were about the king were robed in white , with white turbans , but he himself was without ornament .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 42]: The first thing that struck Philip and Krantz , when they were ushered into the presence of the king , was the beautiful cleanliness which everywhere prevailed ; every dress was spotless and white , as the sun could bleach it .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 85]: Having followed the example of those who introduced them , and saluted the king after the Mahommedan custom , they were requested to be seated ; and through the Portuguese interpreters -- for the former communication of the islanders with the Portuguese , who had been driven from the place , made the Portuguese language well known by many -- a few questions were put by the king , who bade them welcome , and then requested to know how they had been wrecked .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 36]: Philip entered into a short detail , in which he stated that his wife had been separated from him , and was , he understood , in the hands of the Portuguese factory at Tidore .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 22]: He requested to know if his majesty could assist him in obtaining her release , or in going to join her .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 11]: `` It is well said , '' replied the king .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 18]: `` Let refreshments be brought in for the strangers , and the audience be broken up . ''
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 41]: In a few minutes there remained of all the Court but two or three of the king 's confidential friends and advisers ; and a collation of curries , fish , and a variety of other dishes was served up .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 29]: After it was over , the king then said , `` The Portuguese are dogs , they are our enemies -- will you assist us to fight them ?
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 19]: We have large guns , but do not understand the use of them as well as you do .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 17]: I will send a fleet against the Portuguese at Tidore , if you will assist me .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 8]: Say , Hollanders , will you fight ?
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 14]: You , '' addressing Philip , `` will then recover your wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 22]: `` I will give an answer to you to-morrow , '' replied Philip ; `` I must consult with my friend .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 28]: As I told you before , I was the captain of the ship , and this was my second in command -- we will consult together . ''
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 23]: Schriften , whom Philip had represented as a common seaman , had not been brought up into the presence of the king .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 19]: `` It is good , '' replied the king ; `` to-morrow we will expect your reply . ''
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 36]: Philip and Krantz took their leave , and , on their return to the cabin , found that the king had sent them , as a present , two complete Mahommedan dresses , with turbans .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 25]: These were welcome , for their own garments were sadly tattered , and very unfit for exposure to the burning sun of those climes .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 25]: Their peaked hats too , collected the rays of heat , which were intolerable ; and they gladly exchanged them for the white turban .
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 33]: Secreting their money in the Malayan sash , which formed a part of the attire , they soon robed themselves in the native garments , the comfort of which was immediately acknowledged .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 37]: After a long consultation , it was decided that they should accept the terms offered by the king , as this was the only feasible way by which Philip could hope to re-obtain possession of Amine .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 21]: Their consent was communicated to the king on the following day , and every preparation was made for the expedition .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 13]: And now was to be beheld a scene of bustle and activity .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 80]: Hundreds and hundreds of peroquas , of every dimension , floating close to the beach , side by side , formed a raft extending nearly half a mile on the smooth water of the bay , teeming with men , who were equipping them for the service : some were fitting the sails ; others were carpentering where required ; the major portion were sharpening their swords , and preparing the deadly poison of the pineapple for their creezes .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 63]: The beach was a scene of confusion : water in jars , bags of rice , vegetables , salt-fish , fowls in coops , were everywhere strewed about among the armed natives , who were obeying the orders of the chiefs , who themselves walked up and down , dressed in their gayest apparel , and glittering in their arms and ornaments .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 56]: The king had six long brass four-pounders , a present from an Indian captain ; these , with a proportionate quantity of shot and cartridges , were -LRB- under the direction of Philip and Krantz -RRB- fitted on some of the largest peroquas , and some of the natives were instructed how to use them .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 51]: At first the king , who fully expected the reduction of the Portuguese fort , stated his determination to go in person ; but in this he was overruled by his confidential advisers and by the request of Philip , who could not allow him to expose his valuable life .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 25]: In ten days all was ready , and the fleet , manned by seven thousand men , made sail for the island of Tidore .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 59]: It was a beautiful sight , to behold the blue rippling sea , covered with nearly six hundred of these picturesque craft , all under sail , and darting through the water like dolphins in pursuit of prey ; all crowded with natives , whose white dresses formed a lively contrast with the deep blue of the water .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 36]: The large peroquas , in which were Philip and Krantz with the native commanders , were gaily decorated with streamers and pennons of all colours , that flowed out and snapped with the fresh breeze .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 22]: It appeared rather to be an expedition of mirth and merriment , than one which was proceeding to bloodshed and slaughter .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 30]: On the evening of the second day they had made the island of Tidore , and run down to within a few miles of the Portuguese factory and fort .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 30]: The natives of the country , who disliked , though they feared to disobey the Portuguese , had quitted their huts near the beach and retired into the woods .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 19]: The fleet , therefore , anchored and lay near the beach , without molestation , during the night .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 10]: The next morning Philip and Krantz proceeded to reconnoitre .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 22]: The fort and factory of Tidore were built upon the same principle as almost all the Portuguese defences in those seas .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 27]: An outer fortification , consisting of a ditch , with strong palisades embedded in masonry , surrounded the factory and all the houses of the establishment .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 21]: The gates of the outer wall were open all day for ingress and egress , and closed only at night .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 49]: On the seaward side of this enclosure was what may be termed the citadel or real fortification ; it was built of solid masonry with parapets , was surrounded by a deep ditch , and was only accessible by a drawbridge , mounted with cannon on every side .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 25]: Its real strength however , could not well be perceived , as it was hidden by the high palisading which surrounded the whole establishment .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 60]: After a careful survey , Philip recommended that the large peroquas with the cannon should attack by sea , while the men of the small vessels should land and surround the fort -- taking advantage of every shelter which was afforded them , to cover themselves while they harassed the enemy with their matchlocks , arrows , and spears .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 33]: This plan having been approved of , one hundred and fifty peroquas made sail ; the others were hauled on the beach , and the men belonging to them proceeded by land .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 32]: But the Portuguese had been warned of their approach , and were fully prepared to receive them ; the guns mounted to the seaward were of heavy calibre and well served .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 37]: The guns of the peroquas , though rendered as effectual as they could be , under the direction of Philip , were small , and did little damage to the thick stone front of the fort .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 53]: After an engagement of four hours , during which the Ternate people lost a great number of men , the peroquas , by the advice of Philip and Krantz , hauled off , and returned to where the remainder of the fleet were stationed ; and another council of war was held .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 71]: The force , which had surrounded the fort on the land side , was , however , not withdrawn , as it cut off any supplies or assistance ; and , at the same time , occasionally brought down any of the Portuguese who might expose themselves -- a point of no small importance , as Philip well knew , with a garrison so small as that in the fort .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 34]: That they could not take the fort by means of their cannon was evident ; on the sea-side it was for them impregnable ; their efforts must now be directed to the land .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 29]: Krantz , after the native chiefs had done speaking , advised that they should wait until dark , and then proceed to the attack in the following way .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 53]: When the breeze set along shore , which it would do in the evening , he proposed that the men should prepare large bundles of dry palmetto and cocoa-nut leaves ; that they should carry their bundles and stack them against the palisades to windward , and then set fire to them .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 30]: They would thus burn down the palisades , and gain an entrance into the outer fortification : after which they could ascertain in what manner they should next proceed .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 10]: This advice was too judicious not to be followed .
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 35]: All the men who had not matchlocks were set to collect fagots ; a large quantity of dry wood was soon got together , and before night they were ready for the second attack .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 53]: The white dresses of the Ternates were laid aside : with nothing on them but their belts , and scimitars , and creezes , and blue under-drawers , they silently crept up to the palisades , there deposited their fagots , and then again returned , again to perform the same journey .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 35]: As the breastwork of fagots increased , so did they more boldly walk up , until the pile was completed ; they then , with a loud shout , fired it in several places .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 22]: The flames mounted , the cannon of the fort roared , and many fell under the discharges of grape and hand-grenade .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 30]: But , stifled by the smoke , which poured in volumes upon them , the people in the fort were soon compelled to quit the ramparts to avoid suffocation .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 26]: The palisades were on fire , and the flames mounting in the air , swept over , and began to attack the factory and houses .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 48]: No resistance was now offered , and the Ternates tore down the burning palisades , and forced their way into the entrenchment , and with their scimitars and creezes , put to death all who had been so unfortunate as not to take refuge in the citadel .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 44]: These were chiefly native servants , whom the attack had surprised , and for whose lives the Portuguese seemed to care but little , for they paid no attention to their cries to lower the drawbridge , and admit them into the fort .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 26]: The factory , built of stone , and all the other houses , were on fire , and the island was lighted up for miles .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 24]: The smoke had cleared away , and the defences of the fort were now plainly visible in the broad glare of the flames .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 27]: `` If we had scaling-ladders , '' cried Philip , `` the fort would be ours ; there is not a soul on the ramparts . ''
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 48]: `` True , true , '' replied Krantz , `` but even as it is , the factory walls will prove an advantageous post for us after the fire is extinguished ; if we occupy it we can prevent them showing themselves while the ladders are constructing .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 33]: To-morrow night we may have them ready , and having first smoked the fort with a few more fagots , we may afterwards mount the walls , and carry the place . ''
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 13]: `` That will do , '' replied Philip as he walked away .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 23]: He then joined the native chiefs , who were collected together outside of the entrenchment , and communicated to them his plans .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 32]: When he had made known his views , and the chiefs had assented to them , Schriften , who had come with the expedition unknown to Philip , made his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 16]: `` That wo n't do ; you 'll never take that fort , Philip Vanderdecken .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 2]: He !
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 3]: he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 3]: cried Schriften .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 36]: Hardly had he said the words , when a tremendous explosion took place , and the air was filled with large stones , which flew and fell in every direction , killing and maiming hundreds .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 28]: It was the factory which had blown up , for in its vaults there was a large quantity of gunpowder , to which the fire had communicated .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 9]: `` So ends that scheme , Mynheer Vanderdecken .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 2]: He !
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 3]: he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 12]: screamed Schriften ; `` you 'll never take that fort . ''
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 33]: The loss of life and the confusion caused by this unexpected result , occasioned a panic , and all the Ternate people fled down to the beach where their peroquas were lying .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 14]: It was in vain that Philip and their chiefs attempted to rally them .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 51]: Unaccustomed to the terrible effects of gunpowder in any large quantities , they believed that something supernatural had occurred , and many of them jumped into the peroquas and made sail , while the remainder were confused , trembling , and panting , all huddled together , on the beach .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 17]: `` You 'll never take that fort , Mynheer Vanderdecken , '' screamed the well-known voice .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 19]: Philip raised his sword to cleave the little man in two , but he let it fall again .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 25]: `` I fear he tells an unwelcome truth , '' thought Philip ; `` but why should I take his life for that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 24]: Some few of the Ternate chiefs still kept up their courage , but the major part were as much alarmed as their people .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 29]: After some consultation , it was agreed that the army should remain where it was till the next morning , when they should finally decide what to do .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 33]: When the day dawned , now that the Portuguese fort was no longer surrounded by the other buildings , they perceived that it was more formidable than they had at first supposed .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 19]: The ramparts were filled with men , and they were bringing cannon to bear on the Ternate forces .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 22]: Philip had a consultation with Krantz , and both acknowledged , that with the present panic nothing more could be done .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 88]: The chiefs were of the same opinion , and orders were given for the return of the expedition : indeed , the Ternate chiefs were fully satisfied with their success ; they had destroyed the large fort , the factory , and all the Portuguese buildings ; a small fortification only was uninjured : that was built of stone , and inaccessible , and they knew that the report of what had been done , would be taken and acknowledged by the king as a great victory .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 33]: The order was therefore given for embarkation , and in two hours the whole fleet , after a loss of about seven hundred men , was again on its way to Ternate .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 23]: Krantz and Philip this time embarked in the same peroqua , that they might have the pleasure of each other 's conversation .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 30]: They had not , however , sailed above three hours , when it fell calm , and , towards the evening , there was every prospect of bad weather .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 85]: When the breeze again sprung up , it was from an adverse quarter , but these vessels steer so close to the wind , that this was disregarded : by midnight , however , the wind had increased to a gale , and before they were clear of the N.E. headland of Tidore , it blew a hurricane , and many were washed off into the sea from the different craft , and those who could not swim , sank , and were drowned .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 24]: The sails were lowered , and the vessels lay at the mercy of the wind and waves , every sea washing over them .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 37]: The fleet was drifting fast on the shore , and before morning dawned , the vessel in which were Philip and Krantz was among the rollers on the beach off the northern end of the island .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 20]: In a short time she was dashed to pieces , and every one had to look out for himself .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 36]: Philip and Krantz laid hold of one fragment , and were supported by it till they gained the shore ; here they found about thirty more companions who had suffered the same fate as themselves .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 38]: When the day dawned , they perceived that the major part of the fleet had weathered the point , and that those who had not , would in all probability escape , as the wind had moderated .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 59]: The Ternate people proposed , that as they were well armed , they should , as soon as the weather moderated , launch some of the craft belonging to the islanders , and join the fleet ; but Philip , who had been consulting with Krantz , considered this a good opportunity for ascertaining the fate of Amine .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 33]: As the Portuguese could prove nothing against them , they could either deny that they had been among the assailants , or might plead that they had been forced to join them .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 54]: At all risks , Philip was determined to remain , and Krantz agreed to share his fate : and seeming to agree with them , they allowed the Ternate people to walk to the Tidore peroquas , and while they were launching them Philip and Krantz fell back into the jungle and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 40]: The Portuguese had perceived the wreck of their enemies , and , irritated by the loss they had sustained , they had ordered the people of the island to go out and capture all who were driven on shore .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 41]: Now that they were no longer assailed , the Tidore people obeyed them , and very soon fell in with Philip and Krantz , who had quietly sat down under the shade of a large tree , waiting the issue .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 14]: They were led away to the fort , where they arrived by nightfall .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 105]: They were ushered into the presence of the Commandant , the same little man who had made love to Amine , and as they were dressed in Mussulman 's attire , he was about to order them to be hung , when Philip told him that they were Dutchmen , who had been wrecked , and forced by the King of Ternate to join his expedition ; that they had taken the earliest opportunity of escaping , as was very evident since those who had been thrown on shore with them had got off in the island boats , while they chose to remain .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 33]: Whereupon the little Portuguese Commandant struck his sword firm down on the pavement of the ramparts , _ looked _ very big , and then ordered them to prison for further examination .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 28]: Chapter XXXI As every one descants upon the want of comfort in a prison , it is to be presumed that there are no very comfortable ones .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 21]: Certainly that to which Philip and Krantz were ushered , had anything rather than the air of an agreeable residence .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 21]: It was under the fort , with a very small aperture looking towards the sea , for light and air .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 27]: It was very hot , and moreover destitute of all those little conveniences which add so much to one 's happiness in modern houses and hotels .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 20]: In fact , it consisted of four bare walls , and a stone floor , and that was all .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 24]: Philip , who wished to make some inquiries relative to Amine , addressed , in Portuguese , the soldier who brought them down .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 31]: `` My good friend , I beg your pardon -- '' `` I beg yours , '' replied the soldier going out of the door , and locking them in .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 23]: Philip leant gloomily against the wall ; Krantz , more mercurial , walked up and down three steps each way and turn .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 11]: `` Do you know what I am thinking of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 10]: observed Krantz , after a pause in his walk .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 35]: `` It is very fortunate that -LRB- lowering his voice -RRB- we have all our doubloons about us ; if they do n't search us , we may yet get away by bribing . ''
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 33]: `` And I was thinking , '' rejoined Philip , `` that I would sooner be here than in company with that wretch Schriften , whose sight is poison to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 22]: `` I did not much admire the appearance of the Commandant , but I suppose we shall know more to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 31]: Here they were interrupted by the turning of the key , and the entrance of a soldier with a chatty of water , and a large dish of boiled rice .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 18]: He was not the man who had brought them to the dungeon , and Philip accosted him .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 13]: `` You have had hard work within these last two days ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 5]: `` Yes , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 3]: signor . ''
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 15]: `` The natives forced us to join the expedition , and we escaped . ''
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 10]: `` So I heard you say , signor . ''
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 12]: `` They lost nearly a thousand men , '' said Krantz .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 5]: `` Holy St Francis !
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 7]: I am glad of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 20]: `` They will be careful how they attack Portuguese in a hurry , I expect , '' rejoined Krantz .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 10]: `` I think so , '' replied the soldier .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 8]: `` Did you lose many men ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 10]: ventured Philip , perceiving that the man was loquacious .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 8]: `` Not ten of our own people .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 26]: In the factory there were about a hundred of the natives , with some women and children ; but that is of no consequence . ''
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 36]: `` You had a young European woman here , I understand , '' said Philip with anxiety ; `` one who was wrecked in a vessel -- was she among those who were lost ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 4]: `` Young woman !
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 5]: -- Holy St Francis .
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 6]: Yes , now I recollect .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 10]: Why the fact is -- '' `` Pedro ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 25]: called a voice from above ; the man stopped , put his fingers to his lips , went out , and locked the door .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 5]: `` God of Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 16]: give me patience , '' cried Philip ; `` but this is too trying . ''
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 14]: `` He will be down here again to-morrow morning , '' observed Krantz .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 17]: to-morrow morning ; but what an endless time will suspense make of the intervening hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 17]: `` I feel for you , '' replied Krantz ; `` but what can be done ?
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 20]: The hours must pass , though suspense draws them out into interminable years ; but I hear footsteps . ''
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 14]: Again the door was unlocked , and the first soldier made his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 12]: `` Follow me -- the Commandant would speak with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 13]: This unexpected summons was cheerfully complied with by Philip and his companion .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 34]: They walked up the narrow stone steps , and at last found themselves in a small room , in presence of the Commandant , with whom our readers have been already made acquainted .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 39]: He was lolling on a small sofa , his long sword lay on the table before him , and two young native women were fanning him , one at his head , and the other at his feet .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 9]: `` Where did you get those dresses ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 5]: was the first interrogatory .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 36]: `` The natives , when they brought us prisoners from the island on which we had saved ourselves , took away our clothes , and gave us these as a present from their king . ''
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 18]: `` And engaged you to serve in their fleet , in the attack on this fort ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 49]: `` They forced us , '' replied Krantz ; `` for as there was no war between our nations , we objected to this service : notwithstanding which , they put us on board , to make the common people believe that they were assisted by Europeans . ''
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 12]: `` How am I to know the truth of this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 20]: `` You have our word in the first place , and our escape from them in the second . ''
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 8]: `` You belonged to a Dutch East-Indiaman .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 8]: Are you officers or common seamen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 38]: Krantz , who considered that they were less likely to be detained if they concealed their rank on board , gave Philip a slight touch with his finger as he replied , `` We are inferior officers .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 12]: I was third mate , and this man was pilot . ''
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 10]: `` And your captain , where is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 16]: `` I -- I can not say , whether he is alive or dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 9]: `` Had you no woman on board ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 7]: the captain had his wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 8]: `` What has become of her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 18]: `` She is supposed to have perished on a portion of the raft which broke adrift . ''
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 4]: `` Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 11]: replied the Commandant , who remained silent for some time .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 30]: Philip looked at Krantz , as much as to say , `` Why all this subterfuge ; '' but Krantz gave him a sign to leave him to speak .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 16]: `` You say you do n't know whether your captain is alive or dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 5]: `` I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 35]: `` Now , suppose I was to give you your liberty , would you have any objection to sign a paper , stating his death , and swearing to the truth of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 11]: Philip stared at the Commandant , and then at Krantz .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 23]: `` I see no objection , exactly ; except that if it were sent home to Holland we might get into trouble .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 16]: May I ask , signor Commandant , why you wish for such a paper ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 11]: roared the little man , in a voice like thunder .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 37]: `` I will give no reason , but that I wish it ; that is enough ; take your choice -- the dungeon , or liberty and a passage by the first vessel which calls . ''
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 34]: `` I do n't doubt -- in fact -- I 'm sure , he must be dead by this time , '' replied Krantz , drawing out the words in a musing manner .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 16]: `` Commandant , will you give us till to-morrow morning to make our calculations ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 5]: you may go . ''
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 41]: `` But not to the dungeon , Commandant , '' replied Krantz ; `` we are not prisoners , certainly ; and , if you wish us to do you a favour , surely you will not ill-treat us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 39]: `` By your own acknowledgment you have taken up arms against the most Christian King ; however , you may remain at liberty for the night -- to-morrow morning will decide whether or no you are prisoners . ''
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 19]: Philip and Krantz thanked the little Commandant for his kindness , and then hastened away to the ramparts .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 15]: It was now dark , and the moon had not yet made her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 44]: They sat there on the parapet , enjoying the breeze , and feeling the delight of liberty , even after their short incarceration ; but , near to them , soldiers were either standing or lying , and they spoke but in whispers .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 28]: `` What could he mean by requiring us to give a certificate of the captain 's death ; and why did you answer as you did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 38]: `` Philip Vanderdecken , that I have often thought of the fate of your beautiful wife , you may imagine ; and , when I heard that she was brought here , I then trembled for her .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 21]: What must she appear , lovely as she is , when placed in comparison with the women of this country ?
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 19]: And that little Commandant -- is he not the very person who would be taken with her charms ?
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 71]: I denied our condition , because I thought he would be more likely to allow us our liberty as humble individuals , than as captain and first mate ; particularly as he suspects that we led on the Ternate people to the attack ; and when he asked for a certificate of your death , I immediately imagined that he wanted it in order to induce Amine to marry him .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 5]: But where is she ?
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 4]: is the question .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 16]: If we could only find out that soldier , we might gain some information . ''
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 17]: `` Depend upon it , she is here , '' replied Philip , clenching his hands .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 23]: `` I am inclined to think so , '' said Krantz ; `` that she is alive , I feel assured . ''
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 18]: The conversation was continued until the moon rose , and threw her beams over the tumbling waters .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 43]: Philip and Krantz turned their faces towards the sea , and leant over the battlements in silence ; after some time their reveries were disturbed by a person coming up to them with a '' _ Buenos noctes , signor _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 15]: Krantz immediately recognised the Portuguese soldier , whose conversation with him had been interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 6]: `` Good-night , my friend !
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 16]: We thank Heaven that you have no longer to turn the key upon us . ''
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 8]: `` Yes , I 'm surprised ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 9]: replied the soldier , in a low tone .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 23]: `` Our Commandant is fond of exercising his power ; he rules here without appeal , that I can tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 14]: `` He is not within hearing of us now , '' replied Krantz .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 11]: `` It is a lovely spot this to live in !
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 10]: How long have you been in this country ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 15]: `` Now , thirteen years , signor , and I 'm tired of it .
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 30]: I have a wife and children in Oporto -- that is , I _ had _ -- but whether they are alive or not , who can tell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 12]: `` Do you not expect to return and see them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 5]: `` Return -- signor !
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 8]: no Portuguese soldier like me ever returns .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 15]: We are enlisted for five years , and we lay our bones here . ''
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 7]: `` That is hard indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 21]: `` Hard , signor , '' replied the soldier in a low whisper ; `` it is cruel and treacherous .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 25]: I have often thought of putting the muzzle of my arquebuse to my head ; but while there 's life there 's hope . ''
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 41]: `` I pity you , my good fellow , '' rejoined Krantz ; `` look you , I have two gold pieces left -- take one ; you may be able to send it home to your poor wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 24]: `` And here is one of mine , too , my good fellow , '' added Philip , putting another in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 47]: `` Now may all the saints preserve you , signors , '' replied the soldier , `` for it is the first act of kindness shown to me for many years -- not that my wife and children have much chance of ever receiving it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 24]: `` You were speaking about a young European woman when we were in the dungeon , '' observed Krantz , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 12]: `` Yes , signor , she was a very beautiful creature .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 11]: Our Commandant was very much in love with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 7]: `` Where is she now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 35]: `` She went away to Goa , in company with a priest who knew , her , Father Mathias , a good old man ; he gave me absolution when he was here . ''
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 5]: `` Father Mathias ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 11]: exclaimed Philip ; but a touch from Krantz checked him .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 9]: `` You say the Commandant loved her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 48]: `` O yes ; the little man was quite mad about her ; and had it not been for the arrival of Father Mathias , he would never have let her go , that I 'm sure of , although she was another man 's wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 9]: `` Sailed for Goa , you said ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 10]: `` Yes , in a ship which called here .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 30]: She must have been very glad to have got away , for our little Commandant persecuted her all day long , and she evidently was grieving for her husband .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 13]: Do you know , signors , if her husband is alive ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 15]: `` No , we do not ; we have heard nothing of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 32]: `` Well , if he is , I hope he will not come here ; for should the Commandant have him in his power , it would go hard with him .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 9]: He is a man who sticks at nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 43]: He is a brave little fellow , _ that _ can not be denied ; but to get possession of that lady , he would remove all obstacles at any risk -- and a husband is a very serious one , signors .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 56]: Well , signors , '' continued the soldier , after a pause , `` I had better not be seen here too long ; you may command me if you want anything ; recollect , my name is Pedro -- good-night to you , and a thousand thanks , '' and the soldier walked away .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 27]: `` We have made one friend , at all events , '' said Krantz , `` and we have gained information of no little importance . ''
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 8]: `` Most important , '' replied Philip .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 11]: `` Amine then has sailed for Goa with Father Mathias !
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 12]: I feel that she is safe , and in good hands .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 17]: He is an excellent man , that Father Mathias -- my mind is much relieved . ''
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 14]: `` Yes ; but recollect you are in the power of your enemy .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 18]: We must leave this place as quick as we can -- to-morrow we must sign the paper .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 43]: It is of little consequence , as we shall probably be at Goa before it arrives , and even if we are not , the news of your death would not occasion Amine to marry this little withered piece of mortality . ''
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 16]: `` That I feel assured of ; but it may cause her great suffering . ''
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 26]: `` Not worse than her present suspense , believe me , Philip ; but it is useless canvassing the past -- it must be done .
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 21]: I shall sign as Cornelius Richter , our third mate ; you , as Jacob Vantreat -- recollect that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 23]: `` Agreed , '' replied Philip , who then turned away , as if willing to be left to his own thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 17]: Krantz perceived it , and laid down under the embrasure , and was soon fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 50]: Chapter XXXII Tired out with the fatigue of the day before , Philip had laid himself down by Krantz and fallen asleep ; early the next morning he was awakened by the sound of the Commandant 's voice , and his long sword rattling as usual upon the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 23]: He rose , and found the little man rating the soldiers -- threatening some with the dungeon , others with extra duty .
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 16]: Krantz was also on his feet before the Commandant had finished his morning 's lecture .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 20]: At last , perceiving them , in a stern voice he ordered them to follow him into his apartment .
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 31]: They did so , and the Commandant throwing himself upon his sofa , inquired whether they were ready to sign the required paper , or go back to the dungeon .
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 71]: -- Krantz replied that they had been calculating chances , and that they were in consequence so perfectly convinced of the death of the captain , that they were willing to sign any paper to that effect ; at which reply , the Commandant immediately became very gracious , and having called for materials , he wrote out the document , which was duly subscribed to by Krantz and Philip .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 33]: As soon as they had signed it , and he had it in his possession , the little man was so pleased , that he requested them to partake of his breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 17]: During the repast , he promised that they should leave the island by the first opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 20]: Although Philip was taciturn , yet as Krantz made himself very agreeable , the Commandant invited them to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 34]: Krantz , as they became more familiar , informed him that they had each a few pieces of gold , and wished to be allowed a room where they could keep their table .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 43]: Whether it was the want of society or the desire of obtaining the gold , probably both , the Commandant offered that they should join his table and pay their proportion of the expenses ; a proposal which was gladly acceded to .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 19]: The terms were arranged , and Krantz insisted upon putting down the first week 's payment in advance .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 31]: From that moment the Commandant was the best of friends with them , and did nothing but caress them whom he had so politely shoved into a dungeon below water .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 75]: It was on the evening of the third day , as they were smoking their Manilla cheroots , that Krantz , perceiving the Commandant in a peculiarly good humour , ventured to ask him why he was so anxious for a certificate of the captain 's death ; and in reply was informed , much to the astonishment of Philip , that Amine had agreed to marry him upon his producing such a document .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 12]: `` Impossible , '' cried Philip , starting from his seat .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 10]: `` Impossible , signor , and why impossible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 17]: replied the Commandant curling his mustachios with his fingers , with a surprised and angry air .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 85]: `` I should have said impossible too , '' interrupted Krantz , who perceived the consequences of Philip 's indiscretion , `` for had you seen , Commandant , how that woman doted upon her husband , how she fondled him , you would with us have said , it was impossible that she could have transferred her affections so soon ; but women are women , and soldiers have a great advantage over other people ; perhaps she has some excuse , Commandant .
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 12]: -- Here 's your health , and success to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 44]: `` It is exactly what I would have said , '' added Philip , acting upon Krantz 's plan : `` but she has a great excuse , Commandant , when I recollect her husband , and have you in my presence . ''
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 26]: Soothed with the flattery , the Commandant replied , `` Why , yes , they say military men are very successful with the fair sex .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 36]: -- I presume it is because they look up to us for protection , and where can they be better assured of it , than with a man who wears a sword at his thigh .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 11]: -- Come , signors , we will drink her health .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 9]: Here 's to the beautiful Amine Vanderdecken . ''
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 16]: `` To the beautiful Amine Vanderdecken , '' cried Krantz , tossing off his wine .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 11]: `` To the beautiful Amine Vanderdecken , '' followed Philip .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 35]: `` But , Commandant , are you not afraid to trust her at Goa , where there are so many enticements for a woman , so many allurements held out for her sex ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 28]: `` No , not in the least -- I am convinced that she loves me -- nay , between ourselves , that she doats upon me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 4]: `` Liar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 3]: exclaimed Philip .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 5]: `` How , signor !
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 7]: is that addressed to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 13]: cried the Commandant , seizing his sword which lay on the table .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 39]: `` No , no , '' replied Philip , recovering himself ; `` it was addressed to her ; I have heard her swear to her husband , that she would exist for no other but him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 3]: `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 5]: Is that all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 15]: replied the Commandant , `` my friend , you do not know women . ''
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 37]: `` No , nor is he very partial to them either , '' replied Krantz , who then leant over to the Commandant and whispered , `` He is always so when you talk of women .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 13]: He was cruelly jilted once , and hates the whole sex . ''
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 23]: `` Then we must be merciful to him , '' replied the little officer : `` suppose we change the subject . ''
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 32]: When they repaired to their own room , Krantz pointed out to Philip the necessity for his commanding his feelings , as otherwise they would again be immured in the dungeon .
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 39]: Philip acknowledged his rashness , but pointed out to Krantz , that the circumstance of Amine having promised to marry the Commandant , if he procured certain intelligence of his death , was the cause of his irritation .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 6]: `` Can it be so ?
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 33]: Is it possible that she can have been so false , '' exclaimed Philip ; `` yet his anxiety to procure that document seems to warrant the truth of his assertion . ''
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 52]: `` I think , Philip , that in all probability it is true , '' replied Krantz , carelessly ; `` but of this you may be assured that she has been placed in a situation of great peril , and has only done so to save herself for your sake .
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 50]: When you meet , depend upon it she will fully prove to you that necessity had compelled her to deceive him in that way , and that if she had not done so , she would , by this time , have fallen a prey to his violence . ''
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 12]: `` It may be so , '' replied Philip , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 12]: `` It is so , Philip , my life upon it .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 19]: Do not for a moment harbour a thought so injurious to one who lives but in your love .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 7]: Suspect that fond and devoted creature !
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 9]: I blush for you , Philip Vanderdecken . ''
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 67]: `` You are right , and I beg her pardon for allowing such feelings or thoughts to have for one moment overpowered me , '' responded Philip ; `` but it is a hard case for a husband , who loves as I do , to hear his wife 's name bandied about , and her character assailed by a contemptible wretch like this Commandant . ''
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 28]: `` It is , I grant ; but still I prefer even that to a dungeon , '' replied Krantz , `` and so , good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 51]: For three weeks they remained in the fort , every day becoming more intimate with the Commandant , who often communicated with Krantz , when Philip was not present , turning the conversation upon his love for Amine , and entering into a minute detail of all that had passed .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 25]: Krantz perceived that he was right in his opinion , and that Amine had only been cajoling the Commandant , that she might escape .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 18]: But the time passed heavily away with Philip and Krantz , for no vessel made its appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 9]: `` When shall I see her again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 16]: soliloquised Philip one morning as he lolled over the parapet , in company with Krantz .
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 3]: `` See !
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 3]: who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 12]: said the Commandant , who happened to be at his elbow .
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 9]: Philip turned round , and stammered something unintelligible .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 23]: `` We were talking of his sister , Commandant , '' said Krantz , taking his arm , and leading him away .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 32]: -- `` Do not mention the subject to my friend , for it is a very painful one , and forms one reason why he is so inimical to the sex .
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 36]: She was married to his intimate friend , and ran away from her husband : it was his only sister ; and the disgrace broke his mother 's heart , and has made him miserable .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 10]: Take no notice of it , I beg . ''
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 31]: `` No , no , certainly not ; I do n't wonder at it : the honour of one 's family is a serious affair , '' replied the Commandant .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 33]: -- `` Poor young man , what with his sister 's conduct , and the falsehood of his own intended , I do n't wonder at his being so grave and silent .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 9]: Is he of good family , signor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 59]: `` One of the noblest in all Holland , '' replied Krantz ; -- `` he is heir to a large property , and independent by the fortune of his mother ; but these two unfortunate events induced him to quit the States secretly , and he embarked for these countries that he might forget his grief . ''
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 8]: `` One of the noblest families ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 26]: replied the Commandant ; -- `` then he is under an assumed name -- Jacob Vantreat is not his true name , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 29]: `` Oh no , '' replied Krantz ; -- `` that it is not , I assure you ; but my lips are sealed on that point . ''
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 15]: `` Of course , except to a friend , who can keep a secret .
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 7]: I will not ask it now .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 7]: So he is really noble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 25]: `` One of the highest families in the country , possessing great wealth and influence -- allied to the Spanish nobility by marriage . ''
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 20]: rejoined the Commandant , musing -- `` I dare say he knows many of the Portuguese as well . ''
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 15]: `` No doubt of it , they are all more or less connected . ''
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 15]: `` He must prove to you a most valuable friend , Signor Richter . ''
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 15]: `` I consider myself provided for for life as soon as we return home .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 27]: He is of a very grateful , generous disposition , as he would prove to you , should you ever fall in with him again . ''
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 24]: `` I have no doubt of it ; and I can assure you that I am heartily tired of staying in this country .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 40]: Here I shall remain probably for two years more before I am relieved , and then shall have to join my regiment at Goa , and not be able to obtain leave to return home without resigning my commission .
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 8]: But he is coming this way . ''
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 28]: After this conversation with Krantz , the alteration in the manner of the Portuguese Commandant , who had the highest respect for nobility , was most marked .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 35]: He treated Philip with a respect , which was observable to all in the fort ; and which was , until Krantz had explained the cause , a source of astonishment to Philip himself .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 52]: The Commandant often introduced the subject to Krantz , and sounded him as to whether his conduct towards Philip had been such , as to have made a favourable impression ; for the little man now hoped , that , through such an influential channel , he might reap some benefit .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 46]: Some days after this conversation , as they were all three seated at table , a corporal entered , and saluting the Commandant , informed him that a Dutch sailor had arrived at the fort , and wished to know whether he should be admitted .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 22]: Both Philip and Krantz turned pale at this communication -- they had a presentiment of evil , but they said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 25]: The sailor was ordered in , and in a few minutes , who should make his appearance but their tormentor , the one-eyed Schriften .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 16]: On perceiving Philip and Krantz seated at the table he immediately exclaimed , `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 30]: Captain Philip Vanderdecken , and my good friend Mynheer Krantz , first mate of the good ship _ Utrecht _ , I am glad to meet you again . ''
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 6]: `` Captain Philip Vanderdecken ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 11]: roared the Commandant , as he sprung from his chair .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 42]: `` Yes , that is my Captain , Mynheer Philip Vanderdecken ; and that is my first mate , Mynheer Krantz ; both of the good ship _ Utrecht _ : we were wrecked together , were we not , Mynheer ?
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 2]: He !
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 3]: he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 6]: `` Sangue de -- Vanderdecken !
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 3]: the husband ?
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 9]: Corpo del Diavolo -- is it possible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 39]: cried the Commandant , panting for breath , as he seized his long sword with both hands , and clenched it with fury -- `` What then , I have been deceived , cajoled , laughed at ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 42]: Then , after a pause -- the veins of his forehead distending so as almost to burst -- he continued , with a suppressed voice , `` Most noble sir , I thank you ; but now it is my turn .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 5]: -- What , ho !
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 2]: there !
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 10]: Corporal -- men , here instantly -- quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 11]: Philip and Krantz felt convinced that all denial was useless .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 9]: Philip folded his arms and made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 23]: Krantz merely observed , `` A little reflection will prove to you , sir , that this indignation is not warranted . ''
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 5]: `` Not warranted ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 22]: rejoined the Commandant with a sneer ; `` you have deceived me ; but you are caught in your own trap .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 16]: I have the paper signed , which I shall not fail to make use of .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 30]: _ You _ are dead , you know , captain ; I have your own hand to it , and your wife will be glad to believe it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 22]: `` She has deceived you , Commandant , to get out of your power , nothing more , '' said Vanderdecken .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 20]: `` She would spurn a contemptible withered wretch like yourself , were she as free as the wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 14]: `` Go on , go on ; it will be my turn soon .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 19]: Corporal , throw these two men into the dungeon : a sentry at the door till further orders .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 4]: Away with them .
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 21]: Most noble sir , perhaps your influential friends in Holland and Spain will enable you to get out again . ''
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 21]: Philip and Krantz were led away by the soldiers , who were very much surprised at this change of treatment .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 47]: Schriften followed them ; and as they walked across the rampart to the stairs which led to their prison , Krantz , in his fury , burst from the soldiers , and bestowed a kick upon Schriften which sent him several feet forward on his face .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 9]: `` That was a good one -- he !
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 3]: he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 14]: cried Schriften , smiling and looking at Krantz as he regained his legs .
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 24]: There was an eye , however , which met theirs with an intelligent glance , as they descended the stairs to the dungeon .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 8]: It was that of the soldier Pedro .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 28]: It told them that there was one friend upon whom they could rely , and who would spare no endeavour to assist them in their new difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 38]: It was a consolation to them both ; a ray of hope which cheered them as they once more descended the narrow steps , and heard the heavy key turned which again secured them in their dungeon .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 30]: Chapter XXXIII `` Thus are all our hopes wrecked , '' said Philip , mournfully ; `` what chance have we now of escaping from this little tyrant ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 20]: `` Chances turn up , '' replied Krantz ; `` at present , the prospect is not very cheering .
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 8]: Let us hope for the best . ''
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 34]: `` I have an idea in my head which may probably be turned to some account , '' added Krantz ; `` as soon as the little man 's fury is over . ''
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 27]: `` Which is -- '' `` That , much as he likes your wife , there is something which he likes quite as well -- money .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 37]: Now , as we know where all the treasure is concealed , I think he may be tempted to offer us our liberty , if we were to promise to put it into his possession . ''
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 6]: `` That is not impossible .
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 20]: Confound that little malignant wretch Schriften ; he certainly is not , as you say , of this world .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 20]: He has been my persecutor through life , and appears to act from an impulse not his own . ''
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 12]: `` Then must he be part and portion of your destiny .
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 19]: I 'm thinking whether our noble Commandant intends to leave us without anything to eat or drink . ''
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 37]: `` I should not be surprised : that he will attempt my life I am convinced of , but not that he can take it ; he may , however , add to its sufferings . ''
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 38]: As soon as the Commandant had recovered from his fury , he ordered Schriften in , to be examined more particularly ; but after every search made for him , Schriften was no where to be found .
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 23]: The sentry at the gate declared that he had not passed ; and a new search was ordered , but in vain .
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 13]: Even the dungeons and galleries below were examined , but without success .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 12]: `` Can he be locked up with the other prisoners ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 15]: thought the Commandant : `` impossible -- but I will go and see . ''
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 78]: He descended and opened the door of the dungeon , looked in , and was about to return without speaking , when Krantz said , `` Well , signor , this is kind treatment , after having lived so long and so amicably together ; to throw us into prison merely because a fellow declares that we are not what we represented ourselves to be ; perhaps you will allow us a little water to drink ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 17]: The Commandant , confused by the extraordinary disappearance of Schriften , hardly knew how to reply .
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 26]: He at last said in a milder tone than was to be anticipated , `` I will order them to bring some , signor . ''
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 11]: He then closed the door of the dungeon and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 15]: `` Strange , '' observed Philip , `` he appears more pacified already . ''
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 20]: In a few minutes the door was again opened , and Pedro came in with a chatty of water .
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 17]: `` He has disappeared like magic , signors , and is no where to be found .
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 10]: We have searched everywhere , but in vain . ''
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 3]: `` Who ?
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 7]: -- the little old seaman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 14]: `` Yes , he whom you kicked as you were led to prison .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 13]: The people all say , that it must have been a ghost .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 39]: The sentry declares that he never left the fort , nor came near him ; so , how he has got away is a riddle , which I perceive , has frightened our Commandant not a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 11]: Krantz gave a long whistle as he looked at Philip .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 12]: `` Are you to have charge of us , Pedro ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 6]: `` I hope so . ''
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 25]: `` Well , tell the Commandant that when he is ready to listen to me , I have something of importance to communicate . ''
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 4]: Pedro went out .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 34]: `` Now , Philip , I can frighten this little man into allowing us to go free , if you will consent to say that you are not the husband of Amine . ''
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 9]: `` That I can not do , Krantz .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 9]: I will not utter such a falsehood . ''
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 25]: `` I was afraid so , and yet it appears to me that we may avail ourselves of duplicity to meet cruelty and injustice .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 27]: Unless you do as I propose , I hardly know how I can manage it ; however , I will try what I can do . ''
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 21]: `` I will assist you in every way , except disclaiming my wife : that I never will do . ''
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 25]: `` Well then , I will see if I can make up a story that will suit all parties : let me think . ''
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 30]: Krantz continued musing as he walked up and down , and was still occupied with his own thoughts when the door opened , and the Commandant made his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 17]: `` You have something to impart to me , I understand -- what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 18]: `` First , sir , bring that little wretch down here and confront him with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 25]: `` I see no occasion for that , '' replied the Commandant ; `` what , sir , may you have to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 19]: `` Do you know who you have in your company when you speak to that one-eyed deformity ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 9]: `` A Dutch sailor , I presume . ''
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 26]: `` No -- a spirit -- a demon -- who occasioned the loss of the vessel ; and who brings misfortune wherever he appears . ''
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 4]: `` Holy Virgin !
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 9]: What do you tell me , signor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 7]: `` The fact , signor Commandant .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 23]: We are obliged to you for confining us here , while he is in the fort ; but beware for yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 8]: `` You are laughing at me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 10]: `` I am not ; bring him down here .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 8]: This noble gentleman has power over him .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 29]: I wonder , indeed , at his daring to stay while he is so near ; he has on his heart that which will send him trembling away .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 20]: -- Bring him down here , and you shall at once see him vanish with curses and screams . ''
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 6]: `` Heaven defend us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 6]: cried the Commandant , terrified .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 9]: `` Send for him now , signor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 13]: `` He is gone -- vanished -- not to be found ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 12]: `` I thought as much , '' replied Philip , significantly .
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 10]: `` He is gone -- vanished -- you say .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 28]: Then , Commandant , you will probably apologise to this noble gentleman for your treatment of him , and permit us to return to our former apartments .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 14]: I will there explain to you this most strange and interesting history . ''
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 14]: The Commandant , more confused than ever , hardly knew how to act .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 45]: At last he bowed to Philip , and begged that he would consider himself at liberty ; and , continued he to Krantz , `` I shall be most happy at an immediate explanation of this affair , for everything appears so contradictory . ''
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 9]: `` And must , until it is explained .
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 33]: I will follow you into your own room ; a courtesy you must not expect from my noble friend , who is not a little indignant at your treatment of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 10]: The Commandant went out , leaving the door open .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 26]: Philip and Krantz followed : the former retiring to his own apartment ; the latter , bending his steps after the Commandant to his sitting-room .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 17]: The confusion which whirled in the brain of the Commandant , made him appear most ridiculous .
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 80]: He hardly knew whether to be imperative or civil ; whether he was really speaking to the first mate of the vessel , or to another party ; or whether he had insulted a noble , or been cajoled by a captain of a vessel : he threw himself down on his sofa , and Krantz , taking his seat in a chair , stated as follows : `` You have been partly deceived and partly not , Commandant .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 52]: When we first came here , not knowing what treatment we might receive , we concealed our rank ; afterwards I made known to you the rank of my friend on shore ; but did not think it worth while to say anything about his situation on board of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 39]: The fact is , as you may well suppose of a person of his dignity , he was owner of the fine ship which was lost through the intervention of that one-eyed wretch ; but of that by-and-bye .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 5]: Now for the story .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 51]: `` About ten years ago there was a great miser in Amsterdam ; he lived in the most miserable way that a man could live in ; wore nothing but rags ; and having been formerly a seaman , his attire was generally of the description common to his class .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 21]: He had one son , to whom he denied the necessaries of life , and whom he treated most cruelly .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 73]: After vain attempts to possess a portion of his father 's wealth , the devil instigated the son to murder the old man , who was one day found dead in his bed ; but as there were no marks of violence which could be sworn to , although suspicion fell upon the son , the affair was hushed up , and the young man took possession of his father 's wealth .
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 51]: It was fully expected that there would now be rioting and squandering on the part of the heir , as is usually the case ; but , on the contrary , he never spent anything , but appeared to be as poor -- even poorer -- than he ever was .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 39]: Instead of being gay and merry , he was , in appearance , the most miserable , downcast person in the world ; and he wandered about , seeking a crust of bread wherever he could find it .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 36]: Some said that he had been inoculated by his father , and was as great a miser as his father had been ; others shook their heads , and said that all was not right .
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 37]: At last , after pining away for six or seven years , the young man died at an early age , without confession or absolution ; in fact , he was found dead in his bed .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 74]: Beside the bed there was a paper , addressed to the authorities , in which he acknowledged that he had murdered his father for the sake of his wealth ; and that when he went to take some of it for his expenses on the day afterwards , he found his father 's spirit sitting on the bags of money , and menacing him with instant death , if he touched one piece .
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 15]: He returned again and again , and found his father a sentinel as before .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 34]: At last , he gave up attempting to obtain it ; his crime made him miserable , and he continued in possession , without daring to expend one sixpence of all the money .
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 46]: He requested that , as his end was approaching , the money should be given to the church of his patron saint , wherever that church might be found ; if there was not one , then that a church might be built and endowed .
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 85]: Upon investigation , it appeared that there was no such church in either Holland or the Low Countries -LRB- for you know that there are not many Catholics there -RRB- ; and they applied to the Catholic countries , Lisbon and Spain , but there again they were at fault ; and it was discovered , that the only church dedicated to that saint was one which had been erected by a Portuguese nobleman in the city of Goa , in the East Indies .
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 44]: The Catholic bishop determined that the money should be sent to Goa ; and , in consequence , it was embarked on board of my patron 's vessel , to be delivered up to the first Portuguese authorities he might fall in with .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 59]: `` Well , signor , the money , for better security , was put down into the captain 's cabin , which , of course , was occupied by my noble friend , and when he went to bed the first night he was surprised to perceive a little one eyed old man sitting on the boxes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 5]: `` Merciful Saviour ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 19]: exclaimed the Commandant , `` what , the very same little man who appeared here this day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 9]: `` The very same , '' replied Krantz .
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 53]: The Commandant crossed himself , and Krantz proceeded : -- `` My noble patron was , as you may imagine , rather alarmed ; but he is very courageous in disposition , and he inquired of the old man who he was , and how he had come on board ? '' '
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 14]: I came on board with my own money , ' replied the spectre .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 12]: It is all my own , and I shall keep it .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 16]: The church shall never have one stiva of it if I can help it . '
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 39]: `` Whereupon , my patron pulled out a famous relic , which he wears on his bosom , and held it towards him ; at which the old man howled and screamed , and then most unwillingly disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 44]: For two more nights the spectre was obstinate , but at the sight of the relic , he invariably went off howling as if in great pain ; every time that he went away , invariably crying out ` Lost -- lost ! '
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 15]: and during the remainder of the voyage he did not trouble us any more .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 64]: `` We thought , when our patron told us this , that he referred to the money being lost to him , but it appears he referred to the ship ; indeed it was very inconsiderate to have taken the wealth of a parricide on board ; we could not expect any good fortune with such a freight , and so it proved .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 81]: When the ship was lost , our patron was very anxious to save the money ; it was put on the raft , and when we landed , it was taken on shore and buried , that it might be restored and given to the church to which it had been bequeathed ; but the men who buried it are all dead , and there is no one but my friend here , the patron , who knows the spot .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 38]: -- I forgot to say , that as soon as the money was landed on the island and buried , the spectre appeared as before , and seated himself over the spot where the money was interred .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 20]: I think , if this had not been the case , the seamen would have taken possession of it .
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 42]: But , by his appearance here this day , I presume he is tired , and has deserted his charge , or else has come here that the money might be sent for , though I can not understand why . ''
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 6]: `` Strange -- very strange !
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 13]: -- so there is a large treasure buried in the sand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 5]: `` There is . ''
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 19]: `` I should think , by the spectre 's coming here , that it has abandoned it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 14]: `` Of course it has , or it would not be here . ''
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 15]: `` What can you imagine to have been the cause of its coming ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 26]: `` Probably to announce its intention , and request my friend to have the treasure sent for ; but you know he was interrupted . ''
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 12]: `` Very true ; but he called your friend Vanderdecken . ''
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 15]: `` It was the name which he took on board of the ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 11]: `` And it was the name of the lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 23]: `` Very true ; he fell in with her at the Cape of Good Hope and brought her away with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 8]: `` Then she is his wife ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 8]: `` I must not answer that question .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 13]: It is quite sufficient that he treats her as his wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 2]: indeed .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 5]: But about this treasure .
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 20]: You say that no one knows where it is buried , but the patron as you call him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 5]: `` No one . ''
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 25]: `` Will you express my regret at what has passed , and tell him I will have the pleasure of seeing him to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 25]: `` Certainly , signor , '' replied Krantz , rising from his chair ; and wishing the Commandant a good evening as he retired .
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 11]: `` I was after one thing and have found another .
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 30]: A spectre that must have been ; but he must be a bold spectre that can frighten me from doubloons -- besides , I can call in the priests .
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 44]: Now , let me see ; if I let this man go on condition that he reveals the site of the treasure to the authorities , that is to _ me _ , why then I need not lose the fair young woman .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 23]: If I forward this paper to her , why then I gain her -- but I must first get rid of him .
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 9]: Of the two , I prefer -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 4]: -- the gold !
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 7]: But I can not obtain both .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 36]: At all events , let me obtain the money first : I want it more than the church does : but , if I do get the money ; these two men can expose me .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 23]: I must get rid of them ; silence them for ever -- and then perhaps I may obtain the fair Amine also .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 23]: Yes , their death will be necessary to secure either -- that is , after I have the first in my possession .
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 6]: -- Let me think . ''
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 20]: For some minutes the Commandant walked up and down the room , reflecting upon the best method of proceeding .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 38]: `` He says it was a spectre , and he has told a plausible story , '' thought he ; `` but I do n't know -- I have my doubts -- they may be tricking me .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 27]: Well , be it so : if the money is there , I will have it ; and if not , I will have my revenge .
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 38]: I have it : not only must they be removed , but by degrees all the others too who assist in bringing the treasure away ; -- then -- but -- who 's there , Pedro ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 6]: `` Yes , signor . ''
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 9]: `` How long have you been here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 16]: `` But as you spoke , signor : I thought I heard you call . ''
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 10]: `` You may go -- I want nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 24]: Pedro departed ; but he had been some time in the room , and had overheard the whole of the Commandant 's soliloquy .
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 26]: Chapter XXXIV It was a bright morning when the Portuguese vessel on which Amine was on board entered into the bay and roadstead of Goa .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 33]: Goa was then at its zenith -- a proud , luxurious , superb , wealthy city , the capital of the East , a City of Palaces , whose Viceroy reigned supreme .
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 46]: As they approached the river the two mouths of which form the island upon which Goa is built , the passengers were all on deck ; and the Portuguese captain , who had often been there , pointed out to Amine the most remarkable buildings .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 44]: When they had passed the forts they entered the river , the whole line of whose banks were covered with the country seats of the nobility and hidalgos -- splendid buildings embosomed in groves of orange trees , whose perfume scented the air .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 30]: `` There , signora , is the country palace of the Viceroy , '' said the captain , pointing to a building which covered nearly three acres of ground .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 53]: The ship sailed on until they arrived nearly abreast of the town , when Amine 's eyes were directed to the lofty spires of the churches and other public edifices -- for Amine had seen but little of cities during her life , as may be perceived when her history is recollected .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 23]: `` That is the Jesuits ' church , with their establishment , '' said the captain , pointing to a magnificent pile .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 38]: `` In the church , now opening upon us , lay the canonised bones of the celebrated Saint Francisco , who sacrificed his life in his zeal for the propagation of the gospel in these countries . ''
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 22]: `` I have heard of him from Father Mathias , '' replied Amine ; `` but what building is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 18]: `` The Augustine convent ; and the other , to the right , is the Dominican . ''
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 6]: `` Splendid , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 3]: observed Amine .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 59]: `` The building you see now , on the water-side , is the Viceroy 's palace ; that to the right , again , is the convent of the barefooted Carmelites : yon lofty spire is the cathedral of St Catherine , and that beautiful and light piece of architecture is the church of our Lady of Pity .
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 18]: You observe there a building , with a dome , rising behind the Viceroy 's palace ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 8]: `` I do , '' replied Amine .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 8]: `` That is the Holy Inquisition . ''
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 39]: Although Amine had heard Philip speak of the inquisition , she knew little about its properties ; but a sudden tremor passed through her frame as the name was mentioned , which she could not herself account for .
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 47]: `` Now we open upon the Viceroy 's palace , and you perceive what a beautiful building it is , '' continued the captain ; `` that large pile a little above it is the Custom-house , abreast of which we shall come to an anchor .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 9]: I must leave you now , signora . ''
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 11]: A few minutes afterwards the ship anchored opposite the Custom-house .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 33]: The captain and passengers went on shore , with the exception of Amine , who remained in the vessel , while Father Mathias went in search of an eligible place of abode .
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 101]: The next morning the priest returned on board the ship , with the intelligence that he had obtained a reception for Amine in the Ursuline convent , the abbess of which establishment he was acquainted with ; and , before Amine went on shore , he cautioned her that the lady-abbess was a strict woman , and would be pleased if she conformed , as much as possible , to the rules of the convent ; that this convent only received young persons of the highest and most wealthy families , and he trusted that she would be happy there .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 26]: He also promised to call upon her , and talk upon those subjects so dear to his heart , and so necessary to her salvation .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 63]: The earnestness and kindness with which the old man spoke melted Amine to tears , and the holy father quitted her side to go down and collect her baggage , with a warmth of feeling towards her which he had seldom felt before , and with greater hopes than ever that his endeavours to convert her would not ultimately be thrown away .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 20]: `` He is a good man , '' thought Amine , as she descended -- and Amine was right .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 18]: Father Mathias was a good man , but , like all men , he was not perfect .
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 37]: A zealot in the cause of his religion , he would have cheerfully sacrificed his life as a martyr , but if opposed or thwarted in his views , he could then be cruel and unjust .
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 13]: Father Mathias had many reasons for placing Amine in the Ursuline convent .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 53]: He felt bound to offer her that protection which he had so long received under her roof ; he wished her to be under the surveillance of the abbess , for he could not help imagining , although he had no proof , that she was still essaying or practising forbidden arts .
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 43]: He did not state this to the abbess , as he felt it would be unjust to raise suspicions ; but he represented Amine as one who would do honour to their faith , to which she was not yet quite converted .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 49]: The very idea of effecting a conversion is to the tenants of a convent an object of surpassing interest , and the abbess was much better pleased to receive one who required her councils and persuasions , than a really pious Christian who would give her no trouble .
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 26]: Amine went on shore with Father Mathias ; she refused the palanquin which had been prepared for her , and walked up to the convent .
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 49]: They landed between the Custom-house and the Viceroy 's palace , passed through to the large square behind it , and then went up the Strada Diretta , or Straight Street , which led up to the Church of Pity , near to which the convent is situated .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 32]: This street is the finest on Goa , and is called Strada Diretta , from the singular fact that almost all the streets in Goa are quadrants or segments of circles .
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 48]: Amine was astonished : the houses were of stone , lofty and massive ; at each story was thrown out a balcony of marble , elaborately carved ; and over each door were the arms of the nobility , or hidalgos , to whom the houses belonged .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 85]: The square behind the palace , and the wide streets , were filled with living beings ; elephants with gorgeous trappings ; led or mounted horses in superb housings ; palanquins , carried by natives in splendid liveries ; running footmen ; syces ; every variety of nation , from the proud Portuguese to the half-covered native ; Mussulmans , Arabs , Hindoos , Armenians ; officers and soldiers in their uniforms , all crowded and thronged together : all was bustle and motion .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 30]: Such was the wealth , the splendour , and luxury of the proud city of Goa -- the Empress of the East at the time we are now describing .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 53]: In half an hour they forced their way through the crowd , and arrived at the convent , where Amine was well received by the abbess ; and after a few minutes ' conversation , Father Mathias took his leave : upon which the abbess immediately set about her task of conversion .
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 50]: The first thing she did was to order some dried sweetmeats -- not a bad beginning , as they were palatable ; but as she happened to be very ignorant , and unaccustomed to theological disputes , her subsequent arguments did not go down as well as the fruit .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 24]: After a rambling discourse of about an hour , the old lady felt tired , and felt as if she had done wonders .
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 19]: Amine was then introduced to the nuns , most of whom were young and all of good family .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 39]: Her dormitory was shown to her , and expressing a wish to be alone , she was followed into her chamber by only sixteen of them , which was about as many as the chamber could well hold .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 15]: We must pass over the two months during which Amine remained in the convent .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 32]: Father Mathias had taken every step to ascertain if her husband had been saved upon any of the islands which were under the Portuguese dominions , but could gain no information .
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 31]: Amine was soon weary of the convent ; she was persecuted by the harangues of the old abbess , but more disgusted at the conduct and conversation of the nuns .
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 45]: They all had secrets to confide to her -- secrets which had been confided to the whole convent before : such secrets , such stories , so different from Amine 's chaste ideas , such impurity of thought that Amine was disgusted at them .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 45]: But how could it be otherwise ; the poor creatures had been taken from the world in the full bloom of youth under a ripening sun , and had been immured in this unnatural manner to gratify the avarice and pride of their families .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 66]: Its inmates being wholly composed of the best families , the rules of this convent were not so strict as others ; licenses were given -- greater licenses were taken -- and Amine , to her surprise , found that in this society , devoted to Heaven , there were exhibited more of the bad passions of human nature than she had before met with .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 56]: Constantly watched , never allowed a moment to herself , her existence became unbearable : and after three months she requested Father Mathias would find her some other place of refuge ; telling him frankly that her residence in that place was not very likely to assist her conversion to the tenets of his faith .
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 16]: Father Mathias fully comprehended her , but replied , `` I have no means . ''
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 36]: `` Here are means , '' replied Amine , taking the diamond ring from her finger : `` this is worth eight hundred ducats in our country ; here I know not how much . ''
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 6]: Father Mathias took the ring .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 18]: `` I will call upon you to-morrow morning , and let you know what I have done .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 33]: I shall acquaint the lady abbess that you are going to your husband , for it would not be safe to let her suppose that you have reasons for quitting the convent .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 28]: I have heard what you state mentioned before , but have treated it as scandal ; but you , I know , are incapable of falsehood . ''
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 37]: The next day Father Mathias returned , and had an interview with the abbess , who after a time sent for Amine , and told her that it was necessary that she should leave the convent .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 81]: She consoled her as well as she could at leaving such a happy place , sent for some sweetmeats to make the parting less trying , gave her her blessing , and made her over to Father Mathias ; who , when they were alone , informed Amine that he had disposed of the ring for eighteen hundred dollars , and had procured apartments for her in the house of a widow lady , with whom she was to board .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 39]: Taking leave of the nuns , Amine quitted the convent with Father Mathias , and was soon installed in her new apartments , in a house which formed part of a spacious square called the Terra di Sabaio .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 12]: After the introduction to her hostess , Father Mathias left her .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 12]: Amine found her apartments fronting the square , airy and commodious .
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 33]: The landlady , who had escorted her to view them , not having left her , she inquired `` what large church that was on the other side of the square ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 32]: `` It is the Ascension , '' replied the lady ; `` the music is very fine there ; we will go and hear it to-morrow , if you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 11]: `` And that massive building in face of us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 15]: `` That is the Holy Inquisition , '' said the widow , crossing herself .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 9]: Amine again started , she knew not why .
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 7]: `` Is that your child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 15]: said Amine , as a boy of about twelve years old entered the room .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 17]: `` Yes , '' replied the widow , `` the only one that is left me .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 6]: May God preserve him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 29]: The boy was handsome and intelligent , and Amine , for her own reasons , did everything she could to make friends with him , and was successful .
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 38]: Chapter XXXV Amine had just returned from an afternoon 's walk through the streets of Goa ; she had made some purchases at different shops in the bazaar , and had brought them home under her mantilla .
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 28]: `` Here , at last , thank Heaven , I am alone and not watched , '' thought Amine , as she threw herself on the couch .
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 10]: `` Philip , Philip , where are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 17]: exclaimed she ; `` I have now the means , and I soon will know . ''
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 22]: Little Pedro , the son of the widow , entered the room , ran up to Amine , and kissed her .
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 12]: `` Tell me , Pedro , where is your mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 17]: `` She has gone out to see her friends this evening , and we are alone .
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 7]: I will stay with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 6]: `` Do so , dearest .
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 12]: Tell me , Pedro , can you keep a secret ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 11]: `` Yes , I will -- tell it me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 33]: `` Nay , I have nothing to tell , but I wish to do something : I wish to make a play , and you shall see things in your hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 10]: yes , shew me , do shew me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 9]: `` If you promise not to tell . ''
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 13]: `` No , by the Holy Virgin , I will not . ''
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 7]: `` Then you shall see . ''
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 61]: Amine lighted some charcoal in a chafing dish , and put it at her feet ; she then took a reed pen , some ink from a small bottle , and a pair of scissors , and wrote down several characters on a paper , singing , or rather chanting , words which were not intelligible to her young companion .
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 47]: Amine then threw frankincense and coriander seed into the chafing dish , which threw out a strong aromatic smoke ; and desiring Pedro to sit down by her on a small stool , she took the boy 's right hand and held it in her own .
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 46]: She then drew upon the palm of his hand a square figure with characters on each side of it , and in the centre poured a small quantity of the ink , so as to form a black mirror of the size of a half-a-crown .
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 23]: `` Now all is ready , '' said Amine ; `` look , Pedro , what see you in the ink ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 10]: `` My own face , '' replied the boy .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 21]: She threw more frankincense upon the chafing dish , until the room was full of smoke , and then chanted .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 11]: `` Turshoon , turyo-shoon -- come down , come down .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 10]: `` Be present , ye servants of these names .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 10]: `` Remove the veil , and be correct . ''
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 38]: The characters she had drawn upon the paper she had divided with the scissors , and now taking one of the pieces , she dropped it into the chafing dish , still holding the boy 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 13]: `` Tell me now , Pedro , what do you see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 13]: `` I see a man sweeping , '' replied Pedro , alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 11]: `` Fear not , Pedro , you shall see more .
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 6]: Has he done sweeping ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 7]: `` Yes , he has . ''
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 29]: And Amine muttered words , which were unintelligible , and threw into the chafing dish the other half of the paper with the characters she had written down .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 12]: `` Say now , Pedro , Philip Vanderdecken , appear . ''
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 7]: `` Philip Vanderdecken , appear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 6]: responded the boy , trembling .
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 14]: `` Tell me what thou seest , Pedro -- tell me true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 5]: said Amine , anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 22]: `` I see a man lying down on the white sand ; -LRB- I do n't like this play . -RRB- ''
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 13]: `` Be not alarmed , Pedro , you shall have sweetmeats directly .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 13]: Tell me what thou seest , how the man is dressed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 30]: `` He has a short coat -- he has white trousers -- he looks about him -- he takes something out of his breast and kisses it . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 4]: 'T is he !
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 4]: 't is he !
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 4]: and he lives !
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 6]: Heaven , I thank thee .
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 6]: Look again , boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 22]: `` He gets up -LRB- I do n't like this play ; I am frightened ; indeed I am . -RRB- ''
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 5]: `` Fear not . ''
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 51]: `` Oh , yes , I am -- I can not , '' replied Pedro , falling on his knees ; `` pray let me go , '' Pedro had turned his hand , and spilt the ink , the charm was broken , and Amine could learn no more .
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 44]: She soothed the boy with presents , made him repeat his promise that he would not tell , and postponed further search into fate until the boy should appear to have recovered from his terror , and be willing to resume the ceremonies .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 15]: `` My Philip lives -- mother , dear mother , I thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 56]: Amine did not allow Pedro to leave the room until he appeared to have quite recovered from his fright ; for some days she did not say anything to him , except to remind him of his promise not to tell his mother , or any one else , and she loaded him with presents .
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 28]: One afternoon when his mother was gone out , Pedro came in , and asked Amine `` whether they should not have the play over again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 23]: Amine , who was anxious to know more , was glad of the boy 's request , and soon had everything prepared .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 44]: Again was her chamber filled with the smoke of the frankincense : again was she muttering her incantations : the magic mirror was on the boy 's hand , and once more had Pedro cried out , `` Philip Vanderdecken , appear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 21]: when the door burst open , and Father Mathias , the widow , and several other people made their appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 12]: Amine started up -- Pedro screamed and ran to his mother .
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 39]: `` Then I was not mistaken at what I saw in the cottage at Terneuse , '' cried Father Mathias , with his arms folded over his breast , and with looks of indignation ; `` accursed sorceress !
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 5]: you are detected . ''
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 23]: Amine returned his gaze with scorn , and coolly replied , `` I am not of your creed -- you know it .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 10]: Eaves-dropping appears to be a portion of your religion .
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 38]: This is my chamber -- it is not the first time I have had to request you to leave it -- I do so now -- you -- and those who have come in with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 18]: `` Take up all those implements of sorcery first , '' said Father Mathias to his companions .
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 30]: The chafing dish , and other articles used by Amine , were taken away ; and Father Mathias and the others quitting the room , Amine was left alone .
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 35]: Amine had a foreboding that she was lost ; she knew that magic was a crime of the highest degree in Catholic countries , and that she had been detected in the very act .
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 23]: `` Well , well ; '' thought Amine ; `` it is my destiny , and I can brave the worst . ''
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 46]: To account for the appearance of Father Mathias and the witnesses , it must be observed , that the little boy Pedro had , the day after Amine 's first attempt , forgotten his promise , and narrated to his mother all that had passed .
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 42]: The widow , frightened at what the boy had told her , thought it right to go to Father Mathias , and confide to him what her son had told her , as it was , in her opinion , sorcery .
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 23]: Father Mathias questioned Pedro closely , and , convinced that such was the case , determined to have witnesses to confront Amine .
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 39]: He therefore proposed that the boy should appear to be willing to try again , and had instructed him for the purpose , having previously arranged that they should break in upon Amine , as we have described .
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 31]: About half-an-hour afterwards , two men dressed in black gowns came into Amine 's room , and requested that she would follow them , or that force would be used .
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 45]: Amine made no resistance ; they crossed the square ; the gate of a large building was opened ; they desired her to walk in , and , in a few seconds , Amine found herself in one of the dungeons of the Inquisition .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 57]: Chapter XXXVI Previous to continuing our narrative , it may be as well to give our readers some little insight into the nature , ceremonies , and regulations of the Inquisition ; and in describing that of Goa , we may be said to describe all others , with very trifling , if any , variation .
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 25]: The Santa Casa , or Inquisition of Goa , is situated on one side of a large square , called the Terra di Sabaio .
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 43]: It is a massive handsome pile of stone buildings , with three doors in the front : the centre one is larger than the two lateral , and it is through the centre door that you go into the Hall of Judgment .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 19]: The side-doors lead to spacious and handsome apartments for the Inquisitors , and officers attached to the establishment .
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 32]: Behind these apartments are the cells and dungeons of the Inquisition ; they are in two long galleries , with double doors to each , and are about ten feet square .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 31]: There are about two hundred of them ; some are much more comfortable than the others , as light and air are admitted into them : others are wholly dark .
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 27]: In the galleries the keepers watch , and not a word or a sound can proceed from any cell without their being able to overhear it .
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 43]: The treatment of those confined is , as far as respects their food , very good : great care is taken that the nourishment is of that nature that the prisoners may not suffer from the indigestion arising from want of exercise .
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 22]: Surgical attendance is also permitted them ; but , unless on very particular occasions , no priests are allowed to enter .
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 26]: Any consolation to be derived from religion , even the office of confessor and extreme unction , in case of dissolution , are denied them .
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 55]: Should they die during their confinement , whether proved guilty or not of the crime of which they are accused , they are buried without any funeral ceremony , and tried afterwards , if then found guilty , their bones are disinterred , and the execution of their sentence is passed upon their remains .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 93]: There are two Inquisitors at Goa : one the Grand Inquisitor , and the other his second , who are invariably chosen from the order of St-Dominique ; these two are assisted in their judgment and examinations by a large number selected from the religious orders , who are termed deputies of the Holy Office , but who only attend when summoned : they have other officers , whose duty it is to examine all published books , and ascertain if there is anything in their pages contrary to the holy religion .
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 43]: There is also a public accuser , a procureur of the Inquisition , and lawyers , who are permitted to plead the case of the prisoners , but whose chief business and interest it is to obtain their secrets and betray them .
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 84]: What are termed _ Familiars _ of the Inquisition , are , in fact , nothing but this description of people : but this disgraceful office is taken upon themselves by the highest nobility , who think it an honour as well as a security , to be enrolled among the Familiars of the Inquisition , who are thus to be found dispersed throughout society ; and every careless word , or expression , is certain to be repeated to the Holy Office .
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 24]: A summons to attend at the Inquisition is never opposed ; if it were , the whole populace would rise and enforce it .
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 56]: Those who are confined in the dungeons of the Inquisition are kept separate ; it is a very uncommon thing to put two together : it is only done when it is considered that the prolonged solitude of the dungeon has created such a depression of spirits as to endanger the life of the party .
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 8]: Perpetual silence is enjoined and strictly kept .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 23]: Those who wail or weep , or even pray , in their utter darkness , are forced by blows to be quiet .
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 42]: The cries and shrieks of those who suffer from this chastisement , or from the torture , are carried along the whole length of the corridors , terrifying those who , in solitude and darkness , are anticipating the same fate .
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 23]: The first question put to a person arrested by the Inquisition , is a demand , `` What is his property ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 113]: He is desired to make an exact declaration of everything that he is worth , and swear to the truth of his assertions ; being informed that , if there is any reservation on his part -LRB- although he may be at that time innocent of the charges produced against him -RRB- , -- he will , by his concealment , have incurred the wrath of the Inquisition ; and that , if discharged for the crime he is accused of , he will again be arrested for having taken a false oath to the Inquisition ; that , if innocent , his property will be safe , and not interfered with .
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 11]: It is not without reason that this demand is made .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 28]: If a person accused confesses his crime , he is , in most cases , eventually allowed to go free , but all his property becomes confiscated .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 74]: By the rules of the Inquisition , it is made to appear as if those condemned have the show of justice ; for , although two witnesses are sufficient to warrant the apprehension of any individual , seven are necessary to convict him ; but as the witnesses are never confronted with the prisoners , and torture is often applied to the witnesses , it is not difficult to obtain the number required .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 18]: Many a life is falsely sworn away by the witness , that he may save his own .
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 24]: The chief crimes which are noticed by the Inquisition are those of sorcery , heresy , blasphemy , and what is called Judaism .
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 94]: To comprehend the meaning of this last crime , for which more people have suffered from the Inquisition than for any other , the reader must be informed , that when Ferdinand and Isabella of Castile drove all the Jews out of Spain , they fled to Portugal , where they were received on the sole condition that they should embrace Christianity : this they consented , or appeared to consent , to do ; but these converts were despised by the Portuguese people , who did not believe them to be sincere .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 20]: They obtained the title of _ New _ Christians , in contradistinction to that of _ Old _ Christians .
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 50]: After a time the two were occasionally intermingled in marriage ; but when so , it was always a reproach to the old families ; and descendants from these alliances were long termed , by way of reproach , as having a portion of the New Christians in them .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 75]: The descendants of the old families thus intermingled , not only lost _ caste _ , but , as the genealogy of every family was well known , they were looked upon with suspicion , and were always at the mercy of the Holy Office , when denounced for Judaism , -- that is , for returning to the old Jewish practices of keeping the Passover , and the other ceremonies enforced by Moses .
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 17]: Let us see how an accusation of this kind works in the hands of the Inquisition .
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 52]: A really sincere Catholic , descended from one of these unhappy families , is accused and arrested by the orders of the Inquisition ; he is ordered to declare his property , which , -- convinced of his innocence , and expecting soon to be released , he does without reservation .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 37]: But hardly has the key of the dungeon turned upon him , when all his effects are seized and sold by public auction ; it being well understood that they never will be restored to him .
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 51]: After some months ' confinement , he is called into the Hall of Justice , and asked if he knows why he is in prison ; they advise him earnestly to confess and to conceal nothing , as it is the only way by which he can obtain his liberty .
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 16]: He declares his ignorance , and being sent for several times , persists in it .
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 44]: The period of the _ Auto da Fé _ , or Act of Faith , which takes place every two or three years -LRB- that is , the public execution of those who have been found guilty by the Inquisition -RRB- , approaches .
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 22]: The public accuser then comes forward , stating that the prisoner has been accused by a number of witnesses of Judaism .
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 56]: They persuade him to acknowledge his guilt ; he persists in his innocence ; they then pass a sentence on him , which they term _ Convicto Invotivo _ , which means `` found guilty , but will not confess his crime ; '' and he is sentenced to be burnt at the approaching celebration .
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 44]: After this they follow him to his cell , and exhort him to confess his guilt , and promise that if he does confess he shall be pardoned ; and these appeals are continued until the evening of the day before his execution .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 22]: Terrified at the idea of a painful death , the wretch , at last , to save his life , consents .
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 26]: He is called into the Hall of Judgment , confesses the crime that he has not committed , and imagines that he is now saved .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 3]: -- Alas !
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 12]: no ; he has entangled himself , and can not escape .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 15]: `` You acknowledge that you have been guilty of observing the laws of Moses .
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 49]: These ceremonies can not be performed alone ; you can not have eaten the Paschal lamb _ alone _ ; tell us immediately , who were those who assisted at those ceremonies , or your life is still forfeited , and the stake is prepared for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 34]: Thus has he accused himself without gaining anything , and if he wishes to save his life he must accuse others ; and who can be accused but his own friends and acquaintances ?
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 41]: nay , in all probability , his own relations -- his brothers , sisters , wife , sons or daughters -- for it is natural to suppose that in all such practices a man will trust only his own family .
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 85]: Whether a man confesses his guilt , or dies asserting his innocence , his worldly property is in either case confiscated ; but it is of great consequence to the Inquisition that he should confess , as his act of confession , with his signature annexed , is publicly read , and serves to prove to the world that the Inquisition is impartial and just ; nay , more , even merciful , as it pardons those who have been proved to be guilty .
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 38]: At Goa the accusations of sorcery and magic were much more frequent than at the Inquisitions at other places , arising from the customs and ceremonies of the Hindoos being very much mixed up with absurd superstitions .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 76]: These people , and the slaves from other parts , very often embraced Christianity to please their masters ; but since , if they had been baptised and were afterwards convicted of any crime , they were sentenced to the punishment by fire ; whereas , if they had not been baptised , they were only punished by whipping , imprisonment , or the galleys ; upon this ground alone many refused to embrace Christianity .
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 36]: We have now detailed all that we consider , up to the present , necessary for the information of the reader ; all that is omitted he will gather as we proceed with our history .
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 35]: Chapter XXXVII A few hours after Amine had been in the dungeon , the jailors entered : without speaking to her they let down her soft silky hair , and cut it close off .
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 22]: Amine , with her lip curled in contempt , and without resistance and expostulation , allowed them to do their work .
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 12]: They finished , and she was again left to her solitude .
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 21]: The next day the jailors entered her cell , and ordered her to bare her feet , and follow them .
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 10]: She looked at them , and they at her .
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 25]: `` If you do not , we must , '' observed one of the men , who was moved by her youth and beauty .
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 26]: Amine did as she was desired and was led into the Hall of Justice , where she found only the Grand Inquisitor and the Secretary .
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 32]: The Hall of Justice was a long room with lofty windows on each side , and also at the end opposite to the door through which she had been led in .
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 49]: In the centre , on a raised dais , was a long table covered with a cloth of alternate blue and fawn-coloured stripes ; and at the end opposite to where Amine was brought in was raised an enormous crucifix , with a carved image of our Saviour .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 19]: The jailor pointed to a small bench , and intimated to Amine that she was to sit down .
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 19]: After a scrutiny of some moments , the Secretary spoke : -- `` What is your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 5]: `` Amine Vanderdecken . ''
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 6]: `` Of what country ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 16]: `` My husband is of the Low Countries ; I am from the East . ''
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 7]: `` What is your husband ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 9]: `` The captain of a Dutch Indiaman . ''
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 7]: `` How came you here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 12]: `` His vessel was wrecked , and we were separated . ''
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 8]: `` Whom do you know here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 5]: `` Father Mathias . ''
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 7]: `` What property have you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 10]: `` None ; it is my husband 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 6]: `` Where is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 9]: `` In the custody of Father Mathias . ''
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 11]: `` Are you aware why you are brought here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 7]: `` How should I be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 15]: replied Amine , evasively ; `` tell me what I am accused of . ''
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 12]: `` You must know whether you have done wrong or not .
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 12]: You had better confess all your conscience accuses you of . ''
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 12]: `` My conscience does not accuse me of doing wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 8]: `` Then you will confess nothing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 13]: `` By your own showing , I have nothing to confess . ''
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 15]: `` You say you are from the East : are you a Christian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 7]: `` I reject your creed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 9]: `` You are married to a Catholic ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 5]: a true Catholic . ''
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 6]: `` Who married you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 9]: `` Father Seysen , a Catholic priest . ''
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 11]: `` Did you enter into the bosom of the church ?
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 13]: -- did he venture to marry you without your being baptised ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 12]: `` Some ceremony did take place which I consented to . ''
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 10]: `` It was baptism , was it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 9]: `` I believe it was so termed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 12]: `` And now you say that you reject the creed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 29]: `` Since I have witnessed the conduct of those who profess it , I do : at the time of my marriage I was disposed towards it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 16]: `` What is the amount of your property in the Father Mathias 's hands ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 11]: `` Some hundreds of dollars -- he knows exactly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 20]: The Grand Inquisitor rang a bell ; the jailors entered , and Amine was led back to her dungeon .
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 12]: `` Why should they ask so often about my money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 14]: mused Amine ; `` If they require it , they may take it .
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 5]: What is their power ?
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 7]: What would they do with me ?
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 11]: Well , well , a few days will decide . ''
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 4]: A few days !
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 72]: -- no , no , Amine ; years perhaps would have passed without decision , but that in four months from the date of your incarceration , the _ Auto da Fé _ , which had not been celebrated for upwards of three years , was to take place , and there was not a sufficient number of those who were to undergo the last punishment to render the ceremony imposing .
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 21]: A few more were required for the stake , or you would not have escaped from those dungeons so soon .
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 31]: As it was , a month of anxiety and suspense , almost insupportable , had to be passed away , before Amine was again summoned to the Hall of Justice .
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 27]: Amine , at the time we have specified , was again introduced to the Hall of Justice , and was again asked if she would confess .
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 44]: Irritated at her long confinement , and the injustice of the proceedings , she replied , `` I have told you once for all , that I have nothing to confess ; do with me as you will ; but be quick . ''
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 9]: `` Will torture oblige you to confess ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 48]: `` Try me , '' replied Amine , firmly -- `` try me , cruel men ; and if you gain but one word from me , then call me craven : I am but a woman -- but I dare you -- I defy you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 28]: It was seldom that such expressions fell upon the ears of her judges , and still more seldom that a countenance was lighted up with such determination .
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 16]: But the torture was never applied until after the accusation had been made and answered .
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 17]: `` We shall see , '' said the Grand Inquisitor : `` take her away . ''
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 8]: Amine was led back to her cell .
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 14]: In the meantime , Father Mathias had had several conferences with the Inquisitor .
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 26]: Although , in his wrath he had accused Amine , and had procured the necessary witnesses against her , he now felt uneasy and perplexed .
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 45]: His long residence with her -- her invariable kindness till the time of his dismissal -- his knowledge that she had never embraced the faith -- her boldness and courage , nay , her beauty and youth -- all worked strongly in her favour .
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 27]: His only object now was , to persuade her to confess that she was wrong , induce her to embrace the faith , and save her .
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 35]: With this view he had obtained permission from the Holy Office to enter her dungeon , and reason with her -- a special favour which for many reasons they could not well refuse him .
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 41]: It was on the third day after her second examination , that the bolts were removed at an unusual hour , and Father Mathias entered the cell , which was again barred , and he was left alone with Amine .
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 4]: `` My child !
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 4]: my child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 10]: exclaimed Father Mathias , with sorrow in his countenance .
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 9]: `` Nay , Father , this is mockery .
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 12]: It is you who brought me here -- leave me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 26]: `` I brought you here , 't is true ; but I would now remove you , if you will permit me , Amine . ''
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 10]: `` Most willingly ; I 'll follow you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 5]: `` Nay , nay !
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 12]: there is much to talk over , much to be done .
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 14]: This is not a dungeon from which people can escape so easily . ''
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 19]: `` Then tell me what have you to say ; and what is it must be done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 5]: `` I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 28]: `` But , stop ; before you say one word answer me one question as you hope for bliss : have you heard aught of Philip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 6]: `` Yes , I have .
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 5]: He is well . ''
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 7]: `` And where is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 8]: `` He will soon be here . ''
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 7]: `` God , I thank you !
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 8]: Shall I see him , Father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 8]: `` That must depend upon yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 4]: `` Upon myself .
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 14]: Then tell me , quickly , what would they have me do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 9]: `` Confess your sins -- your crimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 4]: `` What sins ?
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 5]: -- what crimes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 27]: `` Have you not dealt with evil beings , invoked the spirits , and gained the assistance of those who are not of this world ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 5]: Amine made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 4]: `` Answer me .
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 6]: Do you not confess ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 12]: `` I do not confess to have done anything wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 5]: `` This is useless .
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 8]: You were seen by me and others .
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 6]: What will avail your denial ?
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 28]: Are you aware of the punishment , which most surely awaits you , if you do not confess , and become a member of our church ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 12]: `` Why am I to become a member of your church ?
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 11]: Do you , then , punish those who refuse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 44]: `` No : had you not already consented to receive baptism , you would not have been asked to become so ; but having been baptised , you must now become a member , or be supposed to fall back into heresy . ''
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 14]: `` I knew not the nature of your baptism at that time . ''
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 10]: `` Granted : but you consented to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 5]: `` Be it so .
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 15]: But , pray , what may be the punishment , if I refuse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 15]: `` You will be burnt alive at the stake ; nothing can save you .
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 43]: Hear me , Amine Vanderdecken : when next summoned , you must confess all ; and , asking pardon , request to be received into the church ; then will you be saved , and you will -- '' `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 10]: `` Again be clasped in Philip 's arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 4]: `` My Philip !
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 3]: my Philip !
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 35]: you , indeed , press me hard ; but , Father , if I confess I am wrong , when I feel that I am not '' `` Feel that you are not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 15]: I invoked my mother 's assistance ; she gave it me in a dream .
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 14]: Would a mother have assisted her daughter , if it were wrong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 16]: `` It was not your mother , but a fiend who took the likeness . ''
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 6]: `` It was my mother .
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 16]: Again you ask me to say that I believe that which I can not . ''
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 7]: `` That which you can not !
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 8]: Amine Vanderdecken , be not obstinate . ''
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 9]: `` I am not obstinate , good Father .
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 26]: Have you not offered me , what is to me beyond all price , that I should again be in the arms of my husband ?
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 8]: Can I degrade myself to a lie ?
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 13]: not for life , or liberty or even for my Philip . ''
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 37]: `` Amine Vanderdecken , if you will confess your crime , before you are accused , you will have done much ; after your accusation has been made , it will be of little avail . ''
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 13]: `` It will not be done either before or after , Father .
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 33]: What I have done I have done , but a crime it is not to me and mine ; with you it may be , but I am not of yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 16]: `` Recollect also that you peril your husband , for having wedded with a sorceress .
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 11]: Forget not : to-morrow I will see you again . ''
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 10]: `` My mind is troubled , '' replied Amine .
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 13]: `` Leave me , Father , it will be a kindness . ''
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 14]: Father Mathias quitted the cell , pleased with the last words of Amine .
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 13]: The idea of her husband 's danger seemed to have startled her .
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 20]: Amine threw herself down on the mattress , in the corner of the cell , and hid her face .
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 5]: `` Burnt alive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 17]: exclaimed she after a time , sitting up , and passing her hands over her forehead .
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 4]: `` Burnt alive !
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 5]: and these are Christians .
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 35]: This , then , was the cruel death foretold by that creature , Schriften -- foretold -- yes , and therefore must be : it is my destiny : I can not save myself .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 23]: If I confess , then , I confess that Philip is wedded to a sorceress , and he will be punished too .
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 28]: No , never -- never : I can suffer , 't is cruel -- 't is horrible to think of -- but ` twill soon be over .
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 28]: God of my fathers , give me strength against these wicked men , and enable me to bear all , for my dear Philip 's sake . ''
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 10]: The next evening Father Mathias again made his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 20]: He found Amine calm and collected : she refused to listen to his advice , or follow his injunctions .
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 44]: His last observation , that `` her husband would be in peril , if she was found guilty of sorcery , '' had steeled her heart , and she had determined that neither torture nor the stake should make her confess the act .
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 57]: The priest left the cell , sick at heart ; he now felt miserable at the idea of Amine 's perishing by so dreadful a death ; accused himself of precipitation , and wished that he had never seen Amine , whose constancy and courage , although in error , excited his admiration and his pity .
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 20]: And then he thought of Philip , who had treated him so kindly -- how could he meet him ?
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 14]: And if he asked for his wife -- what answer could he give ?
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 24]: Another fortnight passed , when Amine was again summoned to the Hall of Judgment , and again asked if she confessed her crimes .
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 11]: Upon her refusal , the accusations against her were read .
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 27]: She was accused by Father Mathias with practising forbidden arts , and the depositions of the boy Pedro , and the other witnesses , were read .
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 70]: In his zeal , Father Mathias also stated that he had found her guilty of the same practices at Terneuse ; and moreover , that in the violent storm when all expected to perish , she had remained calm and courageous , and told the captain that they would be saved ; which could only have been known by an undue spirit of prophecy , given by evil spirits .
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 13]: Amine 's lip curled in derision when she heard the last accusation .
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 11]: She was asked if she had any defence to make .
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 18]: `` What defence can be offered , '' replied she , `` to such accusations as these ?
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 20]: Witness the last -- because I was not so craven as the Christians , I am accused of sorcery .
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 4]: The old dotard !
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 6]: but I will expose him .
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 27]: Tell me , if one knows that sorcery is used , and conceals or allows it , is he not a participator and equally guilty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 14]: `` He is , '' replied the Inquisitor , anxiously awaiting the result .
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 38]: `` Then I denounce '' And Amine was about to reveal that Philip 's mission was known , and not forbidden by Fathers Mathias and Seysen ; when recollecting that Philip would be implicated , she stopped .
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 5]: `` Denounce whom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 4]: inquired the Inquisitor .
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 16]: `` No one , '' replied Amine , folding her arms and drooping her head .
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 6]: `` Speak , woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 5]: Amine made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 9]: `` The torture will make you speak . ''
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 4]: `` Never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 3]: replied Amine .
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 3]: `` Never !
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 18]: Torture me to death , if you choose ; I prefer it to a public execution . ''
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 10]: The Inquisitor and the Secretary consulted a short time .
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 24]: Convinced that Amine would adhere to her resolution , and requiring her for public execution , they abandoned the idea of the torture .
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 6]: `` Do you confess ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 4]: inquired the Inquisitor .
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 9]: `` No , '' replied Amine , firmly .
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 7]: `` Then take her away . ''
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 29]: The night before the _ Auto da Fé _ , Father Mathias again entered the cell of Amine , but all his endeavours to convert her were useless .
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 23]: `` To-morrow will end it all , Father , '' replied Amine ; `` leave me -- I would be alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 11]: Chapter XXXVIII We must now return to Philip and Krantz .
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 34]: When the latter retired from the presence of the Portuguese Commandant , he communicated to Philip what had taken place , and the fabulous tale which he had invented to deceive the Commandant .
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 48]: `` I said that you alone knew where the treasure was concealed , '' continued Krantz , `` that you might be sent for , for in all probability he will keep me as a hostage : but never mind that , I must take my chance .
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 14]: Do you contrive to escape somehow or another , and rejoin Amine . ''
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 38]: `` Not so , '' replied Philip , `` you must go with me , my friend : I feel that should I part with you , happiness would no longer be in store for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 21]: `` Nonsense -- that is but an idle feeling ; besides , I will evade him somehow or another . ''
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 15]: `` I will not show the treasure , unless you go with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 12]: `` Well -- you may try it at all events . ''
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 9]: A low tap at the door was heard .
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 19]: Philip rose and opened it -LRB- for they had retired to rest -RRB- , and Pedro came in .
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 25]: Looking carefully round him , and then shutting the door softly , he put his finger on his lips to enjoin them to silence .
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 12]: He then in a whisper told them what he had overheard .
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 30]: `` Contrive , if possible , that I go with you , '' continued he ; `` I must leave you now ; he still paces his room . ''
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 16]: And Pedro slipped out of the door , and crawled stealthily away along the ramparts .
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 6]: `` The treacherous little rascal !
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 18]: But we will circumvent him , if possible , '' said Krantz , in a low tone .
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 21]: `` Yes , Philip , you are right , we must both go , for you will require my assistance .
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 8]: I must persuade him to go himself .
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 12]: I 'll think of it -- so Philip , good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 20]: The next morning Philip and Krantz were summoned to breakfast ; the Commandant received them with smiles and urbanity .
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 7]: To Philip he was peculiarly courteous .
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 65]: As soon as the repast was over , he thus communicated to him his intentions and wishes : -- `` Signor , I have been reflecting upon what your friend told me , and the appearance of the spectre yesterday , which created such confusion ; it induced me to behave with a rashness for which I must now offer my most sincere apologies .
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 42]: The reflections which I have made , joined with the feelings of devotion which must be in the heart of every true Catholic , have determined me , with your assistance , to obtain this treasure dedicated to the holy church .
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 34]: It is my proposal that you should take a party of soldiers under your orders , proceed to the island on which it is deposited , and having obtained it , return here .
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 32]: I will detain any vessel which may in the meantime put into the roadstead , and you shall then be the bearers of the treasure and of my letters to Goa .
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 26]: This will give you an honourable introduction to the authorities , and enable you to pass away your time there in the most agreeable manner .
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 64]: You will also , signor , be restored to your wife , whose charms had such an effect upon me ; and for mention of whose name in the very unceremonious manner which I did , I must excuse myself upon the ground of total ignorance of who she was , or of her being in any way connected with your honourable person .
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 21]: If these measures suit you , signor , I shall be most happy to give orders to that effect . ''
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 35]: `` As a good Catholic myself , '' replied Philip , `` I shall be most happy to point out the spot where the treasure is concealed , and restore it to the church .
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 35]: Your apologies relative to my wife I accept with pleasure , being aware that your conduct proceeded from ignorance of her situation and rank ; but I do not exactly see my way clear .
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 7]: You propose a party of soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 5]: Will they obey me ?
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 7]: -- Are they to be trusted ?
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 19]: -- I shall , have only myself and friend against them , and will they be obedient ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 26]: `` No fear of that , signor , they are well disciplined ; there is not even occasion for your friend to go with you .
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 17]: I wish to retain him with me , to keep me company during your absence . ''
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 3]: `` Nay !
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 19]: that I must object to , '' replied Philip ; `` I will not trust myself alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 67]: `` Perhaps I may be allowed to give an opinion on this subject , '' observed Krantz ; `` I see no reason , if my friend goes accompanied with a party of soldiers only , why I should not go with him ; but I consider it would be unadvisable that he proceed in the way the Commandant proposes , either with or without me .
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 55]: You must recollect , Commandant , that it is no trifling sum which is to be carried away ; that it will be open to view , and will meet the eyes of your men ; that these men have been detained many years in this country , and are anxious to return home .
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 37]: When , therefore , they find themselves with only two strangers with them -- away from your authority , and in possession of a large sum of money -- will not the temptation be too strong ?
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 30]: They will only have to run down the southern channel , gain the port of Bantam , and they will be safe ; having obtained both freedom and wealth .
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 37]: To send , therefore , my friend and me , would be to send us to almost certain death ; but if you were to go , Commandant , then the danger would no longer exist .
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 30]: Your presence and your authority would control them ; and , whatever their wishes or thoughts might be , they would quail before the flash of your eye . ''
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 21]: `` Very true -- very true , '' replied Philip -- `` all this did not occur to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 37]: Nor had it occurred to the Commandant , but when pointed out , the force of these suggestions immediately struck him , and long before Krantz had finished speaking , he had resolved to go himself .
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 80]: `` Well , signors , '' replied he ; `` I am always ready to accede to your wishes ; and since you consider my presence necessary , and as I do not think there is any chance of another attack from the Ternate people just now , I will take upon myself the responsibility of leaving the fort for a few days under the charge of my lieutenant , while we do this service to Holy Mother Church .
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 28]: I have already sent for one of the native vessels , which are large and commodious , and will , with your permission , embark to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 72]: `` Two vessels will be better , '' observed Krantz ; `` in the first place , in case of an accident ; and next because we can embark all the treasure in one with ourselves , and put a portion of the soldiers in the other ; so that we may be in greater force , in case of the sight of so much wealth stimulating them to insubordination . ''
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 17]: `` True , signor , we will have two vessels ; your advice is good . ''
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 22]: Everything was thus satisfactorily arranged , with the exception of their wish that Pedro should , accompany them on their expedition .
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 46]: They were debating how this should be brought on the tapis , when the soldier came to them , and stated that the Commandant had ordered him to be of the party , and that he was to offer his services to the two strangers .
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 8]: On the ensuing day everything was prepared .
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 32]: Ten soldiers and a corporal had been selected by the Commandant ; and it required but little time to put into the vessels the provisions and other articles which were required .
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 25]: At daylight they embarked -- the Commandant and Philip in one boat ; Krantz , with the corporal and Pedro , in the other .
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 73]: The men , who had been kept in ignorance of the object of the expedition , were now made acquainted with it by Pedro , and a long whispering took place between them , much to the satisfaction of Krantz , who was aware that the mutiny would soon be excited , when it was understood that those who composed the expedition were to be sacrificed to the avarice of the Commandant .
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 48]: The weather being fine , they sailed on during the night : passed the island of Ternate at ten leagues ' distance ; and before morning were among the cluster of isles , the southernmost of which was the one on which the treasure had been buried .
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 49]: On the second night the vessels were beached upon a small island ; and then , for the first time , a communication took place between the soldiers who had been in the boat with Pedro and Krantz , and those who had been embarked with the Commandant .
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 15]: Philip and Krantz had also an opportunity of communicating apart for a short time .
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 59]: When they made sail the next morning , Pedro spoke openly ; he told Krantz that the soldiers in the boat had made up their minds , and that he had no doubt that the others would do so before night ; although they had not decidedly agreed upon joining them in the morning when they had re-embarked .
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 23]: That they would despatch the Commandant , and then proceed to Batavia , and from thence obtain a passage home to Europe .
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 11]: `` Can not you accomplish your end without murder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 11]: `` Yes , we could ; but not our revenge .
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 31]: You do not know the treatment which we have received from his hands ; and sweet as the money will be to us , his death will be even sweeter .
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 16]: Besides , has he not determined to murder us all in some way or another ?
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 5]: It is but justice .
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 16]: No , no ; if there was no other knife ready -- mine is . ''
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 8]: `` And so are all ours ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 12]: cried the other soldiers , putting their hands to their weapons .
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 21]: One more day 's sail brought them within twenty miles of the island ; for Philip knew his landmarks well .
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 40]: Again they landed , and all retired to rest , the Commandant dreaming of wealth and revenge ; while it was arranging that the digging up of the treasure which he coveted should be the signal for his death .
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 22]: Once more did they embark , and the Commandant heeded not the dark and lowering faces with which he was surrounded .
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 7]: He was all gaiety and politeness .
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 62]: Swiftly did they skim over the dark blue sea , between the beautiful islands with which it was studded , and before the sun was three hours high , Philip recognised the one sought after , and pointed out to the Commandant the notched cocoa-nut tree , which served as a guide to the spot where the money had been concealed .
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 60]: They landed on the sandy beach , and the shovels were ordered to be brought on shore by the impatient little officer ; who little thought that every moment of time gained was but so much _ time _ lost to him , and that while he was smiling and meditating treachery , that others could do the same .
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 29]: The party arrived under the tree -- the shovels soon removed the light sand , and , in a few minutes , the treasure was exposed to view .
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 15]: Bag after bag was handed up , and the loose dollars collected into heaps .
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 43]: Two of the soldiers had been sent to the vessels for sacks to put the loose dollars in , and the men had desisted from their labour ; they laid aside their spades , looks were exchanged , and all were ready .
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 55]: The Commandant turned round to call to and hasten the movements of the men who had been sent for the sacks , when three or four knives simultaneously pierced him through the back ; he fell , and was expostulating when they were again buried in his bosom , and he lay a corpse .
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 21]: Philip and Krantz remained silent spectators -- the knives were drawn out , wiped , and replaced in their sheathes .
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 11]: `` He has met his reward , '' said Krantz .
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 17]: `` Yes , '' exclaimed the Portuguese soldiers -- `` justice , nothing but justice . ''
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 13]: `` Signors , you shall have your share , '' observed Pedro .
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 9]: `` Shall they not , my men ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 3]: yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 45]: `` Not one dollar , my good friends , '' replied Philip ; `` take all the money , and may you be happy ; all we ask is , your assistance to proceed on our way to where we are about to go .
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 20]: And now before you divide your money , oblige me by burying the body of that unfortunate man . ''
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 4]: The soldiers obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 26]: Resuming their shovels , they soon scooped out a shallow grave ; the Commandant 's body was thrown in , and covered up from sight .
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 22]: Chapter XXXIX Scarcely had the soldiers performed their task , and thrown down their shovels , when they commenced an altercation .
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 16]: It appeared that this money was to be again the cause of slaughter and bloodshed .
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 24]: Philip and Krantz determined to sail immediately in one of the peroquas , and leave them to settle their disputes as they pleased .
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 59]: He asked permission of the soldiers to take from the provisions and water , of which there was ample supply , a larger proportion than was their share ; stating , that he and Krantz had a long voyage and would require it , and pointing out to them that there were plenty of cocoa-nuts for their support .
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 78]: The soldiers , who thought of nothing but their newly-acquired wealth , allowed him to do as he pleased ; and having hastily collected as many cocoa-nuts as they could , to add to their stock of provisions , before noon Philip and Krantz had embarked , and made sail in the peroqua , leaving the soldiers with their knives again drawn , and so busy in their angry altercation as to be heedless of their departure .
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 26]: `` There will be the same scene over again , I expect , '' observed Krantz , as the vessel parted swiftly from the shore .
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 20]: `` I have little doubt of it ; observe , even now they are at blows and stabs . ''
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 21]: `` If I were to name that spot , it should be the ' _ Accursed Isle _ . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 20]: `` Would not any other be the same , with so much to inflame the passions of men ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 10]: `` Assuredly : what a curse is gold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 7]: `` And what a blessing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 3]: replied Krantz .
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 11]: `` I am sorry Pedro is left with them . ''
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 20]: `` It is their destiny , '' replied Philip ; `` so let 's think no more of them .
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 6]: Now what do you propose ?
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 34]: With this vessel , small as she is , we may sail over these seas in safety ; and we have , I imagine , provisions sufficient for more than a month . ''
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 25]: `` My idea is to run into the track of the vessels going to the westward , and obtain a passage to Goa . ''
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 27]: `` And if we do not meet with any , we can at all events proceed up the Straits as far as Pulo Penang without risk .
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 11]: There we may safely remain until a vessel passes . ''
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 36]: `` I agree with you ; it is our best , nay our only place ; unless , indeed , we were to proceed to Cochin , where junks are always leaving for Goa . ''
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 29]: `` But that would be out of our way , and the junks can not well pass us in the Straits without their being seen by us . ''
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 25]: They had no difficulty in steering their course ; the islands by day , and the clear stars by night , were their compass .
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 38]: It is true that they did not follow the more direct track , but they followed the more secure , working up through the smooth waters , and gaining to the northward more than to the west .
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 63]: Many times were they chased by the Malay proas , which infested the islands , but the swiftness of their little peroqua was their security ; indeed the chase was , generally speaking , abandoned , as soon as the smallness of the vessel was made out by the pirates , who expected that little or no booty was to be gained .
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 19]: That Amine and Philip 's mission was the constant theme of their discourse , may easily be imagined .
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 51]: One morning , as they were sailing between the isles , with less wind than usual , Philip observed : -- `` Krantz , you said that there were events in your own life , or connected with it , which would corroborate the mysterious tale I confided to you .
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 11]: Will you now tell me to what you referred ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 35]: `` Certainly , '' replied Krantz ; `` I have often thought of doing so , but one circumstance or another has hitherto prevented me ; this is , however , a fitting opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 19]: Prepare therefore to listen to a strange story , quite as strange , perhaps , as your own .
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 22]: `` I take it for granted , that you have heard people speak of the Hartz Mountains , '' observed Krantz .
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 40]: `` I have never heard people speak of them that I can recollect , '' replied Philip ; `` but I have read of them in some book , and of the strange things which have occurred there . ''
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 40]: `` It is indeed a wild region , '' rejoined Krantz , `` and many strange tales are told of it ; but , strange as they are , I have good reason for believing them to be true .
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 77]: I have told you , Philip , that I fully believe in your communion with the other world -- that I credit the history of your father , and the lawfulness of your mission ; for that we are surrounded , impelled , and worked upon by beings different in their nature from ourselves , I have had full evidence , as you will acknowledge , when I state what has occurred in my own family .
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 46]: Why such malevolent beings as I am about to speak of should be permitted to interfere with us , and punish , I may say , comparatively unoffending mortals , is beyond my comprehension ; but that they are so permitted is most certain . ''
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 28]: `` The great principle of all evil fulfils his work of evil ; why , then , not the other minor spirits of the same class ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 3]: inquired Philip .
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 40]: `` What matters it to us , whether we are tried by , and have to suffer from , the enmity of our fellow-mortals , or whether we are persecuted by beings more powerful and more malevolent than ourselves ?
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 54]: We know that we have to work out our salvation , and that we shall be judged according to our strength ; if then there be evil spirits who delight to oppress man , there surely must be , as Amine asserts , good spirits , whose delight is to do him service .
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 57]: Whether , then , we have to struggle against our passions only , or whether we have to struggle not only against our passions , but also the dire influence of unseen enemies , we ever struggle with the same odds in our favour , as the good are stronger than the evil which we combat .
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 45]: In either case we are on the ` vantage ground , whether , as in the first , we fight the good cause single-handed , or as in the second , although opposed , we have the host of Heaven ranged on our side .
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 38]: Thus are the scales of Divine Justice evenly balanced , and man is still a free agent , as his own virtuous or vicious propensities must ever decide whether he shall gain or lose the victory . ''
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 15]: `` Most true , '' replied Krantz , `` and now to my history .
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 51]: `` My father was not born , or originally a resident , in the Hartz Mountains ; he was the serf of an Hungarian nobleman , of great possessions , in Transylvania ; but , although a serf , he was not by any means a poor or illiterate man .
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 60]: In fact , he was rich , and his intelligence and respectability were such , that he had been raised by his lord to the stewardship ; but , whoever may happen to be born a serf , a serf must he remain , even though he become a wealthy man ; such was the condition of my father .
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 36]: My father had been married for about five years ; and , by his marriage , had three children -- my eldest brother Caesar , myself -LRB- Hermann -RRB- , and a sister named Marcella .
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 26]: You know , Philip , that Latin is still the language spoken in that country ; and that will account for our high sounding names .
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 64]: My mother was a very beautiful woman , unfortunately more beautiful than virtuous : she was seen and admired by the lord of the soil ; my father was sent away upon some mission ; and , during his absence , my mother , flattered by the attentions , and won by the assiduities , of this nobleman , yielded to his wishes .
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 15]: It so happened that my father returned very unexpectedly , and discovered the intrigue .
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 20]: The evidence of my mother 's shame was positive : he surprised her in the company of her seducer !
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 30]: Carried away by the impetuosity of his feelings , he watched the opportunity of a meeting taking place between them , and murdered both his wife and her seducer .
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 86]: Conscious that , as a serf , not even the provocation which he had received would be allowed as a justification of his conduct , he hastily collected together what money he could lay his hands upon , and , as we were then in the depth of winter , he put his horses to the sleigh , and taking his children with him , he set off in the middle of the night , and was far away before the tragical circumstance had transpired .
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 58]: Aware that he would be pursued , and that he had no chance of escape if he remained in any portion of his native country -LRB- in which the authorities could lay hold of him -RRB- , he continued his flight without intermission until he had buried himself in the intricacies and seclusion of the Hartz Mountains .
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 14]: Of course , all that I have now told you I learned afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 26]: My oldest recollections are knit to a rude , yet comfortable cottage , in which I lived with my father , brother , and sister .
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 55]: It was on the confines of one of those vast forests which cover the northern part of Germany ; around it were a few acres of ground , which , during the summer months , my father cultivated , and which , though they yielded a doubtful harvest , were sufficient for our support .
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 35]: In the winter we remained much in doors , for , as my father followed the chase , we were left alone , and the wolves , during that season , incessantly prowled about .
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 56]: My father had purchased the cottage , and land about it , of one of the rude foresters , who gain their livelihood partly by hunting , and partly by burning charcoal , for the purpose of smelting the ore from the neighbouring mines ; it was distant about two miles from any other habitation .
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 58]: I can call to mind the whole landscape now : the tall pines which rose up on the mountain above us , and the wide expanse of forest beneath , on the topmost boughs and heads of whose trees we looked down from our cottage , as the mountain below us rapidly descended into the distant valley .
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 23]: In summertime the prospect was beautiful ; but during the severe winter , a more desolate scene could not well be imagined .
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 39]: `` I said that , in the winter , my father occupied himself with the chase ; every day he left us , and often would he lock the door , that we might not leave the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 84]: He had no one to assist him , or to take care of us -- indeed , it was not easy to find a female servant who would live in such a solitude ; but , could he have found one , my father would not have received her , for he had imbibed a horror of the sex , as the difference of his conduct towards us , his two boys , and my poor little sister , Marcella , evidently proved .
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 82]: You may suppose we were sadly neglected ; indeed , we suffered much , for my father , fearful that we might come to some harm , would not allow us fuel , when he left the cottage ; and we were obliged , therefore , to creep under the heaps of bears ' - skins , and there to keep ourselves as warm as we could until he returned in the evening , when a blazing fire was our delight .
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 61]: That my father chose this restless sort of life may appear strange , but the fact was that he could not remain quiet ; whether from remorse for having committed murder , or from the misery consequent on his change of situation , or from both combined , he was never happy unless he was in a state of activity .
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 19]: Children , however , when left much to themselves , acquire a thoughtfulness not common to their age .
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 53]: So it was with us ; and during the short cold days of winter we would sit silent , longing for the happy hours when the snow would melt , and the leaves burst out , and the birds begin their songs , and when we should again be set at liberty .
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 46]: `` Such was our peculiar and savage sort of life until my brother Caesar was nine , myself seven , and my sister five , years old , when the circumstances occurred on which is based the extraordinary narrative which I am about to relate .
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 50]: `` One evening my father returned home rather later than usual ; he had been unsuccessful , and , as the weather was very severe , and many feet of snow were upon the ground , he was not only very cold , but in a very bad humour .
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 54]: He had brought in wood , and we were all three of us gladly assisting each other in blowing on the embers to create the blaze , when he caught poor little Marcella by the arm and threw her aside ; the child fell , struck her mouth , and bled very much .
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 8]: My brother ran to raise her up .
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 27]: Accustomed to ill usage , and afraid of my father , she did not dare to cry , but looked up in his face very piteously .
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 40]: My father drew his stool nearer to the hearth , muttered something in abuse of women , and busied himself with the fire , which both my brother and I had deserted when our sister was so unkindly treated .
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 23]: A cheerful blaze was soon the result of his exertions ; but we did not , as usual , crowd round it .
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 32]: Marcella , still bleeding , retired to a corner , and my brother and I took our seats beside her , while my father hung over the fire gloomily and alone .
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 29]: Such had been our position for about half-an-hour , when the howl of a wolf , close under the window of the cottage , fell on our ears .
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 33]: My father started up , and seized his gun : the howl was repeated , he examined the priming , and then hastily left the cottage , shutting the door after him .
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 71]: We all waited -LRB- anxiously listening -RRB- , for we thought that if he succeeded in shooting the wolf , he would return in a better humour ; and although he was harsh to all of us , and particularly so to our little sister , still we loved our father , and loved to see him cheerful and happy , for what else had we to look up to ?
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 73]: And I may here observe , that perhaps there never were three children who were fonder of each other ; we did not , like other children , fight and dispute together ; and if , by chance , any disagreement did arise between my elder brother and me , little Marcella would run to us , and kissing us both , seal , through her entreaties , the peace between us .
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 19]: Marcella was a lovely , amiable child ; I can recall her beautiful features even now -- Alas !
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 5]: poor little Marcella . ''
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 7]: `` She is dead then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 3]: observed Philip .
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 3]: `` Dead !
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 4]: yes , dead !
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 7]: -- but how did she die ?
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 15]: -- But I must not anticipate , Philip ; let me tell my story .
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 42]: `` We waited for some time , but the report of the gun did not reach us , and my elder brother then said , ` Our father has followed the wolf , and will not be back for some time .
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 29]: Marcella , let us wash the blood from your mouth , and then we will leave this corner , and go to the fire and warm ourselves . '
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 28]: `` We did so , and remained there until near midnight , every minute wondering , as it grew later , why our father did not return .
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 28]: We had no idea that he was in any danger , but we thought that he must have chased the wolf for a very long time . '
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 22]: I will look out and see if father is coming , ' said my brother Caesar , going to the door .
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 26]: ` Take care , ' said Marcella , ` the wolves must be about now , and we can not kill them , brother . '
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 18]: My brother opened the door very cautiously , and but a few inches ; he peeped out .
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 24]: -- ' I see nothing , ' said he , after a time , and once more he joined us at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 41]: ` We have had no supper , ' said I , for my father usually cooked the meat as soon as he came home ; and during his absence we had nothing but the fragments of the preceding day . ''
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 38]: ` And if our father comes home after his hunt , Caesar , ' said Marcella , ` he will be pleased to have some supper ; let us cook it for him and for ourselves . '
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 49]: Caesar climbed upon the stool , and reached down some meat -- I forget now whether it was venison or bear 's meat ; but we cut off the usual quantity , and proceeded to dress it , as we used to do under our father 's superintendence .
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 27]: We were all busied putting it into the platters before the fire , to await his coming , when we heard the sound of a horn .
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 34]: We listened -- there was a noise outside , and a minute afterwards my father entered , ushering in a young female , and a large dark man in a hunter 's dress .
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 18]: `` Perhaps I had better now relate , what was only known to me many years afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 37]: When my father had left the cottage , he perceived a large white wolf about thirty yards from him ; as soon as the animal saw my father , it retreated slowly , growling and snarling .
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 76]: My father followed ; the animal did not run , but always kept at some distance ; and my father did not like to fire until he was pretty certain that his ball would take effect : thus they went on for some time , the wolf now leaving my father far behind , and then stopping and snarling defiance at him , and then again , on his approach , setting off at speed .
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 33]: `` Anxious to shoot the animal -LRB- for the white wolf is very rare -RRB- , my father continued the pursuit for several hours , during which he continually ascended the mountain .
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 51]: `` You must know , Philip , that there are peculiar spots on those mountains which are supposed , and , as my story will prove , truly supposed , to be inhabited by the evil influences ; they are well known to the huntsmen , who invariably avoid them .
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 30]: Now , one of these spots , an open space in the pine forests above us , had been pointed out to my father as dangerous on that account .
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 57]: But , whether he disbelieved these wild stories , or whether , in his eager pursuit of the chase , he disregarded them , I know not ; certain , however , it is , that he was decoyed by the white wolf to this open space , when the animal appeared to slacken her speed .
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 29]: My father approached , came close up to her , raised his gun to his shoulder , and was about to fire ; when the wolf suddenly disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 50]: He thought that the snow on the ground must have dazzled his sight , and he let down his gun to look for the beast -- but she was gone ; how she could have escaped over the clearance , without his seeing her , was beyond his comprehension .
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 27]: Mortified at the ill success of his chase , he was about to retrace his steps , when he heard the distant sound of a horn .
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 33]: Astonishment at such a sound -- at such an hour -- in such a wilderness , made him forget for the moment his disappointment , and he remained riveted to the spot .
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 32]: In a minute the horn was blown a second time , and at no great distance ; my father stood still , and listened : a third time it was blown .
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 31]: I forget the term used to express it , but it was the signal which , my father well knew , implied that the party was lost in the woods .
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 32]: In a few minutes more my father beheld a man on horseback , with a female seated on the crupper , enter the cleared space , and ride up to him .
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 43]: At first , my father called to mind the strange stories which he had heard of the supernatural beings who were said to frequent these mountains ; but the nearer approach of the parties satisfied him that they were mortals like himself .
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 18]: As soon as they came up to him , the man who guided the horse accosted him .
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 34]: ` Friend Hunter , you are out late , the better fortune for us : we have ridden far , and are in fear of our lives , which are eagerly sought after .
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 38]: These mountains have enabled us to elude our pursuers ; but if we find not shelter and refreshment , that will avail us little , as we must perish from hunger and the inclemency of the night .
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 28]: My daughter , who rides behind me , is now more dead than alive , -- say , can you assist us in our difficulty ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 38]: ` My cottage is some few miles distant , ' replied my father , ` but I have little to offer you besides a shelter from the weather ; to the little I have you are welcome .
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 9]: May I ask whence you come ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 31]: ` Yes , friend , it is no secret now ; we have escaped from Transylvania , where my daughter 's honour and my life were equally in jeopardy ! '
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 16]: `` This information was quite enough to raise an interest in my father 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 26]: He remembered his own escape : he remembered the loss of his wife 's honour , and the tragedy by which it was wound up .
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 17]: He immediately , and warmly , offered all the assistance which he could afford them . ''
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 44]: ` There is no time to be lost , then , good sir , ' observed the horseman ; ` my daughter is chilled with the frost , and can not hold out much longer against the severity of the weather . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 18]: ` Follow me , ' replied my father , leading the way towards his home . '' '
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 43]: I was lured away in pursuit of a large white wolf , ' observed my father ; ` it came to the very window of my hut , or I should not have been out at this time of night . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 24]: ` The creature passed by us just as we came out of the wood , ' said the female in a silvery tone .
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 36]: `` I was nearly discharging my piece at it , ' observed the hunter ; ` but since it did us such good service , I am glad that I allowed it to escape . '
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 37]: `` In about an hour and a half , during which my father walked at a rapid pace , the party arrived at the cottage , and , as I said before , came in . ''
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 39]: ` We are in good time , apparently , ' observed the dark hunter , catching the smell of the roasted meat , as he walked to the fire and surveyed my brother and sister , and myself .
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 11]: ` You have young cooks here , Mynheer . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 16]: I am glad that we shall not have to wait , ' replied my father .
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 20]: ` Come , mistress , seat yourself by the fire ; you require warmth after your cold ride . '
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 13]: ` And where can I put up my horse , Mynheer ? '
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 6]: observed the huntsman . ' '
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 19]: I will take care of him , ' replied my father , going out of the cottage door .
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 11]: `` The female must , however , be particularly described .
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 11]: She was young , and apparently twenty years of age .
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 25]: She was dressed in a travelling dress , deeply bordered with white fur , and wore a cap of white ermine on her head .
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 20]: Her features were very beautiful , at least I thought so , and so my father has since declared .
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 37]: Her hair was flaxen , glossy and shining , and bright as a mirror ; and her mouth , although somewhat large when it was open , showed the most brilliant teeth I have ever beheld .
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 66]: But there was something about her eyes , bright as they were , which made us children afraid ; they were so restless , so furtive ; I could not at that time tell why , but I felt as if there was cruelty in her eye ; and when she beckoned us to come to her , we approached her with fear and trembling .
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 8]: Still she was beautiful , very beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 60]: She spoke kindly to my brother and myself , patted our heads , and caressed us ; but Marcella would not come near her ; on the contrary , she slunk away , and hid herself in the bed , and would not wait for the supper , which half an hour before she had been so anxious for .
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 24]: `` My father , having put the horse into a close shed , soon returned , and supper was placed upon the table .
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 34]: When it was over , my father requested that the young lady would take possession of his bed , and he would remain at the fire , and sit up with her father .
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 35]: After some hesitation on her part , this arrangement was agreed to , and I and my brother crept into the other bed with Marcella , for we had as yet always slept together .
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 35]: `` But we could not sleep ; there was something so unusual , not only in seeing strange people , but in having those people sleep at the cottage , that we were bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 32]: As for poor little Marcella , she was quiet , but I perceived that she trembled during the whole night , and sometimes I thought that she was checking a sob .
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 27]: My father had brought out some spirits , which he rarely used , and he and the strange hunter remained drinking and talking before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 18]: Our ears were ready to catch the slightest whisper -- so much was our curiosity excited . ''
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 9]: ` You said you came from Transylvania ? '
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 5]: observed my father . ''
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 12]: ` Even so , Mynheer , ' replied the hunter . '
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 41]: I was a serf to the noble house of -- ; my master would insist upon my surrendering up my fair girl to his wishes ; it ended in my giving him a few inches of my hunting-knife . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 27]: ` We are countrymen , and brothers in misfortune , ' replied my father , taking the huntsman 's hand , and pressing it warmly . ''
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 3]: ` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 11]: Are you , then , from that country ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 12]: ` Yes ; and I too have fled for my life .
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 9]: But mine is a melancholy tale . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 5]: ` Your name ? '
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 5]: inquired the hunter . ''
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 5]: ` Krantz . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 20]: Krantz of -- I have heard your tale ; you need not renew your grief by repeating it now .
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 17]: Welcome , most welcome , Mynheer , and , I may say , my worthy kinsman .
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 22]: I am your second cousin , Wilfred of Barnsdorf , ' cried the hunter , rising up and embracing my father .
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 21]: `` They filled their horn mugs to the brim , and drank to one another , after the German fashion .
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 43]: The conversation was then carried on in a low tone ; all that we could collect from it was , that our new relative and his daughter were to take up their abode in our cottage , at least for the present .
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 18]: In about an hour they both fell back in their chairs , and appeared to sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 10]: ` Marcella , dear , did you hear ? '
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 9]: said my brother in a low tone . ''
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 16]: ` Yes , ' replied Marcella , in a whisper ; ' I heard all .
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 18]: brother , I can not bear to look upon that woman -- I feel so frightened . '
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 17]: `` My brother made no reply , and shortly afterwards we were all three fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 20]: `` When we awoke the next morning , we found that the hunter 's daughter had risen before us .
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 9]: I thought she looked more beautiful than ever .
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 25]: She came up to little Marcella and caressed her ; the child burst into tears , and sobbed as if her heart would break .
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 24]: `` But , not to detain you with too long a story , the huntsman and his daughter were accommodated in the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 14]: My father and he went out hunting daily , leaving Christina with us .
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 27]: She performed all the household duties ; was very kind to us children ; and , gradually , the dislike even of little Marcella wore away .
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 28]: But a great change took place in my father ; he appeared to have conquered his aversion to the sex , and was most attentive to Christina .
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 27]: Often , after her father and we were in bed , would he sit up with her , conversing in a low tone by the fire .
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 51]: I ought to have mentioned , that my father and the huntsman Wilfred , slept in another portion of the cottage , and that the bed which he formerly occupied , and which was in the same room as ours , had been given up to the use of Christina .
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 30]: These visitors had been about three weeks at the cottage , when , one night , after we children had been sent to bed , a consultation was held .
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 77]: My father had asked Christina in marriage , and had obtained both her own consent and that of Wilfred ; after this a conversation took place , which was , as nearly as I can recollect , as follows : -- '' ` You may take my child , Mynheer Krantz , and my blessing with her , and I shall then leave you and seek some other habitation -- it matters little where . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 10]: ` Why not remain here , Wilfred ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 20]: ` No , no , I am called elsewhere ; let that suffice , and ask no more questions .
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 8]: You have my child . ' '' '
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 21]: I thank you for her , and will duly value her ; but there is one difficulty . ' '' '
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 40]: I know what you would say ; there is no priest here in this wild country : true ; neither is there any law to bind ; still must some ceremony pass between you , to satisfy a father .
Parsing [sent. 6367 len. 10]: Will you consent to marry her after my fashion ?
Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 12]: if so , I will marry you directly . ' '' '
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 9]: I will , ' replied my father . ''
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 8]: ` Then take her by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 9]: Now , Mynheer , swear . ' '' '
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 9]: I swear , ' repeated my father . ''
Parsing [sent. 6373 len. 21]: ` By all the spirits of the Hartz Mountains -- ' '' ` Nay , why not by Heaven ? '
Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 5]: interrupted my father . ''
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 35]: ` Because it is not my humour , ' rejoined Wilfred ; ` if I prefer that oath , less binding perhaps , than another , surely you will not thwart me . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 12]: ` Well , be it so then ; have your humour .
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 16]: Will you make me swear by that in which I do not believe ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6378 len. 37]: ` Yet many do so , who in outward appearance are Christians , ' rejoined Wilfred ; ` say , will you be married , or shall I take my daughter away with me ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 12]: ` Proceed , ' replied my father , impatiently . '' '
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 58]: I swear by all the spirits of the Hartz Mountains , by all their power for good or for evil , that I take Christina for my wedded wife ; that I will ever protect her , cherish her , and love her ; that my hand shall never be raised against her to harm her . '
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 10]: `` My father repeated the words after Wilfred . ''
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 66]: ` And if I fail in this my vow , may all the vengeance of the spirits fall upon me and upon my children ; may they perish by the vulture , by the wolf , or other beasts of the forest ; may their flesh be torn from their limbs , and their bones blanch in the wilderness ; all this I swear . '
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 33]: `` My father hesitated , as he repeated the last words ; little Marcella could not restrain herself , and as my father repeated the last sentence , she burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 6384 len. 32]: This sudden interruption appeared to discompose the party , particularly my father ; he spoke harshly to the child , who controlled her sobs , burying her face under the bedclothes .
Parsing [sent. 6385 len. 10]: `` Such was the second marriage of my father .
Parsing [sent. 6386 len. 15]: The next morning , the hunter Wilfred mounted his horse , and rode away .
Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 75]: `` My father resumed his bed , which was in the same room as ours ; and things went on much as before the marriage , except that our new mother-in-law did not show any kindness towards us ; indeed , during my father 's absence , she would often beat us , particularly little Marcella , and her eyes would flash fire , as she looked eagerly upon the fair and lovely child .
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 13]: `` One night , my sister awoke me and my brother . ''
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 7]: ` What is the matter ? '
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 4]: said Caesar . ''
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 11]: ` She has gone out , ' whispered Marcella . ''
Parsing [sent. 6392 len. 6]: ` Gone out ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6393 len. 47]: ` Yes , gone out at the door , in her night-clothes , ' replied the child ; ' I saw her get out of bed , look at my father to see if he slept , and then she went out at the door . '
Parsing [sent. 6394 len. 59]: `` What could induce her to leave her bed , and all undressed to go out , in such bitter wintry weather , with the snow deep on the ground , was to us incomprehensible ; we lay awake , and in about an hour we heard the growl of a wolf , close under the window . ''
Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 20]: ` There is a wolf , ' said Caesar ; ` she will be torn to pieces . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6396 len. 6]: ` Oh , no ! '
Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 3]: cried Marcella .
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 21]: `` In a few minutes afterwards our mother-in-law appeared ; she was in her night-dress , as Marcella had stated .
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 41]: She let down the latch of the door , so as to make no noise , went to a pail of water , and washed her face and hands , and then slipped into the bed where my father lay .
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 93]: `` We all three trembled , we hardly knew why , but we resolved to watch the next night : we did so -- and not only on the ensuing night , but on many others , and always at about the same hour , would our mother-in-law rise from her bed , and leave the cottage -- and after she was gone , we invariably heard the growl of a wolf under our window , and always saw her , on her return , wash herself before she retired to bed .
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 52]: We observed , also , that she seldom sat down to meals , and that when she did , she appeared to eat with dislike ; but when the meat was taken down , to be prepared for dinner , she would often furtively put a raw piece into her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 23]: `` My brother Caesar was a courageous boy ; he did not like to speak to my father until he knew more .
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 15]: He resolved that he would follow her out , and ascertain what she did .
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 57]: Marcella and I endeavoured to dissuade him from this project ; but he would not be controlled , and , the very next night he lay down in his clothes , and as soon as our mother-in-law had left the cottage , he jumped up , took down my father 's gun , and followed her .
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 19]: `` You may imagine in what a state of suspense Marcella and I remained , during his absence .
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 13]: After a few minutes , we heard the report of a gun .
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 14]: It did not awaken my father , and we lay trembling with anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 17]: In a minute afterwards we saw our mother-in-law enter the cottage -- her dress was bloody .
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 22]: I put my hand to Marcella 's mouth to prevent her crying out , although I was myself in great alarm .
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 33]: Our mother-in-law approached my father 's bed , looked to see if he was asleep , and then went to the chimney , and blew up the embers into a blaze . ''
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 6]: ` Who is there ? '
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 8]: said my father , waking up . ''
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 34]: ` Lie still , dearest , ' replied my mother-in-law , ` it is only me ; I have lighted the fire to warm some water ; I am not quite well . '
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 16]: `` My father turned round and was soon asleep ; but we watched our mother-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 35]: She changed her linen , and threw the garments she had worn into the fire ; and we then perceived that her right leg was bleeding profusely , as if from a gun-shot wound .
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 20]: She bandaged it up , and then dressing herself , remained before the fire until the break of day .
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 22]: `` Poor little Marcella , her heart beat quick as she pressed me to her side -- so indeed did mine .
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 7]: Where was our brother , Caesar ?
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 12]: How did my mother-in-law receive the wound unless from his gun ?
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 30]: At last my father rose , and then , for the first time I spoke , saying , ` Father , where is my brother , Caesar ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 5]: ` Your brother ! '
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 13]: exclaimed he , ` why , where can he be ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 4]: ` Merciful Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 42]: I thought as I lay very restless last night , ' observed our mother-in-law , ` that I heard somebody open the latch of the door ; and , dear me , husband , what has become of your gun ? '
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 19]: `` My father cast his eyes up above the chimney , and perceived that his gun was missing .
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 24]: For a moment he looked perplexed , then seizing a broad axe , he went out of the cottage without saying another word .
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 40]: `` He did not remain away from us long : in a few minutes he returned , bearing in his arms the mangled body of my poor brother ; he laid it down , and covered up his face .
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 27]: `` My mother-in-law rose up , and looked at the body , while Marcella and I threw ourselves by its side wailing and sobbing bitterly . ''
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 13]: ` Go to bed again , children , ' said she sharply .
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 31]: ` Husband , ' continued she , ` your boy must have taken the gun down to shoot a wolf , and the animal has been too powerful for him .
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 3]: Poor boy !
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 9]: he has paid dearly for his rashness . '
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 41]: `` My father made no reply ; I wished to speak -- to tell all -- but Marcella , who perceived my intention , held me by the arm , and looked at me so imploringly , that I desisted .
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 40]: `` My father , therefore , was left in his error ; but Marcella and I , although we could not comprehend it , were conscious that our mother-in-law was in some way connected with my brother 's death .
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 42]: `` That day my father went out and dug a grave , and when he laid the body in the earth , he piled up stones over it , so that the wolves should not be able to dig it up .
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 37]: The shock of this catastrophe was to my poor father very severe ; for several days he never went to the chase , although at times he would utter bitter anathemas and vengeance against the wolves .
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 24]: `` But during this time of mourning on his part , my mother-in-law 's nocturnal wanderings continued with the same regularity as before .
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 28]: `` At last , my father took down his gun , to repair to the forest ; but he soon returned , and appeared much annoyed . ''
Parsing [sent. 6439 len. 45]: ` Would you believe it , Christina , that the wolves -- perdition to the whole race -- have actually contrived to dig up the body of my poor boy , and now there is nothing left of him but his bones ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 4]: ` Indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 4]: replied my mother-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 20]: Marcella looked at me , and I saw in her intelligent eye all she would have uttered . '' '
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 20]: A wolf growls under our window every night , father , ' said I. '' ` Aye , indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 10]: -- why did you not tell me , boy ?
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 11]: -- wake me the next time you hear it . '
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 19]: `` I saw my mother-in-law turn away ; her eyes flashed fire , and she gnashed her teeth .
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 29]: `` My father went out again , and covered up with a larger pile of stones the little remnants of my poor brother which the wolves had spared .
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 9]: Such was the first act of the tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 77]: `` The spring now came on : the snow disappeared , and we were permitted to leave the cottage ; but never would I quit , for one moment , my dear little sister , to whom , since the death of my brother , I was more ardently attached than ever ; indeed I was afraid to leave her alone with my mother-in-law , who appeared to have a particular pleasure in ill-treating the child .
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 20]: My father was now employed upon his little farm , and I was able to render him some assistance .
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 21]: `` Marcella used to sit by us while we were at work , leaving my mother-in-law alone in the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 43]: I ought to observe that , as the spring advanced , so did my mother-in-law decrease her nocturnal rambles , and that we never heard the growl of the wolf under the window after I had spoken of it to my father .
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 54]: `` One day , when my father and I were in the field , Marcella being with us , my mother-in-law came out , saying that she was going into the forest , to collect some herbs my father wanted , and that Marcella must go to the cottage and watch the dinner .
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 41]: Marcella went , and my mother-in-law soon disappeared in the forest , taking a direction quite contrary to that in which the cottage stood , and leaving my father and I , as it were , between her and Marcella .
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 21]: `` About an hour afterwards we were startled by shrieks from the cottage , evidently the shrieks of little Marcella .
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 17]: ` Marcella has burnt herself , father , ' said I , throwing down my spade .
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 14]: My father threw down his , and we both hastened to the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 21]: Before we could gain the door , out darted a large white wolf , which fled with the utmost celerity .
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 42]: My father had no weapon ; he rushed into the cottage , and there saw poor little Marcella expiring : her body was dreadfully mangled , and the blood pouring from it had formed a large pool on the cottage floor .
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 57]: My father 's first intention had been to seize his gun and pursue , but he was checked by this horrid spectacle ; he knelt down by his dying child , and burst into tears : Marcella could just look kindly on us for a few seconds , and then her eyes were closed in death .
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 21]: `` My father and I were still hanging over my poor sister 's body , when my mother-in-law came in .
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 28]: At the dreadful sight she expressed much concern , but she did not appear to recoil from the sight of blood , as most women do . ''
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 5]: ` Poor child ! '
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 31]: said she , ` it must have been that great white wolf which passed me just now , and frightened me so -- she 's quite dead , Krantz . '
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 10]: `` I know it -- I know it ! '
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 6]: cried my father in agony .
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 49]: `` I thought my father would never recover from the effects of this second tragedy : he mourned bitterly over the body of his sweet child , and for several days would not consign it to its grave , although frequently requested by my mother-in-law to do so .
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 32]: At last he yielded , and dug a grave for her close by that of my poor brother , and took every precaution that the wolves should not violate her remains .
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 25]: `` I was now really miserable , as I lay alone in the bed which I had formerly shared with my brother and sister .
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 43]: I could not help thinking that my mother-in-law was implicated in both their deaths , although I could not account for the manner ; but I no longer felt afraid of her : my little heart was full of hatred and revenge .
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 28]: `` The night after my sister had been buried , as I lay awake , I perceived my mother-in-law get up and go out of the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 21]: I waited some time , then dressed myself , and looked out through the door , which I half opened .
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 41]: The moon shone bright , and I could see the spot where my brother and my sister had been buried ; and what was my horror , when I perceived my mother-in-law busily removing the stones from Marcella 's grave .
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 16]: `` She was in her white night-dress , and the moon shone full upon her .
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 23]: She was digging with her hands , and throwing away the stones behind her with all the ferocity of a wild beast .
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 17]: It was some time before I could collect my senses and decide what I should do .
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 24]: At last , I perceived that she had arrived at the body , and raised it up to the side of the grave .
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 17]: I could bear it no longer ; I ran to my father and awoke him . ''
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 3]: ` Father !
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 3]: father ! '
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 14]: cried I , ` dress yourself , and get your gun . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 4]: ` What ! '
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 14]: cried my father , ` the wolves are there , are they ? '
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 27]: `` He jumped out of bed , threw on his clothes , and in his anxiety did not appear to perceive the absence of his wife .
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 21]: As soon as he was ready , I opened the door , he went out , and I followed him .
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 72]: `` Imagine his horror , when -LRB- unprepared as he was for such a sight -RRB- he beheld , as he advanced towards the grave , not a wolf , but his wife , in her night-dress , on her hands and knees , crouching by the body of my sister , and tearing off large pieces of the flesh , and devouring them with all the avidity of a wolf .
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 11]: She was too busy to be aware of our approach .
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 29]: My father dropped his gun , his hair stood on end ; so did mine ; he breathed heavily , and then his breath for a time stopped .
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 12]: I picked up the gun and put it into his hand .
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 40]: Suddenly he appeared as if concentrated rage had restored him to double vigour ; he levelled his piece , fired , and with a loud shriek , down fell the wretch whom he had fostered in his bosom . ''
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 6]: ` God of Heaven ! '
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 22]: cried my father , sinking down upon the earth in a swoon , as soon as he had discharged his gun .
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 12]: `` I remained some time by his side before he recovered .
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 6]: ` Where am I ? '
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 8]: said he , ` what has happened ?
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 3]: -- Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 5]: -- yes , yes !
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 4]: I recollect now .
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 5]: Heaven forgive me ! '
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 53]: `` He rose and we walked up to the grave ; what again was our astonishment and horror to find that instead of the dead body of my mother-in-law , as we expected , there was lying over the remains of my poor sister , a large , white she wolf . ''
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 6]: ` The white wolf ! '
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 33]: exclaimed my father , ` the white wolf which decoyed me into the forest -- I see it all now -- I have dealt with the spirits of the Hartz Mountains . '
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 13]: `` For some time my father remained in silence and deep thought .
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 45]: He then carefully lifted up the body of my sister , replaced it in the grave , and covered it over as before , having struck the head of the dead animal with the heel of his boot , and raving like a madman .
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 32]: He walked back to the cottage , shut the door , and threw himself on the bed ; I did the same , for I was in a stupor of amazement .
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 25]: `` Early in the morning we were both roused by a loud knocking at the door , and in rushed the hunter Wilfred . ''
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 4]: ` My daughter !
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 6]: -- man -- my daughter !
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 7]: -- where is my daughter ! '
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 7]: cried he in a rage . ''
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 35]: ` Where the wretch , the fiend , should be , I trust , ' replied my father , starting up and displaying equal choler ; ` where she should be -- in hell !
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 12]: -- Leave this cottage or you may fare worse . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 6]: ` Ha -- ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 16]: replied the hunter , ` would you harm a potent spirit of the Hartz Mountains .
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 13]: Poor mortal , who must needs wed a weir wolf . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 4]: ` Out demon !
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 9]: I defy thee and thy power . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 29]: ` Yet shall you feel it ; remember your oath -- your solemn oath -- never to raise your hand against her to harm her . ' '' '
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 10]: I made no compact with evil spirits . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 22]: ` You did ; and if you failed in your vow , you were to meet the vengeance of the spirits .
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 23]: Your children were to perish by the vulture , the wolf -- ' '' ` Out , out , demon ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 9]: ` And their bones blanch in the wilderness .
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 2]: Ha !

Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 23]: `` My father , frantic with rage , seized his axe , and raised it over Wilfred 's head to strike . ''
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 13]: ` All this I swear , ' continued the huntsman , mockingly .
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 30]: `` The axe descended ; but it passed through the form of the hunter , and my father lost his balance , and fell heavily on the floor . ''
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 4]: ` Mortal ! '
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 23]: said the hunter , striding over my father 's body , ` we have power over those only who have committed murder .
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 20]: You have been guilty of a double murder -- you shall pay the penalty attached to your marriage vow .
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 26]: Two of your children are gone ; the third is yet to follow -- and follow them he will , for your oath is registered .
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 18]: Go -- it were kindness to kill thee -- your punishment is -- that you live ! '
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 8]: `` With these words the spirit disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 17]: My father rose from the floor , embraced me tenderly , and knelt down in prayer .
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 11]: `` The next morning he quitted the cottage for ever .
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 17]: He took me with him and bent his steps to Holland , where we safely arrived .
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 31]: He had some little money with him ; but he had not been many days in Amsterdam before he was seized with a brain fever , and died raving mad .
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 17]: I was put into the Asylum , and afterwards was sent to sea before the mast .
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 7]: You now know all my history .
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 17]: The question is , whether I am to pay the penalty of my father 's oath ?
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 17]: I am myself perfectly convinced that , in some way or another , I shall . ''
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 62]: On the twenty-second day the high land of the south of Sumatra was in view ; as there were no vessels in sight , they resolved to keep their course through the Straits , and run for Pulo Penang , which they expected , as their vessel laid so close to the wind , to reach in seven or eight days .
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 30]: By constant exposure , Philip and Krantz were now so bronzed , that with their long beards and Mussulman dresses , they might easily have passed off for natives .
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 34]: They had steered during the whole of the days exposed to a burning sun ; they had lain down and slept in the dew of night , but their health had not suffered .
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 43]: But for several days , since he had confided the history of his family to Philip , Krantz had become silent and melancholy ; his usual flow of spirits had vanished , and Philip had often questioned him as to the cause .
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 19]: As they entered the Straits , Philip talked of what they should do upon their arrival at Goa .
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 26]: When Krantz gravely replied , `` For some days , Philip , I have had a presentiment that I shall never see that city . ''
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 13]: `` You are out of health , Krantz , '' replied Philip .
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 13]: `` No ; I am in sound health , body and mind .
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 31]: I have endeavoured to shake off the presentiment , but in vain ; there is a warning voice that continually tells me that I shall not be long with you .
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 41]: Philip , will you oblige me by making me content on one point : I have gold about my person which may be useful to you ; oblige me by taking it , and securing it on your own . ''
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 7]: `` What nonsense , Krantz . ''
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 8]: `` It is no nonsense , Philip .
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 7]: Have you not had your warnings ?
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 7]: Why should I not have mine ?
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 33]: You know that I have little fear in my composition , and that I care not about death ; but I feel the presentiment which I speak of more strongly every hour .
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 15]: It is some kind spirit who would warn me to prepare for another world .
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 4]: Be it so .
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 37]: I have lived long enough in this world to leave it without regret ; although to part with you and Amine , the only two now dear to me , is painful , I acknowledge . ''
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 12]: `` May not this arise from over-exertion and fatigue , Krantz ?
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 14]: consider how much excitement you have laboured under within these last four months .
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 10]: Is not that enough to create a corresponding depression ?
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 14]: Depend upon it , my dear friend , such is the fact . ''
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 42]: `` I wish it were -- but I feel otherwise , and there is a feeling of gladness connected with the idea that I am to leave this world , arising from another presentiment , which equally occupies my mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 5]: `` Which is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 16]: `` I hardly can tell you ; but Amine and you are connected with it .
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 50]: In my dreams I have seen you meet again ; but it has appeared to me , as if a portion of your trial was purposely shut from my sight in dark clouds ; and I have asked , ` May not I see what is there concealed ? '
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 10]: -- and an invisible has answered , ` No !
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 6]: ` twould make you wretched .
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 25]: Before these trials take place , you will be summoned away ' -- and then I have thanked Heaven , and felt resigned . ''
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 63]: `` These are the imaginings of a disturbed brain , Krantz ; that I am destined to suffering may be true ; but why Amine should suffer , or why you , young , in full health and vigour , should not pass your days in peace , and live to a good old age , there is no cause for believing .
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 7]: You will be better to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 24]: `` Perhaps so , '' replied Krantz ; -- `` but still you must yield to my whim , and take the gold .
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 62]: If I am wrong , and we do arrive safe , you know , Philip , you can let me have it back , '' observed Krantz , with a faint smile -- `` but you forget , our water is nearly out , and we must look out for a rill on the coast to obtain a fresh supply . ''
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 13]: `` I was thinking of that when you commenced this unwelcome topic .
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 28]: We had better look out for the water before dark , and as soon as we have replenished our jars , we will make sail again . ''
Parsing [sent. 6577 len. 26]: At the time that this conversation took place , they were on the eastern side of the Strait , about forty miles to the northward .
Parsing [sent. 6578 len. 36]: The interior of the coast was rocky and mountainous , but it slowly descended to low land of alternate forest and jungles , which continued to the beach : the country appeared to be uninhabited .
Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 49]: Keeping close in to the shore , they discovered , after two hours ' run , a fresh stream which burst in a cascade from the mountains , and swept its devious course through the jungle , until it poured its tribute into the waters of the Strait .
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 39]: They ran close in to the mouth of the stream , lowered the sails , and pulled the peroqua against the current , until they had advanced far enough to assure them that the water was quite fresh .
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 66]: The jars were soon filled , and they were again thinking of pushing off ; when , enticed by the beauty of the spot , the coolness of the fresh water , and wearied with their long confinement on board of the peroqua , they proposed to bathe -- a luxury hardly to be appreciated by those who have not been in a similar situation .
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 20]: They threw off their Mussulman dresses , and plunged into the stream , where they remained for some time .
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 28]: Krantz was the first to get out ; he complained of feeling chilled , and he walked on to the banks where their clothes had been laid .
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 13]: Philip also approached nearer to the beach , intending to follow him .
Parsing [sent. 6585 len. 25]: `` And now , Philip , '' said Krantz , `` this will be a good opportunity for me to give you the money .
Parsing [sent. 6586 len. 26]: I will open my sash , and pour it out , and you can put it into your own before you put it on . ''
Parsing [sent. 6587 len. 15]: Philip was standing in the water , which was about level with his waist .
Parsing [sent. 6588 len. 41]: `` Well , Krantz , '' said he , `` I suppose if it must be so , it must ; but it appears to me an idea so ridiculous -- however , you shall have your own way . ''
Parsing [sent. 6589 len. 46]: Philip quitted the run , and sat down by Krantz , who was already busy in shaking the doubloons out of the folds of his sash ; at last he said -- `` I believe , Philip , you have got them all , now ?
Parsing [sent. 6590 len. 6]: -- I feel satisfied . ''
Parsing [sent. 6591 len. 71]: `` What danger there can be to you , which I am not equally exposed to , I can not conceive , '' replied Philip ; `` however -- '' Hardly had he said these words , when there was a tremendous roar -- a rush like a mighty wind through the air -- a blow which threw him on his back -- a loud cry -- and a contention .
Parsing [sent. 6592 len. 27]: Philip recovered himself , and perceived the naked form of Krantz carried off with the speed of an arrow by an enormous tiger through the jungle .
Parsing [sent. 6593 len. 17]: He watched with distended eyeballs ; in a few seconds the animal and Krantz had disappeared !
Parsing [sent. 6594 len. 5]: `` God of Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 6595 len. 21]: would that Thou hadst spared me this , '' cried Philip , throwing himself down in agony on his face .
Parsing [sent. 6596 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6597 len. 14]: Krantz , my friend -- my brother -- too sure was your presentiment .
Parsing [sent. 6598 len. 3]: Merciful God !
Parsing [sent. 6599 len. 19]: have pity -- but Thy will be done ; '' and Philip burst into a flood of tears .
Parsing [sent. 6600 len. 25]: For more than an hour did he remain fixed upon the spot , careless and indifferent to the danger by which he was surrounded .
Parsing [sent. 6601 len. 37]: At last , somewhat recovered , he rose , dressed himself , and then again sat down -- his eyes fixed upon the clothes of Krantz , and the gold which still lay on the sand .
Parsing [sent. 6602 len. 8]: `` He would give me that gold .
Parsing [sent. 6603 len. 5]: He foretold his doom .
Parsing [sent. 6604 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 6605 len. 2]: yes !
Parsing [sent. 6606 len. 11]: it was his destiny , and it has been fulfilled .
Parsing [sent. 6607 len. 21]: _ His bones will bleach in the wilderness _ , and the spirit-hunter and his wolfish daughter are avenged . ''
Parsing [sent. 6608 len. 28]: The shades of evening now set in , and the low growling of the beasts of the forest recalled Philip to a sense of his own danger .
Parsing [sent. 6609 len. 50]: He thought of Amine ; and hastily making the clothes of Krantz and the doubloons into a package , he stepped into the peroqua , with difficulty shoved it off , and with a melancholy heart , and in silence , hoisted the sail , and pursued his course .
Parsing [sent. 6610 len. 18]: `` Yes , Amine , '' thought Philip , as he watched the stars twinkling and corruscating .
Parsing [sent. 6611 len. 25]: `` Yes , you are right , when you assert that the destinies of men are foreknown , and may by some be read .
Parsing [sent. 6612 len. 6]: My destiny is , alas !
Parsing [sent. 6613 len. 18]: that I should be severed from all I value upon earth , and die friendless and alone .
Parsing [sent. 6614 len. 17]: Then welcome death , if such is to be the case ; welcome a thousand welcomes !
Parsing [sent. 6615 len. 9]: what a relief wilt thou be to me !
Parsing [sent. 6616 len. 14]: what joy to find myself summoned to where the weary are at rest !
Parsing [sent. 6617 len. 7]: I have my task to fulfil .
Parsing [sent. 6618 len. 25]: God grant that it may soon be accomplished , and let not my life be embittered by any more trials such as this . ''
Parsing [sent. 6619 len. 42]: Again did Philip weep , for Krantz had been his long-tried , valued friend , his partner in all his dangers and privations , from the period that they had met when the Dutch fleet attempted the passage round Cape Horn .
Parsing [sent. 6620 len. 35]: After seven days of painful watching and brooding over bitter thoughts , Philip arrived at Pulo Penang , where he found a vessel about to sail for the city to which he was destined .
Parsing [sent. 6621 len. 38]: He ran his peroqua alongside of her , and found that she was a brig under the Portuguese flag , having , however , but two Portuguese on board , the rest of the crew being natives .
Parsing [sent. 6622 len. 37]: Representing himself as an Englishman in the Portuguese service , who had been wrecked , and offering to pay for his passage , he was willingly received , and in a few days the vessel sailed .
Parsing [sent. 6623 len. 25]: Their voyage was prosperous ; in six weeks they anchored in the roads of Goa ; the next day they went up the river .
Parsing [sent. 6624 len. 31]: The Portuguese captain informed Philip where he might obtain lodging ; and passing him off as one of his crew , there was no difficulty raised as to his landing .
Parsing [sent. 6625 len. 46]: Having located himself at his new lodging , Philip commenced some inquiries of his host relative to Amine , designating her merely as a young woman who had arrived there in a vessel some weeks before ; but he could obtain no information concerning her .
Parsing [sent. 6626 len. 44]: `` Signor , '' said the host , `` to-morrow is the grand _ Auto da Fé _ ; we can do nothing until that is over ; afterwards , I will put you in the way to find out what you wish .
Parsing [sent. 6627 len. 42]: In the meantime , you can walk about the town ; to-morrow I will take you to where you can behold the grand procession , and then we will try what we can do to assist you in your search . ''
Parsing [sent. 6628 len. 34]: Philip went out , procured a suit of clothes , removed his beard , and then walked about the town , looking up at every window to see if he could perceive Amine .
Parsing [sent. 6629 len. 44]: At a corner of one of the streets , he thought he recognised Father Mathias , and ran up to him ; but the monk had drawn his cowl over his head , and when addressed by that name , made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 6630 len. 19]: `` I was deceived , '' thought Philip ; `` but I really thought it was him . ''
Parsing [sent. 6631 len. 19]: And Philip was right ; it was Father Mathias , who thus screened himself from Philip 's recognition .
Parsing [sent. 6632 len. 16]: Tired , at last he returned to his hotel , just before it was dark .
Parsing [sent. 6633 len. 31]: The company there were numerous ; everybody for miles distant had come to Goa to witness the _ Auto da Fé _ , -- and everybody was discussing the ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 6634 len. 22]: `` I will see this grand procession , '' said Philip to himself , as he threw himself on his bed .
Parsing [sent. 6635 len. 22]: `` It will drive thought from me for a time , and God knows how painful my thoughts have now become .
Parsing [sent. 6636 len. 11]: Amine , dear Amine , may angels guard thee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6637 len. 59]: Chapter XL Although to-morrow was to end all Amine 's hopes and fears -- all her short happiness -- her suspense and misery -- yet Amine slept until her last slumber in this world was disturbed by the unlocking and unbarring of the doors of her cell , and the appearance of the head jailor with a light .
Parsing [sent. 6638 len. 15]: Amine started up -- she had been dreaming of her husband -- of happiness !
Parsing [sent. 6639 len. 7]: She awoke to the sad reality .
Parsing [sent. 6640 len. 20]: There stood the jailor , with a dress in his hand , which he desired she would put on .
Parsing [sent. 6641 len. 12]: He lighted a lamp for her , and left her alone .
Parsing [sent. 6642 len. 11]: The dress was of black serge , with white stripes .
Parsing [sent. 6643 len. 32]: Amine put on the dress , and threw herself down on the bed , trying if possible to recall the dream from which she had been awakened , but in vain .
Parsing [sent. 6644 len. 18]: Two hours passed away , and the jailor again entered , and summoned her to follow him .
Parsing [sent. 6645 len. 60]: Perhaps one of the most appalling customs of the Inquisition is , that after accusation , whether the accused parties confess their guilt or not , they return to their dungeons , without the least idea of what may have been their sentence , and when summoned on the morning of the execution they are equally kept in ignorance .
Parsing [sent. 6646 len. 28]: The prisoners were all summoned by the jailors , from the various dungeons , and led into a large hall , where they found their fellow-sufferers collected .
Parsing [sent. 6647 len. 78]: In this spacious , dimly lighted hall were to be seen about two hundred men , standing up as if for support , against the walls , all dressed in the same black and white serge ; so motionless , so terrified were they , that if it had not been for the rolling of their eyes , as they watched the jailors , who passed and repassed , you might have imagined them to be petrified .
Parsing [sent. 6648 len. 14]: It was the agony of suspense , worse than the agony of death .
Parsing [sent. 6649 len. 44]: After a time , a wax candle , about five feet long , was put into the hands of each prisoner , and then some were ordered to put on over their dress the _ Sanbenitos _ -- others the _ Samarias _ !
Parsing [sent. 6650 len. 62]: Those who received these dresses , with flames painted on them , gave themselves up for lost ; and it was dreadful to perceive the anguish of each individual as the dresses were one by one brought forward , and with the heavy drops of perspiration on his brows , he watched with terror lest one should be presented to him .
Parsing [sent. 6651 len. 9]: All was doubt , fear , and horror !
Parsing [sent. 6652 len. 15]: But the prisoners in this hall were not those who were to suffer death .
Parsing [sent. 6653 len. 84]: Those who wore the Sanbenitos had to walk in the procession and receive but slight punishment ; those who wore the Samarias had been condemned , but had been saved from the consuming fire , by an acknowledgment of their offence ; the flames painted on their dresses were _ reversed _ , and signified that they were not to suffer ; but this the unfortunate wretches did not know , and the horrors of a cruel death stared them in the face !
Parsing [sent. 6654 len. 21]: Another hall , similar to the one in which the men had been collected , was occupied by female culprits .
Parsing [sent. 6655 len. 20]: The same ceremonies were observed -- the same doubt , fear , and agony were depicted upon every countenance .
Parsing [sent. 6656 len. 34]: But there was a third chamber , smaller than the other two , and this chamber was reserved for those who had been sentenced , and who were to suffer at the stake .
Parsing [sent. 6657 len. 37]: It was into this chamber that Amine was led , and there she found seven other prisoners dressed in the same manner as herself : two only were Europeans , the other five were negro slaves .
Parsing [sent. 6658 len. 17]: Each of these had their confessor with them , and were earnestly listening to his exhortation .
Parsing [sent. 6659 len. 28]: A monk approached Amine , but she waved him away with her hand : he looked at her , spat on the floor , and cursed her .
Parsing [sent. 6660 len. 43]: The head jailor now made his appearance with the dresses for those who were in this chamber ; these were Samarias , only different from the others , inasmuch as the flames were painted on them _ upwards _ instead of down .
Parsing [sent. 6661 len. 56]: These dresses were of grey stuff , and loose , like a waggoner 's frock ; at the lower part of them , both before and behind , was painted the likeness of the wearer , that is , the face only , resting upon a burning faggot , and surrounded with flames and demons .
Parsing [sent. 6662 len. 13]: Under the portrait was written the crime for which the party suffered .
Parsing [sent. 6663 len. 29]: Sugar-loaf caps , with flames painted on them , were also brought and put on their heads , and the long wax candles were placed into their hands .
Parsing [sent. 6664 len. 47]: Amine and the others condemned being arrayed in these dresses , remained in the chambers , for some hours before it was time for the procession to commence , for they had been all summoned up by the jailors at about two o'clock in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 6665 len. 66]: The sun rose brilliantly , much to the joy of the members of the Holy Office , who would not have had the day obscured on which they were to vindicate the honour of the church , and prove how well they acted up to the mild doctrines of the Saviour -- those of charity , good-will , forbearing one another , forgiving one another .
Parsing [sent. 6666 len. 4]: God of Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 6667 len. 53]: And not only did those of the Holy Inquisition rejoice , but thousands and thousands more who had flocked from all parts to witness the dreadful ceremony , and to hold a jubilee -- many indeed actuated by fanaticism , superstition , but more attended from thoughtlessness and the love of pageantry .
Parsing [sent. 6668 len. 18]: The streets and squares through which the procession was to pass were filled at an early hour .
Parsing [sent. 6669 len. 28]: Silks , tapestries , and cloth of gold and silver were hung over the balconies , and out of the windows , in honour of the procession .
Parsing [sent. 6670 len. 53]: Every balcony and window was thronged with ladies and cavaliers in their gayest attire , all waiting anxiously to see the wretches paraded before they suffered ; but the world is fond of excitement , and where is anything so exciting to a superstitious people as an _ Auto da Fé _ ?
Parsing [sent. 6671 len. 35]: As the sun rose , the heavy bell of the Cathedral tolled , and all the prisoners were led down to the Grand Hall , that the order of the procession might be arranged .
Parsing [sent. 6672 len. 29]: At the large entrance door , on a raised throne , sat the Grand Inquisitor , encircled by many of the most considerable nobility and gentry of Goa .
Parsing [sent. 6673 len. 52]: By the Grand Inquisitor stood his Secretary , and as the prisoners walked past the throne , and their names were mentioned , the Secretary , after each , called out the names of one of those gentlemen , who immediately stepped forward , and took his station by the prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 6674 len. 31]: These people are termed the godfathers ; their duty is to accompany and be answerable for the prisoner , who is under their charge , until the ceremony is over .
Parsing [sent. 6675 len. 18]: It is reckoned a high honour conferred on those whom the Grand Inquisitor appoints to this office .
Parsing [sent. 6676 len. 6]: At last the procession commenced .
Parsing [sent. 6677 len. 34]: First was raised on high the standard of the Dominican Order of Monks , for the Dominican Order were the founders of the Inquisition , and claimed this privilege , by prescriptive right .
Parsing [sent. 6678 len. 12]: After the banner the monks themselves followed , in two lines .
Parsing [sent. 6679 len. 9]: And what was the motto of their banner ?
Parsing [sent. 6680 len. 6]: `` Justitia et Misericordia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6681 len. 30]: Then followed the culprits , to the number of three hundred , each with his godfather by his side , and his large wax candle lighted in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 6682 len. 17]: Those whose offences have been most venial walk first ; all are bareheaded , and barefooted .
Parsing [sent. 6683 len. 34]: After this portion , who wore only the dress of black and white serge , came those who carried the Sanbenitos ; then those who wore the Samarias , with the flames reversed .
Parsing [sent. 6684 len. 34]: Here there was a separation in the procession , caused by a large cross , with the carved image of Our Saviour nailed to it , the face of the image carried forward .
Parsing [sent. 6685 len. 58]: This was intended to signify , that those in advance of the Crucifix , and upon whom the Saviour looked down , were not to suffer ; and that those who were behind , and upon whom his back was turned , were cast away , to perish for ever in this world , and the next .
Parsing [sent. 6686 len. 20]: Behind the Crucifix followed the seven condemned ; and , as the greatest criminal , Amine walked the last .
Parsing [sent. 6687 len. 8]: But the procession did not close here .
Parsing [sent. 6688 len. 23]: Behind Amine were five effigies , raised high on poles , clothed in the same dresses , painted with flames and demons .
Parsing [sent. 6689 len. 47]: Behind each effigy was borne a coffin , containing a skeleton ; the effigies were of those who had died in their dungeon , or expired under the torture , and who had been tried and condemned after their death , and sentenced to be burnt .
Parsing [sent. 6690 len. 28]: These skeletons had been dug up , and were to suffer the same sentence as , had they still been living beings , they would have undergone .
Parsing [sent. 6691 len. 18]: The effigies were to be tied to the stakes , and the bones were to be consumed .
Parsing [sent. 6692 len. 38]: Then followed the members of the Inquisition ; the familiars , monks , priests , and hundreds of penitents , in black dresses , which concealed their faces , all with the lighted tapers in their hands .
Parsing [sent. 6693 len. 34]: It was two hours before the procession , which had paraded through almost every important street in Goa , arrived at the Cathedral in which the further ceremonies were to be gone through .
Parsing [sent. 6694 len. 32]: The barefooted culprits could now scarcely walk , the small sharp flints having so wounded their feet , that their tracks up the steps of the Cathedral were marked with blood .
Parsing [sent. 6695 len. 20]: The grand altar of the Cathedral was hung with black cloth , and lighted up with thousands of tapers .
Parsing [sent. 6696 len. 30]: On one side of it was a throne for the Grand Inquisitor , on the other , a raised platform for the Viceroy of Goa , and his suite .
Parsing [sent. 6697 len. 41]: The centre aisle had benches for the prisoners , and their godfathers ; the other portions of the procession falling off to the right and left , to the side aisles , and mixing for the time with the spectators .
Parsing [sent. 6698 len. 40]: As the prisoners entered the Cathedral , they were led into their seats , those least guilty sitting nearest to the altar , and those who were condemned to suffer at the stake being placed the farthest from it .
Parsing [sent. 6699 len. 23]: The bleeding Amine tottered to her seat , and longed for the hour which was to sever her from a Christian world .
Parsing [sent. 6700 len. 44]: She thought not of herself , nor of what she was to suffer ; she thought but of Philip ; of his being safe from these merciless creatures -- of the happiness of dying first , and of meeting him again in bliss .
Parsing [sent. 6701 len. 61]: Worn with long confinement , with suspense and anxiety , fatigued and suffering from her painful walk , and the exposure to the burning sun , after so many months ' incarceration in a dungeon , she no longer shone radiant with beauty ; but still there was something even more touching in her care-worn , yet still perfect features .
Parsing [sent. 6702 len. 68]: The object of universal gaze , she had walked with her eyes cast down , and nearly closed ; but occasionally , when she did look up , the fire that flashed from them spoke the proud soul within , and many feared and wondered , while more pitied that one so young , and still so lovely , should be doomed to such an awful fate .
Parsing [sent. 6703 len. 32]: Amine had not taken her seat in the Cathedral more than a few seconds , when , overpowered by her feelings and by fatigue , she fell back in a swoon .
Parsing [sent. 6704 len. 9]: Did no one step forward to assist her ?
Parsing [sent. 6705 len. 10]: to raise her up , and offer her restoratives ?
Parsing [sent. 6706 len. 5]: No -- not one .
Parsing [sent. 6707 len. 73]: Hundreds would have done so , but they dared not : she was an outcast , excommunicated , abandoned , and lost ; and should any one , moved by compassion for a suffering fellow-creature , have ventured to raise her up , he would have been looked upon with suspicion , and most probably have been arraigned , and have had to settle the affair of conscience with the Holy Inquisition .
Parsing [sent. 6708 len. 34]: After a short time two of the officers of the Inquisition went to Amine and raised her again in her seat , and she recovered sufficiently to enable her to retain her posture .
Parsing [sent. 6709 len. 26]: A sermon was then preached by a Dominican monk , in which he pourtrayed the tender mercies , the paternal love of the Holy Office .
Parsing [sent. 6710 len. 80]: He compared the Inquisition to the ark of Noah , out of which all the animals walked after the deluge ; but with this difference , highly in favour of the Holy Office , that the animals went forth from the ark no better than they went in , whereas those who had gone into the Inquisition with all the cruelty of disposition , and with the hearts of wolves , came out as mild and patient as lambs .
Parsing [sent. 6711 len. 31]: The public accuser then mounted the pulpit , and read from it all the crimes of those who had been condemned , and the punishments which they were to undergo .
Parsing [sent. 6712 len. 36]: Each prisoner , as the sentence was read , was brought forward to the pulpit by the officers , to hear their sentence , standing up , with their wax candles lighted in their hands .
Parsing [sent. 6713 len. 61]: As soon as the sentences of all those whose lives had been spared were read , the Grand Inquisitor put on his priestly robes and , followed by several others , took off from them the ban of excommunication -LRB- which they were supposed to have fallen under -RRB- , by throwing holy water on them with a small broom .
Parsing [sent. 6714 len. 82]: As soon as this portion of the ceremony was over , those who were condemned to suffer , and the effigies of those who had escaped by death , were brought up one by one , and their sentences read ; the winding up of the condemnation of all was in the same words , `` that the Holy Inquisition found it impossible on account of the hardness of their hearts and the magnitude of their crimes , to pardon them .
Parsing [sent. 6715 len. 60]: With great concern it handed them over to Secular Justice to undergo the penalty of the laws ; exhorting the authorities at the same time to show clemency and mercy towards the unhappy wretches , and if they _ must _ suffer death , that at all events it might be without the _ spilling of blood _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 6716 len. 30]: What mockery was this apparent intercession , not to shed blood , when to comply with their request , they substituted the torment and the agony of the stake !
Parsing [sent. 6717 len. 36]: Amine was the last who was led forward to the pulpit , which was fixed against one of the massive columns of the centre aisle , close to the throne occupied by the Grand Inquisitor .
Parsing [sent. 6718 len. 12]: `` You , Amine Vanderdecken , '' cried the public accuser .
Parsing [sent. 6719 len. 36]: At this moment an unusual bustle was heard in the crowd under the pulpit , there was struggling and expostulation , and the officers raised their wands for silence and decorum -- but it continued .
Parsing [sent. 6720 len. 38]: `` You , Amine Vanderdecken , being accused -- '' Another violent struggle ; and from the crowd darted a young man , who rushed to where Amine was standing , and caught her in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 6721 len. 3]: `` Philip !
Parsing [sent. 6722 len. 3]: Philip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6723 len. 28]: screamed Amine , falling on his bosom ; as he caught her , the cap of flames fell off her head and rolled along the marble pavement .
Parsing [sent. 6724 len. 17]: `` My Amine -- my wife -- my adored one -- is it thus we meet ?
Parsing [sent. 6725 len. 7]: My lord , she is innocent .
Parsing [sent. 6726 len. 22]: Stand off , men , '' continued he to the officers of the Inquisition , who would have torn them asunder .
Parsing [sent. 6727 len. 13]: `` Stand off , or your lives shall answer for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6728 len. 41]: This threat to the officers , and the defiance of all rules , were not to be borne ; the whole Cathedral was in a state of commotion , and the solemnity of the ceremony was about to be compromised .
Parsing [sent. 6729 len. 57]: The Viceroy and his followers had risen from their chairs to observe what was passing , and the crowd was pressing on , when the Grand Inquisitor gave his directions , and other officers hastened to the assistance of the two who had led Amine forward , and proceeded to disengage her from Philip 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 6730 len. 5]: The struggle was severe .
Parsing [sent. 6731 len. 37]: Philip appeared to be endued with the strength of twenty men ; and it was some minutes before they could succeed in separating him , and when they had so done , his struggles were dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 6732 len. 31]: Amine , also , held by two of the familiars , shrieked , as she attempted once more , but in vain , to rush into her husband 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 6733 len. 44]: At last , by a tremendous effort , Philip released himself , but as soon as he was released , he sank down helpless on the pavement ; the exertion had caused the bursting of a blood-vessel , and he lay without motion .
Parsing [sent. 6734 len. 4]: `` Oh God !
Parsing [sent. 6735 len. 3]: Oh God !
Parsing [sent. 6736 len. 23]: they have killed him -- monsters -- murderers -- let me embrace him but once more , '' cried Amine , frantically .
Parsing [sent. 6737 len. 54]: A priest now stepped forward -- it was Father Mathias -- with sorrow in his countenance ; he desired some of the bystanders to carry out Philip Vanderdecken , and Philip , in a state of insensibility , was borne away from the sight of Amine , the blood streaming from his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 6738 len. 16]: Amine 's sentence was read -- she heard it not , her brain was bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 6739 len. 53]: She was led back to her seat , and then it was that all her courage , all her constancy and fortitude gave way ; and during the remainder of the ceremony , she filled the Cathedral with her wild hysterical sobbing ; all entreaties or threats being wholly lost upon her .
Parsing [sent. 6740 len. 16]: All was now over , except the last and most tragical scene of the drama .
Parsing [sent. 6741 len. 34]: The culprits who had been spared were led back to the Inquisition by their godfathers , and those who had been sentenced were taken down to the banks of the river to suffer .
Parsing [sent. 6742 len. 24]: It was on a large open space , on the left of the Custom-house , that this ceremony was to be gone through .
Parsing [sent. 6743 len. 34]: As in the Cathedral , raised thrones were prepared for the Grand Inquisitor and the Viceroy , who , in state , headed the procession , followed by an immense concourse of people .
Parsing [sent. 6744 len. 17]: Thirteen stakes had been set up , eight for the living , five for the dead .
Parsing [sent. 6745 len. 22]: The executioners were sitting on , or standing by , the piles of wood and faggots , waiting for their victims .
Parsing [sent. 6746 len. 30]: Amine could not walk ; she was at first supported by the familiars , and then carried by them , to the stake which had been assigned for her .
Parsing [sent. 6747 len. 31]: When they put her on her feet opposite to it , her courage appeared to revive , she walked boldly up , folded her arms , and leant against it .
Parsing [sent. 6748 len. 24]: The executioners now commenced their office : the chains were passed round Amine 's body -- the wood and faggots piled around her .
Parsing [sent. 6749 len. 23]: The same preparations had been made with all the other culprits , and the confessors stood by the side of each victim .
Parsing [sent. 6750 len. 33]: Amine waved her hand indignantly to those who approached her , when Father Mathias , almost breathless , made his appearance from the crowd , through which he had forced his way .
Parsing [sent. 6751 len. 7]: `` Amine Vanderdecken -- unhappy woman !
Parsing [sent. 6752 len. 12]: had you been counselled by me this would not have been .
Parsing [sent. 6753 len. 15]: Now it is too late , but not too late to save your soul .
Parsing [sent. 6754 len. 31]: Away then with this obstinacy -- this hardness of heart ; call upon the blessed Saviour , that He may receive your spirit -- call upon His wounds for mercy .
Parsing [sent. 6755 len. 11]: It is the eleventh hour , but not too late .
Parsing [sent. 6756 len. 19]: Amine , '' continued the old man , with tears , `` I implore , I conjure you .
Parsing [sent. 6757 len. 16]: At least , may this load of trouble be taken from my heart . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 6758 len. 5]: ` Unhappy woman ! '
Parsing [sent. 6759 len. 4]: you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6760 len. 32]: replied she , `` say rather , ` unhappy priest : ' for Amine 's sufferings will soon be over , while you must still endure the torments of the damned .
Parsing [sent. 6761 len. 12]: Unhappy was the day when my husband rescued you from death .
Parsing [sent. 6762 len. 17]: Still more unhappy the compassion which prompted him to offer you an asylum and a refuge .
Parsing [sent. 6763 len. 17]: Unhappy the knowledge of you from the _ first _ day to the _ last _ .
Parsing [sent. 6764 len. 31]: I leave you to your conscience -- if conscience you retain -- nor would I change this cruel death for the pangs which you in your future life will suffer .
Parsing [sent. 6765 len. 27]: Leave me -- _ I die in the faith of my forefathers _ , and scorn a creed that warrants such a scene as this . ''
Parsing [sent. 6766 len. 18]: `` Amine Vanderdecken , '' cried the priest on his knees , clasping his hands in agony .
Parsing [sent. 6767 len. 7]: `` Leave me , Father . ''
Parsing [sent. 6768 len. 31]: `` There is but a minute left -- for the love of God -- '' `` I tell you then , leave me -- that minute is my own . ''
Parsing [sent. 6769 len. 18]: Father Mathias turned away in despair , and the tears coursed down the old man 's cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 6770 len. 9]: As Amine said , his misery was extreme .
Parsing [sent. 6771 len. 19]: The head executioner now inquired of the confessors whether the culprits died in the _ true _ faith ?
Parsing [sent. 6772 len. 30]: If answered in the affirmative , a rope was passed round their necks and twisted to the stake , so that they were strangled before the fire was kindled .
Parsing [sent. 6773 len. 29]: All the other culprits had died in this manner ; and the head executioner inquired of Father Mathias , whether Amine had a claim to so much mercy .
Parsing [sent. 6774 len. 11]: The old priest answered not , but shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 6775 len. 5]: The executioner turned away .
Parsing [sent. 6776 len. 33]: After a moment 's pause , Father Mathias followed him , and seized him by the arm , saying , in a faltering voice , `` Let her not suffer long . ''
Parsing [sent. 6777 len. 18]: The Grand Inquisitor gave the signal , and the fires were all lighted at the same moment .
Parsing [sent. 6778 len. 35]: In compliance with the request of the priest , the executioner had thrown a quantity of wet straw upon Amine 's pile , which threw up a dense smoke before it burnt into flames .
Parsing [sent. 6779 len. 3]: `` Mother !
Parsing [sent. 6780 len. 2]: mother !
Parsing [sent. 6781 len. 6]: I come to thee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6782 len. 10]: were the last words heard from Amine 's lips .
Parsing [sent. 6783 len. 21]: The flames soon raged furiously , ascending high above the top of the stake to which she had been chained .
Parsing [sent. 6784 len. 36]: Gradually they sunk down ; and only when the burning embers covered the ground , a few fragments of bones hanging on the chain were all that remained of the once peerless and high-minded Amine .
Parsing [sent. 6785 len. 29]: Chapter XLI Years have , passed away since we related Amine 's sufferings and cruel death ; and now once more we bring Philip Vanderdecken on the scene .
Parsing [sent. 6786 len. 10]: And during this time , where has he been ?
Parsing [sent. 6787 len. 21]: A lunatic -- at one time frantic , chained , coerced with blows ; at others , mild and peaceable .
Parsing [sent. 6788 len. 23]: Reason occasionally appeared to burst out again , as the sun on a cloudy day , and then it was again obscured .
Parsing [sent. 6789 len. 40]: For many years there was one who watched him carefully , and lived in hope to witness his return to a sane mind ; he watched in sorrow and remorse , -- he died without his desires being gratified .
Parsing [sent. 6790 len. 5]: This was Father Mathias !
Parsing [sent. 6791 len. 35]: The cottage at Terneuse had long fallen into ruin ; for many years it waited the return of its owners , and at last the heirs-at-law claimed and recovered the substance of Philip Vanderdecken .
Parsing [sent. 6792 len. 58]: Even the fate of Amine had passed from the recollection of most people ; although her portrait , over burning coals , with her crime announced beneath it , still hangs -- as is the custom in the church of the Inquisition -- attracting , from its expressive beauty , the attention of the most careless passers-by .
Parsing [sent. 6793 len. 32]: But many , many years have rolled away -- Philip 's hair is white -- his once-powerful frame is broken down -- and he appears much older than he really is .
Parsing [sent. 6794 len. 11]: He is now sane ; but his vigour is gone .
Parsing [sent. 6795 len. 20]: Weary of life , all he wishes for is to execute his mission -- and then to welcome death .
Parsing [sent. 6796 len. 31]: The relic has never been taken from him : he has been discharged from the lunatic asylum , and has been provided with the means of returning to his country .
Parsing [sent. 6797 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 6798 len. 21]: he has now no country -- no home -- nothing in the world to induce him to remain in it .
Parsing [sent. 6799 len. 13]: All he asks is -- to do his duty and to die .
Parsing [sent. 6800 len. 22]: The ship was ready to sail for Europe ; and Philip Vanderdecken went on board -- hardly caring whither he went .
Parsing [sent. 6801 len. 28]: To return to Terneuse was not his object ; he could not bear the idea of revisiting the scene of so much happiness and so much misery .
Parsing [sent. 6802 len. 32]: Amine 's form was engraven on his heart , and he looked forward with impatience to the time when he should be summoned to join her in the land of spirits .
Parsing [sent. 6803 len. 17]: He had awakened as from a dream , after so many years of aberration of intellect .
Parsing [sent. 6804 len. 30]: He was no longer the sincere Catholic that he had been ; for he never thought of religion without his Amine 's cruel fate being brought to his recollection .
Parsing [sent. 6805 len. 17]: Still he clung on to the relic -- he believed in that -- and that only .
Parsing [sent. 6806 len. 81]: It was his god -- his creed -- his everything -- the passport for himself and for his father into the next world -- the means whereby he should join his Amine -- and for hours would he remain holding in his hand that object so valued -- gazing upon it -- recalling every important event in his life , from the death of his poor mother , and his first sight of Amine ; to the last dreadful scene .
Parsing [sent. 6807 len. 22]: It was to him a journal of his existence , and on it were fixed all his hopes for the future .
Parsing [sent. 6808 len. 3]: `` When !
Parsing [sent. 6809 len. 9]: oh when is it to be accomplished ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6810 len. 8]: was the constant subject of his reveries .
Parsing [sent. 6811 len. 32]: `` Blessed , indeed , will be the day when I leave this world of hate , and seek that other in which ` the weary are at rest . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6812 len. 32]: The vessel on board of which Philip was embarked as a passenger was the _ Nostra Señora da Monte _ , a brig of three hundred tons , bound for Lisbon .
Parsing [sent. 6813 len. 27]: The captain was an old Portuguese , full of superstition , and fond of arrack -- a fondness rather unusual with the people of his nation .
Parsing [sent. 6814 len. 41]: They sailed from Goa , and Philip was standing abaft , and sadly contemplating the spire of the Cathedral , in which he had last parted with his wife , when his elbow was touched , and he turned round .
Parsing [sent. 6815 len. 6]: `` Fellow-passenger , again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6816 len. 13]: said a well-known voice -- it was that of the pilot Schriften .
Parsing [sent. 6817 len. 27]: There was no alteration in the man 's appearance ; he showed no marks of declining years ; his one eye glared as keenly as ever .
Parsing [sent. 6818 len. 25]: Philip started , not only at the sight of the man , but at the reminiscences which his unexpected appearance brought to his mind .
Parsing [sent. 6819 len. 15]: It was but for a second , and he was again calm and pensive .
Parsing [sent. 6820 len. 8]: `` You here again , Schriften ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6821 len. 3]: observed Philip .
Parsing [sent. 6822 len. 13]: `` I trust your appearance forebodes the accomplishment of my task . ''
Parsing [sent. 6823 len. 17]: `` Perhaps it does , '' replied the pilot ; `` we both are weary . ''
Parsing [sent. 6824 len. 38]: Philip made no reply ; he did not even ask Schriften in what manner he had escaped from the fort ; he was indifferent about it ; for he felt that the man had a charmed life .
Parsing [sent. 6825 len. 43]: `` Many are the vessels that have been wrecked , Philip Vanderdecken , and many the souls summoned to their account by meeting with your father 's ship , while you have been so long shut up , '' observed the pilot .
Parsing [sent. 6826 len. 18]: `` May our next meeting with him be more fortunate -- may it be the last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6827 len. 3]: replied Philip .
Parsing [sent. 6828 len. 5]: `` No , no !
Parsing [sent. 6829 len. 22]: rather may he fulfil his doom , and sail till the day of judgment , '' replied the pilot with emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 6830 len. 4]: `` Vile caitiff !
Parsing [sent. 6831 len. 13]: I have a foreboding that you will not have your detestable wish .
Parsing [sent. 6832 len. 2]: Away !
Parsing [sent. 6833 len. 4]: -- leave me !
Parsing [sent. 6834 len. 22]: or you shall find , that although this head is blanched by misery , this arm has still some power . ''
Parsing [sent. 6835 len. 25]: Schriften scowled as he walked away ; he appeared to have some fear of Philip , although it was not equal to his hate .
Parsing [sent. 6836 len. 44]: He now resumed his former attempts of stirring up the ship 's company against Philip , declaring that he was a Jonas , who would occasion the loss of the ship , and that he was connected with the _ Flying Dutchman _ .
Parsing [sent. 6837 len. 28]: Philip very soon observed that he was avoided ; and he resorted to counter-statements , equally injurious to Schriften , whom he declared to be a demon .
Parsing [sent. 6838 len. 34]: The appearance of Schriften was so much against him , while that of Philip , on the contrary , was so prepossessing , that the people on board hardly knew what to think .
Parsing [sent. 6839 len. 45]: They were divided : some were on the side of Philip -- some on that of Schriften ; the captain and many others looking with equal horror upon both , and longing for the time when they could be sent out of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 6840 len. 20]: The captain , as we have before observed , was very superstitious , and very fond of his bottle .
Parsing [sent. 6841 len. 35]: In the morning he would be sober and pray ; in the afternoon he would be drunk , and swear at the very saints whose protection he had invoked but a few hours before .
Parsing [sent. 6842 len. 32]: `` May Holy Saint Antonio preserve us , and keep us from temptation , '' said he , on the morning after a conversation with the passengers about the Phantom Ship .
Parsing [sent. 6843 len. 23]: `` All the saints protect us from harm , '' continued he , taking off his hat reverentially , and crossing himself .
Parsing [sent. 6844 len. 47]: `` Let me but rid myself of these two dangerous men without accident , and I will offer up a hundred wax candles , of three ounces each , to the shrine of the Virgin , upon my safe anchoring off the tower of Belem . ''
Parsing [sent. 6845 len. 8]: In the evening he changed his language .
Parsing [sent. 6846 len. 68]: `` Now , if that Maldetto Saint Antonio do n't help us , may he feel the coals of hell yet ; damn him and his pigs too ; if he has the courage to do his duty , all will be well ; but he is a cowardly wretch , he cares for nobody , and will not help those who call upon him in trouble .
Parsing [sent. 6847 len. 2]: Carambo !
Parsing [sent. 6848 len. 46]: that for you , '' exclaimed the captain , looking at the small shrine of the saint at the bittacle , and snapping his fingers at the image -- `` that for you , you useless wretch , who never help us in our trouble .
Parsing [sent. 6849 len. 19]: The Pope must canonise some better saints for us , for all we have now are worn out .
Parsing [sent. 6850 len. 44]: They could do something formerly , but now I would not give two ounces of gold for the whole calendar ; as for you , you lazy old scoundrel , '' -- continued the captain , shaking his fist at poor Saint Antonio .
Parsing [sent. 6851 len. 63]: The ship had now gained off the southern coast of Africa , and was about one hundred miles from the Lagullas coast ; the morning was beautiful , a slight ripple only turned over the waves , the breeze was light and steady , and the vessel was standing on a wind , at the rate of about four miles an hour .
Parsing [sent. 6852 len. 34]: `` Blessed be the holy saints , '' said the captain , who had just gained the deck ; `` another little slant in our favour , and we shall lay our course .
Parsing [sent. 6853 len. 34]: -- Again I say , blessed be the holy saints , and particularly our worthy patron Saint Antonio , who has taken under his peculiar protection the _ Nostra Señora da Monte _ .
Parsing [sent. 6854 len. 31]: We have a prospect of fine weather ; come , signors , let us down to breakfast , and after breakfast we will enjoy our cigarros upon the deck . ''
Parsing [sent. 6855 len. 63]: But the scene was soon changed ; a bank of clouds rose up from the eastward , with a rapidity that , to the seamen 's eyes , was unnatural , and it soon covered the whole firmament ; the sun was obscured , and all was one deep and unnatural gloom ; the wind subsided , and the ocean was hushed .
Parsing [sent. 6856 len. 31]: It was not exactly dark , but the heavens were covered with one red haze , which gave an appearance as if the world was in a state of conflagration .
Parsing [sent. 6857 len. 34]: In the cabin the increased darkness was first observed by Philip , who went on deck ; he was followed by the captain and passengers , who were in a state of amazement .
Parsing [sent. 6858 len. 6]: It was unnatural and incomprehensible .
Parsing [sent. 6859 len. 15]: `` Now , holy Virgin , protect us -- what can this be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6860 len. 7]: exclaimed the captain in a fright .
Parsing [sent. 6861 len. 14]: `` Holy Saint Antonio , protect us -- but this is awful . ''
Parsing [sent. 6862 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 6863 len. 3]: there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6864 len. 12]: shouted the sailors , pointing to the beam of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 6865 len. 14]: Every eye looked over the gunnel to witness what had occasioned such exclamations .
Parsing [sent. 6866 len. 12]: Philip , Schriften , and the captain were side by side .
Parsing [sent. 6867 len. 35]: On the beam of the ship , not more than two cables ' length distant , they beheld , slowly rising out of the water , the tapering mast-head and spars of another vessel .
Parsing [sent. 6868 len. 33]: She rose , and rose gradually ; her topmasts and top-sail yards , with the sails set , next made their appearance ; higher and higher she rose up from the element .
Parsing [sent. 6869 len. 18]: Her lower masts and rigging , and , lastly , her hull showed itself above the surface .
Parsing [sent. 6870 len. 40]: Still she rose up till her ports , with her guns , and at last the whole of her floatage was above water , and there she remained close to them , with her main-yard squared , and hove-to .
Parsing [sent. 6871 len. 5]: `` Holy Virgin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6872 len. 26]: exclaimed the captain , breathless ; `` I have known ships to _ go down _ , but never to _ come up _ before .
Parsing [sent. 6873 len. 26]: Now will I give one thousand candles , of ten ounces each , to the shrine of the Virgin to save us in this trouble .
Parsing [sent. 6874 len. 5]: One thousand wax candles !
Parsing [sent. 6875 len. 10]: Hear me , blessed lady ; ten ounces each .
Parsing [sent. 6876 len. 21]: Gentlemen , '' cried the captain to the passengers , who stood aghast -- `` why do n't you promise ?
Parsing [sent. 6877 len. 15]: -- promise , I say ; _ promise _ , at all events . ''
Parsing [sent. 6878 len. 30]: `` The Phantom Ship -- _ The Flying Dutchman _ '' shrieked Schriften ; `` I told you so , Philip Vanderdecken ; there is your father -- He !
Parsing [sent. 6879 len. 3]: he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6880 len. 23]: Philip 's eyes had remained fixed on the vessel ; he perceived that they were lowering down a boat from her quarter .
Parsing [sent. 6881 len. 17]: `` It is possible , '' thought he , `` I shall now be permitted ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6882 len. 13]: and Philip put his hand into his bosom and grasped the relic .
Parsing [sent. 6883 len. 22]: The gloom now increased , so that the strange vessel 's hull could but just be discovered through the murky atmosphere .
Parsing [sent. 6884 len. 16]: The seamen and passengers threw themselves down on their knees , and invoked their saints .
Parsing [sent. 6885 len. 38]: The captain ran down for a candle , to light before the image of St Antonio , which he took out of its shrine , and kissed with much apparent affection and devotion , and then replaced .
Parsing [sent. 6886 len. 32]: Shortly afterwards the splash of oars was heard alongside , and a voice calling out , `` I say , my good people , give us a rope from forward . ''
Parsing [sent. 6887 len. 10]: No one answered , or complied with the request .
Parsing [sent. 6888 len. 35]: Schriften only went up to the captain , and told him that if they offered to send letters they must not be received or the vessel would be doomed , and all would perish .
Parsing [sent. 6889 len. 15]: A man now made his appearance from over the gunnel , at the gangway .
Parsing [sent. 6890 len. 33]: `` You might as well have let me had a side rope , my hearties , '' said he , as he stepped on deck ; `` where is the captain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6891 len. 14]: `` Here , '' replied the captain , trembling from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 6892 len. 27]: The man who accosted him appeared a weather-beaten seaman , dressed in a fur cap and canvas petticoats ; he held some letters in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 6893 len. 7]: `` What do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6894 len. 6]: at last screamed the captain .
Parsing [sent. 6895 len. 9]: `` Yes -- what do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6896 len. 3]: continued Schriften .
Parsing [sent. 6897 len. 3]: `` He !
Parsing [sent. 6898 len. 3]: he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6899 len. 9]: `` What , you here , pilot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6900 len. 22]: observed the man ; `` well -- I thought you had gone to Davy 's locker , long enough ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 6901 len. 3]: `` He !
Parsing [sent. 6902 len. 3]: he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6903 len. 6]: replied Schriften , turning away .
Parsing [sent. 6904 len. 36]: `` Why the fact is , captain , we have had very foul weather , and we wish to send letters home ; I do believe that we shall never get round this Cape . ''
Parsing [sent. 6905 len. 12]: `` I ca n't take them , '' cried the captain .
Parsing [sent. 6906 len. 6]: `` Ca n't take them !
Parsing [sent. 6907 len. 34]: well , it 's very odd -- but every ship refuses to take our letters ; it 's very unkind -- seamen should have a feeling for brother seamen , especially in distress .
Parsing [sent. 6908 len. 33]: God knows , we wish to see our wives and families again ; and it would be a matter of comfort to them , if they only could hear from us . ''
Parsing [sent. 6909 len. 18]: `` I can not take your letters -- the saints preserve us ; '' replied the captain .
Parsing [sent. 6910 len. 18]: `` We have been a long while out , '' said the seaman , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 6911 len. 5]: `` How long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6912 len. 10]: inquired the captain , not knowing what to say .
Parsing [sent. 6913 len. 19]: `` We ca n't tell ; our almanack was blown overboard , and we have lost our reckoning .
Parsing [sent. 6914 len. 23]: We never have our latitude exact now , for we can not tell the sun 's declination for the right day . ''
Parsing [sent. 6915 len. 25]: `` Let _ me _ see your letters , '' said Philip , advancing , and taking them out of the seaman 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 6916 len. 11]: `` They must not be touched , '' screamed Schriften .
Parsing [sent. 6917 len. 6]: `` Out , monster ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6918 len. 11]: replied Philip , `` who dares interfere with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6919 len. 8]: `` Doomed -- doomed -- doomed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6920 len. 20]: shrieked Schriften , running up and down the deck , and then breaking into a wild fit of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 6921 len. 19]: `` Touch not the letters , '' said the captain , trembling as if in an ague fit .
Parsing [sent. 6922 len. 14]: Philip made no reply , but held his hand out for the letters .
Parsing [sent. 6923 len. 22]: `` Here is one from our second mate , to his wife at Amsterdam , who lives on Waser Quay . ''
Parsing [sent. 6924 len. 29]: `` Waser Quay has long been gone , my good friend ; there is now a large dock for ships where it once was , '' replied Philip .
Parsing [sent. 6925 len. 4]: `` Impossible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6926 len. 23]: replied the man ; `` here is another from the boatswain to his father , who lives in the old market-place . ''
Parsing [sent. 6927 len. 21]: `` The old market-place has long been pulled down , and there now stands a church upon the spot . ''
Parsing [sent. 6928 len. 4]: `` Impossible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6929 len. 27]: replied the seaman ; `` here is another from myself to my sweetheart , Vrow Ketser -- with money to buy her a new brooch . ''
Parsing [sent. 6930 len. 22]: Philip shook his head -- `` I remember seeing an old lady of that name buried some thirty years ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 6931 len. 3]: `` Impossible !
Parsing [sent. 6932 len. 7]: I left her young and blooming .
Parsing [sent. 6933 len. 18]: Here 's one for the house of Slutz & Co. , to whom the ship belongs . ''
Parsing [sent. 6934 len. 31]: `` There 's no such house now , '' replied Philip ; `` but I have heard , that many years ago there was a firm of that name . ''
Parsing [sent. 6935 len. 3]: `` Impossible !
Parsing [sent. 6936 len. 7]: you must be laughing at me .
Parsing [sent. 6937 len. 49]: Here is a letter from our captain to his son '' `` Give it me , '' cried Philip , seizing the letter , he was about to break the seal , when Schriften snatched it out of his hand , and threw it over the lee gunnel .
Parsing [sent. 6938 len. 16]: `` That 's a scurvy trick for an old shipmate , '' observed the seaman .
Parsing [sent. 6939 len. 27]: Schriften made no reply , but catching up the other letters which Philip had laid down on the capstan , he hurled them after the first .
Parsing [sent. 6940 len. 72]: The strange seaman shed tears , and walked again to the side : -- `` It is very hard -- very unkind , '' observed he , as he descended ; `` the time may come when you may wish that your family should know your situation ; '' so saying , he disappeared : in a few seconds was heard the sound of the oars , retreating from the ship .
Parsing [sent. 6941 len. 6]: `` Holy St Antonio ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6942 len. 13]: exclaimed the captain , `` I am lost in wonder and fright .
Parsing [sent. 6943 len. 9]: Steward , bring me up the arrack . ''
Parsing [sent. 6944 len. 28]: The steward ran down for the bottle ; being as much alarmed as his captain , he helped himself before he brought it up to his commander .
Parsing [sent. 6945 len. 35]: `` Now , '' said the captain , after keeping his mouth for two minutes to the bottle , and draining it to the bottom , `` what is to be done next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6946 len. 15]: `` I 'll tell you , '' said Schriften , going up to him .
Parsing [sent. 6947 len. 43]: `` That man there has a charm hung round his neck ; take it from him and throw it overboard , and your ship will be saved ; if not , it will be lost , with every soul on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 6948 len. 18]: `` Yes , yes , it 's all right depend upon it ; '' cried the sailors .
Parsing [sent. 6949 len. 14]: `` Fools , '' replied Philip , `` do you believe that wretch ?
Parsing [sent. 6950 len. 18]: Did you not hear the man who came on board recognise him , and call him shipmate ?
Parsing [sent. 6951 len. 14]: He is the party whose presence on board will prove so unfortunate . ''
Parsing [sent. 6952 len. 24]: `` Yes , yes , '' cried the sailors , `` it 's all right , the man did call him shipmate . ''
Parsing [sent. 6953 len. 27]: `` I tell you it 's all wrong , '' cried Schriften ; `` that is the man , let him give up the charm . ''
Parsing [sent. 6954 len. 23]: `` Yes , yes ; let him give up the charm , '' cried the sailors , and they rushed upon Philip .
Parsing [sent. 6955 len. 9]: Philip started back to where the captain stood .
Parsing [sent. 6956 len. 10]: `` Mad-men , know ye what ye are about ?
Parsing [sent. 6957 len. 12]: It is the holy cross that I wear round my neck .
Parsing [sent. 6958 len. 31]: Throw it overboard if you dare , and your souls are lost for ever ; '' and Philip took the relic from his bosom and showed it to the captain .
Parsing [sent. 6959 len. 33]: `` No , no , men ; '' exclaimed the captain , who was now more settled in his nerves ; `` that wo n't do -- the saints protect us . ''
Parsing [sent. 6960 len. 58]: The seamen , however , became clamorous ; one portion were for throwing Schriften overboard , the other for throwing Philip ; at last , the point was decided by the captain , who directed the small skiff , hanging astern , to be lowered down , and ordered both Philip and Schriften to get into it .
Parsing [sent. 6961 len. 13]: The seamen approved of this arrangement , as it satisfied both parties .
Parsing [sent. 6962 len. 18]: Philip made no objection ; Schriften screamed and fought , but he was tossed into the boat .
Parsing [sent. 6963 len. 31]: There he remained trembling in the stern sheets , while Philip , who had seized the sculls , pulled away from the vessel in the direction of the Phantom Ship .
Parsing [sent. 6964 len. 46]: Chapter XLII In a few minutes the vessel which Philip and Schriften had left was no longer to be discerned through the thick haze ; the Phantom Ship was still in sight , but at a much greater distance from them than she was before .
Parsing [sent. 6965 len. 20]: Philip pulled hard towards her , but although hove-to , she appeared to increase her distance from the boat .
Parsing [sent. 6966 len. 31]: For a short time he paused on his oars , to regain his breath , when Schriften rose up and took his seat in the stern sheets of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 6967 len. 63]: `` You may pull and pull , Philip Vanderdecken , '' observed Schriften ; `` but you will not gain that ship -- no , no , that can not be -- we may have a long cruise together , but you will be as far from your object at the end of it , as you are now at the commencement .
Parsing [sent. 6968 len. 10]: -- Why do n't you throw me overboard again ?
Parsing [sent. 6969 len. 9]: You would be all the lighter -- He !
Parsing [sent. 6970 len. 3]: he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6971 len. 27]: `` I threw you overboard in a state of frenzy , '' replied Philip , `` when you attempted to force from me my relic . ''
Parsing [sent. 6972 len. 17]: `` And have I not endeavoured to make others take it from you this very day ?
Parsing [sent. 6973 len. 7]: -- Have I not -- He !
Parsing [sent. 6974 len. 3]: he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6975 len. 43]: `` You have , '' rejoined Philip ; `` but I am now convinced , that you are as unhappy as myself , and that in what you are doing , you are only following your destiny , as I am mine .
Parsing [sent. 6976 len. 50]: Why , and wherefore I can not tell , but we are both engaged in the same mystery ; -- if the success of my endeavours depends upon guarding the relic , the success of yours depends upon your obtaining it , and defeating my purpose by so doing .
Parsing [sent. 6977 len. 26]: In this matter we are both agents , and you have been , as far as my mission is concerned , my most active enemy .
Parsing [sent. 6978 len. 62]: But , Schriften , I have not forgotten , and never will , that you kindlily _ did advise _ my poor Amine ; that you prophesied to her what would be her fate , if she did not listen to your counsel ; that you were no enemy of hers , although you have been , and are still mine .
Parsing [sent. 6979 len. 22]: Although my enemy , for her sake _ I forgive you _ , and will not attempt to harm you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6980 len. 14]: `` You do then _ forgive your enemy _ , Philip Vanderdecken ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6981 len. 16]: replied Schriften , mournfully , `` for such , I acknowledge myself to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 6982 len. 20]: `` I do , with _ all my heart , with all my soul _ , '' replied Philip .
Parsing [sent. 6983 len. 27]: `` Then have you conquered me , Philip Vanderdecken ; you have now made me your friend , and your wishes are about to be accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 6984 len. 7]: You would know who I am .
Parsing [sent. 6985 len. 38]: Listen : -- when your Father , defying the Almighty 's will , in his rage took my life , he was vouchsafed a chance of his doom being cancelled , through the merits of his son .
Parsing [sent. 6986 len. 28]: I had also my appeal , which was for _ vengeance _ ; it was granted that I should remain on earth , and thwart your will .
Parsing [sent. 6987 len. 46]: That as long as we were enemies , you should not succeed ; but that when you had conformed to the highest attribute of Christianity , proved on the holy cross , that of _ forgiving your enemy _ , your task should be fulfilled .
Parsing [sent. 6988 len. 18]: Philip Vanderdecken , you have forgiven your enemy , and both our destinies are now accomplished . ''
Parsing [sent. 6989 len. 12]: As Schriften spoke , Philip 's eyes were fixed upon him .
Parsing [sent. 6990 len. 36]: He extended his hand to Philip -- it was taken ; and as it was pressed , the form of the pilot wasted as it were into the air , and Philip found himself alone .
Parsing [sent. 6991 len. 30]: `` Father of Mercy , I thank Thee , '' said Philip , `` that my task is done , and that I again may meet my Amine . ''
Parsing [sent. 6992 len. 50]: Philip then pulled towards the Phantom Ship , and found that she no longer appeared to leave him ; on the contrary , every minute he was nearer and nearer , and at last he threw in his oars , climbed up her sides , and gained her deck .
Parsing [sent. 6993 len. 9]: The crew of the vessel crowded round him .
Parsing [sent. 6994 len. 17]: `` Your captain , '' said Philip ; `` I must speak with your captain . ''
Parsing [sent. 6995 len. 9]: `` Who shall I say , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6996 len. 11]: demanded one , who appeared to be the first mate .
Parsing [sent. 6997 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6998 len. 19]: replied Philip ; `` tell him his son would speak to him , his son Philip Vanderdecken . ''
Parsing [sent. 6999 len. 43]: Shouts of laughter from the crew , followed this answer of Philip 's ; and the mate , as soon as they ceased , observed with a smile , `` You forget , sir , perhaps you would say his father . ''
Parsing [sent. 7000 len. 23]: `` Tell him his son , if you please , '' replied Philip , `` take no note of grey hairs . ''
Parsing [sent. 7001 len. 25]: `` Well , sir , here he is coming forward , '' replied the mate , stepping aside , and pointing to the captain .
Parsing [sent. 7002 len. 7]: `` What is all this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7003 len. 4]: inquired the captain .
Parsing [sent. 7004 len. 13]: `` Are you Philip Vanderdecken , the captain of this vessel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7005 len. 11]: `` I am , sir , '' replied the other .
Parsing [sent. 7006 len. 8]: `` You appear not to know me !
Parsing [sent. 7007 len. 5]: But how can you ?
Parsing [sent. 7008 len. 26]: you saw me but when I was only three years old ; yet may you remember a letter which you gave to your wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 7009 len. 4]: `` Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7010 len. 12]: replied the captain ; `` and who then are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7011 len. 19]: `` Time has stopped with you , but with those who live in the world he stops not !
Parsing [sent. 7012 len. 16]: and for those who pass a life of misery , he hurries on still faster .
Parsing [sent. 7013 len. 53]: In me , behold your son , Philip Vanderdecken , who has obeyed your wishes ; and after a life of such peril and misery as few have passed , has at last fulfilled his vow , and now offers to his father the precious relic that he required to kiss . ''
Parsing [sent. 7014 len. 13]: Philip drew out the relic , and held it towards his father .
Parsing [sent. 7015 len. 32]: As if a flash of lightning had passed through his mind , the captain of the vessel started back , clasped his hands , fell on his knees , and wept .
Parsing [sent. 7016 len. 8]: `` My son , my son ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7017 len. 30]: exclaimed he , rising , and throwing himself into Philip 's arms , `` my eyes are opened -- the Almighty knows how long they have been obscured . ''
Parsing [sent. 7018 len. 21]: Embracing each other , they walked aft , away from the men , who were still crowded at the gangway .
Parsing [sent. 7019 len. 28]: `` My son , my noble son , before the charm is broken -- before we resolve , as we must , into the elements , oh !
Parsing [sent. 7020 len. 25]: let me kneel in thanksgiving and contrition : my son , my noble son , receive a father 's thanks , '' exclaimed Vanderdecken .
Parsing [sent. 7021 len. 22]: Then with tears of joy and penitence he humbly addressed himself to that Being , whom he once so awfully defied .
Parsing [sent. 7022 len. 30]: The elder Vanderdecken knelt down : Philip did the same ; still embracing each other with one arm , while they raised on high the other , and prayed .
Parsing [sent. 7023 len. 31]: For the last time the relic was taken from the bosom of Philip and handed to his father -- and his father raised his eyes to heaven and kissed it .
Parsing [sent. 7024 len. 38]: And as he kissed it , the long tapering upper spars of the Phantom vessel , the yards and sails that were set , fell into dust , fluttered in the air and sank upon the wave .
Parsing [sent. 7025 len. 18]: Then mainmast , foremast , bowsprit , everything above the deck , crumbled into atoms and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 7026 len. 73]: Again he raised the relic to his lips , and the work of destruction continued , the heavy iron guns sank through the decks and disappeared ; the crew of the vessel -LRB- who were looking on -RRB- crumbled down into skeletons , and dust , and fragments of ragged garments ; and there were none left on board the vessel in the semblance of life but the father and the son .
Parsing [sent. 7027 len. 92]: Once more did he put the sacred emblem to his lips , and the beams and timbers separated , the decks of the vessel slowly sank , and the remnants of the hull floated upon , the water ; and as the father and son -- the one young and vigorous , the other old and decrepit -- still kneeling , still embracing , with their hands raised to heaven , sank slowly under the deep blue wave , the lurid sky was for a moment illumined by a lightning cross .
Parsing [sent. 7028 len. 33]: Then did the clouds which obscured the heavens roll away swift as thought -- the sun again burst out in all his splendour -- the rippling waves appeared to dance with joy .
Parsing [sent. 7029 len. 20]: The screaming sea-gull again whirled in the air , and the scared albatross once more slumbered on the wing .
Parsing [sent. 7030 len. 20]: The porpoise tumbled and tossed in his sportive play , the albicore and dolphin leaped from the sparkling sea .
Parsing [sent. 7031 len. 27]: -- All nature smiled as if it rejoiced that the charm was dissolved for ever , and that `` THE PHANTOM SHIP '' WAS NO MORE .
