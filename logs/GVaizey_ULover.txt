Parsing [sent. 1 len. 11]: AN UNKNOWN LOVER , BY MRS GEORGE DE HORNE VAIZEY .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 6]: Part 1 -- Chapter I .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 41]: They were seated together at the breakfast-table , a handsome , bored-looking man of thirty-three , and a girl of twenty-six , whose dress of a rich blue made an admirable touch of colour in the dim , brown room .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 40]: The house had been designed in the period when shelter from the wind seems to have been the one desired good , and was therefore built in a dell , from which the garden rose in a rapid slope .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 55]: Today the house would crown the head of the slope , and the dell be relegated to a retreat for occasional hot afternoons ; the breakfast-room would face east , and the sun stream in through wide bay-windows , from which fact the spirits of the occupants would benefit afresh with each new morn .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 22]: As it was the light filtered dimly through mullioned panes , and the oak panelled walls gave back no answering gleam .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 33]: Curtains and carpet alike were of dull neutral tints , and the one bright spot in the picture was the blue dress of the girl , who sat behind the coffee urn .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 4]: Was she beautiful ?
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 5]: Was she merely pretty ?
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 15]: Was she redeemed from plainness only by a certain quality of interest and charm ?
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 70]: At different times an affirmative answer might have been given to each of the three questions in turns ; at the moment Katrine Beverley appeared just a tall , graceful girl who arranged her hair with a fine eye for the exigencies of an irregular profile , and who deserved an order of merit for choosing a dress at once so simple , so artistic , and so becoming .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 13]: Martin was enjoying a breakfast menu which he sturdily refused to vary .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 23]: Year in , year out , through dog days , and through frost , the same three courses formed his morning meal .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 23]: Porridge -- the which he ate barbarously with sugar , instead of salt , -- bacon and eggs , marmalade and toast .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 31]: The appearance of the same dish at the dinner-table twice over in a fortnight would have evoked complaint and reprisals , but he would stand no tampering with his breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 15]: The _ Times _ and the _ Morning Post _ lay beside his plate .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 13]: He glanced at the headlines in the interval between porridge and bacon .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 4]: Nothing going on !
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 9]: It was the dullest of all dead years .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 9]: Katrine was nibbling daintily at fruit and cream .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 40]: For the moment a fruitarian craze was in full swing , and she shuddered disgustedly at the thought of bacon , refusing to view it in its crisp and rashered form , and obstinately harking back to the sty .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 29]: In a few months ' time she would probably be discoursing learnedly of the uric acid in fruit , and seriously contemplating a course of `` Salisbury . ''
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 61]: When the maid entered the room with the morning 's letters and the young mistress turned over her correspondence with white , ringless hands , the discovery that she was not the wife of the man at the head of the table would have come to an onlooker less as a surprise than as the confirmation of a settled conviction .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 12]: These two people had not the air of a married couple .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 43]: As individuals they were more calmly , amicably detached than it is possible to be in that closest and most demanding of relationships ; moreover , family likeness betrayed itself in curve and line , and in a natural grace of movement .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 30]: Brother and sister , alone in the dim old room , while from three different points of view the same pictured face looked down upon their _ tete-a-tete _ .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 30]: From above the mantelpiece a painting ; from the bureau , a photograph printed in soft sepia tones ; from the bookcase a snapshot in a round black frame .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 43]: All over the house the same face looked down from the walls , for Katrine saw to it that no room was without a pictured presentment of the young mistress who had reigned for one short year over the dim old house .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 39]: In the first days of loss her heart had ached with an unbearable ache , not so much even for Martin himself , as for that other girl who had enjoyed her kingdom for so brief a reign .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 7]: Poor , pretty , fair-haired child !
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 14]: there was something inconceivably shocking in the thought of Juliet _ dead _ .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 44]: In life she had played the part of an irresponsible toy , born to be petted , to be served , to be screened from every touch of care ; her very marriage had been treated in the light of an amusing joke .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 12]: It was impossible to think of Juliet becoming middle-aged and responsible .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 20]: She was a flower of a day , and her day had passed with startling , with horrible rapidity .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 8]: Martin had been stunned by his loss .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 30]: He was but twenty-five at the time of his marriage , and had found no difficulty in turning into a boy again to make merry with his girl wife .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 90]: As the months passed by , he had , it is true , shown signs of a growing restiveness , born of a desire for something more stable than everlasting frivoling , but before the restiveness had had time to culminate , a sudden wind had swept the delicate flower , and after a few days of agonising fear , the soul of Juliet had fled , leaving behind a still , majestic mask , which even to the husband who loved her was a strange and awesome thing .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 4]: Eight years ago !
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 8]: The colour was fading from the photographs .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 58]: The fair face with the large eyes and small open mouth was growing more and more cloudy and indistinct , but as soon as her attention was directed to the fact , Katrine had industriously ordered new copies from the old negative , and distributed them about the house , waiting complacently for her brother 's recognition .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 4]: It never came .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 12]: No word or glance betrayed Martin 's knowledge of the change .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 19]: Even yet , Katrine reflected , even yet , he could not bear to refer to the past !
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 17]: In his heart he was grateful , no doubt , but his tongue could not speak .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 9]: Juliet 's name was never mentioned between them .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 23]: A blank wall of silence was drawn over that short , eventful year during which she had passed meteor-like across their path .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 26]: So far as Katrine herself was concerned , grief had long since evaporated , but she reminded herself constantly that for Martin it was different .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 7]: Martin 's sorrow was for life .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 37]: Eight years ago , when she was barely eighteen , he had come to her , white and haggard , and had spoken a few unforgettable words : `` You are the mistress now , Katrine .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 14]: We are alone together , and I -- and I shall never many !
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 8]: Do as you please in the house .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 13]: I sha n't interfere ; I shall never care enough to interfere .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 6]: My life is over . ''
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 52]: He believed what he said ; they both believed it , the girl of eighteen and the youth of twenty-five , and alone in her room Katrine , who had never kept in the same mind for a month together , made , with sobs and tears , a life-long vow .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 4]: Loyalty to Martin !
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 22]: faithfulness , devotion , unending patience and tenderness to Martin of the broken heart , and the broken , ended life .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 19]: In the hour of his agony he had turned to her , and she would never fail him .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 47]: It would not be easy ; Martin had not always been easy to understand even in the good old times ; now he would be sad , irritable , unresponsive ; she would have to expend herself , and to expect but little appreciation in return .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 17]: She told herself warmly that she wanted no thanks , all she wanted was to help .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 33]: Incidentally , also , she herself could never marry , but as a mere school-girl , free as yet from any consciousness of sex , she accepted that privation with youthful calm .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 28]: She would have her own house , her own place in the world ; a life-work worth doing , and which no one but herself could undertake .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 9]: She entered upon it with a serene content .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 59]: Eight years ago , and here they were still , sitting at either end of the breakfast table , with Juliet 's face looking down on them from the walls ; the same people , living the same lives , looking practically the same , for life goes slowly in little English towns , thinking the same thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 45]: practically the same -- poor Martin 's outlook , of course , was unchanged , Katrine decided , but for herself , when one was twenty-six ... She heaved a sigh , straightened herself resolutely , and glanced at the letters by her plate .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 48]: They were three in number ; a coroneted missive in white and gold , a pale violet envelope edged with a line of a darker shade , and bearing a dashing monogram upon the reverse side , and lastly , a bulky epistle with an Indian stamp .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 5]: `` Nice mail ! ''
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 11]: exclaimed Katrine appreciatively , as she glanced over her budget .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 29]: `` Some one told me yesterday that the invitations for the Barfield Garden Party were out , and I felt a qualm in case ours had been overlooked .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 10]: Here it is , however , safe and sound .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 5]: Tuesday , July 9 .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 4]: Over six weeks !
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 6]: What a fearsomely long invitation !
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 17]: I do love that afternoon at Barfield ; it is a very zoological garden of lions .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 13]: If they could only be labelled , how interesting it would be !
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 11]: You will come with me to Barfield , Martin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 7]: `` Oh , I suppose so .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 2]: Possibly .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 5]: If nothing happens . ''
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 11]: Martin Beverley 's voice hardly echoed his sister 's gratification .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 24]: He spoke with the air of a man laboriously anxious to be agreeable , but his lifted eyes held no sparkle of light .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 22]: Then they fell upon the violet envelope , and he spoke again : -- `` From Grizel , is it not ?
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 7]: What has she to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 6]: Katrine laughed with light amusement .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 5]: `` The usual Grizel !
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 7]: Nothing whatever that 's worth repeating .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 24]: I often wonder why I write to her at all , for her replies are nothing but a paraphrase of my own letters .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 5]: This one for example .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 31]: She is sorry it was wet for the picnic ; she is glad you are enjoying your golf ; how nice it is that the garden is looking so well !
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 24]: She echoes all my sentiments and thoughts , but '' -- Katrine 's lips curved with laughter , `` in her own way !
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 11]: It 's just the Grizel touch which transforms the whole .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 3]: Little wretch !
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 9]: she can make even a paraphrase charming . ''
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 11]: Martin helped himself to another slice of crisp brown toast .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 28]: His sister 's description of her friend 's letter had not been enthralling , nevertheless his eyes dwelt upon it with a persistence which was easily understood .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 10]: Martin wanted to read Grizel 's effusion for himself .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 31]: Katrine was perfectly aware of the fact , but a latent obstinacy , for which she would have found it difficult to account , prevented her from granting his desire .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 14]: There was nothing whatever in the letter which could interest a grown man .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 16]: She persistently looked the other way , waiting in silence until he should speak again .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 14]: `` Are you going to ask Grizel for the Barfield Garden Party ? ''
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 20]: Katrine looked up sharply , her tell-tale face betraying the fact that the suggestion was not to her taste .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 3]: `` Grizel !
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 3]: To Barfield .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 6]: I never thought of it .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 5]: Why should I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 6]: `` She would enjoy it .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 10]: She has n't been here for some time . ''
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 11]: Katrine looked down , and drummed on the table impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 24]: A moment before she had been decidedly pale ; now there was a suspicion of temper in the quick reddening of her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 46]: Her lips were pressed together as though to keep back impetuous words , but before the pause had time to grow serious , she had put another question , with an air of elaborate calm : `` Do you wish her to be invited ? ''
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 13]: Martin Beverley waved his hand carelessly , `` it was a suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 22]: I thought you might be glad of her company , and Grizel can always be trusted to turn herself out well .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 7]: She would do you credit . ''
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 7]: `` Oh , _ clothes _ !
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 23]: I was not thinking of clothes , '' Katrine pushed back her plate , and fidgeted impatiently with her cup and saucer .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 8]: `` Of course it is your house .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 20]: If you wish -- '' A fragment of toast broke off sharply at a twist from Martin 's fingers .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 27]: There was a moment of strained silence , then he said suavely : -- `` Let us say then that I do _ not _ wish !
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 30]: It 's too hot to argue -- and even if the house is -- ostensibly -- mine , I have no wish to force your own friends upon you .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 6]: You do n't want Grizel .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 3]: Very well !
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 8]: There is no more to be said .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 7]: I 'll have some more coffee .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 7]: It 's particularly good this morning .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 12]: This new woman of yours makes it better than the last .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 10]: What are you going to be about to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 4]: `` Oh nothing !
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 4]: The usual thing .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 4]: Pottering around . ''
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 31]: As Katrine filled up the cup she reflected that it would be easier to deal with Martin if he would let himself go occasionally , and say what he meant .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 21]: These self-contained people made one feel such a brute , and exacted so heavy a penitence for a slight offence !
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 28]: She ought not to have made that remark about `` your house , '' it had been intended to annoy , and it _ had _ annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 54]: The vigorous snap of those strong fingers had not passed unnoticed , but Martin had controlled himself , and poured coals of fire on her head ; she had been not only forgiven , but besought to take her own way , had received into the bargain a sop to her housekeeping pride .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 13]: A right down good scolding would have been less difficult to bear !
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 6]: `` Oh , the coffee !
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 6]: It 's not the making .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 5]: I paid sixpence more .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 17]: The grocer 's bill will be bigger than ever this week , '' she declared perversely .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 17]: To herself she was saying irritably : `` I will _ not _ be stroked down !
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 5]: Why should Grizel come ?
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 9]: It would n't be half so much fun .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 28]: I should be obliged to stay with her , and introduce her to every one who came up , and come home when _ she _ liked .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 22]: -- I go out so seldom that on a special occasion like this , I want to consider _ myself _ !
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 20]: She 'll never expect -- '' `` Your other letter is from the faithful Dorothy , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 16]: Katrine 's hand instinctively covered the grey envelope , her glance softening to a smile .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 5]: `` She never misses .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 15]: It is not once in a year that I have a blank mail . ''
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 11]: `` What on earth does she find to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 9]: Martin Beverley 's voice betrayed a decided impatience .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 13]: Now that the subject was impersonal he had evidently relaxed his guard .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 29]: `` You must have heard all there is to hear about her surroundings , years ago , and there can be precious few happenings in life out there .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 10]: Of course in your case it is different ! ''
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 11]: `` Life being so thrilling in this giddy vale ! ''
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 6]: Katrine was rebellious once more .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 13]: `` Martin never realises _ how _ dull it is for me !
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 22]: It 's just because we have both so few outside interests that Doll and I count so much on our letters .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 36]: I believe Martin considers that life here is quite full and satisfying , and has not the _ least _ idea of how monotonous it is , or of how much I give up . ''
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 27]: She let her mind ponder on the episodes of the last month , feeling an increasing glow of satisfaction in the remembrance of her own sacrifices .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 43]: A week 's invitation refused because Martin would have been left alone ; a musical evening abandoned at the last moment because Martin 's head ached ; two whole evenings devoted to sleepy bridge , when she had wished to play tennis .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 14]: No one could say that she was not the most devoted of sisters !
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 29]: Martin had not even heard of that first most tempting invitation ; she had refused it without a word , denying herself the meed of thanks and appreciation .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 32]: Katrine felt that a special laurel wreath was due to her for that fact alone ; -- every time she recalled her own silence , she was thrilled anew with content .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 16]: Dozens of invitations she had refused for the same reason during the last six years !
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 15]: She might certainly be allowed to enjoy her few pleasures after her own fashion !
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 22]: Suddenly her mood changed ; her eye rested upon the tiny coroneted sheet , and her previous elation died into distaste .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 15]: What did it amount to after all -- this gala day of the season ?
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 71]: A tiresome cross-country journey , or , as an alternative , a long motor drive , tiring and costly ; a crush of smart celebrities making merry among themselves , while the country folk stared from afar , avoiding each other at the beginning of the afternoon , but in the end glad to meet , to compare notes , quiz and admire , and so mitigate the growing loneliness .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 31]: And it was to this that she and her neighbours looked forward for weeks at a time , preening themselves on the invitation received , or smarting beneath its omission !
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 14]: What volumes it spoke of the flatness of life in a country town !
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 12]: How tired , how tired , she was of it all !
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 21]: How she thirsted for a change ... `` Has Dorothea never suggested that you should pay her a visit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 4]: Katrine started violently .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 16]: The question leapt out at her suddenly as if in continuation of her own thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 8]: She gave a short , light laugh .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 5]: `` Dozens of times !
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 3]: Years ago .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 17]: She does n't mention it any longer now that she realises that it is impossible . ''
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 5]: `` Why impossible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 3]: `` Martin !
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 7]: What would become of you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 22]: The note of pained surprise in Katrine 's voice was very real , but her brother refused to treat it seriously .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 11]: He shrugged his shoulders , and smiled an easy smile .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 8]: `` Oh , I should rub along .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 17]: I might get in a working housekeeper , or I could take a room in town .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 10]: I might work better for a change of scene .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 19]: If you would like to go -- '' `` I should n't like anything which left you alone .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 20]: It would not be worth going for less than six months , and I could n't possibly do that .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 13]: I am of _ some _ use to you , Martin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 17]: This time the appeal was too direct to be ignored and the response came readily enough .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 6]: `` A very great deal .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 14]: You have managed admirably , but it is possible to be too unselfish .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 19]: If you would like a change -- '' Katrine drew in her breath with a sharp inhalation . ''
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 6]: _ Like it _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 10]: like to spend months with Dorothea and Jack Middleton !
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 31]: _ Like _ to have the experiences of that thrilling voyage , past the Bay , past Gib. , along the Mediterranean , through the Canal to the glowing East !
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 25]: _ Like _ to see India , with its riot of sun and colour , after six long years in a sleepy country town !
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 20]: It would require an infinitely stronger word to give an indication of the passionate longing which filled her heart .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 33]: But to Katrine , as to most people , the big sacrifice was less difficult than the small , and all that was noble in her nature rose to meet the strain .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 27]: A week 's recreation denied had left a sting which had found vent in captious mood , but she had long since buried the great desire .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 16]: It was only the hopeless inadequacy of that word which had stung it into life .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 4]: _ Like _ !
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 9]: Martin was watching her intently across the table .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 19]: There was a hint of anxiety in his face which touched a sensitive chord in Katrine 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 4]: He needed her !
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 7]: She was all he had left .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 13]: Unselfishness had prompted the suggestion , but it had cost him dear .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 16]: Impulsively she bent towards him , her face a charming mingling of tenderness and fun .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 4]: `` Dear man !
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 13]: It 's noble of you , but it 's no use talking .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 10]: I -- am -- not -- to be budged !
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 10]: My place is here , and here I remain .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 17]: In September you will be off shooting , and then I 'll take a trot around .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 10]: One does want to get out of Cumly sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 16]: But I 'll come back in time to have home ready for your return . ''
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 4]: Martin nodded absently .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 22]: He made no further protestations one way or another , and Katrine in her recovered complacency did not miss their absence .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 34]: The marmalade stage was reached and approaching a conclusion before he spoke again , to ask a new and unexpected question : `` How old is it that you are now , Katrine ?
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 5]: Twenty-three , twenty-four ? ''
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 4]: `` Twenty-six ! ''
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 6]: corrected Katrine with a grimace .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 7]: `` I 'm a woman growed .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 6]: Getting most horridly old . ''
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 6]: `` Nonsense , nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 27]: Martin brushed aside the suggestion , but a moment after contradicted his words with a suggestive : '' _ Still _ , it 's getting on .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 30]: -- Of course you realise , Katrine , that if ever there is any talk of marriage , you must n't let me -- I must not interfere . ''
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 6]: The girl 's lips twitched .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 4]: Ever any talk !
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 3]: Blessed innocent !
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 10]: did he suppose that no one had ever -- ?
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 52]: What would he say if he realised that she had already dismissed two solid , eligible suitors , who had laid before her feet not only themselves , but their not inconsiderable worldly goods , pointing out to each in gentle , sister-like fashion that her life work was already fixed .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 20]: Apart from the pain which she had been obliged to inflict , the incidents had afforded Katrine real satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 13]: It was pleasant to know that _ some one _ had cared !
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 28]: When one grew elderly and fat , it would be satisfactory to remember that one had remained an old maid not of necessity , but from choice .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 23]: It was true that no self-denial had been involved in rejections , but this was a point over which memory skimmed lightly .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 19]: However sorely she had been tempted , Katrine was satisfied that her answer would have been the same .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 11]: `` Thank you , dear , '' she replied demurely .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 5]: `` I 'll remember .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 15]: But there are n't so _ very _ many chances here , are there ?
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 34]: I counted up the other day , and found that there are just twenty-six eligible and attractive girls within a radius of three miles , and exactly three and a half young men .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 16]: The half is represented by Edgar Bevan , who comes home for the week end .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 19]: I do n't wish to exaggerate , so I 'll confess that there are also three widowers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 5]: `` Including myself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 10]: Katrine 's look was full of a shocked surprise .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 3]: `` Martin !
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 4]: How can you !
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 12]: Three and a half bachelors , _ and _ the widowers .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 10]: But _ one _ widower has a fine car .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 8]: He might almost be counted as two !
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 9]: Even so , it leaves a considerable margin .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 14]: My own chance , dear brother , is but one to five ! ''
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 18]: They laughed together , but Martin appeared to ponder the subject , and to find it disconcerting .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 11]: `` That 's so ; no doubt it 's so .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 8]: The young men gravitate to the towns .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 8]: It 's hard on the girls . ''
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 9]: `` Oh , we are happy enough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 15]: The very acknowledgment of the hardship seemed for the moment to remove its sting .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 40]: `` So far as I am concerned , if they all arrived in a body and sat in rows on the hearthrug waiting to propose -LRB- which they show no immediate signs of doing , by the bye ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 7]: I would not look at one .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 11]: You and Dorothea are all the sweethearts I want . ''
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 5]: ejaculated Martin Beverley vaguely .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 23]: He pushed back his chair and strolled over to the window , drawing a cigarette case from his pocket as he went .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 34]: Every morning of his life he took up this position after breakfast , smoked a regulation cigarette , presumably digested the morning 's news , and thought out his plans for the day .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 22]: Katrine was accustomed to the sight , but this morning something in the pose of the figure attracted an uneasy attention .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 15]: The shoulders drooped , the whole attitude bespoke weariness , a lack of purpose .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 45]: Martin Beverley stood in the alcove of the window , and the light shining through the upper panes left his figure in the shade , and fell full upon the pictured face above the mantel -- the fair young face with the unending smile .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 23]: The scene might have been taken as the motif for an artist 's picture , portraying the desolation of a widowed home .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 15]: Katrine 's quick sensibilities grasped its significance , and her heart contracted with sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 3]: `` Juliet !
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 3]: Juliet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 5]: she sighed to herself .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 10]: `` The old ache ; the old pain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 24]: but in truth Juliet might never have existed , for all the part she played in her husband 's thoughts at that moment .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 36]: Martin Beverley was passing through that trying stage in the life of an author when he casts about in his mind for the plan of a future book , and can find no satisfactory response .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 76]: Three months ago , when his last manuscript had been despatched to the publisher , he had acclaimed his liberty with the zest of a schoolboy released from school , had found it sheer joy to wake in the morning to the expectation of a lazy day , but now the holiday mood was fast turning into unrest ; the creative instinct had awakened from its sleep , and its voice would not be denied .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 18]: Imaginary characters flitted before Martin 's brain , he lived with them , carved out their lives .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 22]: In a flash of enthusiasm he saw the completed whole , and found it the finest thing he had yet achieved .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 30]: From time to time he wrote out notes ; sketched out the first few chapters , then reading them over , fell once more into the trough of despair .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 24]: A day or two of restless wanderings , and he would begin again , and again would follow the check , the discouragement .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 16]: He had lived through the same misery with each fresh book which he had written .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 77]: Experience had proved that in this instance it was indeed the first step which cost , that once fairly afloat his characters would grow in reality , and in inexplicable fashion would take the reins in their own hands , and work out their own destinies , but where , since the beginning of the world , is the artist to be found who can be comforted by common-sense while floundering in the valley of discouragement ?
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 30]: This morning for Martin Beverley had begun badly , and breakfast , instead of being a time of refreshment , had left him feeling still more jarred and dreary .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 10]: Mentally he laid the blame upon Katrine 's shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 14]: There was no denying the fact that Katrine was getting upon his nerves .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 82]: For the first few years of their lives together all had gone well ; he himself had been too bruised , too sore , to take more than a passing interest in life ; and she had been but a young and malleable girl ; now at the end of eight years he was awake once more , while Katrine was a woman of twenty-six , and , it was no use denying that the home atmosphere was out of time .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 47]: Katrine was a clever housekeeper , careful and considerate of his comfort , she was also handsome , capable , and affectionate , yet the bitter fact remained that the _ tete-a-tete _ was beginning to jar , and an unspoken friction to shadow the air .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 47]: Martin was grateful for the help which his sister had given him , he tried persistently for self-control , yet in the recesses of his mind the question was growing daily more insistent : '' _ How long could he endure the present _ manage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 25]: An intolerable longing possessed him to break loose from the chains which cramped his life , and to start afresh , free and untrammelled .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 19]: For the moment the very presence of his sister in the room seemed more than he could bear .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 13]: He turned on his heel , and walked quickly from the room .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWO .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 25]: Katrine meantime had accomplished her duties , and given herself up to the enjoyment of reading , and replying , to her Indian letter .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 30]: The temptation of beginning the reply could seldom be postponed , for Dorothea 's words brought with them a personal demand , to which it was imperative to respond .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 25]: Dorothea was the one person in the whole world who could always be relied upon to understand , and follow Katrine 's mental flights .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 74]: At school she had been the staunchest of chums ; through the first black years of Martin 's widowerhood her enthusiasm had kept her friend 's resolution at white heat , and when two years later she had met her fate in the guise of a young officer , and had been spirited away to India , her departure had been the sorest grief which Katrine had yet been called upon to bear .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 45]: The weekly letters which crossed each other with unfailing regularity were in each case a diary of daily happenings , enlivened by such moralisings , grave and gay , as were natural between the friends , who were deeply in each other 's confidence .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 28]: Dorothea 's latest letter was no exception to the rule , except as regards one startling item of news , given , woman-like , in the postscript .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 33]: `` By the way , Jim Blair discovered a charming old box in the bazaar this week , and is sending it home to you as the latest addition to your collection .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 13]: Be sure to answer his letter nicely , and be properly pleased !
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 34]: He is a dear , and I have read -LRB- edited -RRB- extracts from your letters to him weekly , for years past , so that he knows you quite well by repute .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 7]: He is lonely , poor man .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 10]: You would n't grudge him that small distraction ! ''
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 14]: Katrine 's cheeks flushed to an unusual pink as she digested that postscript .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 3]: Jim Blair !
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 19]: Jim Blair was a bachelor , and the _ ami intime _ of the Middleton _ menage _ .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 38]: Katrine searched her memory for further details , and had an impression of a tall , thin man , who had had a rough time in life , and had come through his trials with flying colours .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 6]: Whence had the impression arisen ?
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 20]: She could not tell , but determined to re-read old letters to find out exactly what had been said .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 61]: Meantime the present announcement caused a distinct stirring of the quiet waters of life ... A strange man had written to her , had sent her a gift , in the shape of a brass box , to add to the collection of antiques which lay before her , their polished surfaces gleaming brightly against a background of old oak .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 24]: Katrine had a passion for antique brasses , and through Dorothea 's agency had acquired an interesting collection during the last few years .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 33]: An addition to her collection was always a triumph , but in this special case her expectations were engaged more with the message itself , than with the treasure which it introduced .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 20]: The letter had not arrived by the ordinary post , although Dorothea had spoken of it as already despatched .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 18]: Probably then it was enclosed in the box , and would arrive by the later parcel delivery !
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 3]: A letter !
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 25]: How extraordinary that a man should take upon himself to send a letter to an unknown girl at the other end of the world !
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 71]: As for the brass itself , he had probably seen other specimens which Dorothea had forwarded from time to time , both as commissions and gifts ; had been consulted as to their value , possibly even taken to the bazaar to assist in bargaining ; then , coming by chance across a good specimen , it might have occurred to a generously-minded man to secure it in its turn .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 25]: Katrine would have found the whole transaction natural enough if the gift had been offered through Dorothea 's mediumship -- But to write direct !
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 3]: A letter !
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 6]: What would that letter contain ?
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 25]: A few brief lines of formal explanation ; a colourless , characteristic thing , as lifeless as the sheet on which it was written ?
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 3]: Assuredly so .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 12]: How in the name of fortune could it be anything else ?
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 22]: Katrine stifled a stab of disappointment , and set herself resolutely to foretell the words which she was presently to read .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 30]: `` Dear Miss Beverley -- Dear Madame -- Knowing your liking for old brass -- um -- um -- I am taking the liberty of forwarding -- '' No !
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 7]: that 's too sudden and businessy .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 53]: -- He _ must _ offer some sort of explanation ... `` Coming across this old box the other day in the bazaar , and knowing your liking for old brass , I consulted with Mrs Middleton as to whether I might venture -- '' `` Really , it 's horribly difficult !
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 18]: Why did n't he just put in a card , and leave it to Doll to explain ?
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 27]: I must accept , of course ; it would be churlish to refuse , but as to answering _ nicely _ , that 's another matter !
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 27]: A few lines in the third person would be the best way out of the difficulty -- '' `` A parcel for you , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 24]: The waitress brought in a small box , oblong in shape , sealed and tied with a security which bespoke a long journey .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 48]: Katrine 's hasty hands scattered the wrappings on the floor , and even as they fell , the musty , pungent smell of the East filled the air , and her eyes looked with surprise upon a cedar-wood box , carved , and inlaid with delicate skill .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 3]: Cedar wood !
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 8]: but Dorothea had said _ brass _ .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 19]: It seemed inexplicable that the offering should consist of a thing in which she took no special interest .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 33]: Katrine 's hands weighed it carefully , and discovered an unexpected weight ; she prized off the lid , and beheld yet a second parcel , wrapped in soft , rough silk .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 5]: here came the brass .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 37]: She drew her breath with a quick gasp of delight as the treasure came into sight , -- a long , flat-shaped box , deeply carved with letterings , mingled with the most grotesque of figures .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 11]: Katrine 's growing experience made her aware of its antiquity .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 14]: No other item in her possession was worthy to be named in comparison .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 18]: It was a treasure trove , such as would delight the heart of the most fastidious collector .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 17]: For a moment surprise and admiration engrossed her mind , then quickly following came another thought .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 3]: The letter !
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 6]: -- where was the letter ?
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 6]: Was there no letter enclosed ?
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 31]: Katrine dashed at the scattered wrappings , shook them apart , and failing to find any trace of what she sought , fumbled with the lid of the box itself .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 35]: It was tightly jammed , but a little coaxing set it free , and in the cavity lay a sheet of foreign paper , closely covered with a man 's strong , well-formed writing .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 19]: Katrine seated herself on the chair by the window , with a strange , dazed feeling of expectancy .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 16]: A narrow strip of garden separated the side of the house from the lane without .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 20]: With half-conscious eyes she saw a blue-robed figure strolling slowly by , followed by a fat , waddling pug .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 17]: Mary Biggs , the lawyer 's sister , taking Peter Biggs for his morning 's stroll .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 28]: Approaching from the opposite direction came a trim figure in grey , sandwiched between two small girls , with skirts cut short to display shapely brown legs .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 63]: Mrs Slades 's governess taking the children for their morning stroll ... The little hamlet was pursuing its quiet , machine-like way ; no tremor of excitement had disturbed its calm , but in Katrine 's room was the scent of the East , and out of the silence six thousand miles away , a man laid bare to her his heart .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 3]: CHAPTER THREE .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 11]: `` Lebong , _ May 10 , 19 -- _ .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 38]: `` Captain Blair presents his compliments to Miss Beverley , and takes the liberty of forwarding for her acceptance an antique brass box , which he trusts may be considered worthy of a place in her collection .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 3]: `` Katrine !
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 22]: It is such a delicious little name ; it is the only name by which I have ever heard you called .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 21]: Will you forgive a lonely fellow , six thousand miles away , if he writes to you as he thinks ?
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 32]: It 's ridiculous to let conventions throw their shadow across the world , but if you _ will _ have it , enclosed is the conventional , colourless , third-person missive .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 10]: Keep it , and tear up the rest unread .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 9]: I give you full liberty to do it .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 6]: `` But you wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 19]: `` I might as well confess at once , -- that box is a delusion and a snare .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 17]: I did n't ` hit upon it ' ; I searched for it far and wide .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 19]: Properly regarded , it is not a box at all ; it is an excuse ; a decoy .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 14]: I wanted one badly , and it was the best I could find .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 14]: `` The nuisance of it is that we meet on such unequal terms !
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 29]: You know my name ; you have probably gathered an impression that , as fellows go , I 'm not a bad fellow , though a trifle dull .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 20]: Dorothea Middleton is an angel of hospitality , but an up-country station has its limits even for a saint .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 19]: To your mind I 'm dead as Queen Anne , but to me you are quite distractingly alive .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 44]: Why do you send out photographs taken in such a fashion that your eyes look straight into the eyes of any lonely fellow who chances to sit smoking his pipe in a friend 's bungalow if you do n't want trouble to follow ?
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 8]: `` There 's one photograph which smiles .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 4]: You know it !
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 7]: the one in the white frock .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 19]: When I 'm pleased to be witty , I look at those eyes , and they laugh back .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 15]: My other hearers may be dull and unappreciative , but those eyes never fail .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 14]: Katrine and I have shared many a joke together during these last years .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 10]: `` There 's another photograph -- the dark one !
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 22]: A white , little face looking out of the shadow ; pensive this time , but always with those straight-glancing eyes .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 8]: It 's your own fault , Katrine !
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 33]: If you had been ` taken ' like ordinary folk , gazing blankly into space , all this might never have happened ... The pensive portrait is even deadlier than the glad .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 6]: It looks sorry for me .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 19]: When I 'm turning out at night leaving Will and Dorothea alone , it understands how I feel .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 8]: Its eyes follow me to the door .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 19]: `` I have n't a photograph to send you ; I would n't send one if I had .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 30]: What 's the use of a portrait of a big skeleton of a fellow , brown as a nigger , and at thirty-five looking a lot more like forty ?
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 49]: Let that slide ; but within the walls of the skeleton lives a lonely fellow who has no one left to send him letters from home , and who for the last three years has enjoyed his mail vicariously through extracts read from a young girl 's letters .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 8]: `` You write wonderful letters , Katrine !
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 24]: I do n't know if they are the sort a literary critic would approve , but they bring new life into our camp .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 40]: Dorothea is generous in reading aloud all that she may , and I could stand a pretty stiff examination upon your life in that delightful little Cranford of a place , which you do n't appreciate as you ought .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 12]: Those letters , plus the photograph , have done the damage .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 17]: `` So this is what it comes to , -- I want some letters for myself !
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 11]: I want -LRB- it sounds appallingly conceited ; never mind !
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 27]: Let it go at that -RRB- , I want you to know _ me _ , to realise my existence , even as I do yours .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 7]: Will you write to me sometimes ?
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 16]: I give you fair notice that in any case I mean to write to you .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 39]: It can do you no harm to read my effusions , and if you do violence to your natural curiosity and burn them instead , the snub would miss its point , for I shall be no wiser .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 10]: I 'm not afraid that you will burn them .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 21]: The feminine in you is too strongly developed for such a lack of curiosity , but will you answer them ?
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 5]: That 's the question !
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 7]: `` Think it over , Katrine !
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 17]: At the moment of reading , you have n't a doubt of what you will say .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 26]: Sit down at once to write that haughty letter of reproof and denial , but -- do n't send it off by the first post !
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 15]: Relieve yourself by letting off steam , and then think out the thing calmly .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 30]: `` Your own life is not all that you could wish , but compare it just for a moment with mine , and consider the compensations which you enjoy !
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 45]: Friends , books , papers , happenings of world-wide interest at your door , or what _ seems _ your door to exiles across the world -- all these , and into the bargain , home , and comfort , and _ cool _ !
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 14]: You must acknowledge , Katrine , that the odds are on your side !
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 21]: `` If I could take a holiday and come home , you would receive me graciously as Dorothea 's friend .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 14]: Why should it require a greater effort to receive me in the spirit ?
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 34]: `` Get away from the Cranford spirit , Katrine ; refuse to be bound by it , I see signs , -- I tell you frankly , I see signs of its encroachment !
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 12]: Here 's a fine chance of throwing it to the winds .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 27]: Are you brave enough , fine enough , woman enough , to work out this thing for yourself , and to decide as your heart dictates ?
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 18]: `` I am very humble ; I ask for the moment nothing more than an occasional letter .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 9]: Now , what are you going to do ?
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 8]: At any rate there 's that box !
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 13]: In common decency you must write once at least to acknowledge that !
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 15]: Your answer ought , I calculate , to arrive about four weeks from to-day .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 9]: `` Yours faithfully , `` Jim Blair . ''
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 8]: `` Well , I 'm -- ! ''
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 7]: ejaculated Katrine , and stopped aghast .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 30]: The failure to finish her sentence was attributable less to good feeling than the utter inability to find a word strong enough to express the sentiments of the moment .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 28]: An onlooker , however , could not have failed to remark the fact that , be the sentiment what it might , it was certainly extraordinarily becoming .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 27]: Katrine 's eyes shone , her pale cheeks blazed a damask rose , the firm lips gaped , showing a flash of small , white teeth .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 52]: Seated bolt upright in her high-backed chair , the blue dress outlining the fine lines of her figure , she reached at that moment her highest possibilities of beauty , but there was no one to see her , and for the moment she was oblivious of her own good looks .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 32]: The world of monotonous order rocked in chaos beneath her feet ; volcano-like , those written words had convulsed the landscape , transforming the familiar features into new and astounding shapes .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 15]: Out of the shock and amazement it was difficult to realise the predominant sensation .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 30]: Was it anger ; was it excitement ; was it relief that at last , at last , something had happened to lift life out of the eternal jog-trot ?
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 31]: Katrine did not know , she did not trouble to think ; for the moment it was enough to sit still , and let the whirlwind rush through her veins .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 34]: Whether she were angry or glad , for the moment , at least , the latent powers of feeling were stirred into being ; she was strongly , vitally , _ alive _ !
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 29]: An unknown man had accosted her with what was virtually an expression of love ; had flung down the gage , and challenged her to the reply . ''
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 91]: _ For the moment _ '' he demanded nothing more than an intimate correspondence , with the object of gaining an opportunity to reveal his own identity , and evoking her sympathy in return ... She looked at the brass box lying upon the table , the beautiful antique whose real nature had been so openly confessed ; she looked at the stiff , three-lined message of decorum ; she looked at the letter lying open in her hand , at the strong , clear lettering of that opening word .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 7]: -- '' _ Katrine _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 11]: she murmured beneath her breath , -- `` Katrine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 11]: The word came to her ear with a new delight .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 14]: The commonplace had vanished , it seemed to breathe of beauty and romance .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 27]: Her hands retained their hold of the letter , she raised it from her knee , read it once more and bit hard upon her lip .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 8]: `` What can he think of me ?
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 27]: What impression must my letters have left , if he can believe that it is _ possible _ that I could agree to such a suggestion ?
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 34]: He ca n't have much respect -- '' She fumed , flushed , scorched him with disdain , then suddenly found herself faced by another paragraph , and suffered a humiliating collapse . ''
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 7]: _ The Cranford cramp _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 5]: He had seen signs !
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 6]: How had he seen signs ?
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 24]: Could it indeed be true , that while she was complacently denouncing the narrow-mindedness of her neighbours , the infection had touched herself ?
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 47]: Impulse prompted her to thrust aside so humiliating a suggestion , but a doubt remained ... Was it possible to live for years in a narrow sphere , surrounded by an atmosphere of petty detail , and yet keep one 's own attitude broad and free ?
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 25]: With a certain fierceness of sincerity Katrine searched her conscience , summoned the image of herself before a mental bar , and passed sentence .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 6]: _ It was true _ !
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 26]: Compared with friends from afar ; compared even with the Katrine of years ago , she was slowly , surely stiffening into the Cranford Model .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 35]: Another ten years of steady following would find her with a horizon limited by the High Street and the tennis ground , and a mind incapable of braving the verdict of a village tea-party .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 9]: Katrine sighed ; a short , impatient sigh .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 18]: Self-pride suffered in the revelation , but she told herself boldly that she was not to blame .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 9]: She had had no change , no distractions .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 12]: Year after year she had vegetated in the same small place .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 21]: The past tense came unconsciously to her lips , for already her thoughts dwelt upon yesterday as a far-off past .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 33]: Yesterday Jim Blair had been but a name , the most shadowy of figures ; to-day , with amazing audacity , the shadowy figure had stepped into the very foreground of life !
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 29]: Katrine searched her memory for the stray items of information which her friend 's letters had from time to time contained with regard to her husband 's friend .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 10]: The two men were fellow-captains in the same regiment .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 31]: Blair was the senior of the two , but even so his chances of promotion were small , owing to the hopeless blocking which is the soldier 's greatest handicap .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 50]: Blair had seen active service , had distinguished himself in an expedition to Tibet , could with ease have achieved an exchange , but he was devoted to the regiment , a prime favourite with the mess , and having private means , preferred to defer the evil day .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 11]: Dorothea 's descriptions , though flattering , were somewhat vague .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 17]: She had stated frequently , and with conviction , that `` Jim was a dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 17]: but to which particular brand or type of dear he belonged was left to the imagination .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 43]: Jim was the godfather of the son and heir ; in descriptions of domestic scenes and conversations he seemed naturally to play a part ; Dorothea was complacently convinced that in the society of her husband and herself he found complete satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 20]: It had never occurred to her to consider the part played by a fourth person in those same interviews !
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 16]: A quiet , well-mannered young person who sat on the mantelpiece , taking notes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 7]: _ Katrine and I _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 13]: The real Katrine gasped once more at the remembrance of those words .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 35]: So extraordinary were they , so unbelievable , that to make sure that they were not the creation of her own brain , she turned back to the letter , and re-read the sentence .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 12]: `` Katrine and I have shared many a joke together . ''
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 17]: For a moment the girl frowned , then suddenly a wistful expression stole into her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 13]: She herself had enjoyed so few jokes in these long flat years !
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 7]: The photographs had the advantage there .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 11]: She found herself for the moment almost envying the photographs .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 13]: The laughing one , that was to say ; not the sad .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 25]: The sad one had been guilty of unpardonable boldness in looking sorry for a strange man ; in exchanging glances with him , forsooth !
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 12]: from the doorway , in covert sympathy with his bachelor estate !
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 19]: `` If it had been just an ordinary friendly correspondence , one might -- perhaps -- have agreed !
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 20]: It would be interesting to be friends with a man , but -- but _ it is not _ !
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 20]: He does n't mean it to be ; he does n't mean me to believe that he means it .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 21]: It 's a kind of verbal ` walking out ' ; a correspondence ` with a view to matrimony ! '
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 33]: In a few months ' time he would be asking -- '' Katrine jumped to her feet , and paced excitedly to the window , the letter still clutched in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 15]: It crackled beneath her fingers , as she stood staring out into the lane .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 14]: A man in a white apron was walking rapidly along the farther side .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 14]: Rogers , the butcher 's foreman , homeward bound for his mid-day meal .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 26]: The clock of Saint Dunstan 's struck twelve chimes , and celebrated the occasion by chiming a verse of `` Onward , Christian Soldiers . ''
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 31]: Every morning of the year that white-robed figure passed up the lane at precisely the same hour ; every morning the same verse was ground out on the church bells .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 7]: `` And there is Martin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 12]: said Katrine , in a slow , dull tone of finality .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 6]: `` There is Martin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 19]: For the first time in her experience she felt a flood of pity for her own self-enforced celibacy .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 25]: Hitherto marriage had presented no especial lure and the two men who had appeared as suitors had failed to awaken even a passing interest .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 54]: No one could look at Katrine 's face and fail to realise that she was capable of deep and passionate love , but she had none of the easy sentiment of the ordinary young girl , and having failed to meet her mate , the softer part of her nature was still dormant .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 35]: Moreover she had an immense advantage over the ordinary unmarried woman , in being mistress of a home , in the management of which she could indulge to the full her natural feminine instincts .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 20]: It had appeared to her that if Martin were more responsive , she could be satisfied with her lot .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 30]: There was a certain flatness , no doubt ; a certain dread in envisaging the years , but experience showed that such moods were not confined to spinsters alone .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 24]: They followed as a natural sequence the awakening from youth 's bright dreams ; to encourage them would be both morbid and weak !
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 33]: But with the reading of that amazing letter a new rebellion surged in her soul ... She was giving up her life for Martin , and Martin was not made happy thereby .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 50]: Her mind travelled back to the interview of an hour before -- she saw the tall figure , the weary droop of the shoulders ; caught again a glimpse of the lean dark profile , which , in contradistinction to the pose , had still so boyish an air .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 18]: Like a flash of light came a realisation which galvanised into life the stereotyped pity of years .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 24]: He was _ young _ , poor Martin ; still young , at an age when he might most have enjoyed his life !
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 29]: For the first time a faint doubt shot through the certainty of Katrine 's conviction that all that was best worth having was for Martin past and over .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 37]: A man of thirty-five , in the prime of health and vigour -- was it natural , was it _ right _ , that his heart should remain buried in the grave of his girl wife ?
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 37]: Loyalty would not allow Katrine to confess as much in words , but deep down in her heart she realised that her brother was growing yearly less loving , less lovable , more difficult to please .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 21]: Bereft of Juliet , thrown back upon himself , the best part of his nature was slowly atrophying from disuse .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 9]: Was the fault on his side or hers ?
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 21]: Woman of twenty-six though she was , Katrine was curiously limited in her ideas on the great facts of life .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 25]: The Cranford cramp had laid its hand upon her , so that her judgments were made from the standpoint of convention , not fact .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 50]: It never occurred to her to blame human nature for the fact that a brother and sister of mature age had failed to find completeness in a life together ; instead , she peered anxiously into her own shortcomings of temper and tact , and laboriously built up resolutions .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 10]: `` I must be more careful , more considerate .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 7]: He has nobody but me . ''
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 14]: She sighed , and this time the sigh was undisguisedly wistful in tone .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 6]: `` If it were possible !
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 32]: If she could indeed be brave enough , fine enough , woman enough , to throw conventions to the winds , what a wonderful new interest might come into her life !
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 28]: The arrival of Dorothea 's letters had made epochs in the week , but how much more -- '' She stopped short , aghast at the suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 21]: How could the letters of a strange man be _ more _ engrossing than those of the friend of years ?
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 6]: Comparison between them was ridiculous .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 8]: The whole proposition was preposterous and impossible .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 12]: She would write at once , a firm and dignified rebuff .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 38]: Then suddenly , in the midst of her protests , Katrine caught sight of her own image gazing at her from a mirror across the room -- a transformed image , youthful , glowing , incredibly alive .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 17]: The eyes flashed , drooped with a guilty shame , then flashed again bright and defiant .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 41]: She looked , and burst into a great peal of laughter ; she threw out her arms with the gesture of one pushing aside imprisoning chains , advanced with a swaggering gait , and nodded defiance into the tell-tale glass .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 14]: `` You 're a fraud , Katrine Beverley ; you 're a fraud !
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 16]: It is all humbug and pretence , and you _ know _ that it is .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 34]: His letters _ would _ be more interesting , just because he _ is _ a man , who admires me , and wants -- _ things _ -- he can never have !
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 14]: And I 'm _ not _ sorry , I 'm _ glad _ .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 12]: If it was n't for Martin , I 'd say yes .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 17]: -- I 'd say it at once , I _ want _ to say yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 14]: Her face fell , she sighed despondently , then straightened herself , reassured .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 9]: `` At any rate there is the box .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 14]: In common decency I must write to thank him for the box ! ''
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 36]: And meantime Martin was swinging along the country lanes , recalling the morning 's conversation , and pondering for the hundredth time how he could best escape from the _ impasse _ of his life .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 46]: `` Any other woman would have understood -- would have realised that I _ wanted _ to be alone , but the mischief of it is Katrine does n't see , and I ca n't be brute enough to tell her in so many words .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 21]: If she could be induced to take that Indian tour , we might start afresh after a year 's absence .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 7]: Or she might marry out there .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 19]: She 's a handsome girl , and would make a rattling wife , -- to the right man !
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 4]: Poor old Katrine !
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 72]: I hope I did not show her too plainly ... The furniture will have an extra polish this morning , and we shall have a superfine dinner , my favourite dishes , -- an ice , and Angels on Horseback , -- for a ducat we 'll have them , and I shall buy her a box of chocolates on my way home ... She tries her best , poor girl .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 16]: So do I , for that matter , and that is the devil of it .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 2]: Effort !
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 3]: Effort ! ''
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 19]: The air seemed black with clouds ; the pain which long custom had dulled revived into throbbing life .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 18]: He was racked with mental nausea : life stretched before him level , uneventful , intolerably dull .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 7]: His very work was a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 38]: Long months of effort , and struggle of spirit , and as a result a few patronising reviews , and a monetary reward , which , worked out on a time basis , approached a sweating wage .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 21]: If he never wrote another line , should he be missed ; would the world be a whit the poorer ?
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 17]: What was the sum total when all was told , but amusement for an idle hour !
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 28]: It was in the depths of depression that Martin entered the golf club half an hour later , but on the threshold his good angel stood waiting .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 48]: His favourite partner , a retired civil servant , living in an adjoining village , stood within the pavilion and acclaimed him with delight ; the most intelligent of caddies was at his disposal , and half-an-hour 's play demonstrated the fact that the day was his .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 58]: By the end of two hours the vapours had disappeared beneath the combined influences of bracing air , congenial companionship , and a succession of long drives ; and then as he climbed up the side of a heathery slope , suddenly , mysteriously , in the fashion known to all writers of fiction , inspiration flashed !
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 16]: The longed-for clue appeared , the tangles smoothed , the barren scene vibrated with life .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 18]: Martin stood still on the hill-side , and his lungs expanded with a deep , envious breath .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 2]: Work !
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 2]: Work !
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 51]: The study table -- the scattered leaves , the click of the typewriter ; the barren hours , the hours when thoughts flew so fast that the pen could not keep pace , -- each different phase of work rose before him , and each in its turn seemed good .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 5]: His former lethargy disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 2]: Useless ?
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 2]: Valueless ?
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 22]: Was it of no value to be one of the few writers who in a decadent age kept his pages clean ?
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 18]: When so many streams ran foul , was it a light thing to provide a crystal well ?
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 19]: And this last book should be the best he had written ; stronger , deeper , more vital .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 11]: Already in his own mind it was a living thing .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 18]: He conceived a man , and lived in his image ; he made unto him a wife .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 43]: The two faces flashed at him out of the blue ... Ten minutes later , as he took up his position before a buried ball , Martin was telling himself briskly : `` Hang it all , it 's _ true _ !
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 7]: It _ is _ my house .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 11]: I can ask whom I like -- '' CHAPTER FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 13]: `` Cumly , _ June _ 1 , _ 19 -- _ .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 22]: `` Dear Captain Blair , `` As you say , I am bound in duty to thank you for the box .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 12]: `` Considered as a box , it is a treasure indeed .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 21]: It is so ` worthy ' of my collection , that every other specimen looks in comparison poor and tawdry .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 23]: I have placed it on a little pinnacle of its own , where it shines afar , leaving the lesser lights undimmed .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 28]: `` Miss Beverley returns warm thanks to Captain Blair for his kindness in remembering her collection , and adding to it so valuable and antique a specimen .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 17]: `` But -- there remains Katrine , and Katrine 's duty is so much more complicated !
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 33]: She has written , as you prophesied , four separate letters , all well spelt , and punctuated , and admirably composed , the sentences rounded to a marvel , but alas !
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 18]: each separate one said a different thing , and was afterwards torn up for a different reason .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 16]: `` Number one was haughty and firm : firm , without a quaver of doubt .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 19]: ` Miss Beverley was surprised that Captain Blair could suppose for a moment , that etc. , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 52]: Miss Beverley could certainly not consent to sacrifice the dignity and self-respect so dear to the heart of every true etc. ' `` So far , so good , but Katrine here came to the conclusion that Miss Beverley was a hopeless prig , and effort number one was destroyed forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 12]: Number two was also firm , but more affable in tone .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 16]: `` Miss Beverley had been duly amused by the perusal of Captain Blair 's letter .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 27]: She realised that it had been written on the spur of an impulse , and that he had not intended his suggestion to be taken seriously .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 22]: She would proceed to banish it from her mind , as she felt sure he would now wish her to do .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 32]: `` Here again Katrine interfered , rated Miss Beverley as a hypocrite , declared that she believed nothing of the sort , and sent the second missive packing after the first .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 17]: `` The third and fourth attempts were destroyed for -- er -- _ other _ reasons !
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 10]: One flies at times from one extreme to another .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 6]: Here now beginning the fifth .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 32]: `` If you are sure ; if you are _ quite _ sure that my letters would be a help , I should like to say yes , but conscience pricks .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 19]: -- the Cranford conscience which sees not only straight ahead , but round every conceivable niche and corner .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 9]: `` Take first your own point of view !
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 19]: Suppose a moment that I _ did _ write , you might be horribly disappointed with my letters !
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 46]: You have enjoyed my weekly effusions to Dorothea , but you must remember that she and I are the friends of years , who have shared together all the big experiences of our lives , so that we have a thousand mutual links and interests .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 18]: Also , -- and the importance of this there is no denying -- we are both women !
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 20]: When writing to Dorothea I can be just as frivolous , as morbid , as unreasonable as I please .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 9]: She understands ; she 's been there herself .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 31]: But no mere man -- `` Suppose my letters were insufferably flat and tame , what a position for the Lonely Fellow to find himself bound to reply in kind !
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 8]: He ought seriously to consider this point .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 18]: `` Then there 's my own position , and with myself goes irrevocably Martin , my brother .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 33]: `` Am I _ quite _ justified in taking up any interest , which must more or less engross my thoughts , and distract them from what is my real life work ?
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 9]: `` I am all that he has left .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 16]: He turned to me in his trouble , and I must always put him first .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 16]: It 's not the easiest thing in the world to live with a literary man .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 47]: The readers who praise his books and gush over his lofty sentiments , would be surprised if they could live in the house for a week , and listen to his flow of language over such a trifle , as , say , a banging door !
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 41]: For the last eight years all my time , and all my thought , have been devoted to the effort of pleasing Martin , and , -- -LRB- one can acknowledge things on paper more easily than in words ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 8]: -- it is n't a brilliant success !
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 9]: `` I thought that it was ; no !
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 50]: I did n't think at all , I just complacently took it for granted that he was very lucky to have me , and that I made him as happy and comfortable as he possibly could be under the circumstances , but just lately I 've had an awakening .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 14]: `` He _ is n't _ happy ; he is n't even content .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 28]: I 've been quite an efficient Martha , but the Mary role seems to have been neglected , and we are growing apart , rather than together .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 5]: That must be stopped !
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 11]: I must give more thought to him ; not less .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 8]: `` I am all he has left .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 25]: I should be false to my trust if I deliberately undertook anything which would separate me from Martin by so much as a thought .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 27]: `` Are you fine enough , honest enough , _ man _ enough , to acknowledge that I 'm right , and to respect my decision ?
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 4]: `` Lonely Man !
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 11]: I ought not to begin a regular correspondence with you .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 49]: Just occasionally , perhaps , I might write ; for Christmas , or Easter , or your birthday , and to receive a letter in reply would make a break in my life , which as you so blightingly remark begins to show symptoms of ` cramp . '
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 18]: -LRB- How could my letters be ` so delightful ' if they were ` cramped ' ? -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 26]: The very first thing you must do is to explain just how , and in what way , you discern in me the fatal growth !
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 17]: I 'm so down upon it in other people ; I imagined myself so immaculately free !
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 22]: The least you can do is to warn me of the danger point , before the infection has time to spread .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 49]: `` Also , -- as the aim and object of the correspondence is that I should know your honourable self , let me in to some of the secrets which my photograph understands so well , and most of all , tell me what makes my eyes sorry ?
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 17]: It seems a little hard to be shut out , when mere photographs see so much !
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 10]: `` Miss Beverley presents her compliments to Captain Blair .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 21]: She finds it a very difficult thing to wind up a letter to a man whom she has never seen .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 29]: Miss Beverley will be obliged if Captain Blair will therefore kindly consider this letter concluded in the manner which seems to him the most graceful and appropriate . ''
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 29]: Katrine carried the letter to the post in her own hands , the address carefully turned inwards so as to be screened from the scrutiny of peering eyes .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 35]: Although the distance from the house to the post-office was about an eighth of a mile , it was seldom that she could traverse it without being accosted at least three or four times .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 67]: This morning , however , the ordinary gossip jarred upon every nerve ; she realised with a shiver of distaste that upon previous occasions she had enjoyed these encounters , had looked forward to them as to one of the prized episodes in the day ; had been moved to excitement when she herself possessed a tiny item of news to add to the general store .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 34]: As she crossed the road to the post-office , she debated with herself as to the cause of her change of mind , and found it in the envelope clasped in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 21]: A real interest had come into her life , and in its presence she had no room for trivial make-believes .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 24]: Until now , for eight long years , nothing had happened to reach the real heart of her , and make her feel .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 54]: Never , never once , a thrill , a surprise , a feeling that the great procession of life had halted to give her place , until one short week ago , when out of the void a voice had spoken , and across the world had come a challenge , an appeal !
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 28]: She , who owned little , was asked for much ; at the moment when her own heart was starved , she was asked to fill another .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 15]: The voice had called ; all that was vital within her sang a reply .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 26]: The letter was held out in an extended hand , was pressed for one moment between tightening fingers , then dropped deep into the box .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 28]: She stood motionless for a moment , overwhelmed by the irrevocability of the action , then turned aside with the feeling of one facing a new life .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 19]: That evening Martin was conscious of a special attempt on Katrine 's part to be agreeable and sympathetic .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 29]: The secret lying warm and fragrant at her own heart made her especially tender over his loneliness , added to which tenderness was a decided leaven of compunction .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 32]: Theoretically , she was ready to sacrifice all for Martin 's sake ; virtually , she had stubbornly set herself to reject the one suggestion he had made for months past .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 25]: It had taken a whole week of valiant striving against self to bring her to the point of giving in with a good grace .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 22]: The prospect of a visit from Grizel Dundas was distinctly unpleasant , despite the fact that Grizel was a well-loved friend .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 30]: Katrine searched her conscience for a reason for this contradiction , at the same time shutting a tight bolt over the one suggestion which endeavoured to make itself heard .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 2]: Jealous !
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 6]: Why should she be jealous ?
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 26]: Even if Grizel were a thousand times more attractive than herself , they moved in different worlds , and owned entirely distinct circles of friends .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 9]: Why , pray , need she be jealous ?
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 16]: The inner voice was sternly forbidden to mention Martin 's name in such a connection .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 11]: Jealousy was out of the question where Martin was concerned .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 26]: His suggestion had been made out of consideration for her own enjoyment ; it lay on her conscience that she had received the suggestion ungraciously .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 29]: She swallowed the last doubt , and said gravely : `` I 've been thinking , Martin , that I _ will _ ask Grizel for next month .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 21]: There 's not much to do , but the garden is at its best , and she 'll enjoy that .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 6]: I 'll write to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 5]: Martin crumbled his bread .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 19]: `` Oh , well , '' he said slowly , `` I wrote to her myself last night .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 6]: I meant to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 12]: We have been growing rather dull , living so much alone .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 12]: It will do us good to have some fresh life . ''
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 41]: The fly stopped at the gate , the flyman alighted , and prompted by a sweet expectancy in Grizel 's eye , rose to a height of gallantry hitherto unknown , and offered his arm to assist her to alight .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 28]: Grizel leaned heavily upon it , and having languidly descended to the level of the pavement , dropped her uplifted skirts and trailed slowly towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 38]: In contradiction to the fashion of the day the skirts were trained both back and front , they floated round her in a soft billowy cloud , trailing in their wake a little shower of pebbly stones .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 35]: They were most unfashionable skirts , for a railway journey they were ridiculously inappropriate ; they were also undeniably unsanitary , but the most irate critic could not have denied that they were becoming .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 18]: The skirts were of a soft , quaker grey , edged with a little foam of flounces .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 11]: No one wore flounces in that summer of hobble skirts !
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 33]: A scarf of lavender chiffon was thrown round her neck , she wore a straw hat of no particular shape , draped in no particular fashion , with an old lace veil .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 45]: Up the garden path she came between the two tall lines of hollyhocks , a slight nymph-like figure , enveloped in cloud-like draperies , with a glimpse of a small pale face between the dip of the veil and the float of the scarf .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 15]: Martin and Katrine rushed together to the door , vociferous in greetings and explanations .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 3]: `` Grizel !
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 13]: We were going to meet you ... You _ said _ four-thirty !
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 10]: What induced you to travel by the slow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 17]: `` I _ like _ them slow , '' drawled Grizel in her deep rich tones .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 44]: She trailed into the drawing-room , subsided on to an oak settee , the nearest available seat , held up her face for Katrine 's caress , and extended a small hand to Martin with the air of an Empress bestowing an order .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 35]: This done she yawned undisguisedly , rummaged in a bag -- another floating accessory of violet satin -- produced a minute purse , and asked with a frown : `` What 's his fare ?
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 11]: Please ask him , Somebody , and pay him double .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 11]: I always pay double ; then they do n't swear .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 6]: I do loathe being sweared .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 6]: With my money , please .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 4]: No paupery ! ''
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 28]: The deep drawling tone was in the oddest contrast with the unconventional , not to say slangy mode of speech , but the listeners betrayed no surprise .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 23]: They were accustomed to the discrepancy , and in common with the rest of the world enjoyed , the while they condemned .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 12]: Grizel 's language grew ever more and more exaggerated and boy-like .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 6]: She really ought to reform !
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 16]: but on the other hand how much less amusing it would be if she did !
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 8]: `` The full fare is two shillings .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 14]: Tip him sixpence if you like , but to give more is corruption .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 8]: You should n't be cowardly , Grizel .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 9]: It makes things hard for other people . ''
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 8]: Grizel blinked , and encouraged another yawn .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 6]: `` Is that Socialism ? ''
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 4]: she drawled vaguely .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 8]: `` Have you caught it down here ?
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 21]: I 'll join tomorrow , but do n't expect a fellow to have principles at the end of a journey .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 5]: Give me crumpets ! ''
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 37]: Lifting her arms she tugged at the two long , dagger-like pins with amethyst heads , which held her hat in place , flipped it to the ground , and blinked vaguely in Martin 's face .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 14]: `` Do n't I look _ plain _ with my hair squashed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 10]: In truth at the moment Grizel was not beauteous .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 33]: Her little face was without a trace of colour , marks of fatigue ringed the grey eyes , the mass of soft brown hair was flattened by the pressure of the hat .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 42]: Just a little , tired , colourless face , not even in the first flush of youth , for the fine lines which are the surest tell-tale of advancing years were already beginning to show at the corners of her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 39]: Katrine was sympathetically agreed that Grizel _ was _ plain this afternoon , but Martin felt a sudden flushing of the cheeks as he met the glance of the long eyes ; a sudden swelling of the throat .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 23]: He did not know if Grizel were plain or not ; what was more to the purpose , he did n't care .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 24]: An ordinary , commonplace woman might be appraised for her looks , but this woman 's lure lay in something infinitely more subtle .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 33]: Ill or well , tired or alert , sorry or glad , she remained a very type of womanhood , from whose eyes looked out the eternal challenge , the eternal question .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 29]: No man in Grizel 's presence could forget that she was a woman , and that some time , somewhere , some fortunate man might be her mate .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 22]: As he turned back to the tea-table Martin asked himself for the hundredth time if Grizel were conscious of her power .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 78]: There was nothing consciously provocative in her glance ; her manner with men was indifferent to the point of boredom , yet there it was , a turn of the head , a droop of the lid , a tone in the low rich voice proclaimed the man 's woman , the woman who from childhood to age is served and worshipped , who on a desert island would find a Prince Charming behind the first palm .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 18]: The serving of Grizel 's tea engrossed for some minutes the entire attention of her two hosts .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 41]: She was supplied with a table , a footstool , a cushion for her back ; her tea was first watered , secondly milked , and thirdly strengthened to its original state ; her toast was cut into tiny strips .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 52]: She yawned at intervals with infantile abandon ; it is to be feared she scattered many crumbs upon the grey pile carpet , but unlike ninety-nine women out of a hundred , she made no effort to fluff her flattened hair , or to arrange the delicate disorder of her attire .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 15]: There was something primitive , almost savage , in her childlike naturalness of mien .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 48]: In excuse for such lapses from conventional manners , Katrine was wont to remind herself that Grizel lived so much alone : no one in the grim town house but the old great-aunt , and the retinue of family servants who had grown old in her service .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 36]: It was a ghastly life for a young woman still several years under thirty , it would have been considered so at least by most young women , but Grizel stoutly refused to be pitied .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 8]: The old `` Buddy '' was alone .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 28]: The old Buddy needed her ; the old Buddy found pleasure and refreshment in her society , -- why then should she not have what she wanted ?
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 30]: `` S'pose _ you _ were an old Buddy of eighty-nine , and nobody would n't come , how would _ you _ like it , d'you suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 44]: she would enquire with her usual disregard of grammar , circumlocution , and other conventions practised by the polite , and her hearers mentally substituting `` Grizel '' for `` nobody , '' invariably decided that they would n't like it at all .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 8]: `` How 's the old Buddy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 22]: enquired Katrine , when , the preliminary preparations over , she found a chance to begin tea on her own account .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 52]: She took not the faintest interest in the venerable dame , who for the last ten years had refused to see any one beyond the members of her own family , but it seemed the proper thing to make the enquiry and get it over before proceeding to more interesting subjects .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 10]: `` The same as usual , I suppose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 21]: Grizel held a morsel of cake extended in her hand ; frowned at it sternly , and shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 4]: `` Failing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 4]: she said solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 15]: `` Failing rapidly ; sometimes quite lucid , but , generally speaking , dotty !
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 11]: Dotty , my dear , as the veriest March hare .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 2]: Hallucinations .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 2]: Delusions .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 22]: Went in to see her last night in a new rig , and she took me for the Queen of Sheba .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 22]: Chatted quite calmly for a moment , then blushed and started wriggling , trying to do obeisance from her wheeled chair .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 15]: Said she had n't caught the name , and hoped I would forgive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 5]: `` Poor old Buddy !
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 5]: Awkward for you both .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 8]: And what did you do next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 14]: `` Oh , I Shebaed , of course , '' laughed Grizel lightly .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 18]: `` Bit embarrassing , y' know , because James was Solomon , and she made compromising remarks .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 2]: Humorous !
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 13]: if you think of it -- Solomon in whiskers and greasy black !
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 9]: I could have wished it had been John .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 12]: John is a shapely young thing , and devoted to me .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 7]: We had quite a rollicky evening .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 16]: I made offerings of tea caddies and chimney-piece ornaments , and she kissed my hand .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 4]: Poor old Buddy !
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 8]: She had quite a bean feast . ''
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 35]: Grizel 's deep voice could take on occasion a note of beautiful tenderness ; it sounded now at the mention of the old mad aunt , and her listeners noting it , marvelled afresh .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 53]: Lady Griselda Dundas might now be irresponsible for her eccentricities , but no one could deny that at a time when she was in full possession of her faculties she had complacently plumed herself upon the popular vote which placed her at the head of the cantankerous , ill-mannered women in Society .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 43]: With all sincerity she had endeavoured to live up to her reputation , and though her grand-niece was possibly the only person on earth for whom she had any affection , she was also at the same time the most convenient butt .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 22]: Grizel was ordered about , hectored , reproved , dragged here and there without the slightest reference to her own wishes .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 26]: That the girl bore it cheerfully , uncomplainingly , even with an appearance of zest , was attributed to mercenary motives by society at large .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 34]: Grizel was -- presumably -- heiress to Lady Griselda 's fortune , and it was felt that an even harder apprenticeship would be a cheap price to pay for so big a prize .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 47]: Surmises in plenty were made as to the amount in question ; Grizel went about labelled as one of the greatest heiresses in society , but not even her most intimate friends had the temerity to question Lady Griselda as to the reality of these expectations .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 20]: No one but her `` man of business '' knew the secret of the will locked within his safe .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 12]: `` What happens about your own bean feasts , Grizel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 15]: Martin enquired from the corner seat , to which he had carried his tea .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 26]: The position afforded a full-length view of the visitor as she lolled on the couch ; it was also slightly behind Katrine at the tea-table .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 20]: There were occasions when it was distinctly an asset to be out of the range of Katrine 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 11]: `` Do you go out as much as you used ?
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 14]: I suppose there is a capable maid whom you can leave in charge .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 21]: You ca n't possibly be bound -- '' `` I 'm not bound , but she 's a beautiful excuse .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 24]: I go out when she 's better , which means an invitation which tempts , and if it does n't she 's worse !
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 8]: In the daytime I 'm on duty .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 29]: Parsons is a brick , but she 's a serious brick , and it 's hard lines on the old Buddy to be taken seriously night and day .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 24]: It needs a vast intellect to be vivacious with the insane , but it 's drefful interesting when you 've learned the knack .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 11]: I 'm thinking of taking it up as a Pro .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 8]: Doctor White has sworn to recommend me .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 84]: He says he fears for his own brain , but just for the moment he ordered a change ... I 'm not used to taxing my intellect , and it 's a bit of a strain , so I took a mean advantage of the old dear 's infirmity , and told her certain sure I 'd be back at four o'clock , and when I arrive at the week 's end , she 'll groan because I 'm ten minutes late ! ''
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 4]: `` A week !
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 17]: Now that we 've got you , we wo n't let you go in a week .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 12]: You must take a good rest while you 're about it .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 35]: We have no excitements on hand except the Barfield Garden Party , but you shall be out in the fresh air , and feed on strawberries and cream , and sleep half the day .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 21]: We must send her back with a little more colour in her cheeks , must n't we , Katrine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 9]: Katrine looked at her visitor , and smiled .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 51]: She had not wanted to invite Grizel ; the proposition had found her in an antagonistic mood , she had resented the fact that it had come from Martin rather than herself , but now Grizel had arrived , and with the personal presence , antagonism had vanished into space .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 25]: Her thoughts turned back to yesterday , when at the same hour in the same room she and Martin had partaken of tea together .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 11]: Certainly no one could have called it a lively meal .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 32]: There were occasions when the coming of a third person infused a wonderful refreshment into the daily routine , but Katrine knew her guest 's nature better than did her brother .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 22]: Martin desired that they should take care of Grizel ; in reality it was Grizel who would take care of them .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 23]: Martin had declared that Grizel must rest ; Grizel was incapable of rest , and rest would weary her more than action .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 7]: Where Grizel was , things happened .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 25]: Even as she sat pale and weary upon the sofa , vitality flowed out of her ; the atmosphere was instinct with electric force .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 15]: `` Grizel , '' said Katrine smiling , `` will do as she pleases .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 16]: She always did , and she always will , and she will please to gad !
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 17]: She will gad from morning till night , and drag me about to gad with her .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 46]: It 's very easy for you , Martin ; you issue instructions , shut yourself up in your study all day , and expect them to be carried out , but I tell you at the beginning , -- I wash my hands of responsibility !
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 16]: I 'll go where I 'm -- dragged , and do as I -- must !
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 18]: She 'll be tired out , of course , but it wo n't be my fault . ''
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 15]: `` But I have n't the least intention of letting him shut himself up .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 6]: ` Course I 'll gad !
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 23]: What else is there to do , but do n't you worry , my lamb , Martin shall gad with me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 4]: announced Grizel calmly .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 21]: She flashed her honey-coloured eyes across the room to where Martin sat among the shadows of the dark old room .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 37]: His back was towards the light , she could see the outline of his long lean face , the fine modelling of the jaw , but the expression in the dark eyes she could not see .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 9]: `` We 'll have such -- sport ! ''
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 9]: She laughed , a deep , soft-throated laugh .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 25]: `` I 'm working , '' said Martin in a hesitating voice , a voice which seemed forced out of him against his will .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 27]: `` I 'm afraid , Grizel , that I ca n't -- '' `` And I 'm afraid , Martin , that you _ must _ !
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 9]: What work are you trying to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 8]: `` I 've started a fresh book .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 7]: It 's just beginning to go .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 20]: The first chapters are always a pull , but I hope at last that I 'm well afloat . ''
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 7]: `` I 'll help you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 4]: announced Grizel calmly .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 13]: `` You play with me , and I 'll work with you .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 13]: I 've always felt it in me to write a corking novel .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 10]: We 'll collaborate , and make 'em sit up !
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 6]: Present day , of course .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 11]: I ca n't contend with any century but my own .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 17]: _ Very _ modern , and up to date , and the heroine lives in Kensington .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 8]: She must be a duck , Martin !
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 7]: _ Is _ she a duck ?
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 7]: What colour are her eyes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 26]: `` Er -- Her eyes are grey -- '' `` Grey as a mountain tarn -- '' Grizel rolled her own eyes to the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 12]: It 's a useful shade , and affords scope for variety .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 21]: They can grow black under stress of emotion , and in evening dress when she wants to look her best .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 4]: And the hero !
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 9]: he 'll be my affair , of course .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 26]: I 'll write the man-ey bits , and you 'll do the girl -- '' `` You mean -- '' Grizel waved an imperious hand .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 7]: `` I do _ not _ !
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 7]: I mean what I say . ''
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 13]: She screwed up her little face in an expressive _ moue _ .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 3]: `` Poof !
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 13]: Who knows more about a man in love -- you or I ?
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 8]: Who 'd be fairer to another girl ?
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 20]: -- If more books were written in that way , they 'd be a vast deal truer to life .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 5]: We 'll show 'em !
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 11]: Katrine , congratulate us ; our fortune is made . ''
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 8]: Katrine 's smile was a trifle forced .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 48]: Of course it was nonsense to suppose that Grizel would be allowed to invade the sanctuary of Martin 's room ; nevertheless , knowing as she did the heights of her visitor 's audacity , she felt it her duty to adopt an air of dignified reproof .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 27]: Martin 's work was not a subject for jest , it was a serious affair , with the stages of which his sister was well acquainted .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 72]: First the stage of restless absent-mindedness , during which it was useless to expect punctuality , or even an appropriately sensible answer to a question ; next , a brief period of intoxication when the long-delayed inspiration dawned with a brilliance which promised a glory never before attained ; thirdly , the long months of labour and anxiety , in which the early triumph faded to at best a temperate content .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 13]: Katrine was never admitted into her brother 's confidence about his work .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 33]: He had allowed it to be known that he could not suffer questions or remarks ; never once in those eight years had she dared to question concerning a heroine 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 28]: Through mental storms and sunshine , she had `` sat tight , '' observant but silent , expressing her sympathy , Martha-like , in soups and sauces .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 17]: It was not for Grizel to obtrude where she , a sister , might not go .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 12]: Katrine pushed back her chair , and rose to her feet .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 9]: `` You are talking nonsense , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 3]: Come upstairs !
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 13]: You look tired to death , and your hair is coming down .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 20]: I 'll give you a book , and you can sleep or read until it 's time to dress .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 7]: I 'll carry your things . ''
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 25]: She gathered together the scattered hat , gloves , and bag , and led the way upstairs , Grizel trailing slowly in her wake .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 37]: The bedroom was sweet and fresh ; after the manner of such rooms in country houses , a bowl of roses stood on a table ; through the open window the air blew soft and clean .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 40]: Grizel looked around with smiling satisfaction ; then dropping her impedimenta on the bed , and wheeling round with a swift , unexpected movement , she faced her hostess , and nipped her chin between a thumb and forefinger .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 43]: The two faces were close together : for a moment Katrine smiled , unconcerned and amused , but the honey-coloured eyes stared on , stared deep , stared with a long , unblinking intentness which brought the colour rushing to her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 25]: She twitched her head , the small fingers gripped with unexpected tenacity ; she frowned and fumed , but the eyes stared relentlessly on .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 10]: Finally she raised both hands and forced herself free .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 9]: `` Grizel , what _ is _ it ?
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 5]: Why are you staring ?
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 8]: What in the world has happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 23]: `` And that , my lamb , '' returned Grizel calmly , `` is just precisely what I am axing myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 12]: She turned her back , and strolled nonchalantly across the rooms .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIX .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 26]: When Grizel sailed down to dinner two hours later , it would have been difficult to recognise in her the pallid traveller of the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 19]: She was gorgeously attired in a robe of golden net covered with an embroidery of the same hue .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 43]: The golden sheaf clung round her , and trailed heavily on the ground ; encased in it her body appeared of an incredible slimness , yet from head to foot there was not one angle , not one harsh , unlovely line .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 23]: Nymph , elf , fay , she was all rounded curve and dimple , from satin shoulder to arched and tiny feet .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 26]: Though one might marvel that a human being could live in such wand-like form , _ thin _ was a word which could never occur .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 9]: Grizel was no more thin than Katrine herself .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 50]: Her soft , mouse-brown hair was waved loosely back , and twisted in a fashion which preserved the shape of the head , -- a rare and wonderful sight at a time when nine women out of ten carried a cushion-like appendage standing out many inches behind the ear .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 34]: Grizel was too wise to disguise herself by any such freak of fashion ; an artist would have noted with delight that she invariably respected the natural `` line '' of the body .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 39]: Neck and arms were bare of ornament , her cheeks were still pale , but with a warm , cream-like tint which had no trace of ill-health , her honey-coloured eyes reflected the golden lights of her dress .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 11]: The scarlet lips made the one contrasting note of colour .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 18]: Katrine stared blankly at the entrance of the apparition , the inevitable admiration largely tinged with reproach .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 20]: How ridiculous , and unsuitable , and altogether Grizelish to choose such a dress for a quiet home evening !
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 22]: It was probably the first that had come to her hand , and she had put it on without a thought .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 34]: When there was a dinner party , and the most important people in the neighbourhood were assembled to meet her , she would just as likely as not appear in a simple muslin .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 15]: Katrine had lived through such experiences before , and had suffered much aggravation thereby .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 16]: She stared with exaggerated surprise , whereupon Grizel gurgled , quick to appreciate the criticism .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 5]: `` Yes , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 6]: My _ very _ best !
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 9]: Ai n't I a pr-etty ittle did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 11]: `` It would be very suitable for a Court ball .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 10]: What possessed you to put it on to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 12]: `` I felt like it , -- in a golden mood !
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 8]: I always dress to suit my moods .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 14]: Besides it 's quite new , and the dear thing wanted its turn .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 17]: It is my Sheba dress , but you are n't nearly so appreciative as Aunt Griselda .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 9]: _ She _ bowed down before me . ''
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 17]: `` I 'm not going to bow down , but it 's a marvellous frock ! ''
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 46]: Katrine felt a depressing consciousness of the shabby black net which had done duty for home wear for several winters in succession , and woman-like reflected with a pang that the price of that golden sheaf would probably equal that of her entire summer outfit .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 17]: How would it feel to own a fairy purse , and bid Paquin do his best ?
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 15]: For a moment she was rent with envy , then curiosity claimed its day .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 53]: She crossed the room , and peered with awe and admiration at the elaborateness of the dress , the chiffon skirts poised one upon another , which softened the glare of the satin slip , the exquisite design of the embroidery , the rare and varied beads with which it was intermingled .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 6]: `` Grizel -- what gorgeousness !
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 6]: Every bead is a treasure .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 8]: It must have taken months to work .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 8]: And on a piece of perishable net .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 38]: I have _ read _ about such things , but I 've never seen them ... Mrs Brewston would read you a lesson on wanton extravagance -- '' '' _ Decadence _ , '' interrupted Grizel firmly .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 10]: `` You must _ always _ call it decadence .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 6]: And I should perfectly agree .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 30]: But the poor lambs had embroidered it , so some one _ had _ to pay , and Aunt Griselda might as well do it as any one else .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 13]: I would n't have dreamed of _ giving _ the order ! ''
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 3]: `` Humbug !
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 2]: Quibbler !
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 20]: -- Is there any possible way of getting into it , or do you wriggle in at the neck ?
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 22]: There 's nothing of you , my dear , but you are modelled so considerately -- plump in the right places !
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 14]: ... The sleeves are a trifle attenuated , do n't you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 14]: `` Perhaps they are , but it 's the fault of my arms .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 7]: They _ are _ so pretty !
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 19]: Look at that ikkle , ikkle dimple ... You would n't have the heart to hide it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 23]: returned Grizel , shutting one eye so as to peer with the other at the soft , infantile dents above the elbow .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 15]: In praise or blame she was always markedly honest as regarded her own appearance .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 53]: Even when Martin made his appearance at the door , and came to the sudden stand as if dazzled by the glittering apparition in the middle of the dark room , Grizel seemed to see no reason for changing her pose , but continued to peer and to crane with undiminished interest .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 17]: `` I 'm showing Katrine a bonnie wee dimple ... This side , to the west !
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 29]: I can just peer at it like this , but it 's beautiful viewed from the side , I wear my sleeve cut short ` a pupos . '
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 18]: ... This is the dress that the Duck wears , Martin , the night she 's engaged .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 32]: He had n't intended to speak so soon , but when he saw her in it he could n't resist -- '' `` I 'm sure he could n't -- ! ''
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 14]: Martin 's echo came back with what his sister considered a painful banality .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 10]: She flinched before it , as at a desecration .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 61]: When one is accustomed to regard a man as seated on a permanent pinnacle of grief , it is a shock to find him condescending to the ordinary barter of compliment , but Martin was oblivious of her frown , for Grizel had opened her closed eye , and peered upward into his face with her sweet , lazy smile .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 34]: He gave her his arm , led her in to dinner , arranged her chair , and groped under the table for a footstool , leaving Katrine to follow , alone and unnoticed .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 21]: Never in all the years they had lived together had he thought of a footstool for his sister 's feet !
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 32]: As there was only one of these articles in common use , she was obliged to do without the ordinary support , and the feeling of discomfort lasted throughout the meal .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 36]: The curtains were undrawn , leaving a vista of garden sloping upward to the knoll , the low panelled room was already dim , and the table was lighted by candles in tall silver stands .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 34]: A bowl of beautifully cut old glass was piled high with roses , and the meal was dainty and well chosen , for Katrine was on her mettle before Grizel 's quizzical eyes .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 35]: Martin sat at the head of the table ; he had the long thin face , the deep-set eyes , the sensitive lips , which carry the mind instinctively to the days of old .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 16]: For him a stock and a fob would have seemed more appropriate than twentieth-century attire .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 13]: His eyes looked particularly dark to-night ; he held himself buoyantly erect .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 23]: Grizel rested both elbows on the table , and began feeding herself with fragments of bread , before the soup was served .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 6]: `` Excuse my bad manners .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 8]: They 're _ so _ fashionable ! ''
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 5]: she mumbled in explanation .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 31]: She attacked her soup with a zest which one would hardly have expected from so fragile a creature , and took little part in the conversation until it was finished .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 18]: Then once more she rested her elbows on the table , and smiled across at her host .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 17]: `` And so , '' she said lazily , `` to-morrow is the Duke 's bean-feast .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 12]: It 's no end of a way , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 6]: How do we go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 7]: `` Martin has engaged a car .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 20]: Several neighbours wanted us to share , and it was really quite a blessing to be able to refuse .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 20]: Last year we went with the Morlands , and they stuck to us like glue to the bitter end .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 8]: This time we shall be free . ''
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 9]: `` We three , and a second man .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 7]: Who is the second man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 12]: `` We three , and _ no _ other man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 15]: Grizel dropped her hands on to the table , and stared with distended eyes .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 9]: `` But , my child , how absurd .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 20]: I 'm the most unexacting of critters but I make it a principle , never to share a man !
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 19]: There _ must _ be an odd bachelor in the neighbourhood who 'd be glad of a lift !
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 12]: A presentable , flirtable creature to make up the four ! ''
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 30]: The youthful parlour-maid jerked at the sound of that second adjective , and scurried from the room , soup plates in hand , leaving Katrine to whisper hasty reprisals .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 5]: `` Grizel , please !
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 4]: Wait until afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 9]: It 's a young girl I am training .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 14]: She belongs to the Y.W.C.A. '' Grizel 's stare changed to a smile .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 8]: `` I do n't object , dear .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 5]: I really do n't .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 22]: So long as she 's pleased , I assure you I wo n't let it make _ any _ difference ! ''
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 12]: `` But that 's just what I want it to do !
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 20]: Do please be sensible until dinner is over , and for mercy 's sake do n't talk about flirts .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 7]: She 'll be so shocked . ''
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 17]: `` Then she 'll be the first Y.W. I 've ever met who _ was _ .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 10]: And I do n't believe she will , neither .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 38]: There 's a tilt to her cap -- '' The door opened to admit the Y.W. , bearing in her hands the fish , and on her face that expression of concentrated vacuity which denotes acute curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 33]: Every householder has suffered such moments , and knows by experience the painful pause which ensues before one of the diners bursts vivaciously into impersonalities , but to-day there was no pause .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 9]: Grizel was too nimble-witted to permit such discomfiture .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 24]: There was not the slightest break in the continuity of her speech , her words flowed on in a smooth unbroken stream . ''
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 50]: -- The which I take to typify a certain temperamental tendency towards the ornate , coupled with a desire to please , and be appreciated by those whom Providence has appointed lords among us , against which tendency all the restrictions of that admirable society -- '' `` Grizel !
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 2]: Idiot !
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 4]: Eat your fish .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 6]: You talk too much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 18]: Martin had burst into a roar of laughter , in which Katrine perforce was obliged to join .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 8]: The Y.W. marched stolidly round the table .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 34]: She was by no means so dense as she appeared , was perfectly aware that the visitor had been reproved in her absence , and suspected a personal application in the long-winded speech .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 19]: She disappeared in search of sauce , and to report the progress of events to the eager cook .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 14]: `` I 'll make a compact with you , '' whispered Grizel eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 28]: `` I 'll talk like a tract to the end of my stay , if you can induce her _ not _ to puff down my back !
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 9]: Principles I respect , but draughts I abhor .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 7]: Just make it perfectly clear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 50]: ... The Y.W. returned , and puffed vigorously the while she handed the sauce , whereat Katrine suffered a moment of acute suspense , but Grizel only wriggled her white shoulders , and remarked sweetly : `` Chill , is n't it , for the time of year ! ''
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 6]: Katrine hastily turned the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 19]: `` Grizel , did you know that Martin 's last book is already in its third edition ? ''
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 3]: Is it ?
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 5]: How very good . ''
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 13]: The words were irreproachable but there was something lacking in the tone .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 34]: Katrine frowned , Martin looked across the table at the sparkling golden figure , who sat with head on one side , and brows arched , like a penitent child asking for forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 11]: Their eyes met , and he smiled in reassuring sweetness .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 13]: `` Martin 's books are a forbidden topic at Martin 's table .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 14]: After dinner , Grizel , I 'll take you to see my roses .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 7]: They are much more interesting . ''
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 5]: `` In that dress !
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 5]: In those slippers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 4]: gasped Katrine outraged .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 46]: As neither of her hearers volunteered a reply she considered the proposition ruled out of court , but after coffee had been served it was necessary to retire to her room to write an order to the stores , and upon her return , lo !
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 28]: the room was empty , the French windows stood apart , and in and out between the bushes of the knoll passed a shimmer of golden light .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 44]: Katrine 's first sensation was one of shocked surprise at the recklessness of garden promenades in a costly new gown , her second an impulse to go out in her turn , and make one of a party to enjoy the fragrant dusk .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 45]: She had gathered up her skirts , was on the point of stepping through the window , when like a dart came the remembrance of Grizel 's words , her avowed dislike to `` sharing a man '' ; of Martin 's evident agreement .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 17]: She drew back , seated herself on the nearest chair , and digested the unwelcome thought .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 6]: They would not want her !
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 20]: They had probably chosen the moment when she was out of the room to start on their ramble alone .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 18]: If she were to join them now , her presence would form the proverbial `` trumpery . ''
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 53]: Katrine could have understood it , could have sympathised frankly if it had been a case of love ; lovers naturally wished to be alone , but Martin and Grizel were merely friends , not even intimate friends , since Grizel 's visits had come at long intervals during the past years .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 9]: They could have no sweet secrets to discuss .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 20]: Sitting alone in the room looking out into the dusk , a memory darted back out of the years .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 22]: Just so had she sat during her first visit to the house , in that brief summer of Martin 's wedlock .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 13]: She had been a young girl then , lately released from school .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 41]: She recalled anew the loneliness which had fallen upon her , while Martin and Juliet roamed the garden paths , and she sat alone , listening to the soft burst of laughter , watching the flit of the white dress .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 20]: A white dress , ghost-like , transparent ; a light , slight thing , as befitted the youthful wearer .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 14]: Grizel 's dress was gold ; it flashed an opulent orange and red .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 17]: There was nothing ghostly about it ; it was warm , and human , and alive .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 9]: It drew the eye with an irresistible allure .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 4]: How could he !
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 4]: How could he !
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 11]: Along the very paths which he had paced with Juliet .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 9]: Beside the flowers which her hands had planted !
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 10]: Once again Katrine suffered the pang , the repulsion .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 23]: All these years she had suffered at the sight of Martin sorrowful and lonely , now -- mysterious , but incontrovertible fact !
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 11]: -- she suffered afresh at the sight of him consoled .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 29]: Without , in the garden , Grizel was flitting from tree to tree like a big gold moth , bending her head to drink in the heavy perfume .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 34]: The curve of the neck , the curve of the cheek half hidden against the leaves , the reed-like figure bent low from the waist , they were the very epitome of grace .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 3]: `` Martin !
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 2]: Martin !
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 13]: I must have some of these to take up to my room .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 20]: There 's magic in the scent of red roses ... real country roses , living on their own stems .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 9]: It has something different from all other scents .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 9]: These are the trees which little Juliet planted ?
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 30]: How sweet she was that day , when they were planted , and she was so happy , so dirty , like a pretty child in her big pinafore !
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 9]: They _ ought _ to be sweet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 3]: Martin winced .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 28]: He did not reply , but taking a knife from his pocket cut off one or two of the best blooms , carefully pruning the thronged stems .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 62]: For the first months after Juliet 's death her name had been continually on his lips , he had loved to talk about her , to hear her discussed ; later on the reference had become rarer , more strained ; now for years it had been avoided as elaborately as though it had belonged to a criminal , a prodigal .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 25]: The young fair face still hung on the walls , but in the house where she had lived no one mentioned Juliet 's name .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 23]: Only Grizel , an outsider , talked of her still , naturally , simply , with a transparent pleasure in the remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 12]: Martin was not sure whether the reference more pleased or jarred .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 3]: he remembered !
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 33]: He should never forget that bright autumn day , the laughing crowd of spectators , the picture of his girl wife in her short garden skirt , waving her spade in triumph .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 12]: He could never forget , but the personal significance had faded .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 27]: There seemed little connection between himself and that boyish bridegroom ; it was an effort to realise that that sweet child had truly been his wife .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 11]: The present moment seemed far more real , more vital .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 26]: Himself , the man , occupied with the matured work of life ; Grizel , the woman , instinct with the lure of her sex .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 26]: He held the roses towards her that she might enjoy their fragrance , and for a minute they stood in silence , side by side .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 18]: Then Grizel raised her head , and looked into his face with a long , penetrating glance .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 17]: This was the real moment of their meeting , and both silently recognised it as such .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 8]: `` How goes it , Martin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 8]: she asked in her soft rich voice .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 6]: `` How goes it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 8]: `` Haltingly , Grizel , haltingly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 8]: his smile flickered , and died out .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 33]: `` We 'll talk of that presently ; you are the one person to whom I _ can _ talk on that subject , but first of all there is something else .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 5]: Prisoner at the Bar .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 12]: -- _ Why do n't you like my book _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 12]: His voice was gentle , bantering , almost tender in tone .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 24]: There was not the faintest touch of offence , but Grizel 's discomfiture was as naive and undisguised as that of a child .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 3]: `` Martin !
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 31]: you said that we were not to discuss -- '' `` Not in public ; not at meals , not even before Katrine , but certainly when we are alone .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 10]: There 's no getting out of it , Grizel .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 19]: You said nothing , it was only a tone , but as it happens I understand your tones .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 16]: The book may run through a dozen editions , but for you it has failed .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 15]: She stood before him , slim and straight , her face puckered in thought .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 8]: `` I -- do n't -- know !
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 11]: Everything , -- or was it nothing , Martin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 9]: `` Can I help you to find out ?
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 11]: A few leading questions perhaps ... Is it clever ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 5]: `` Very clever . ''
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 4]: `` Original ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 4]: `` Original ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 4]: `` Interesting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 5]: `` Quite interesting . ''
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 15]: `` Clever , original , and interesting , and already in its third edition !
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 10]: What would you have more , Mistress Critic ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 12]: Grizel lifted her right hand , and lightly tapped her heart .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 15]: `` Clever , interesting , original , but it did n't _ touch _ !
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 36]: The craft is good , Martin ; you are a skilful workman -- I think you grow more and more skilful , but -- '' `` Go on , Grizel ; do n't be afraid .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 7]: Tell me the whole truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 6]: Grizel faced him in silence .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 18]: It was not often that so grave and thoughtful an air was seen upon her sparkling face .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 12]: Her eyes gazed past his , far away into the night .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 14]: `` Once , '' she said dreamily , `` there was a painter .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 24]: He painted marvellous pictures , but it was the depth and tone of his colouring which made him celebrated over all the world .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 30]: And of all his colours there was one in particular which appeared in all his pictures , and the secret of which his fellow-artists tried in vain to discover .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 69]: It was a red , Martin , a red so rich , so warm , so _ kindled _ , that all who beheld it felt warmed in their souls , and his fellow-artists questioned and pondered , and tried in vain to produce the same glow upon their own canvases -- and the years passed , and they grew old and weary , and still they failed .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 34]: At last one day the great man died , and those who tended him for his burial were amazed to find a wound , an _ open _ wound , above his heart .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 7]: And then at last they understood .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 23]: The red of his pictures , the glow which had warmed the world , had been painted with his own blood ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 7]: There was silence in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 10]: The scent of roses hung heavy upon the air .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 9]: `` And I , '' said Martin slowly .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 9]: `` I write in _ ink _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 5]: Grizel made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 26]: She turned from the rose-bed , and passed along a winding path which led round the herbaceous border to the slope of the orchard beyond .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 27]: It was a narrow path , too narrow for two to walk in line , so that Martin , following , could not see her face .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 17]: It was like Grizel , he reflected , to have chosen that path at this moment .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 10]: She divined that he could speak more openly unseen .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 22]: `` And even , Grizel , if I wrote in your painter 's medium , my reds would have no glow !
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 11]: One can not give out what one does not possess .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 13]: While I am cold myself , how can I give out warmth ?
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 14]: It is so long , Grizel , since my heart was warm ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 9]: A sigh floated back to his ears . ''
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 5]: _ Pauvre _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 24]: breathed the deep voice , but she did not turn her head ; the gleaming figure flitted before him down the darkening path .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 12]: `` I flattered myself that I had made a brave pretence .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 18]: It was a good enough sham to delude the world , but You have found me out .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 20]: Do n't think that I regret it -- I am thankful to Heaven that _ some one _ understands .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 15]: To be praised for what one knows to be false is a bitter pill .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 11]: Sometimes I wonder , shall I throw it all up ?
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 12]: Settle down comfortably into the rut , and -- grow roses !
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 14]: I could grow good roses , Grizel ; the best of their kind .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 10]: There would be no need to be ashamed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 10]: In the twilight he saw her shake her head .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 16]: A fold of the golden robe escaped her hands , and trailed on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 20]: They stooped together to lift it up , and she smiled up at him with her sweet gay smile .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 14]: `` But you could n't , Martin ; you could n't do it !
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 13]: You might make a hundred resolutions , but you 'd begin again .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 10]: There 's no escape that way , dear man .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 18]: You must write , as you must breathe , therefore it follows that you must get warm .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 17]: Chills are depressing things , but they are dangerous only when they are allowed to settle .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 13]: This old house of yours has its back to the sun . ''
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 21]: `` I can read your parable , Grizel , but circumstances -- like houses -- are not easily turned round .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 13]: Life has made chains for me from which I can not escape .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 22]: Katrine -- '' `` I rather -- suspect , '' interrupted Grizel drawling , `` that Katrine 's chains are slackening !
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 12]: Some one , or something , has been supplying the oil .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 25]: Another creak or two and she will be breaking loose , and going off at a tangent which will surprise your innocent mind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 4]: `` Symbols again !
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 21]: I do n't follow so easily this time , but if the signs are good , I am uncommonly thankful .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 15]: I can talk openly to you , Grizel , for you wo n't misunderstand .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 7]: Katrine is -- on my mind !
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 15]: Perhaps it would be more honest if I said on my _ nerves _ !
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 25]: I 've a suspicion that I 'm on her nerves also , and the mischief of it is , that things are growing worse .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 13]: There 's nothing definitely wrong , and yet there 's -- everything !
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 7]: I feel an utter brute . ''
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 17]: To his astonishment , to his relief , Grizel laughed ; a blithe and comfortable laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 32]: They had reached the summit of the orchard by this time , and had paused to look down at the twinkling lights of the village before turning back to the house .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 8]: `` Poor , dear , conventional brute !
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 7]: Am I expected to be shocked ?
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 14]: I 'm not one bit , and I ca n't pretend to be .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 13]: It 's not your fault , and it 's not Katrine 's .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 34]: You have both done your laborious bests to accomplish something that has never been accomplished by effort since the world began , and you are both overcome with Remorse because it has failed .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 19]: I 'd like to present you with a putty medal apiece to the memory of a successful failure .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 29]: You have lived together , two utter strangers , who happen to have been born brother and sister , for eight long years without once descending to violence .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 8]: It 's magnificent , it 's incredible !
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 8]: You ought to be intoxicated with pride !
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 29]: It 's the most unique quality on earth which enables two people to live in happiness and understanding , and what constitutes it , the dickens only knows .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 12]: We 've got it , -- my old Buddy and I .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 29]: We are at opposite ends of the poles , we can on occasions quarrel like cats , but in the main we understand ; we _ fit _ !
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 9]: You and Katrine do n't touch within miles .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 10]: There 's no credit , there 's no blame .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 8]: Fate placed us together , not choice .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 9]: I have succeeded because -- please realise this !
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 10]: -- I did n't need _ to try _ .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 14]: You , poor lambs , have tried away what little chance you had .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 11]: It is affectation to pretend that it is your fault .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 15]: The only blame would be to go on living in a false condition . ''
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 9]: `` I know it , I know it !
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 10]: I 've been feeling it more and more strongly .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 18]: It 's not fair to Katrine ; it 's not fair to me or to my work .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 6]: But what can I do ?
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 56]: I brought her here , she has given up her youth to looking after me , there 's no other home open , to her -- I do n't pretend that her happiness is bound up in mine , but she _ thinks _ that it is , and that 's virtually the same thing .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 22]: She would feel desperately aggrieved -- '' `` Oh , you unselfish people , there 's no dealing with you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 5]: Grizel shrugged impatiently . ''
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 7]: _ Let _ her feel aggrieved !
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 23]: If it 's a case of smarting for a week , or freezing for life , then let her _ smart _ !
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 21]: Ca n't you make up your mind just for once in your life to speak the bold , blatant truth ?
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 22]: ` Katrine , my dear , we are getting sick of each other -- let 's cut it , and part !
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 42]: I 'll give you an allowance -- go off and pay visits , or set up a crib of your own , enjoy yourself in your own way , but for Heaven 's sake let me be happy too ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 5]: Martin shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 11]: `` I could n't , Grizel ; I could n't !
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 15]: It may be the right thing to do , but I 'm a coward .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 6]: I ca n't face it .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 5]: Not that way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 6]: Grizel looked at him whimsically .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 28]: Men -- the best of men , were so apt to believe that so long as the words were not actually spoken , their feelings remained concealed .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 9]: And woman , -- the pity of it !
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 9]: -- could read the meaning of a sign .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 8]: This woman already had read the signs .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 10]: Undoubtedly , inevitably , a change was at hand !
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 43]: Despite her growing indifference towards neighbouring festivities , Katrine could not resist a thrill of excitement in preparing for the Barfield Garden Party , which was in truth no ordinary local function , but an important , almost a national , fete .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 41]: Among the guests royalty itself might appear ; foreign potentates , ambassadors , distinguished politicians , disciples of the arts and sciences would be on show on the wide lawns , and within the splendid rooms of the old Castle .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 36]: It would be , as Katrine herself had said , a very Zoological Garden of lions , among whom an insignificant spinster from a country town must of necessity appear the smallest of small fry .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 32]: Martin , of course , owned a roar of his own , a minor roar , but still distinguishable among the rest , but his sister had no claim to celebrity .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 24]: Her aim was theoretically to see , not to be seen , but the theory did not prevent a lengthy and painstaking toilette .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 68]: It was only a simple ninon dress , it was only a home-made hat , she owned neither jewels nor laces , nor valuable accessories of any sort to give a _ cachet _ to the whole , but considering these deficiencies there was the more reason for being thankful for a graceful figure , for a face with well-cut features , and deep , level eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 14]: Surveying the completed toilette in her glass Katrine first smirked and then sighed .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 21]: `` Very praiseworthy considering , but when I see Grizel , she will knock the conceit out of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 31]: she said to herself as she put the dressing-table in order with a few swift touches , and crossed the passage to tap at the door of the guest chamber .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 7]: `` May I come in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 5]: `` What ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 48]: sounded cheerily from within , and Katrine entered to behold a Romney picture in grey chiffon pirouetting before the glass , a ridiculous buckram bandeau pressed turban-like on her head , to which she was endeavouring to anchor a vast hat , encircled by sweeping white feathers .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 36]: The feathers swept , they did not soar , a Grizel-like distinction between beauty and fashion ; there was not a touch of colour about her , except for the coral brightness of her lips .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 27]: Katrine felt an instant conviction that ninon was heavy , that colour was vulgar , that every item of her own toilette was detestable and ill-chosen .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 28]: She stood staring in the doorway , and even as she stood the door of Martin 's room opened , at the opposite side of the passage .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 58]: He would have passed on without a glance towards the opened room ; Katrine in her friend 's place would have dodged hastily into a corner rather than have been discovered in the unbecoming stage of bandeau _ sans _ hat , but Grizel hailed him with a cheerful cry : `` Halloa , you man thing !
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 14]: Look upon me , and thank your stars you are not a woman .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 22]: I 've _ got _ to balance this tent upon my head , and nothing short of clamps will do it .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 19]: And there 's one hairpin , a fiendish anarchist of a hairpin , simply stacking into my scalp !
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 38]: ... Which would you rather , -- keep the car waiting while I take it down and do it again , or have me scratching at my head all the afternoon , at the most compromising moments ?
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 7]: Put your fingers in , Katrine !
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 3]: Prod about !
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 5]: Can you feel it ?
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 6]: Not that one , no !
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 14]: For the land 's sake do n't scatter my curls on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 4]: That 's him !
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 4]: That 's him !
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 3]: Good girl !
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 17]: ... What a mussiful relief ... Now for the skewers ... Deadly , ai n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 38]: But I have screws for the ends , so you can be aisey ... The question of the hour is , Martin -- _ do _ you love me better in a veil , or without ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 55]: She faced him , holding before her face lengths of filmy white , no disfiguring scrolls , no shadows , such as the fashion of the day forces on an unoffending public , but a gossamer tulle , invisible at a few yards ' distance , yet lending a becoming softness to the features .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 19]: Martin , however , gallantly refused to see the improvement , and gave the verdict `` Without ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 25]: in unhesitating accents , whereupon Grizel beamed upon him , and deliberately proceeded to swathe the folds round the wide brim of the hat .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 4]: `` Sweet pusson !
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 16]: But you would n't , after a long drive , when the ends were flying !
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 9]: No woman can look distinguished with tousley hair .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 8]: I 'm ready , my loved ones !
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 20]: If you 've any remarks to make , make 'em now , or else for ever hold your peace .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 16]: As for Katrine -- she 's quite unnecessarily good-looking -- no objections to make there .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 31]: My hobject is -- if you can understand , -- to appear as if I were ` Somebody , ' and have a train of admirers following wherever I go !
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 31]: -- If you did n't know any better , do you think you could mistake me for ` Some one in Particular , ' and hang around to stare ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 7]: The brother and sister smiled indulgently .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 8]: `` Is n't Grizel Dundas Somebody ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 3]: Martin enquired .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 8]: `` She 's a goose anyway ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 24]: corrected Katrine , but she said it with a laugh , and in a voice which held no trace of the ordinary snap .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 23]: Martin 's eyes turned upon her quickly ; he also seemed to be infected with an unusual gentleness and amenity of manner .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 13]: `` How nice you look , dear -- how very nice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 4]: he said genially .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 17]: In the way of definite approval it was more than he had said to Grizel herself .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 14]: Katrine flushed with pleasure , and brushed his arm with a caressing touch .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 18]: Each was conscious of a longing to make up for the growing disloyalty of the past months .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 39]: The position remained unchanged , but there was a different attitude towards it ; they had grown suddenly softer , kindlier ; in each mind was a conviction of personal responsibility , a disinclination to blame the other .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 8]: `` I have n't considered her enough .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 9]: She 's had a desperately dull time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 11]: ... `` I 've been so narrow-minded -- so blind .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 6]: I did n't understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 16]: Each heart made its own confession of shortcomings , and felt lightened of a load .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 27]: It was in the happiest of moods that the trio started on their ten-mile drive through the wooded country which stretched between Cumly and Barfield Castle .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 40]: In the matter of rural scenery England stands unsurpassed in the kingdoms of the world , and a stranger to our isle could not have had a better introduction to its beauties than the drive through that southern county .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 65]: Long avenues of beeches gave entrance to the most picturesque of villages , with the traditional duck-pond and green ; thatched cottages showed a blaze of flowers in their trim gardens ; the smooth white road curved through the heart of a great forest , dived through the precipitous High Street of a quaint old town , and climbed steeply to a breezy down .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 29]: Everywhere there was a wealth of greenery , a universal air of prosperity , of order , of well-being , good to behold on this brilliant summer morning .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 17]: Within a few miles of Barfield Castle , however , all peacefulness vanished from the scene .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 22]: The converging roads were filled with an unending stream of vehicles , and the dust rose in clouds above the hedgerows .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 35]: The women wrapped themselves closely in dust cloaks and motor-veils , the pace slackened to a crawl , and at frequent intervals ceased altogether as the congested lines merged together near the castle gates .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 33]: When once that point had been passed , progress was sure though slow , and the dust of the high roads was replaced by refreshing shade from the great avenue of trees .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 60]: The wrappings were thrown aside , to display the brave toilettes of men and women ; and the pedestrians who , having travelled by train , had been disappointed of finding conveyances at the station , gazed enviously , curiously , at the occupants of the various carriages and cars , and were in their turn as mercilessly scrutinised .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 12]: `` Everybody is dying to know who everybody else is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 4]: whispered Grizel gleefully .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 10]: `` Buck up , Katrine , and look haughty .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 20]: You may be mistaken for a Duchess , or a variety actress , -- you never know your luck !
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 22]: When we pass the next group , watch me heave , to show off the effect of my massed gems ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 31]: The `` massed gems '' consisted of a diamond brooch and a small heart-shaped pendant to match , which nestled together in the folds of chiffon at Grizel 's breast .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 46]: It was a charming and ludicrous sight to behold her inflate her slight form at the prescribed moment , but sure enough , the stones flashed in response , catching a passing sunbeam and blazing with a brilliance altogether out of proportion to their size .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 17]: cried Grizel triumphantly , achieving a double chin in her effort to admire her own splendour .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 13]: `` Never say again that I do n't do you credit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 29]: The first part of the afternoon was spent pleasantly enough in strolling about the gardens , or in sitting down to watch the kaleidoscopic brilliance of the scene .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 27]: At intervals Martin was hailed by a fellow-writer or club acquaintance , or Grizel by a friend from town , but Katrine was never so addressed .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 20]: Other girls less attractive than herself flitted about with attendant cavaliers , or formed the centres of merry groups .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 18]: What was the use of being `` unnecessarily good-looking , '' if no one were influenced thereby ?
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 12]: Across the sunshine of the scene shot grey shadows of depression .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 13]: In the midst of a crowd one could be so horribly alone !
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 19]: Among the hundreds of guests crowding the green lawn , not one cared to pause by her side .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 5]: Even Martin and Grizel .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 27]: -- It was a hateful thought , Katrine fought against it , but her heart acknowledged its truth , -- they would be happier without her !
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 47]: It was inevitable that the mind should leap to the remembrance of the one man who _ would _ have cared ; who , entering by those great gates , would have come swiftly forward , unsatisfied , unseeing , till he had gained her side !
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 21]: Across the intervening miles went out a warm , glad thought : '' _ He would have cared _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 14]: said Katrine 's heart , and at the thought the sun shone again .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 7]: `` Excuse me one moment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 4]: cried Martin hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 6]: `` That man over there .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 48]: -- I 've been wanting to catch him for months ... '' He darted across the lawn , and the two girls subsided into chairs , afraid to leave the spot , lest in the crowd he might not be able to find them on his return .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 54]: Already Grizel was looking tired and spent ; the little face beneath the sweeping hat was white as a tired rose , but the whimsical light shone bright as ever in the golden eyes as she turned them on the passing throng , and from her lips bubbled an endless stream of nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 31]: It was difficult for a listener to preserve a due decorum of manner as each group passed by , heralded by biographical sketches in those low , rich tones . ''
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 11]: -- Aunt Hepsibah and her niece Jane ... County family .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 5]: Redooced , but proud .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 17]: ` A lace shawl , ' says Auntie , ` is _ always _ le mode !
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 8]: And Jane shall wear my bertha . '
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 6]: ... Mrs Ponsonby de Tompkins .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 19]: Left cards regularly for years past , angling for an invitation , and at long last one arrived .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 8]: A handsome new dress for the occasion !
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 15]: The very _ best _ satin , and everything to match , Husband excepted !
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 9]: Ponsonby wishes to goodness he 'd never come !
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 13]: ... Rich Mr Stock-broker on the point of proposing to Emily Maud .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 5]: Emily 'll have him .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 4]: Observe the smirk !
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 16]: I _ always _ refuse men who propose to me at garden parties ... Ha !
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 5]: whom have we here ?
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 12]: Looks like a Duchess , but probably is _ not _ .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 33]: Old lady in puce probably _ is _ , and has no right to be ... Long-haired pus-son probably an Anabaptist , or a Poet , or something of that ilk . ''
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 16]: `` It 's all very well , but I want to _ know _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 8]: objected Katrine in tones of strong disapproval .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 23]: `` It 's the dullest thing in the world to be surrounded by celebrities , and not to recognise a single one .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 14]: Martin goes about so little that he is no use as a guide .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 15]: The dozens and dozens of interesting invitations which he has refused these last years !
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 17]: I think he might introduce us to some of his friends who _ do _ know !
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 10]: It 's the literary people who interest me most .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 4]: And the artists .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 6]: It 's too tiresome ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 7]: `` Keep calm , Sweet One !
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 32]: We 'll ask him when he comes back , and , '' Grizel smiled , a slow , sweet smile , '' _ I _ might know one or two myself !
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 13]: If we sit here patiently , some one is sure to pass .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 8]: I 'll keep a bright look-out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 5]: `` Oh , do !
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 12]: Yes , of course , you meet all kinds of people .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 7]: I 've lived in a rut .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 14]: Grizel , do you know , I 'm getting _ tired _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 18]: The words were used in their deeper sense , and Grizel 's long glance proclaimed her understanding .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 42]: Grizel always _ did _ understand , Katrine acknowledged ungrudgingly , but the deep , contemplative glance aroused a remembrance of the parting of the night before , and to her annoyance she felt the blood once more stain her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 31]: Now if Grizel proceeded to joke , question , insinuate , she felt she could _ not _ endure it , but Grizel was silent , and spoke no word .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 53]: They sat together for a long five minutes without exchanging a remark , then suddenly strolling towards them came a strikingly handsome woman followed at a few yards ' distance by a man and a girl , evidently members of the same party , whom for the moment she chose to ignore .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 24]: She wore a trailing gown of a deep rose pink , and over it a cloak of chiffon , elaborately embroidered in silks .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 24]: Her head was swathed in turban-like folds , on the front of which a diamond bosque held the end of a rampant plume .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 35]: Her expression was as unusual as her appearance , the blankness on most of the passing faces being replaced in her case by a radiant audacity which proved her to be no ordinary character .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 46]: So striking and queenly a figure attracted instant attention , and Katrine 's melancholy reflection that this _ must _ be one of the many unrecognised celebrities , was followed by a thrill of joy , as Grizel rushed forward with friendly _ empressement _ .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 10]: `` Grizel Dundas , by all that is charming !
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 12]: And who brought _ you _ here , dear person ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 21]: enquired the tall lady warmly , at which question Grizel 's eyes turned upon Katrine , with a twinkling gleam .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 30]: One hand still rested on her friend 's arm , pressing upon it as with a special significance ; with the other she made a sweeping gesture of introduction .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 7]: `` I drove over from Cumly .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 11]: I am staying with my friends , the Martin Beverleys .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 38]: Let me introduce you ... This is Miss Beverley , and she has been lamenting all afternoon that she does not know Who 's Who , and is surrounded by celebrities , whom she ca n't recognise .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 9]: Now she 's going to have a treat .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 20]: Providence has been kind in sending you to our aid , for you are one of her special heroines .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 5]: Prepare yourself , Katrine !
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 8]: You _ are _ a lucky girl !
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 41]: If you 've had to wait , you 've got a big catch at the end ... Guess what is the name of this fine , this very fine , this superfine lady whom you now behold before you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 30]: Katrine smiled , blushed , waited , agape with curiosity ; so -- it would have appeared to the eye of a beholder -- did the superfine lady also .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 27]: Grizel gave another sweep of the small gloved hand , and pronounced a name in a tone of triumph : `` Mrs -- Humphrey Ward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 4]: `` Oh-h ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 27]: an irresistible exclamation burst from Katrine 's lips , her attitude became on the moment instinct with deference , with the most transparent and whole-hearted adulation .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 25]: The lady on her part cast a rapid glance at Grizel , from Grizel to Katrine , simpered , attitudinised , and gently coughed .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 5]: `` So pleased ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 4]: she murmured softly .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 9]: `` So happy ; so _ braced _ !
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 20]: In the midst of this alien throng to meet a Kindred Soul , -- that is refreshment indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 19]: She held Katrine 's hand between both of her own , gazing at her with a fond affection .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 26]: `` Tell me , dear ; I am so pining to know , -- _ which _ of my books do you cherish most ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 19]: That `` cherish '' struck a jarring note , but Katrine 's answer came none the less promptly .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 26]: She had no hesitation in pronouncing her preference for _ Eleanor _ ; it was her hearer who for a moment looked blank and vague .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 4]: `` Ah-h ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 17]: she said thoughtfully , then with a sudden radiant smile , `` I call her Nellie !
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 9]: We mothers have pet names for our children .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 4]: Dear little Nell !
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 6]: She was a sweet thing .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 13]: Hard on her , was n't it , while still so young ?
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 26]: So dear of you to love her ... Well , dear , I shall always remember you , and love you for your sweet sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 9]: And you want my autograph , of course ?
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 15]: Do n't mind asking -- I shall be only _ too _ pleased ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 7]: Katrine 's flush deepened to rose .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 19]: Bewilderment , embarrassment , and a chilling disillusion seemed for the moment to have deprived her of speech .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 16]: The gorgeous figure towered over her , the brilliant eyes blazed relentlessly upon her face .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 13]: Grizel stood meekly in the background , her face all infantile sweetness .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 7]: `` I , -- thank you !
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 16]: I do n't collect autographs , but I shall be -- honoured to have yours .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 9]: Miss Dundas can give you my address . ''
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 7]: `` That 's quite all right .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 16]: I 'll send it soon , with an appropriate quotation for your dear little album .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 27]: ` Be good , sweet maid , All lame dogs aid , ' With best wishes from Nellie 's Mother ... '' She smirked once more .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 50]: Katrine was breathlessly demanding of herself if this could indeed be the woman who had written such masterly books , when the girl who had been standing at a discreet distance during the short interview , came forward and spoke in an apologetic voice : -- `` Mrs Singleton !
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 28]: I 'm sorry , but father has an appointment to meet a friend in the rose garden , I 'm afraid we must really move on . ''
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 5]: `` Singleton ... Incognito !
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 45]: The name she travels by , do n't you know , '' naughty Grizel mumbled in explanation , as the little party turned away , but the truth burst upon Katrine in an all-illuminating flash , and she was not to be caught again .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 6]: `` Grizel , you horror !
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 21]: To make me a laughing stock ... What a fool she must have thought me , standing gaping with admiration !
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 7]: ` Nellie 's Mother ' indeed !
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 7]: An idol toppled at that moment .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 29]: I _ was _ disillusioned , but living in the same house with an author prepares one for so many eccentricities , that I still believed ... Well !
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 16]: it came off very well that time , but do n't try it again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 10]: Grizel continued to chuckle in soft , retrospective enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 7]: `` Oh , it was grand !
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 15]: Mrs Singleton is a capital actress , and she played up like a man .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 32]: It _ was _ delicious to see you standing there , all humility and adulation , such a douce , modest , young woman , burning incense to a master mind .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 34]: If only that tiresome girl had not come up at the wrong moment , I might have faked all the wig bigs in turn , and had the time of my life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 9]: Katrine 's lips twisted in an enigmatical smile .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 33]: She was feeling gay and young ; the prickly dignity which had made her resent any approach to a joke at her own expense , had given place to a humorous enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 34]: Mentally she stood beside Grizel , looking on at the little scene which had just been enacted , appreciating the alertness of Mrs Singleton , and enjoying the spectacle of her own credulity .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 11]: Meantime each passing moment brought with it a fresh picture .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 68]: Now it was a group of Chinamen , attired in the gorgeous colourings of the East , conversing with friendly cordiality with their black-coated friends ; again it was a slender , dark-skinned woman , moving to the jingle of innumerable bangles , her timid eyes alight with childlike curiosity ; anon , it was an ecclesiastic of the Church , or a group of court officials .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 35]: The kaleidoscopic groups streamed in and out of the great house , passing each other on the marble staircase of the terrace , while the strains of massed bands sounded from a discreetly-arranged distance .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 27]: Presently Martin returned , and was duly regaled with an account of the Singleton episode , which being done Grizel laid upon him her own commands .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 11]: `` Let 's go into the house and be fed !
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 15]: Eating is my one solace on these occasions , '' she said , yawning .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 10]: `` One sees so many better-looking women than oneself .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 11]: -- I rather believe I am going to faint ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 9]: The threat brought her companions to their feet .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 32]: Martin offered his arm , and Grizel hung upon it with an air of exhaustion , her reed-like form and misty draperies investing her with an almost ghostly air of fragility .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 45]: She made her way towards the house , followed by eyes of commiserating admiration , but once seated in the great hall she displayed an appetite for , and appreciation of the dainties provided , which put her more robust friends in the shade .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 16]: Martin hovered around her with a solicitude which provoked Katrine to the bluntness of truth .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 15]: `` There 's not much wrong with her when she can eat those cakes !
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 10]: She 's not half so bad as she pretends .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 9]: I wish I had half her appetite . ''
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 10]: `` Do you grudge me my humble board ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 28]: Grizel grimaced with the air of a cheeky schoolboy , oblivious of the stare of a haughty flunky who was at the moment supplying her with cream .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 27]: She sipped luxuriously at the delicious coffee , and proceeded reflectively : -- `` Last time I was here was at the Ball of the Creases .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 7]: Such a tragic occasion , Katrine !
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 24]: It was the hour of wool-satins ; no other material had a look in , and every mortal woman had clothed herself therein .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 42]: Most of them had a railway journey , or a long drive across country , and oh , the shock when they alighted , and took off their wraps in the cloak room !!! Creases , creases , nothing but creases !
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 33]: It was a pitiful scene ; mothers afume , daughters in tears , rows of dowagers turning themselves before the fire , like turkeys on a spit ; plaintive pleadings for flat-irons .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 28]: When we got upstairs to the ballroom , it was worse than ever , with the great electric chandelier blazing down , and showing up every deficiency .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 11]: And we revolved beneath them looking like so many rag-bags .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 13]: I have never seen so many badly-dressed women in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 11]: `` Serve you right , '' was Martin 's comment .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 3]: `` Sheep !
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 2]: Sheep !
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 9]: Why _ will _ you all dress alike ?
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 26]: I can never see the fascination of being a replica of a hundred other women , when one might be a woman by oneself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 26]: Certainly the female portion of the crowd which continually surged in and out of the great door formed an admirable illustration of Martin 's indictment .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 40]: Old and young , tall and small , fat and thin , all hobbled within the same tight folds , and hid their hair beneath enormous hats which descended on the shoulder , entirely concealing both hair and neck .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 18]: Viewed from the front the costume achieved on occasions a not unbecoming effect , but the back !
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 20]: `` Oh would some power the giftie gie them , To see their backs as others see them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 18]: chanted Grizel softly , as a distinguished party crossed the floor at a few yards ' distance .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 25]: She laughed as she spoke , her deep , gurgling laugh , at the sound of which the colour rose in Martin 's cheek .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 11]: He looked at her and said quickly : `` Grizel !
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 10]: did n't you want to see the picture gallery ?
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 7]: Shall I take you now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 42]: As he spoke , his expression seemed to take a significance apart from the words ; delicately but unmistakably his eyebrows rose , asking a secret question , and as delicately Grizel 's eyes met his , and signalled a reply .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 22]: Katrine saw , guessed , was in the act of defiantly fighting against the suggestion , but Grizel was before her .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 3]: `` Presently .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 6]: There 's plenty of time .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 26]: Katrine was wishing , Martin , that you could introduce her to some one who could act as guide , and point out the celebrities .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 11]: It 's dull for her dragging about with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 4]: `` Of course .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 2]: Certainly !
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 8]: I saw old Deeds a minute ago .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 7]: There could be no one better .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 7]: I 'll bring him along . ''
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 24]: Martin dashed off with a haste seldom characteristic of altruistic enterprises , while Katrine sat rigid on her seat , consumed with anger .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 4]: `` Us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 9]: That word was the crux of the offence .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 4]: `` Us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 15]: having for its meaning Martin and Grizel , leaving herself coldly outside the pale .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 20]: Katrine hardly realised it at the time , but in reality another word had cut almost as deep . ''
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 5]: _ Old _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 4]: Old Mr Deeds .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 8]: `` No one could be better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 24]: The first old man who came within reach appeared a fitting companion for her , the while her companions went their unhindered way .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 14]: She sat rigid , her lips pressed in a hard , straight line .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 8]: By her side Grizel cast sorrowful glances .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 20]: On occasions it is almost as disagreeable to do good , as to be the object of benevolent designs !
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 11]: `` Lebong , _ June 20 , 19 -- _ .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 7]: `` Katrine , `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 4]: Very well indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 7]: I understand , and I agree .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 13]: My birthday is next month , so it fits in all right .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 13]: Rather a special birthday this time , for I shall be twenty-five .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 8]: Last year I was _ thirty-five _ .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 11]: These things happen sometimes ; I 've heard of them .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 15]: When it comes to one 's own turn , it 's jolly good work .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 17]: You 'll just have time to catch that birthday , if you write off at once .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 22]: Awfully good of you to worry about my sufferings in being obliged to reply to your -- problematically -- boring letters !
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 7]: I 'll risk it , Katrine !
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 37]: I 'll do more than that , I 'll promise to own up , and tell you straight , not only when I reach the bored stage , but long before it is even approximately approached .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 42]: If there is no other advantage in this thundering distance , there is at least this , that we can be honest to the verge of brutality , and there 's no earthly sense in a correspondence -- -LRB- beg pardon !
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 18]: -- occasional exchange of letters -RRB- -- if it is not for our mutual pleasure and profit .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 30]: Wherefore , Miss Sensitive Conscience , kindly understand that so long as I do n't say I am bored I am to be the superlative , the other thing !
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 31]: `` As to your first question , you are not only justified , but it 's your bounden duty to open your life to every fresh interest which comes along .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 26]: There 's no greater mistake than to believe that any work can be done the better for deliberately closing the shutters on all other claims .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 32]: You have a duty to yourself , as well as to that precious Martin , and it is even conceivable that he might fare the better for a little less attention !
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 19]: `` So far as I have gathered facts from Dorothea , Martin lost his wife eight years ago .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 17]: She was his wife for six short months , and she has been dead eight years .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 21]: He was a boy at that time ; since then he has grown into a man , and a reputation .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 30]: The Martin who came to you in his grief , and to whom you mortgaged your life , is dead too ; as dead as the poor little wife !
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 15]: So long as he was alive , you were a big help to him .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 25]: He was miserable enough no doubt , poor beggar , but the last extremity of despair was spared him by your love and care .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 6]: I 'd swear to that !
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 11]: But that Martin died , and with him your power .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 8]: `` Thus far , and no farther !
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 30]: There 's a wall , Katrine , between the soul of every brother and sister who was ever created , and sooner or later they come up against it .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 22]: All the love , and the care , and the patience , and the trying and crying can never scale it .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 34]: And then one day comes along a vagrant who _ does n't _ cry , does n't try , perhaps does n't even care , and before that stranger is an open road .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 11]: Which is a mystery , dear , and a commonplace .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 4]: Likewise cussedly unfair .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 12]: `` Do you mind if I call you ` dear ' ?
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 20]: It 's only on paper , and it 's so long since I 've had any one to endear .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 31]: It takes off a bit of the loneliness to feel that there is some one in the world to whom one can occasionally show a glimpse of one 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 24]: It 's the only bit of me that has a chance of feeling cold out here -- but it 's petrifying fast enough .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 14]: If you object , if it shocks your sense of decorum , well !
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 17]: -- I 'll write it all the same , but I 'll blot it out afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 8]: You need n't know anything about it .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 10]: Pens _ will _ blot on this thin paper !
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 16]: `` Do n't worry yourself because you are not the world and all to Martin .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 10]: He would be an odd fellow if you were .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 24]: It 's not in nature that a sister should satisfy a man 's heart , and it 's no use bucking against nature .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 9]: Neither need you worry because of his discontent .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 41]: If you 'd ever suffered from a big wound , you 'd understand that at the first , one is numbed by the shock ; it 's only when the knitting up and rebuilding begin that the pain bites deep .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 17]: Look upon his restlessness and depression as growing pains , and the beginning of his cure .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 4]: Poor little Katrine !
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 12]: but this sort of thing is confoundedly hard on the looker-on .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 24]: `` You want to know about myself -- and why your eyes look sorry as they watch me turn out on my lone .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 36]: Well , you know , Katrine -- I am -- I _ was _ , thirty-five last birthday ; only child , parents gone , relations scattered , strangers to me in all but name .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 39]: Outside the regiment there is not a soul to count in my life , and at the end of four years , unless the impossible happens , I must leave the regiment and say good-bye to my friends .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 65]: They offered me a majority in the Blankshire a year ago , but I could n't bring myself to face the wrench , but as anything is preferable to idleness and the shelf , I shall have to start life again among strangers before I 'm forty , with two or three captain fellows swearing vengeance at me for being promoted over their heads !
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 19]: It 's not exactly a glowing vista , and the prospect of that forty makes a man think .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 29]: When he sits alone on a sweltering Indian night , and compares his lot with that of fellows like Middleton , for instance , it is depressing work !
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 21]: `` In one or other department of life a man must have success , if he is to know content .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 18]: Work counts for a lot , but it must be successful work to make up a whole .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 46]: A big career appeals to all men -- the sense of power , the consciousness that one particular bit of the world 's work depends upon him , and would suffer from his absence , but that sort of success has n't come my way .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 35]: It 's the jolliest regiment in the world , the best set of fellows , but it 's been our luck to be ` out of things , ' and we are hopelessly blocked .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 8]: `` Then there 's the home department !
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 31]: Middleton -LRB- I use him as a type -RRB- can never ask himself ` what is the good , ' while he has his wife and that stunning little lad .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 30]: He has his depressed moods like the rest , but when they come on , Dorothea makes love to him , and the little chap sits on his knee .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 23]: At such times any nice feeling young photograph ought to sympathise with a lonely fellow who sits by and -- looks on !
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 12]: `` What do you suppose made up my last Christmas mail ?
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 15]: A bill from the stores , and a picture postcard from an old nurse .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 10]: This year there 'll be a letter from you !
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 14]: I have theories about Christmas letters -- especially Christmas letters to fellows abroad .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 32]: Christmas is a time of special kindliness and love ; people who are as a rule most reserved and dignified let themselves go , and show what is in their hearts .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 23]: I 've a fancy just for once to ` pittend ' as the children say , and write a real Christmassy letter .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 12]: A fellow in the regiment -- Vincent -- is just engaged .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 14]: He met her when he went to S -- for his last leave .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 25]: Prom his descriptions you would imagine she was another Helen of Troy , but I 'm told she 's quite an ordinary nice girl .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 6]: The airs he gives himself !
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 9]: A fellow might never have been engaged before .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 23]: After listening to him steadily for two hours on end the other night , I ventured one on my own account . ''
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 27]: ` I wonder , ' I said tentatively , ` if any girl will ever care enough to be willing to be engaged to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 28]: `` He ruminated , and sucked his pipe : ` Well , ' he said slowly , ` you 're not such a bad old beast ! '
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 15]: `` Rather beastly of me all the same to bore you with all this .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 3]: Forgive me !
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 34]: As Vincent has appointed me his confidant I hear such a lot about the affair that I turned on to it without thinking ... The wedding wo n't come off for another year .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 13]: When _ I 'm _ engaged , I 'll be married sharp !
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 17]: `` Now here 's a subject for discussing in your next letter -- Love and marriage !
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 13]: It 's a big bill , and -- be discursive , please !
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 11]: You ca n't possibly discuss such questions on one sheet .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 13]: We know , of course , that you are never to many .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 16]: You are doomed to dry-nurse Martin for life , whether he wants you or no .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 3]: -LRB- Brutal !
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 5]: Sorry , dear ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 60]: Things being as they are at the moment , we may premise that I also am doomed to celibacy , but as onlookers see most of the game , there 's no reason why we should n't wag our heads together over the follies of lovers , and expatiate on how much better we should have managed things ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 27]: `` There 's no Cranford reason , I suppose , why a young female should not discuss these things with a person of the opposite sex ?
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 32]: Even vowed to celibacy as _ you _ are , I expect there are moments when you have dreamed dreams , and seen as in a vision the not impossible He .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 8]: `` Tell me about him , Katrine !
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 7]: I 've a fancy to hear .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 20]: `` Now the sort of girl _ I _ should choose ... But this scrawl is too long already .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 7]: That must keep for another day .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 3]: `` Salaams !
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 5]: `` Jim Blair . ''
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINE .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 11]: `` Cumly , _ July 10 , 19 -- _ .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 15]: `` Dear Captain Blair , `` I 'm in a grumbly mood this morning .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 4]: Do you mind ?
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 12]: Something annoyed me yesterday , and this is the lachrymose aftermath .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 30]: I 'm sorry , for your sake as well as my own , for it 's mail day , and it 's now or never to catch that birthday !
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 21]: Perhaps a morning 's writing will work it ` off ' better than any other distraction which this place affords .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 64]: It 's easy for you away at the other side of the world to sentimentalise over my ` Cranford ' home , but if I had been asked to state the spot of all others in which I would _ not _ choose to live , it would be just such a derelict little hamlet as that in which fate has dumped me .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 33]: It 's a pretty little place , built on the side of a hill , with a precipitous High Street which is dangerous to drive down , and puffy to walk up .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 54]: There is a church at the top , a chapel at the bottom , and a bank half-way ; likewise a linen draper 's shop , which serves the purpose of a lady 's club , for no self-respecting woman allows a morning to pass without popping in at ` Verney 's . '
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 15]: If the stock does not supply what one wants -LRB- it rarely does ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 20]: there is always ` a startling line ' in something else , and a smell of flannel thrown in .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 22]: ` We are out of white gloves this morning , but I have a very fine line in unbleached calico ! '
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 23]: Mr Verney is a deacon of the chapel ; Mrs Verney was in the millinery , and has hankerings after the church .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 53]: We notice a general tendency among the maidens of dissent to appear at the parish church , what time they possess new garments or hats ... After we have bought our packets of needles , or a box of pins , we meet our friends in the front shop , and gossip .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 13]: Such a lot of talk , about such little , little things !
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 17]: There are days when it 's amusing enough ; days when it 's the driest dust .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 32]: Last year a friend of mine started a ` Thankfulness Society , ' as a cure for the grumbling and discontent which is apt to engulf spinsters in a country place .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 27]: Each member was presented with a little book , and was bound to inscribe therein the special causes of thankfulness which had occurred during each day .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 5]: I refused to join .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 17]: I said if I ceased to grumble it would have a demoralising effect on my character .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 5]: No use to grumble ?
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 2]: Fiddlesticks !
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 5]: _ Every _ use !
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 68]: As a dear old American friend used to say : ` When you feel like scratching , it 's not a mite of use rolling your eyes , and trying to be a saint -- just let yourself go , and be right down _ ugly _ for a few minutes , and it will be a heap better for you , and every one concerned ! '
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 5]: The secretary was shocked .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 38]: She said if one realised one 's blessings , one would not _ wish _ to grumble ... I said that considered as a trial the grumbler was not in it , compared with the persistent optimist .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 15]: Nothing on earth is more embittering than to live with a persistently amiable person .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 37]: Imagine living with a certificated optimist bound over to be thankful through thick and thin , when the soot falls , the soup is singed , and the new dress does _ not _ come home !
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 12]: ... Imagine the conversation , the maddening serenity of the smile !
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 24]: Optimists are admirable in calamity , but in the simple aggravations of daily life they are just the most depressing creatures upon earth !
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 7]: `` Well , I 'm sorry !
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 13]: Now I 've had my growl , and -LRB- Yankee again ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 53]: feel as ` good as pie , ' You might as well know what a grumbling , discontented wretch I am , and if you ask me why this special fit attacked me just this special morning , well , I _ know _ , but I 'm not going to tell .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 28]: I 'll answer another question instead -- `` You ask me what I think about love , getting engaged , married , all the rest of it .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 23]: I am only a looker on , and must always be , but it _ does _ interest me all the same !
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 36]: I have marvelled with every one else over the nature of that indefinable something which draws two people together , and which has nothing on earth to do with suitability as understood by the people .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 43]: John may be a model of excellence ; amiable , rich , handsome , devoted , but on their first meeting it is settled in Louisa 's mind as irrevocably as the trump of doom that he would never _ do _ !
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 21]: She knew it at a flash , the moment he entered the room ; the second he touched her hand .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 21]: And Tom is poor ; he is plain , he looks as though on occasion he might be abominably disagreeable .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 18]: Louisa looks upon his cross face , and acknowledges to herself ` My Lord and King ! '
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 15]: -- It 's a _ feel _ that decides it , not a fact .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 14]: In the great , big choice of life , reason does n't count .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 54]: Two men have asked me to marry them -LRB- You would n't know their names , even if you heard them , so I am betraying no confidence -RRB- ; I should have said ` no ' in any case , but I might have _ wanted _ to say ` yes ' !
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 4]: I did n't !
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 44]: I felt that as a choice a jump into the river would be preferable , yet from a sane , sensible point of view there was no reason why I should not have fallen in love -- and -- especially in one case !
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 9]: every obvious reason why I _ should _ !
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 18]: I could n't for my life tell you what was wrong , except -- _ Everything _ !
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 12]: I should have hated his very virtues by my own fireside .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 51]: His ` little _ ways _ ' would have driven me daft , but I can imagine wrapping up those self-same little ways right in the middle of my heart , as the dearest things , the sweetest , the most winsome , if they had belonged to another man !
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 19]: `` Engaged people are a bore to outsiders , but for themselves it must be a good time .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 57]: To be able to speak out , after bottling it all in ; to be left alone in peace , instead of living on odd snatches of conversation in the midst of crowds ; to feel _ sure _ ; to be done with ` I ' , -- and become for ever ` We . '
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 13]: -- It must feel so warm , and restful , and rich !
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 19]: It is n't so much the mere happiness that impresses me ; it 's the _ rest _ .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 38]: I wish it were possible to get engaged without being married , then I should arrange it with indecent haste , with an orphan , with a motor car , and we _ would _ be happy !
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 32]: He should be clean shaven , and rather plain , but it must be just my special fad in the way of plainness -- a trim , slim , sinewy sort .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 9]: Nothing flabby , an ' you love me !
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 16]: `` I 've thought of his name sometimes ; names count for a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 38]: There are moods when I dream of Ralph and feel a fascination for Peter ; moods when I have a secret hankering for Guy ; moods again when he could not possibly be any one but Jack .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 16]: People say that if you really love a man , his name does not matter .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 19]: I 've known a woman to settle down with ` Percy , ' and live happily ever after .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 17]: I 've heard of another who espoused a ` Samuel , ' and was apparently content .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 19]: It is conceivable that I might do the same , but ` Alfred ' gives me a crawl .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 19]: It is settled , firm , as the everlasting hills , that I can never belong to Alfred !
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 35]: `` If there is one thing more than another for which I bless my parents , and praise them in the gate , it is that they called me by a durable Christian name .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 2]: Katherine !
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 19]: It is not beautiful ; it is not poetic , but it is at least seemly and discreet .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 14]: You may take liberties with Katherine , and it will never disgrace you .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 18]: When you are small and curly-headed you can pose as ` Kitty Clover ' with beguiling effect .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 10]: I did myself , for quite a long run .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 18]: Later on , dropping the Clover , you may be known to schoolmates as Kitty or Kate .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 15]: There 's a snap about Kate which keeps Pearls and Rubies in their place .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 23]: Katrine is , as you observe , quite attractive for the days of youth ; Katherine is a refuge for old age .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 15]: Can you imagine anything more appropriate for a spinster lady in a country town ?
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 26]: `` The only married couple whom I have studied from the _ inside _ was my brother and his wife during that little six months .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 33]: It seemed quite a perfect thing at the time , but looking back from the sober height of twenty-six , it seems more like a play , than real , serious life .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 19]: She was only nineteen ; a pretty thing ; such a babe ; poor little , happy Juliet !
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 8]: and Martin was a boy with her .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 11]: Now , as you say , he is a man .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 15]: I wonder sometimes -- `` We have a visitor staying with us just now .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 33]: Her name is Grizel Dundas , and she is twenty-eight , and very beautiful or rather plain , according to the hour of the day , and her own mood and intention .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 26]: Sometimes I suspect that she deliberately _ makes _ herself plain , for the fun of confounding people with her beauty an hour later on .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 56]: Also she may probably turn out to be one of the greatest heiresses in London , or be left with a few hundreds a year , and she is very lazy , and very energetic , and talks like a schoolboy , and looks like a fay , and dresses , oh , Lonely Man !
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 6]: in the most ra-vishing clothes !
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 20]: And she knocks at the door of Martin 's study in his writing hours , and walks bang in .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 10]: _ And he does n't turn her out _ !
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 5]: `` That 's Grizel .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 14]: And if I tried a hundred years I could n't describe her better .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 87]: We were at school together , and she is my most intimate friend , next to Dorothea , but -- `` I wish I were a generous , humble-minded person who _ liked _ standing aside , and seeing other people succeed where I have failed , and being praised where I 'm snubbed , and run after when I 'm ignored , but I 'm not , and if you think I am , you 'd better know once for all that you 're mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 19]: There have been times this last week when I 've _ hated _ Grizel , and her works !
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 36]: `` Yesterday we went to a garden party , she , Martin , and I , and they schemed to send me off with a snuffy old man , so that they could be alone .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 26]: I saw them look at each other , a quick , signalling look , which meant , ` _ Get rid of her _ ! '
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 10]: and he was the first person who came along .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 12]: Poor , snuffy person , with a termagant on his hands !
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 57]: If you were sitting here , face to face -- I should be too proud to tell you this ; even to write it to Dorothea would hurt , but to a ghostly shape whom one has never seen , and probably never shall see , it is a relief to blurt out one 's woes !
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 24]: `` Martin looks at Grizel with a look in his eyes which , -- which is _ not _ like a sorrowing widower !
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 23]: and when I see it I am filled with seventeen contending emotions , like the heroines in the newspaper _ feuilletons _ .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 64]: Jealousy -- hideous , aching jealousy , for Juliet , and the past , for myself and the future ; disillusionment , in the breaking of an ideal , which , if impracticable , was still beautiful and sweet , the illusion of a lifelong loyalty and devotion ; also , and this is worst of all , -- something horribly approaching contempt !
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 40]: My love for Martin is as great as ever , but he is no longer the hero , the strong , silent man who loved once and for ever , and went through life waiting patiently for a reunion .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 21]: He has stepped down from his pedestal and become flesh and blood , and I -- oh , Lonely Man !
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 19]: -- I am _ trying _ to be glad , but it 's a big , big effort !
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 16]: Self looms so large ; the self that _ will _ intrude into every question .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 15]: I wanted him to be happy , _ but in my own way _ !
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 9]: `` I 'm going to stop this minute .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 18]: You 'll be horrified at the length of this budget , but it 's your own fault .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 13]: Give a woman an inch , and she 'll take an ell .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 20]: Wade through it this time , and tell me what you think , but do n't _ preach _ !
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 9]: Preaching does me such a lot of harm .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 32]: Methinks I descry in you a latent tendency to preach ; nevertheless , somehow -- I ca n't think how -- you 've comforted me to-day and so I 'm grateful .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 9]: `` Many happy returns of your twenty-fifth birthday .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 11]: I am a year older , and feel pleasantly superior .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 8]: `` Yours sincerely , `` Katrine Beverley .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 3]: `` PS .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 21]: -- Please go on about ` The girl you would fancy ' ... I have a fancy to hear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 3]: CHAPTER TEN .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 9]: It was a week after the garden party .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 20]: A persistent rain was drenching the trees in the garden , and turning the gravel path into miniature torrents .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 13]: The atmosphere in the low , panelled rooms was damp and chilly .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 22]: Katrine , in a flannel shirt of her favourite rich blue , was busy with account books at the centre table .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 28]: Grizel , in a white gown , and a red nose , was miserably rubbing her hands together , and drumming her small feet on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 4]: `` Katrine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 6]: `` I 'm cold . ''
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 11]: Katrine glanced over the rim of the grocer 's book .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 3]: `` Naturally !
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 5]: Who would n't be ?
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 7]: A muslin gown , this morning !
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 19]: If you 'd an ounce of sense , you 'd go upstairs and change it at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 13]: Grizel 's face fell , like that of a small disappointed child .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 11]: She shivered , and her nose looked redder than ever .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 16]: `` I was hinting , '' she sighed softly , `` for a fire . ''
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 23]: `` I _ know _ that , my dear , perfectly well , but you are not going to get it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 40]: `` If you were a kind , polite hostess -- '' `` No , I should n't , because in an hour 's time the rain will stop , and the room would be close and stuffy all day .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 7]: Besides , we are going out .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 23]: If you will be quiet for ten minutes , I shall have finished these books , and we 'll go out shopping .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 10]: So you 'll _ have _ to change . ''
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 11]: Grizel stared , a glimmer of interest struggling with dismay .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 9]: `` What are you going to buy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 14]: `` Vegetables for dinner , and bacon , and pay the books . ''
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 14]: `` You expect me to walk out in a torrent for _ that !
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 6]: I _ wo n't go .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 8]: I wo n't change my frock either .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 7]: I 'll go to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 13]: There was not the least note of offence in Grizel 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 23]: It preserved its deep note of good-nature , but it sounded obstinate , and her little face was fierce in its militance .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 10]: Katrine , unabashed , went on checking off figures .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 3]: `` Nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 6]: It will do you good .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 7]: Rain is good for the complexion .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 12]: Your face looks tartan , and your nose is red . ''
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 11]: `` I like it red , '' said Grizel serenely .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 9]: She sat another moment nursing her cold hands .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 14]: `` And I wo n't buy cabbages either , '' she added defiantly .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 19]: `` It 's no use trying to brace me , for I wo n't _ be _ braced .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 11]: I 'll go upstairs , and complain to Martin . ''
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 8]: That threat roused Katrine to whole-hearted attention .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 31]: She shut the little red book -- the butcher 's book , this time , swept it and its companions into a neat pile , and sprang to her feet .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 9]: `` You 'll do nothing of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 11]: _ Nobody _ interrupts Martin when he is at work .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 19]: We are forbidden even to knock at the door for anything short of a fire or an earthquake .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 11]: It might spoil his work for the whole morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 6]: Grizel stared at her thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 10]: `` That reminds me , '' she soliloquised slowly .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 23]: `` I _ promised _ to help him , and it 's four whole days , and I 've never been near !
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 24]: It 's my duty to go at once , and I 'll tell him my brain ca n't work unless I 'm warm .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 16]: We 'll light a fire and roast , while you swim home with the cabbage .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 12]: Why on earth did n't I think of that before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 21]: She smiled into her hostess 's face with an easy assurance which brought a spark into the dark blue eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 9]: Katrine was honestly trying not to be angry .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 30]: Before now she had had experience of Grizel in a perverse mood , and knew that it was not by force that one could move her from her purpose .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 12]: She adopted an air of resignation , and approached the bell .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 29]: `` Very well , then , you shall have your fire , and you can read comfortably beside it , or write letters , while I 'm away .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 13]: And I 'll tell Mary to bring you a cup of chocolate .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 32]: You are a spoiled baby , Grizel ; when you 've taken it into your head to do a thing , one might as well give in first as last . ''
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' agreed Grizel calmly .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 8]: `` I 'm going to Martin . ''
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 22]: She rose in her turn and strolled towards the door , while Katrine stood helpless , her hand on the bell .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 4]: `` Grizel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 6]: `` Do n't go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 20]: There was a look on her face , a tone in her voice , which arrested Grizel 's attention .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 26]: Half-way across the room she paused , and studied her hostess with those eyes which looked so lazy , but which saw so uncommonly well .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 12]: There was dread as well as annoyance on Katrine 's face .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 8]: `` What will happen if I do ?
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 9]: What is it you are afraid of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 6]: `` He 'll be furious .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 4]: Terribly angry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 13]: But in her heart Katrine knew that this was not her fear .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 12]: Her fear was lest Martin should _ not _ be angry .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 10]: Grizel considered , a slow smile curving her lips .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 13]: `` But that , '' she said , `` would be amusing .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 7]: Much more amusing than buying cabbages .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 9]: I 'd like to see Martin angry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 7]: She turned and continued her way .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 25]: From her position by the bell Katrine could watch her progress up the staircase , could note the grace of the slim white form .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 7]: `` Her nose is red ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 5]: chanted the inner voice .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 7]: `` Her nose is red ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 16]: Amongst a medley of disagreeable reflections the thought appeared to stand out in solitary comfort .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 46]: It was hardly more than a week since Grizel had arrived , eight days to be exact , yet to Katrine standing alone in the dark old room , it appeared that the whole structure of life had in that time undergone a radical change .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 45]: It was not a change which could be registered in _ facts _ ; the days had been spent in ordinary happenings , tea parties in neighbouring gardens , drives through the country lanes , small dinner parties , a day on the river .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 27]: There was no single incident on which she could lay a finger and declare that here or there stood the dividing mark between past and present .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 27]: The change was in the air ; impalpable yet real ; Katrine 's sensitive nature felt it in every fibre , inhaled it with every breath .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 12]: Behind the peaceful , smiling exterior she divined a smouldering passion .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 20]: The atmosphere was flecked with fire ; it flamed beneath the most trivial words , the most trivial deeds .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 22]: From an ice-bound solitude she looked on , understanding with a keenness of vision , as new as it was bitter .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 23]: During the last days her mind had been incessantly occupied reviewing the past , searching it in the light of the present .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 14]: Juliet , Grizel , and herself had been schoolmates at a French boarding-school .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 19]: Grizel had accompanied her on a short visit to the married couple in the autumn after their marriage .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 29]: That was the first time that Martin had seen her , and even in the midst of his bridegroom 's joy , he had been attracted , impressed .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 37]: Then came two long , black years , at the end of which , taking her courage in both hands , she had enquired if Martin would object if Grizel came down for a few days .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 43]: The mysterious storehouse of the brain had registered the moment , so that she could still see her brother 's face before her , as he lifted it from his book -- the young , drawn face , with the haggard eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 12]: Something approaching a light of interest dawned in the wan depths .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 5]: `` Grizel Dundas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 9]: he queried slowly ; and after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 3]: `` Certainly !
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 3]: Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 8]: I 'd like to see her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 5]: So Grizel had come .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 30]: Memory again registered the fact that it was in response to one of her sallies that Martin had laughed for the first time : an honest , wholesome laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 14]: She had come again the next year , and had been warmly welcomed .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 6]: Then had followed an interval .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 25]: Lady Griselda 's health had begun to fail , she was much abroad , and when at home , disinclined to spare her niece .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 35]: It was not until the fifth year of Martin 's widower-hood that Grizel again visited The Glen , but since then every six or seven months had brought about more or less fleeting visits .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 45]: Questioning herself , Katrine realised that while at the beginning she herself had been the one to suggest a fresh invitation , for the last two years Martin had taken the initiative , while she , with an instinctive unwillingness , had sought excuses .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 28]: Could it be that subconsciously she had divined this ending ; had known that slowly , surely , Martin 's heart was passing into Grizel 's keeping ?
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 39]: She had held fiercely to the remembrance of Juliet ; to the ideal of lifelong faithfulness ; held to it the more fiercely as doubt grew , but now it was no longer doubt , it was certainty .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 26]: Martin loved Grizel with the love of a full-grown man , compared with which that pretty idyll of the past had been child 's play .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 3]: And Grizel ?
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 4]: Who could say !
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 25]: That she would not marry while her aunt lived had for years been an accepted fact , but Lady Griselda 's days were numbered .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 39]: In a few months the question of Grizel 's future position would be decided , and then -- Katrine 's mind had a flashlight realisation of two alternatives , Martin refused , despairing , Martin accepted , aglow .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 13]: For one black moment of involuntary selfishness , each seemed equally obnoxious .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 19]: Then with a stifled sob , she shut the door , and buried her face in her hands .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 12]: Throughout the silent house travelled the sound of an imperative rap .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 6]: `` Who 's there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 16]: The sharp , impatient voice was enough to quell the courage of an ordinary intruder .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 15]: Grizel chuckled , and knocked once more , a trifle more loudly than before .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 8]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ `` Who 's -- there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 4]: `` Me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 21]: It was the tiniest of squeaks , and the irate author , shouting back an imperious `` Go away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 31]: settled himself to his task , but the knock sounded yet again , and in a fury of impatience he dashed to the door and stood scowling upon the threshold .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 19]: `` What the -- '' `` Devil -- '' concluded Grizel calmly , `` but it is n't .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 4]: It 's me .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 6]: Let me in , Martin !
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 13]: It 's a choice between you and buying cabbages in the rain .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 14]: Katrine says so , and I should catch my death of cold . ''
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 13]: But the change in the man 's face was startling to behold .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 27]: The scowl had vanished , had been wiped out of being at the first swift glance , and with it the fret , and the tire .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 12]: The deep-set eyes glowed upon her , the hands stretched out .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 3]: `` Grizel !
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 3]: Come in !
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 3]: Come in !
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 5]: I was just thinking .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 24]: Wishing -- '' Grizel floated past into the forbidden room , her glance as easily avoiding his as her hands escaped his grasp .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 33]: There was nothing curt or forbidding in the evasion , she seemed simply oblivious of anything but a friendly warmth of manner ; engrossed in an interested survey of the study itself .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 16]: Her eyes roved round the book-lined walls , and rested brightening upon the old-fashioned hearth .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 5]: The fire was laid .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 16]: In a basket on one side of the hearth reposed a pile of resined logs .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 7]: A copper vase obviously contained coal .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 4]: `` Martin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 10]: she cried eagerly , `` let 's light up !
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 7]: I 've been perished all morning .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 7]: Katrine says I 'm unsuitably dressed .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 11]: I am , but I never dress to suit rooms .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 9]: I heat them to suit _ me _ !
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 14]: Would you think the room unbearably stuffy if we had a fire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 7]: `` Not a bit of it !
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 4]: I often do .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 9]: Sitting at a desk is chilly work . ''
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 25]: He was already on his knees , posing logs scientifically over the paper and wood , balancing small pieces of coal on the top .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 30]: In an incredibly short time a cheerful blaze was illuminating the room , and Grizel , kicking off small brown shoes , was crinkling her toes before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 23]: Martin drew forward a second chair and seated himself beside her , in apparent forgetfulness of the papers scattered over the desk .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 11]: `` What a shame that you should be so chilled !
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 10]: Why have n't you had a fire downstairs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 5]: `` Katrine preferred exercise .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 13]: She recommended a flannel shirt , and an expedition to buy cabbages .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 4]: British and bracing .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 22]: Can you imagine _ me _ , Martin , buying cabbages , in the rain , in a flannel shirt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 9]: He looked at her ; an eloquent glance .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 67]: There were two feelings warring in his breast , indignation against his sister for her callousness and lack of consideration , and a rush of protective tenderness towards the sweet martyr so abused , for it is one of the injustices of life that the woman who smiles and looks beautiful will always take precedence in a man 's heart over the assiduous purchaser of cabbages .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 18]: For a moment sympathy engrossed Martin 's mind , then he smiled ; a somewhat difficult smile .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 9]: `` It is hardly your _ metier _ !
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 40]: Still , if it happened that you were in Katrine 's position ; if it came in your day 's work -- '' `` If the garden were properly managed you would not _ need _ to buy cabbages !
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 7]: I 'd dismiss the gardener ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 16]: pronounced Grizel briskly , and once again a dangerous moment had come , and gone .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 18]: She cowered over the fire , holding out her hands , hitching her shoulders to her ears .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 71]: Her nose was still red ; if Katrine had been present she would have told herself that no man could possibly admire a woman with a red nose , but Martin had not so much as noticed the fact , and if he had , would have felt it to be a wonderful and beautiful thing that Grizel 's nose could be red , like that of an ordinary mortal .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 12]: It would have appeared to him the most endearing of traits .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 9]: `` I wonder , '' he said thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 11]: `` I wonder Grizel , how you would stand poverty !
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 9]: Comparative poverty , I mean , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 9]: You have never realised the meaning of money .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 12]: You have wanted a thing , and it has been yours .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 20]: You have not adapted yourself to circumstances , circumstances have been made to adapt themselves to _ you _ .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 45]: It is the fashion to decry the power of riches , but in the case of a woman like yourself , young , and strong , and beautiful , and sane , it is folly to pretend that they are not a valuable asset .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 10]: You have been happy -- '' `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 4]: assented Grizel thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 12]: She stared into the fire , her small face very grave .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 21]: `` I like money ; so much money that one need not have the thought of it always before one .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 16]: It would seem to me debasing to be always considering costs , planning and contriving .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 8]: It would hold one 's thoughts down .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 9]: And I have never felt burdened by responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 38]: That 's what they say , you know , -- the dear , serious folks , -- they call wealth a burden and responsibility , but I 've loved to be able to give and to help .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 15]: I 've my own little way about giving ... '' -LRB- The listener smiled .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 11]: When had Grizel _ not _ her own way ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 38]: `` The public charities must be supported , of course , that 's mechanical ; a mere signing of cheques , but the interesting part is to get hold of private cases , and see them through !
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 31]: Will you be shocked , Martin , when I tell you that my particular _ forte _ is helping people who have failed through -- _ their own fault _ !
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 24]: Not misfortune , but drink , gambling , other things , of which they might have kept free , but -- did n't !
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 60]: It 's a kind old world ; every one is ready to help the unfortunate , but when a man has had a chance , and thrown it away , when it 's ` nobody 's fault but his own , ' _ then _ , '' she shrugged her slight shoulders , `` he goes into outer darkness !
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 23]: People have ` enough to do ' helping those who ` deserve it , ' and so I do the other thing !
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 27]: My old Buddy has never limited me as to money ; the only time when she is annoyed , is when I 've not spent enough .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 13]: I have quite a battalion of lost causes dependent on me now .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 9]: It would hurt to give them up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 19]: There was a moment 's silence , then : `` And have you _ no _ idea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 4]: asked Martin tentatively .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 12]: `` None at all , whether in the end -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 3]: Grizel laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 17]: It was rare indeed that she was serious for more than a minute at a time .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 5]: `` Not -- one !
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 5]: Is n't it odd ?
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 9]: Like a position in a _ feuilleton _ .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 10]: Never once has the subject been mentioned between us .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 40]: I have had , as I said , command of unlimited money since I left school , but she dreads the idea of death ; it must never be mentioned in her presence , or anything approximately suggesting it .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 45]: For the last few years she has been , of course , increasingly irresponsible , but before that we lived always as if the present would last for ever ... She has never even alluded to the time when I should be alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 25]: `` But surely there must have been , -- I know , Grizel , that there have been men , -- many men ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 10]: cried Grizel deeply , and chuckled with reminiscent enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 4]: `` Just so .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 19]: There _ was _ one , a bold one , who questioned her point blank on her intentions .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 21]: He lived ; he came out of the room alive , but that was as much as one could say .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 20]: He got the best dressing down of _ his _ life , but that was all he did get .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 10]: And he did n't trouble me any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 3]: `` Cur !
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 9]: But they were not all so mercenary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 6]: Grizel looked thoughtful once more .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 4]: `` Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 4]: I like men .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 13]: They are nice things ; not really mercenary unless they 're obliged .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 31]: But it 's a difficult position to saddle yourself with a wife who _ may _ turn out a colossal heiress , or on the other hand -- a pauper !
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 20]: It complicates the position , and in one way or other is pretty well bound to lead to trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 53]: The man who would appreciate the one , is bound to object to t ` other , and it 's such a contrary world , that the t ` other it would almost certainly be ... When you are making a choice for life , you ought to understand where you are .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 24]: You see , Martin , '' she turned towards him with a smile , `` it would not _ be fair _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 21]: `` And -- '' he said hoarsely , `` was _ that _ the reason why you never -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 15]: Grizel put her head on one side , and stared thoughtfully into the blaze .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 3]: `` Partly .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 2]: Mostly .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 5]: And my old Buddy .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 13]: She wo n't live long , and I owe her so much .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 9]: But mostly the idea of playing the game .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 21]: Most of the men I have met have positions to maintain , and expect their wives to lend a hand .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 18]: They ca n't afford a love marriage , and I 'm proud in my own little way .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 11]: I should n't like to turn out a disappointment . ''
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 35]: `` There are some men who are old-fashioned enough to prefer to provide for their own wives , who would dread the fortune even more heartily than others do the lack of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 4]: `` There are .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 4]: I realise that .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 5]: Bless their dear hearts !
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 7]: But _ not _ the majority !
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 33]: There 's an heir to a Dukedom hovering round now , Martin ; not compromising himself , you understand , but by steady attention to business laying the foundation of a claim .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 49]: If the old Buddy died and left me her heir , he 'd tell me that he had forborne to _ intrude _ , had valiantly subdued his impatience , etc. , etc. , I never want the money quite so badly as when I imagine that interview !
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 30]: I 'm not spiteful as a rule , but I shall think fate treats me hardly if I never have a chance of scorching that young man ... Well !
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 6]: we 'll see -- ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 19]: `` You want then , -- you will be disappointed if you do n't get the money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 15]: She turned her eyes full upon him , distended in the widest of stares .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 15]: `` Well , I should just _ farther _ think I _ should _ !
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 3]: T-errifically disappointed !
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 2]: Squelched .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 2]: Flum-macked .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 4]: Laid out flat .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 7]: For the hour , that is .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 15]: I could n't go on being worried , for all the fortunes on earth .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 20]: It will be a case of adapting myself to a new sort of happiness -- _ c'est tout _ !
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 6]: That 's easily done . ''
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 29]: The joy of the lover , the keen , appraising interest of the artist , were both eloquent in Martin 's glance as he considered her eloquent face .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 11]: One can not imagine Grizel less than happy and content .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 26]: And yet to an ordinary nature , your life during these last years , for all its luxuries , would have seemed a poor thing .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 14]: You have made your happiness by managing to love a very unlovable character .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 14]: It 's a big feat , Grizel ; a very big feat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 15]: Grizel rubbed her nose , a slow , thoughtful rub with a raised forefinger .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 28]: The homely movement seemed ridiculously out of character with the ethereal form and the transparent hand , on which the firelight woke the gleam of flawless diamonds .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 15]: `` Can a ` feat ' be something for which you have never tried ?
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 10]: I never _ try _ to love any one .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 12]: Either I love 'em , or -- I do n't bother !
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 11]: Disliking , hating , -- it 's too much trouble !
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 26]: I wipe 'em out ... Same way with things ; therefore , as a logical conclusion nothing remains but what I _ do _ like .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 7]: Therefore , -- logical inference again !
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 19]: -- one must be happy , because there 's nothing to make one _ un _ - happy .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 9]: Sounds easy enough , does n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 5]: Martin 's lip curled .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 8]: `` I wonder , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 15]: `` I wonder what Katrine would say if you propounded that theory to her ?
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 22]: I fancy , poor girl , that the very opposite of your programme would come nearer to her outlook on life .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 15]: She finds it as difficult to be happy as you do to be miserable .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 10]: And yet -- she 's had her chance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 9]: `` Martin , she has _ not _ !
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 6]: What chance has she had ?
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 25]: Tucked away in this dark old house , with you shut up in your study all day , and in your moods all night ?
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 22]: My old Buddy loves me ; it 's not an ordinary form of loving perhaps , but she _ does _ !
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 10]: I 'm more to her than the whole world .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 31]: And I 've had my fling ... Poor old Katrine has had no love , and no fling , nothing but duty , and brotherly affection , and home-made clothes .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 9]: It 's enough to make any woman snap .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 9]: I 'm glad she _ is _ discontented .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 13]: I 'll make her more discontented still , before I 've done .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 25]: She 's pot-bound , like your stale old ferns , and needs uprooting , and shaking , and planting in fresh , strong earth .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 11]: Then she 'll bloom , and you , poor bat !
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 12]: will be amazed at what a fine big bloom it is .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 39]: It is n't a sign of greatness , Martin , to blink in the sun , because one is too lazy too move , and is content to bask , and be stroked , and lick up cream .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 4]: That 's me !
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 21]: Katrine is bigger ; it needs more to fill her life , but she 's only just beginning to grow .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 18]: You do n't know , Martin , how sweet a woman Katrine is going to be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 11]: Martin smiled ; a smile of serene , unshakable conviction .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 5]: He knew his sister .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 77]: She was a good girl , well meaning , if a little difficult by nature ; he , of all people on earth , would be the last to deny Katrine 's good points , but -- to compare her with Grizel , to account to her a greatness of nature above that of the sweetest , kindliest , most loving of women , -- that was a flight of fancy beyond even his well-trained powers !
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 50]: `` And who , '' queried Grizel , with sudden energy , `` is Katrine thinking of , when she sits smiling into space , and giving silly answers to obvious questions , and putting horrid sugar into my tea , -- tell me that , if you can !
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 17]: It is your profession in life to study men and women , and analyse their thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 15]: What do you make of the mystery of the woman upon your hearth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 4]: Martin smiled superior .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 5]: `` There is none .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 70]: She is thinking of the grocer , and determining to hurl another complaint at his head , because he will insist upon sending us sandy grit , instead of honest West Indian sugar , or of the butcher , whom she suspects of frozen meat , or -- or of the Y.W. , who has left smudges on the plates ... Nothing more romantic , I assure you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 7]: `` Blind bat of a man !
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 8]: that 's all _ you _ know .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 10]: I 'll take to novel-writing myself at this rate .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 27]: If this is the insight and inner vision of ` one of the most popular of our young writers ' there 's room for Grizel Dundas !
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 33]: I have not been in the house a week , but I know two things -- _ Some one _ is making love to Katrine , and -- Katrine enjoys the process !
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 42]: By a process of elucidation I know also that it is not the doctor with the beard , nor the curate with the smile , nor the Caldecote squire who rides the white horse , nor the squeaky person who sings .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 10]: It is n't this neighbourhood which holds the treasure .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 15]: She has an air of calmness and detachment in partaking of your rural joys .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 10]: Not a flicker of ` Will he come ? '
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 10]: ... Methinks my friend , he lives afar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 8]: The smile broadened upon Martin 's lips .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 42]: Women , the most sensible of women , had a way of searching for sentimental reasons for the most prosaic happenings ; it was an interesting trait , and from the altitude of a man 's sound common-sense , attractive enough .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 20]: It pleased him to hear Grizel imagining love stories with Katrine as heroine , without foundation as they were .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 15]: `` Ca n't you go a little further and discover his name and address ?
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 8]: It would be interesting to know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 3]: `` Jim .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 17]: India , '' replied Grizel with a promptness which startled her hearer into attention at last .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 18]: The face which confronted him was full of triumph , and a malicious delight in his discomfiture .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 10]: He stared discomfited , amazed , subtly aggrieved . ''
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 6]: _ Jim _ , India !
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 7]: There _ is _ no Jim !
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 16]: She knows no one there , not a soul , except Jack Middleton and Dorothea .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 12]: What put it into your head to fancy such a thing ?
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 5]: Has she -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 14]: `` There _ is _ a Jim , and the Middletons know him .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 17]: Dorothea wrote about some commissions , and Katrine showed me the note -- wanting my advice .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 32]: There was a reference to one ` Jim , ' -- she 'd forgotten that , quite a colourless reference , but when I questioned , she _ blushed _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 12]: Grizel covered her cheeks with her hands , in eloquent gesture .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 9]: `` Oh , _ such _ a blush !
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 18]: I looked away , but I thought : ` Why should one blush at a name ? '
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 10]: and after that I went _ on _ thinking .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 35]: It 's Jim , India -- Martin , you may take my word for it , though how , and why , and when , I have no more idea than you have yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 31]: There 's a new interest in her life ; any one with two eyes can see that , and she writes huge , huge letters ... '' `` To Dorothea !
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 7]: She 's done that for years .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 11]: I 've often wondered what she finds to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 8]: Grizel rolled eloquent eyes to the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 47]: `` I have been young , '' she declaimed dramatically , `` and now am old , yet have I never seen a woman staring into space , smirking , and looking silly , considering how she can best turn a sentence , to another woman !
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 38]: I tell you that which I do know and , Martin dear , it 's not disloyalty ... I would n't have breathed a word , if it had not been for the hope of helping both .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 11]: Keep your own eyes open , and _ act _ !
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 36]: Katrine 's conscience is of the good , old-fashioned , Nonconformist type which urges her on to do the thing she most dislikes , out of a deluded idea that it must needs be right !
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 11]: She 's quite capable of playing suttee with her life .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 10]: _ Do n't let her do it _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 7]: `` How can I help it ?
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 4]: I know nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 5]: I am not consulted .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 8]: I believe the whole thing is imagination .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 15]: If there had been anything real she would surely have confided in you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 3]: `` Me ?
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 36]: I 'm the last person , -- the last person in the world -- '' The words were spoken on the impulse of the moment , and apparently regretted as soon as they were pronounced .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 15]: Grizel flushed ; obviously , unmistakably , even in the glow of the firelight .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 14]: She flushed , and pushing back her chair rose hurriedly to her feet .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 3]: `` Whew !
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 3]: That fire !
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 12]: Katrine was right , -- it _ does _ get close .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 9]: And I believe it is going to clear .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 8]: -- I 'll go and see . ''
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 7]: `` Why are you the last ?
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 5]: _ Why _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 21]: Martin had followed her , was questioning with a new light in his eyes -- eager , curious , anticipatory .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 15]: On her way towards the door her progress was blocked by his tall form .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 8]: `` Why the last , Grizel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 4]: he repeated urgently .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 4]: `` Tell me !
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 5]: I want to know .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 6]: Why should Katrine -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 18]: Never before had he seen a trace of embarrassment break the lazy serenity of Grizel 's mien .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 20]: The sight of it , and the possibility of an intoxicating explanation of her statement , fired his blood .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 39]: For the last two years he had been fighting against this love , fighting it as a forbidden thing , a thing of which to be ashamed , but lately , subtly , the mental position had changed .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 23]: Life was forcibly pushing him from one standpoint after another , proving its untenability , sending him forth to find fresh fields .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 7]: `` Why should Katrine -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 18]: he cried , and at that moment the door opened and Katrine herself stood upon the threshold .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 63]: Her face was pale , her eyes grave and gentle , the picture of her as she appeared at that moment dwelt in Martin 's mind , and brought with it a startled recognition of his sister 's charm , then in a flash , she stiffened ; the softness passed from the eyes , and was replaced by a chilly scorn .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 48]: This was a love scene upon which she had intruded , -- Grizel flushed , protesting , Martin flushed , appealing , and her own name `` Katrine '' bandied upon his lip -- no doubt to be waved aside , as an obstacle blocking the way .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 27]: It was in a voice icily bereft of expression that she delivered her message : `` I have just taken a message for you , Grizel .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 12]: They have rung up to say that Lady Griselda is worse .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 9]: You are wanted at home at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 3]: CHAPTER ELEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 11]: Lady Griselda Dundas lay a-dying on her great oak bed .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 57]: For two long weeks after Grizel 's summons home she had lingered on , until now her aquiline features were attenuated to a knife-like sharpness , and every particle of flesh seemed to have departed from the skeleton form , but the eyes were alive , conscious , yet with a puzzled wistfulness in their glance .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 28]: Her brain had cleared , as often happens immediately before the great change ; the present was clear , but over the past the cloud still hung .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 8]: `` I -- ca n't remember ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 4]: she reiterated feebly .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 6]: `` It 's all blank .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 11]: What have I been doing these last weeks , Grizel ?
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 6]: Where have I been ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 15]: Grizel knelt by the bedside , her warm hands clasped over the icy fingers .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 19]: She wore a soft white dressing-gown , and her hair hung in a long plait down her back .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 42]: She had been sleeping on a sofa at the end of the room , but now it was two o'clock , and there was a look in the old woman 's face which made her determine to keep close at hand .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 23]: Nevertheless there was no sorrow in her face ; the smile with which she spoke was as usual , sweet and unperturbed .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 29]: `` You have been here , Buddy ; in this house ; in these rooms , and I 've been with you , except for a few days .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 13]: Everything has gone on just the same ... '' `` Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 5]: exclaimed Lady Griselda loudly .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 11]: Her eyes flashed with a flicker of the old fire .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 16]: `` And a fine old fool I 've been making of myself , no doubt !
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 3]: Senile decay !
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 12]: I hoped at least I should be spared _ that _ .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 5]: I ca n't remember .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 7]: -- It is like a mist .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 6]: Have I been ill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 8]: `` Weak , darling , and tired .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 7]: You 've been up most days .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 8]: A month ago you had a drive .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 10]: Only two days ago you were taken worse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 16]: `` And now , '' said the old woman calmly , `` I 'm dying .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 16]: Pretty soon too , I should say , for there 's not much feeling left .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 10]: Do n't let them poke me about , Grizel .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 4]: Keep them away !
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 14]: It 's a poor thing if one ca n't die in peace . ''
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 9]: She was silent , munching her sunken jaws .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 14]: Then the keen glance wandered to the girl 's face , and softened .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 10]: `` Have I been rough with you , child ?
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 3]: Bullied you ?
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 7]: More than usual , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 18]: If I have , I did n't know it ... Has it been a hard time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 4]: Grizel smiled again .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 6]: `` You varied , dear .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 16]: Rather fierce at times , and again quite meek , and sometimes , terribly funny !
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 18]: You 'd laugh , Buddy , if you could hear some of the things you said ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 4]: `` Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 11]: A wraith of a smile passed over the grey face .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 6]: `` Glad to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 19]: I 'd be interested , but there 's not time ... Where 's that fool of a nurse ?
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 11]: Keep her away ; I want no one but you .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 15]: Well , child , shall you grieve for me when I 'm gone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 7]: `` No , Buddy , dear .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 36]: I 'll grieve for _ myself _ , but for you , I shall be glad it 's over , -- the pain , and the crippledom , and the dulness , and the waiting .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 14]: I love you too much to want _ that _ to go on .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 9]: It will be better ... '' `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 3]: Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 4]: Lady Griselda sighed .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 5]: `` We 'll see !
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 11]: Better than I deserve -- I 'm sure of that .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 11]: I ca n't even say I 've done my best .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 21]: I _ have n't _ but God knows , at the bottom of my heart I _ wanted to _ !
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 15]: I was born sour , just as you , child , were born sweet .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 3]: Seems unfair .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 23]: I do n't understand ... Lots of things we do n't understand ... That will be interesting -- to find out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 23]: She munched in silence for several minutes , her gaze lingering wistfully on Grizel 's face , upturned in the dim light .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 9]: `` Good child , '' she said distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 4]: `` Good child !
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 2]: Kind .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 2]: Loving .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 2]: True .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 9]: You 've been a comfort to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 8]: `` Ah , Buddy , dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 16]: The deep , soft tone of Grizel 's voice was more eloquent than a caress .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 7]: `` It 's been so easy !
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 20]: We 've loved each other ... If it 's possible where you are going , look after me still !
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 8]: I want to feel you are near .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 12]: I 'll remember you always , and your dear kindness . ''
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 4]: Lady Griselda frowned .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 8]: A look of distress wrinkled her face .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 4]: `` Kind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 3]: she repeated .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 8]: `` I _ meant _ to be !
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 21]: I wanted you to be happy -- I schemed for that -- but it may be , I was wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 10]: I do n't know , I ca n't think .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 16]: It 's too late now , but I meant well , child , remember that !
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 7]: I thought only of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 8]: `` Buddy , '' said Grizel clearly .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 18]: `` All the money in the world is not worth troubling about in these few last hours .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 4]: Leave it alone !
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 12]: I shall be happy , dear ; God made me happy .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 10]: Rest your old head , and do n't trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 9]: It 's all quite , quite right . ''
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 6]: Lady Griselda closed her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 16]: The sands were running very low , and she had not the energy to speak .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 25]: Grizel fed her with sips of brandy , but she made no attempt to call the nurse , who was sleeping in another room .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 32]: She also held the theory that a human soul should be allowed to die after its own fashion , even if thereby life 's span were shortened by a few hours .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 42]: Still on her knees she watched while the old woman dozed , and dozed again , waking up to brief moments of consciousness , but her mind had wandered from the present , and was back in the far away past .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 12]: `` He broke my heart , '' she said faintly once .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 16]: `` It was the money he wanted , not me ; but I loved him .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 11]: And there was no child -- I was alone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 5]: Suddenly her eyes flashed .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 15]: `` I hope , '' she said clearly , `` we shall never meet !
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 22]: I forgive him -- it 's all over -- but eternity is big enough ... There 's room for both . ''
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 17]: ... Another time , `` Remember , '' she gasped , `` no black for me !
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 5]: Do n't suit you .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 3]: Dismal stuff .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 7]: _ Let _ 'em talk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 14]: and again , with a reminiscent chuckle : `` Rudest woman in London .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 9]: That was me , and here I lie !
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 7]: it did me one good turn .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 14]: When I was crippled they kept their distance ... No fussing and sympathising .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 5]: Did n't want 'em .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 14]: Only you -- '' Grizel stroked her hand , and she slept again .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 21]: It was an awesome thing to watch the grey face , changing moment by moment into a mask of clay .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 23]: The hard , bitter-tongued woman had come to the end of her journey , and was going out into the great unknown .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 18]: Life had brought her perhaps the hardest of all fates , great wealth , and little love .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 32]: The girl kneeling by her side knew that she was the only person on earth who would honestly regret her loss , and the knowledge brought with it the first tear .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 26]: She sent out her whole heart in a passion of love and gratitude , as if thereby she could lighten the last struggle of life .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 31]: As the shackles of earth were loosened , the spirit so soon to be freed from the fleshly prison must surely be sensitive to the ministrations of a kindred soul .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 23]: Grizel poured forth the wealth of her love , and even as she gazed beheld an answering peace on the dying face .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 17]: The eyes remained closed , but the fingers stirred within her own with a caressing touch .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 11]: `` Good -- child , '' breathed the faint voice .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 6]: `` Good -- child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 21]: An hour later Grizel awoke the sleeping nurse and informed her of her patient 's death some ten minutes before .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 13]: The nurse rose hurriedly , shocked and discomfited in her professional pride .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 6]: Why was she not called ?
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 7]: `` She did not want you .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 11]: We preferred to be alone , '' said Grizel calmly .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 16]: She was perfectly composed , and there were no tear marks on her pallid face .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 16]: The nurse looked at her and wondered instinctively why people called Miss Dundas a beauty .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 13]: She fastened her dressing-gown , and made the inevitable attempt at comfort .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 6]: `` You must be exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 10]: Let me make you a cup of tea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 9]: `` Please do , '' returned Grizel heartily .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 7]: `` I adore stray teas ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 3]: Most unfeeling !
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 12]: the nurse decided , but then , what could one expect ?
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 13]: A most disagreeable old woman , and such a fortune to inherit !
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 9]: She sighed , stifling a pang of envy .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 28]: The will of Lady Griselda Dundas was published the week after her funeral , and was the subject of comment in every large newspaper in the kingdom .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 24]: The disposal of so large a fortune was in itself interesting , but the unusual conditions of the will attracted a curious attention .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 30]: Beyond a few insignificant legacies the entire property was bequeathed to her niece , and adopted daughter , Miss Grizel Dundas , for the term of her unmarried life .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 55]: On her marriage she became entitled to an income of five hundred a year , with a further sum of ten thousand pounds to be paid down on her fiftieth birthday , the remainder of the vast property being divided between certain charities , and a few distant relations , scattered about the world .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 28]: Grizel Dundas was left then to decide between single blessedness and an income approaching thirty thousand a year , and marriage on a pittance of five hundred !
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 15]: Society wagged its tongue in excited effort to solve the reason of the mystery .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 17]: Lady Griselda 's own unhappy marriage had made her dread a similar experience for her niece .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 22]: Grizel Dundas had been on the eve of an imprudent marriage , from which the will was designed to save her .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 26]: Unsavoury facts had come to light concerning the private life of a certain titled aspirant ... Numerous theories were advanced , but only one solution .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 41]: Grizel Dundas was already twenty-eight , an age at which the sentimental period might be supposed to be outlived ; she would accept the goods which the gods had given , and become one of the great hostesses of society .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 14]: Those seemingly lazy , easy-going people were invariably the most practical at heart .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 6]: Grizel Dundas was no fool .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 12]: She knew well enough on which side her bread was buttered .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 27]: And in The Glen , Martin and Katrine Beverley read the different notices in strained silence , and referred to them in terse , difficult words .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 17]: Each tried anxiously to discover the other 's sentiments , and to conceal a personal verdict .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 34]: Katrine discovered in Martin 's depression the confirmation of her own conviction that he could never venture to ask Grizel to become his wife , at such a cost to her future prospects .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 21]: The conviction brought with it a renewed sense of security , but little of the satisfaction which she had expected .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 19]: A mysterious weight lay on her heart , and she struggled against an almost overwhelming sense of impatience .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 14]: The routine of daily life appeared insufferably monotonous , blank , and unsatisfying .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 26]: If Martin settled down again into his old , grave way , life would go on in the same old way , always the same !
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 26]: She had been passing through a period of unrest and dread , but now that the dread seemed over , her heart knew no joy .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 7]: `` What do I want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 6]: Katrine asked despairingly of herself .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 7]: `` What do I want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 25]: Martin had gone to town to attend the funeral , but as Grizel had not attended the ceremony had had no glimpse of her .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 15]: The ordinary letter of condolence had been forwarded , but had received no reply .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 61]: A week dragged by , a fortnight , almost three weeks , and Martin , strained almost beyond endurance , was tentatively suggesting to Katrine that it would be a kind action to run up to town to pay Grizel a call , when the morning post arrived , and with it a letter in the large , well-known writing .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 11]: `` Will you put me up for a week ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 3]: Grizel wrote .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 19]: `` There is a lot of clearing away to be done here , and I must get away .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 10]: Expect me to-morrow by the five o'clock train ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWELVE .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 11]: `` Lebong , _ August 20 , 19 -- _ .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 13]: `` Dear Katrine , -- `` Your grumbly letter safely to hand .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 22]: You explained the reasons right enough , for all your protests , and honestly , dear , I ca n't sympathise !
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 22]: All is going as I could have told you it would , and in the best way possible for all concerned .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 11]: You 've only to sit still , and await events .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 10]: `` I should like to meet Miss Grizel Dundas .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 20]: She does n't sound the sort of a girl a man _ would _ look at with sorrowful eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 5]: I should n't myself .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 11]: I 'd think small beer of Martin if he did .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 24]: Dorothea says there 's an erratic old aunt in the question , and that no human soul can foretell what she may do .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 31]: Personally I hope she 'll leave her fortune to the Home for Stray Cats , or any mad scheme which old ladies approve , rather than to fascinating Miss Grizel .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 35]: A few hundreds a year to buy frocks and frills is agreeable enough , but a colossal fortune is a handicap to a girl , so far as decent , single-minded men are concerned .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 14]: _ You _ are not an heiress by any chance , are you ?
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 43]: My annual income from every source tots up to something like eight hundred a year , and as this is an expensive station , and the caste question necessitates an army of servants , it might very well be more ... However !
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 7]: we were not talking about ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 19]: `` You are wrong about Martin , dear girl , and the sooner you realise it the better .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 32]: There 's no stepping down from pedestals in opening the heart to love and joy -- the demoralising thing is to close it , out of a mistaken sense of duty .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 17]: Are these years of repression shaping him into a kinder , wider , more generous form ?
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 21]: Think over the question , and if you answer ` no , ' then what is to be his cure ?
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 19]: `` I expect the truth of it is that like most dear women the religious question troubles you .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 25]: How , you ask yourself , would Martin feel , if he married again , and died , and met Juliet in another sphere ?
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 9]: What would happen when the two wives met ?
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 37]: -- I should laugh over that question , if I did not guess that it bites deep , for what sort of a spiritual world could it be in which jealousy and self-seeking counted before love !
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 72]: I can imagine Juliet meeting Grizel with open arms , and blessing her for having brought back joy to the beloved 's heart ; I can imagine them united by the very fact of their mutual love ; what is utterly beyond my imagination is that having reached a higher plane of thought and vision , there should be any grudge , any envy , any question of who comes first !
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 12]: `` We 've got to _ grow _ , little girl !
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 20]: Plants _ can _ grow in the dark ; sickly , pale-coloured things , but they can not flower .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 5]: Think that over too .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 7]: You 'll find I am right .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 13]: `` I 'm hanged if I am not preaching , after all .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 2]: Sorry !
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 9]: You 'll have to forgive me this time .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 10]: `` Dorothea and I have had ` words . '
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 28]: She represents that as she allowed me to hear extracts from your letters for years past , she might now be treated to occasional extracts from mine .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 21]: From a logical point of view there 's nothing to be said , only -- it ca n't be done .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 6]: My letters are my own .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 10]: Not so much as a comma can be shared .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 19]: It appears also that a certain photograph has disappeared from her mantelpiece , and that she blames me .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 18]: I took it right enough , _ but it looked as if it wanted to come _ !
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 7]: Give you my word it did .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 56]: And it lives _ perdu _ in a drawer , where no eye can see it but mine own , and I say good-night to it every night , and good-morning when I 'm not too late , and an occasional salaam during the day , just to see that she 's there all right !
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 30]: `` We have just been giving a big send-off to a fellow in the regiment , Bedford by name , who is taking a few months ' sick leave .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 26]: His people are to meet him in Egypt as he ca n't stand an English winter , and he hopes to get back in spring .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 22]: A bad case of rheumatism , which will play the dickens with his work if it is not stopped in time .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 22]: The desert air is the best cure he can have , and he ought to put in a pretty good time .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 5]: You 'd like Bedford .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 30]: A big , bony chap , rather after your own description of the fortunate orphan , with a curt , shy manner , which the women seem to approve .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 15]: With men he is as straight as a die , and a splendid soldier .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 13]: It gives one a choke in the throat to see Bedford hobble .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 41]: `` I 've told him that I know a spinster lady in England who collects brasses , and asked him to keep a look-out for old specimens , so I expect you 'll hear from him one of these days .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 17]: It will give him an interest in poking about , and besides -- Christmas is coming !
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 8]: `` Well , good-bye , little girl .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 17]: Take care of yourself , and look forward as I do to a good time coming !
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 9]: `` Yours ever , `` Jim Blair . ''
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 3]: CHAPTER THIRTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 21]: Grizel in a grey dress , with a hat wreathed with violets , was a shock to Katrine 's sensibilities .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 51]: In theory she disapproved of conventional mourning , and approved of fulfilling the wishes of the dead ; in reality she was still under the thraldom of public opinion , and the prospect of walking down the High Street with a mourner in colours assumed the dimensions of a dread .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 14]: `` They '' would say , -- what would `` they '' say ?
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 11]: The unchanged demeanour of the mourner was likewise a shock .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 36]: There was every reason why Lady Griselda 's death should be regarded as a relief , but an assumption of regret and gravity were customary under the circumstances , and Grizel was not even subdued .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 31]: She smiled , and jested , preserved her lazy , untroubled air , and to an outside eye was in no respect altered by the happenings of the last weeks .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 24]: Katrine waited impatiently for some reference to the dramatic will , and when none came , was driven to open the subject herself .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 20]: `` Is n't it glorious , '' she questioned curiously , `` to be mistress of that enormous fortune ?
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 19]: To know that you can practically get anything in the whole world which you happen to fancy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 19]: Grizel stroked her nose , her eyes asking the question which would have been too banal in words .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 4]: _ Anything _ ?
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 9]: Katrine understood the reference , and flushed brightly .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 44]: She hurried to add a clause : `` Of course , if you had been sentimentally disposed , it would have been different , but you have never -- '' `` No , '' responded Grizel amiably , `` I never have . ''
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 35]: Voice and manner were all that is friendly ; there was not a particle of resentment , nevertheless the subject was closed , and Katrine knew that she could never refer to it again .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 41]: That Martin would not do so on his own accord she felt convinced , for though Grizel herself was unchanged , there was an unmistakable difference between his present behaviour to his guest , and that during her recent visit .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 28]: Now he was merely the courteous host , concerned with the comfort and amusement of his sister 's guest , but making no personal claim for attention .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 19]: By day he shut himself in his study ; in the evening he sedulously avoided _ tete-a-tetes _ .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 23]: A still , set look had come back to his face , which brought with it a haunting memory of the past .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 39]: Katrine had not realised how far from the desert of sorrow he had travelled until she recognised that look , and at the sight her heart contracted with a pang of protective tenderness , startling in its intensity .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 29]: At that moment , and for the first time in her life , Self was wiped out , and her own welfare ceased to weigh in the balance .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 4]: `` Not again !
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 4]: Not again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 5]: cried the inner voice .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 7]: `` He has suffered enough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 18]: It was intolerable to think of living to see Martin pass through a second period of despair !
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 29]: Katrine set her wits to work to puzzle out the problem before her , and at each point in her reflections the same question recurred with ever-increasing force .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 8]: _ Why had Grizel come back _ ?
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 32]: Realising as any woman must have done the depth of Martin 's love , why , at this moment of all others , had she deliberately put herself in his way ?
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 39]: Grizel was not heartless , her numerous flirtations had been of an open and innocent nature , stopping well short of the danger point ; it was inconceivable to believe that she would deliberately increase Martin 's pain .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 26]: Then -- could it be possible that she was _ willing _ to sacrifice all ; was but waiting for a word , a sign ?
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 20]: It was almost impossible to believe , but at least , Katrine determined , the opportunity should be given .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 25]: Now that the critical moment had arrived all other dreads dwindled before that of failing to do her share to secure Martin 's happiness .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 10]: That very day at lunch she made her attempt .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 15]: `` I have to be out this afternoon , Grizel , '' she announced .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 9]: `` A committee meeting , and a tea .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 5]: Martin must amuse you .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 21]: The study is cool in the afternoon , you might sit there , or have tea in the garden . ''
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 11]: Martin 's start of surprise held no sign of pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 28]: He appeared to be on the point of an objection , when Grizel 's calm acquiescence closed his lips : `` Yes -- I 'd like to !
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 8]: We 'll try the study first . ''
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 29]: `` We sha n't need a fire to-day ... I 'm afraid it will be dull for you , but I can give you a good book . ''
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 24]: The words fell mechanically from Martin 's lips , but it was Katrine who flushed with resentment ; Grizel smiled on , unperturbed .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 38]: An hour afterwards she was sleeping like a child on her bedroom sofa , and Katrine peeping in to say good-bye , asked herself amazedly if such composure could exist side by side with any deep feeling .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 25]: `` If I -- '' the very suggestion made her heart leap , she looked on the sleeping face with a stirring of indignation .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 17]: Martin 's life , and her own , shaken to their foundations , while Grizel slept !
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 24]: For a moment she wrestled with the temptation to shake the still form into consciousness , then turning slowly , left the room .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 16]: Half an hour later Grizel opened her eyes , and sat up on her couch .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 24]: There was no intermediary stage of heaviness and confusion , with the very opening of her lids she was vividly , composedly awake .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 15]: She rose , sauntered to the glass , and surveyed herself with critical detachment .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 16]: Her cheeks were flushed with sleep , her hair ruffled into a disorder undeniably becoming .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 51]: Her lips parted in a smile of transparent pleasure , then deliberately she took the brush and smoothed back the curling ends , which being done she seated herself by the open window , took up a book , and read composedly until the pink had faded from her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 25]: It was a pale , orderly , infinitely less attractive Grizel who tapped at Martin 's door , and seated herself by his desk .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 8]: `` I 've come , you see !
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 24]: You did n't want me , but I wanted to come , and I always do what I want -- '' `` Grizel !
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 10]: that 's not true , '' protested Martin hastily .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 22]: He was still sitting in his swivel writing-chair , turned sideways from the desk so that he could see her face .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 20]: A few scattered sheets of MS lay before him , but the ink was dry on the last words .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 18]: When Grizel had entered the room , it had been to find him gazing blankly into space .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 23]: It was not obvious against which part of Grizel 's declaration his protest was directed , nor did she trouble to enquire .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 23]: Folding her hands she looked in his eyes with childlike directness and said simply : `` Martin -- I want to talk !
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 18]: You have said nothing about my position , but I am waiting to hear what you think !
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 9]: I came down on purpose to talk . ''
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 12]: `` But , Grizel , what is there to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 13]: Martin spoke in quick practical accents , his eyes sedulously avoiding hers .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 16]: `` I have not congratulated you , because it hardly seemed that congratulations were deserved .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 10]: On the other hand , I can not condole .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 10]: Lady Griselda 's mind had been failing for years .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 20]: I can not believe that she was fully responsible when she concocted -- '' `` You are wrong there .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 5]: She was perfectly clear .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 10]: I have always expected some arrangement of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 11]: She loved me ; she was anxious for my happiness .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 45]: If it could be happily arranged she wished me to inherit the money , but she had been an heiress herself , and had suffered by it , and she was sharp enough to estimate the sincerity of the men who hung around me .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 13]: It 's quite simple , Martin , if you remember the clue .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 47]: If I choose to remain single , I enjoy everything that her money can give ; if I marry , I marry a man who wants _ me _ , not my wealth ; Grizel Dundas , -- herself -- not what she can bring . ''
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 28]: `` He would be a bold man who could ask a girl to give up thirty thousand a year , for the sake of his love ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 8]: He would need to be brave ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 13]: The substitution of the word was so quiet as to appear unconscious .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 19]: Martin shot a piercing look , but the eyes which met his were as expressionless as the voice .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 12]: He leaped to his feet , and restlessly paced the floor .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 7]: `` But you , Grizel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 9]: `` No one could expect it of you !
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 16]: You are born to the position ; have been trained to it all your life .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 12]: You will be one of the great hostesses of the day .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 8]: You are young , brilliant , beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 19]: The ordinary woman looks to love to provide the interest of life , but you have so much .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 16]: The world is at your feet -- '' `` Yes , '' sighed Grizel softly .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 11]: She sat staring before her with rapt , smiling eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 8]: `` And I love it , Martin .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 15]: Pomp and show , and jewels , and beautiful clothes , and -- power !
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 10]: All women do at the bottom of their hearts .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 15]: If they pretend they do n't , it is a humbug and a sham .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 22]: I can see myself living alone in that great house , very rich , very gorgeous ; not a bit lonely !
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 11]: Friends would flock around , more friends than I need .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 3]: Lovers too !
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 7]: for the unattainable is always tempting .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 8]: I could amuse myself very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 9]: `` For heaven 's sake , Grizel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 17]: Martin came to a standstill in front of her chair , his face flushed with protest .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 13]: `` For heaven 's sake speak the truth , and drop pretence !
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 12]: You are going to keep the money , -- very well !
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 30]: but it is not for such reasons as those ... There are precious few illusions left in life , -- do n't kill one of the few that remain !
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 61]: You will keep the money , not out of self-indulgence , but because it was Lady Griselda 's wish , and because there is no stronger claim upon you , until -- until the time arrives , as it _ will _ arrive , when you meet a man -- '' `` Whom I love , '' concluded Grizel calmly .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 27]: She was silent for a moment , then in the deepest , most bell-like notes of her beautiful voice , she added a few soft words .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 6]: `` More than the world !
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 9]: More than riches -- more than my life .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 8]: And then -- '' `` Then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 4]: queried Martin breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 39]: To the end of his life he would hear the echo of Grizel 's voice intoning those thrilling words : `` It will depend upon him , and how brave he can be , '' she returned quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 18]: She rose in her turn , and bending over the desk , drew together the scattered sheets .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 9]: `` How is the novel going , Martin ?
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 7]: What is happening to them all ?
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 18]: I was going to help , but fate intervened , and turned me into a heroine myself .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 13]: Is she happy , your little girl with the hill-tarn eyes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 5]: `` Yes -- no .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 6]: I could n't get on .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 9]: The novel is shelved _ pro tem _ .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 9]: My head was too full of other things .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 51]: Your position , and the problem of the whole situation were so constantly in my mind , that it was a relief to work it out on paper ... Those sheets are the draft of a short story , dealing with such a position -- but not for publication . ''
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 7]: `` I 'm glad of that !
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 14]: I should not like it to be published , '' said Grizel quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 19]: Her cheeks were flushed , she glanced at the sheets with an air at once timid and eager .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 13]: `` It would be interesting to hear what you make of it !
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 5]: May I read ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 7]: `` There 's so little done .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 6]: Just the situation roughed in .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 28]: A girl beautiful , alluring , left with a choice like yours , a man , loving her -- '' `` What kind of a man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 6]: `` Ordinary -- quite ordinary .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 33]: A dull dog , but with a capacity , a hideous capacity for suffering -- '' Grizel subsided on to the swivel chair , and lifted a quill pen from the rack .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 21]: The seriousness , the quiet , almost timid manner of the last few minutes had disappeared as by a flash .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 20]: Now she was composed again , mischievous , audacious ; the dimples dipping in her soft , round cheek .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 21]: She rested her elbows on the desk and nibbled at the pen with a delicious assumption of the professional manner .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 12]: `` Make him a _ little _ bit interesting , Martin !
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 5]: He must be interesting .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 4]: Is he tall ?
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 4]: Is he handsome ?
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 10]: I insist that he is thin and clean shaven .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 27]: And charming , too -- he must certainly be charming , or she would n't have qualms , and at the least she must feel qualms !
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 18]: ... No girl could even imagine giving up a fortune for a dull man with a beard .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 35]: Suppose you made him an author like yourself , so that he had _ something _ to offer on his own accord , such as a reputation which she would be proud to share !
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 28]: Then on _ his _ side would be love , fame , home , and on hers , ambition , wealth -- '' `` Opportunity -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 5]: Grizel stroked her chin .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 5]: `` In a sense !
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 32]: It 's a fact though , Martin , -- humiliating as it is to acknowledge , -- that man is the medium through which a woman discovers every possibility worth having .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 11]: The opportunities which come apart from him are only makeshifts .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 23]: I think we 'll rule out opportunity ... Wo n't he , at least , give her the _ choice _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 5]: `` I think not .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 14]: He is not such an ass as to consider himself worth the sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 27]: The only decent thing he can do is to efface himself , and stand by ready to help her whenever he can be of use . ''
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 4]: commented Grizel again .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 6]: `` Admirable -- but dull .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 8]: _ How _ mad she 'll be !
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 18]: ... It 's just as I said , Martin -- you do n't understand your own sex .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 9]: You need me to write the man-ey bits .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 20]: What he should really do , is to take her in his arms , and say , ` Thirty-thousand-a-year !
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 15]: Thirty thousand _ pounds _ ' -- her light voice suddenly swelled into earnestness .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 16]: but I 've more than that , -- a better offer to make you ! '
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 35]: And he should hold her tight , tight , and laugh , -- a strong man 's laugh , and look in her eyes , and cry : ` _ You are mine _ !
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 11]: All the fortunes in the world could not buy you .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 11]: All the fortunes in the world could not keep you .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 7]: You belong to _ me _ !
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 79]: ... Leave your empty palace , and come _ Home _ , and as you are a true woman , and worth loving , I 'll give you more , far , far more than you ever dreamt , -- ever imagined -- ' '' The soft voice broke : she wheeled suddenly round , hiding her face , but Martin leaped after her , seized her by the arms : `` Grizel -- _ Grizel _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 6]: Her face quivered into tears .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 15]: you _ made _ me do it ; and I vowed I would n't !
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 24]: -- If I 'm worth having , I 'm worth asking , and oh , Martin -- I 've _ waited _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 6]: `` Grizel , Grizel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 4]: cried Martin again .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 19]: She was in his arms , she clung to him , sobbing with the abandonment of a child .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 14]: Grizel , in whose gay eyes he had never yet seen a tear !
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 41]: His grasp , the trembling of his strong frame , the dazed rapture of his face , told their own tale , but as yet he had no words ; it was Grizel who poured out her tale of love .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 11]: `` It was always you -- never any one else .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 12]: And I was happy because I knew that some day -- !
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 12]: And I tried , I _ tried _ to make you !
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 10]: ... Oh , Martin , your arms at last !
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 4]: To rest here !
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 6]: And you talk of money !
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 17]: Oh , now I am rich ; but for years I have starved , -- Martin !
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 3]: Martin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 12]: He strained her close , still dazed , incredulous with joy .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 3]: `` Grizel .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 2]: Beloved !
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 13]: You are my life , but _ can _ I take you ?
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 3]: Dare I ?
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 5]: Is it right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 10]: `` You have no choice -- I 'm here !
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 39]: Martin , I 've loved you since that day I saw you first , standing with little Juliet among the roses ... She 'll be glad , Martin -- there can be no jealousy in a spiritual world .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 18]: She 'll just rejoice that you are happy , and that love has come to you again .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 8]: I 'm so sure of that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 17]: Was there another woman in the world who would have spoken of Juliet at that moment ?
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 28]: Martin flinched , for at the back of his mind still lingered a consciousness of disloyalty , but he loved Grizel the more for her sweet comfort .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 13]: `` I -- I hope she is , '' he said unsteadily .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 17]: `` Grizel you brought me back to life , but I dared not hope for this .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 29]: -- I 'll work like ten men ; I will pour out my life for you like water , but I can never repay -- never be worthy .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 23]: Oh , my beautiful , that you should give up so much for _ met _ The wonder of it stuns me .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 7]: Ought I to let you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 7]: `` You ca n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 10]: I 'm here , '' cried Grizel once more .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 21]: She tilted her face to look up at him , laughing , with the tears still wet on her lashes .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 16]: `` And , oh , Martin , _ wo n't _ it sell your books !
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 5]: Think of the advertisement !
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 12]: Shall we keep it quiet until the new novel is out ?
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 20]: Not _ too _ long , because , you know , I do n't mean to touch that money .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 15]: It would n't be straight , when I 'm going to break the condition .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 17]: There must be no question of staying on in the house , and making a book .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 14]: I am not going back ... '' `` And when -- when ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 4]: queried Martin hotly .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 11]: `` Grizel , will you come to me at once ?
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 5]: Why should we wait ?
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 16]: Everything is ready , if you are really willing to come to this tiny house .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 18]: If it comes to that , I ca n't wait , and I _ wo n't _ !
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 8]: You shall never leave me again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 21]: `` Oh , wo n't I though , '' Grizel laughed softly , pushing him from her with determined hands .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 8]: `` Now -- let 's be sensible !
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 48]: -- Sit over there , and I 'll tell you just what I will do , and what I wo n't -- I wo n't marry you until the old Buddy has been dead for some months , and I wo n't ever live in this house .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 26]: We 'll find another , that looks to the sun , and I 'll furnish it in my own way , with my own fads .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 11]: Buddy gave me lots of treasures for my own rooms .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 15]: They are mine whatever I do , and I must have room for them .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 12]: I have five hundred a year , you know , Martin .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 16]: Shall you be able to afford a better house with an extra five hundred ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 7]: `` I can afford it now .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 27]: You are quite right , it would be better to move , but I 'm not going to touch a halfpenny of your money , sweetheart .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 7]: You must keep that for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 7]: It will seem little enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 13]: `` It takes a great _ deal _ to dress me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 4]: sighed Grizel plaintively .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 12]: `` Ca n't think why , when I 'm so thin .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 5]: And my lame dogs !
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 8]: I must squeeze out something for them .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 12]: there are some good pictures , and curios , and jewels .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 6]: They are mine , too .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 20]: With an occasional visit to the pawnshop , we 'll last out , somehow , till I 'm fifty .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 7]: Wo n't be so long either !
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 4]: But , Martin !
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 14]: in heaven 's name , _ Who _ will order the dinners ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 8]: `` Perhaps -- er -- Katrine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 8]: Martin 's voice sounded nervous and miserable .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 19]: Grizel had thought of Juliet , but she had not mentioned Katrine , the obvious , living difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 19]: He hated to remind her of it ; hated to feel that his home was not his own .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 11]: Perhaps -- er -- Katrine , '' returned Grizel sweetly .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 21]: She smiled into space , her face swept clear of expression , while Martin searched vainly for the hidden thought .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 8]: `` I 'm -- sorry , darling !
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 9]: I hate the thought of a third person .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 25]: It would be so perfect alone , but -- Katrine has given me her youth , and there is nowhere else she could go .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 12]: I should be a cur if I turned her out . ''
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 5]: `` An ungrateful cur .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 6]: We 'll never do it .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 11]: _ I _ would n't , if you could ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 22]: `` And do you think , -- could you manage to be happy with her here , always with us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 18]: `` I think , '' pronounced Grizel judicially , `` I might stand it for a week .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 3]: With grace !
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 10]: Then I 'd poison her with lingering torture . ''
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 33]: She turned to him as she spoke , eyes shining , lips apart , deliberately inviting caress , but when he leaped to take her in his arms she waved him away .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 4]: This is business .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 7]: Let us finish this first . ''
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 6]: `` Oh , Bewildering Woman !
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 9]: Have you the least idea what you mean !
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 13]: Shall I ever understand you , to the end of my life ?
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 18]: It 's a choice then between being a cur , and having you hung as a murderess .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 20]: How do you reconcile that with your statement that _ you _ could n't , if I would . ''
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 10]: `` I would n't , and I sha n't .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 5]: You wo n't either .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 4]: She will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 4]: replied Grizel lucidly .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 9]: `` Oh , Man , do n't worry !
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 8]: Katrine is sensible if you are not !
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 13]: You must be good to her , and generous , and loving .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 5]: Not affectionate , remember !
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 14]: _ laving _ , and things will arrange themselves well for us all .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 5]: You 'll see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 6]: `` I hope I may .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 8]: At present I 'm in a maze .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 14]: I am to say to her -- what am I to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 29]: `` That so long as you have a house there will be a Katrine 's room , and a welcome for her , if she chooses to stay .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 43]: And you are to take no notice -- not the slightest -- of anything she says in reply , but to leave things to time , and her own good sense ... Now we 've wasted quite enough time on silly details .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 5]: Let 's be sensible !
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 10]: -- _ I love you _ , Martin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 4]: ... CHAPTER FOURTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 20]: Grizel came to meet Katrine on her return from the afternoon expedition and drew her into the oak-panelled morning-room .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 12]: Her cheeks were flushed , but her air was serenely unmoved .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 10]: `` What do you think I 've been doing ?
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 12]: I 've been proposing to Martin , '' she announced placidly .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 19]: `` He 's upstairs now , suffering from nervous shock , but he is going to take me !
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 8]: ... Katrine , are you pleased ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 13]: `` But , but , -- _ all _ that money ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 17]: At the moment of certainty , the remembrance of the enormous sacrifice involved swamped everything else .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 7]: Katrine gasped , and Grizel sighed .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 6]: is n't it a bore ?
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 13]: I _ am _ sick about it , '' she said simply .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 32]: Another woman would have rolled her eyes , protested that `` money was as naught when compared with love , '' or some such banality , but that was not Grizel .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 18]: She heaved a second sigh , before recovering her cheerfulness , then added hopefully : `` However !
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 13]: I shall soon be fifty ... Katrine , are you pleased ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 7]: For a moment Katrine was silent .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 13]: Then she bent her tall head and kissed Grizel on the cheek .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 13]: `` Yes , '' she said sweetly , `` I 'm pleased .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 6]: Martin will be happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 12]: `` He is , '' Grizel held on to her hand .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 4]: `` Incredibly happy !
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 14]: And so am I. I 've loved him a long time , Katrine .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 6]: I want you to know .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 8]: There has never been any one else .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 16]: Thank you , dear , for taking care of him for me so well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 4]: Katrine was silent .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 24]: That acknowledgment had a sting , sweet as it was , since it seemed to point out the finality of her own office .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 6]: Martin needed her no longer .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 8]: Grizel would take care of him now .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 11]: She moved away , and sat down in a chair .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 6]: `` I did n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 23]: I should have suspected , I suppose , but you have known each other so long , and Martin showed no sign .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 10]: -- I thought you were just good friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 12]: A gleam shone into Grizel 's eyes ; an impish gleam .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 5]: Her red lips curled .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 18]: `` Martin would have _ jumped _ at me , any time during the last five years !
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 15]: I had only to lift a finger ; but it suited me to wait .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 24]: I had my old Buddy , and I knew he would be there , waiting for me , whenever I was ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 9]: Katrine 's glance was full of wounded dignity .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 6]: `` You may be right .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 4]: Probably you are .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 27]: I begin to think I am very dense , but I do n't think , Grizel , you ought to have _ said _ so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 23]: `` Oh , be hanged to it , _ not _ of course I should n't , but it was your fault !
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 15]: You insinuated that he did n't care , and I wo n't be insinuated !
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 14]: He did -- he does -- he will , he always shall ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 10]: cried Grizel belabouring the table with a startling vigour .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 16]: `` And I 'll kill you dead this moment if you dare to doubt it !
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 13]: For pity 's sake , Katrine , be _ nice _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 12]: `` I _ am _ nice , and I 'm sorry .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 20]: I was jealous , and just for the moment I snapped , but I wo n't do it again .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 30]: I _ did _ suspect during that last visit , and I know he cares , but I was afraid that Lady Griselda 's will might come between you .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 9]: It 's a difficult position for Martin . ''
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 23]: `` It 's difficult for Me , but -- '' Grizel shrugged , `` what ca n't be cured must be endured !
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 29]: I 'm bound to have Martin , so I shall have to put up with being poor , but I am not coming to this house , Katrine .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 14]: It 's too dull and dark , and full of sad old thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 11]: Martin will have to find a new one for me .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 7]: It will be a good thing .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 9]: Keep him quiet while he is waiting . ''
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 4]: Katrine stared blankly .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 24]: The news of the new home hit her like a fresh blow , removing as it did another landmark in the familiar life .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 16]: Despite all her efforts to rejoice unselfishly , a feeling of unutterable loneliness possessed her .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 9]: `` And when will you be -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 3]: `` Married ?
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 12]: In three or four months , I suppose ; probably January .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 30]: I am leaving the town house at once , and going on a round of visits ; Martin will join me sometimes , and be introduced to my friends .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 9]: Then there 'll be the _ trousseau _ !
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 23]: Wo n't it be _ great _ , Katrine , choosing one 's _ trousseau _ for such a scrumptious man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 5]: It was all settled !
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 9]: Grizel had dictated , and Martin had agreed .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 9]: That one eventful interview had settled it all .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 15]: Nothing remained to be arranged but that one insignificant problem , her own future .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 19]: Katrine tasted the bitterness of loneliness ; her strained glance met Grizel 's , soft with understanding love .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 5]: `` I know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 4]: she said quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 7]: `` It 's hard on you .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 25]: Martin will tell you that it will make no difference , but it _ will _ , and you and I wo n't pretend .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 32]: It can never be easy to step down and take a second place where one has been first , and a sister fares poorly when there 's a wife in possession !
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 21]: But Martin is not like other men ; he is _ big _ , big enough to love us both .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 18]: He wants you to live with us ; it was one of the first things he said .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 9]: He thought of you in the -- midst !
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 8]: And he meant it , Katrine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 7]: `` It was good of him .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 12]: I know he meant it , but I could never consent .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 9]: That is the last thing I could do .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 12]: Honestly , Grizel , do you think it is possible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 4]: Grizel pondered thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 6]: `` It would be difficult !
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 7]: Worse for you than for me .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 17]: You 'd be in my way -- sometimes , I 'd be in yours -- always !
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 21]: And if I were cross , I 'd snap , and grumble to Martin , and you , poor lamb !
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 9]: would shut it all up in your heart .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 12]: I think , dear , we wo n't discuss it to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 22]: There 's plenty of time , and I 'm not in the mood to come down to bare , bald facts .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 15]: -- I 'm horribly happy , Katrine , but you must be happy too !
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 10]: It will spoil it all if you are mumpy .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 20]: Think what you want most , and I 'll get it for you , if the skies fall ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 36]: That was kind and sweet , and wise into the bargain , but Katrine did not know what she wanted ; for all her resolution she could not banish the haunting fear of the future .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 19]: She dreaded the first meeting with Martin ; knew in her heart that the dread would be mutual .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 17]: When they did meet an hour later she was amazed at the change on his face .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 25]: He looked pale and shaken ; oppressed , rather than exultant ; but it was the extraordinary revival of youth which struck her dumb .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 23]: The heavy lines seemed wiped away , the eyes looked at her , glad and shy ; the eyes of a boy .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 22]: Katrine held out her hands , but he took her into his arms , and pressed his lips to her forehead .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 6]: `` Grizel has told you !
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 8]: -- I ca n't realise it yet .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 5]: It is too wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 19]: You will be glad for me , dear , for you _ knew _ what has gone before .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 18]: I can never thank you enough for all you have done for me , these eight years .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 9]: And I have been so dull and impatient .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 8]: This will make no difference between us .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 7]: You know that , Katrine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 3]: Katrine smiled .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 23]: It would make just all the difference in the world , but she could not be ungenerous enough to damp his joy .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 7]: It was something that Grizel understood !
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 12]: `` I am glad that you are happy , dear boy .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 5]: I do congratulate you .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 7]: Grizel will be an inspiring wife .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 12]: No one could live with her and find life boring . ''
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 6]: `` Is n't she wonderful ?
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 12]: So beautiful , so fascinating , so -- _ simple _ !
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 11]: I am overwhelmed that she should give up so much .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 9]: That 's the only fly in the ointment .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 9]: I ca n't feel that it is justified .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 30]: You must help me to look out for a house for her , Katrine -- a bright , sunny place , which wo n't be too painful a contrast .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 17]: I can afford a higher rent nowadays , and she must have all that she wants .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 24]: She said to me -- ` Wherever we go there will always be a Katrine 's room , a place for Katrine . '
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 11]: That was one of the first things she said ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 6]: `` Sweet of her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 8]: said Katrine , smiling bravely once again .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 17]: `` I shall be delighted to come as a visitor sometimes , but not to live !
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 7]: Newly married couples are best alone .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 7]: I must move my camp . ''
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 6]: Martin looked troubled and anxious .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 11]: `` For a time perhaps ; just for a time .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 7]: What about that visit to Dorothea ?
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 13]: Would n't it be a good chance to fit that in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 8]: The blood rushed over Katrine 's face .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 4]: she said sharply .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 17]: and there was such unflinching decision in her voice that Martin dared not pursue the subject .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 17]: Was there after all some foundation for Grizel 's romance about a mysterious lover in India ?
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 21]: It seemed like it , since no human girl would blush like that at the mention of a female friend .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 16]: And yet , if there _ were _ a lover , why this emphatic refusal ?
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 19]: Martin gave it up , too engrossed in his own beatitude to feel much interest in the problem .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 9]: we need n't discuss things to-day , dear .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 16]: There 's plenty of time , '' he said , using Grizel 's own words .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 23]: `` Only remember this -- we sha n't be satisfied , either of us , unless _ you _ are happy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 12]: He kissed her again , and passed on to his study .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 33]: From the central place on the mantelpiece the portrait of his dead wife gazed at him with innocent young eyes as it had gazed every day of the last eight long years .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 14]: He stood before it , gazing back , his face working with emotion .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 75]: There had been a time when to return that gaze had been his first impulse upon entering the room , days when he had sat for hours holding the photograph in his hand , had risen from his work to bend over it once and again ; times again when work , and success , and the trend of life had brought a passing forgetfulness , followed by periods of passionate longing and despair .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 16]: He had even thought of ending life itself for the sake of that smiling face .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 25]: Now for months past it had counted for little more than the ornaments by which it was surrounded ... '' _ Juliet _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 7]: he murmured beneath his breath . ''
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 5]: _ Juliet _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 21]: It was a summoning cry , as if he would call the dead girl 's spirit from the unseen world .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 12]: He stretched out his hand as a prisoner at the bar .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 4]: `` Little girl !
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 3]: Little girl !
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 6]: I was faithful to you .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 17]: I gave you all that was mine to give ... '' The wide eyes stared on .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 10]: The lips smiled ; a blank , unanswering smile .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIFTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 11]: `` Cumly , _ September 30 , 19 -- _ .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 13]: `` Dear Captain Blair , `` Martin is engaged to Grizel Dundas .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 22]: She is giving up thirty thousand a year to marry him , and he is going to let her do it .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 40]: I sent Dorothea a cutting from the newspaper , which no doubt you have seen , so I need not enlarge upon the details of a ` millionaire 's extraordinary will , ' and the subsequent ` Romantic engagement .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 13]: Millionaire 's heiress gives up her fortune to marry well-known novelist . '
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 8]: -LRB- See _ Morning Post _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 94]: `` The marriage is to be in January , and we are house-hunting , answering letters of congratulation , looking at patterns , discussing dresses and wallpapers , and hats , and carpets , and what to do with drawing-room walls , and where to find new places for such trifles as sideboards , and buffets , and bookcases , and maiden sisters ... They 'll fit in somewhere , I suppose , and look fairly comfortable and at home in their new positions , but it will take a little settling down !
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 35]: The sideboard was made especially to fit a niche here ; the maiden sister thought she was , too , but they 've both got to move , and look distrustfully upon new corners .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 17]: `` Grizel spent a week with us , then went off on a round of visits .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 34]: She has left the old house and given up her claim to the money at once , so as to avoid all appearance of ` making a purse ' for Martin 's benefit .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 74]: They are preposterously happy , and have each explained to me most carefully that the other is _ so _ anxious for me to live with them , and confessed that from their _ own _ standpoint it might perhaps be better -- for a time at least ... and I have relieved their feelings , poor dears , by proclaiming at once that nothing could bribe me , either sooner or later .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 24]: `` Now , Lonely Man , go down on your knees and thank Providence , fasting , that you are not a woman !
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 15]: You 've done it heaps of times before , but do it once again .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 41]: No man in the world could find himself in such a position as I am in at this moment , at twenty-six , _ past _ , after doing my duty in my appointed place for a painstaking eight years .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 19]: For what have I gained -- in what single way have I prepared myself for the journey ahead ?
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 33]: I can keep house satisfactorily on a satisfactory income , but I shall have no house to keep ; I can train servants , but I shall have no servants to train .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 19]: In any case I could have learned as much in one year , and I 've wasted eight !
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 63]: Not _ wasted _ , you 'll say , as it was an obvious duty to look after Martin 's home , but the fact remains that the years have gone by , and left me at the end , adrift , with the alternative of living on charity , or working for myself , and no work that I can do !
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 14]: Too young to be a housekeeper , too old to begin a training .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 12]: `` It is a big problem , and must be gripped .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 20]: I have many invitations , enough to fill six months at least , but I 've refused them all !
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 23]: I ca n't frivol with that big question unsolved , so I 'm going away quietly by myself to think it out .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 25]: The friends here are keenly interested , and proffer advice , tinctured with consolation as follows : ` Have you ever thought of dispensing ?
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 16]: I knew a girl who had such a good post , and married the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 11]: Of course you will marry , too , dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 28]: -- ` I 'm told there 's quite a big income to be made out of fashion designing ' -LRB- Ca n't draw a line ! -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 17]: ` Then you could go on with it at home if you married a poor man .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 7]: Of course you 'll marry . '
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 16]: ... ` You might be a matron at Eton ... ' -LRB- Might I ? -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 12]: ` How would you like to be a Cookery Demonstrator ? '
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 6]: -LRB- Not at all ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 8]: ` So useful when you marry . '
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 8]: -- ` Charity Organisation Offices need Secretaries .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 20]: Could n't you get your brother to get the Bishop to write to say you 'd be suitable ? '
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 6]: -LRB- Story-teller if he did !
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 4]: I should n't .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 20]: Too much sympathy , and too little judgment , I 'd give them money on the sly ! -RRB- ''
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 4]: ` Dear Katrine !
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 23]: promise me _ one _ thing , -- that you will _ not _ be tempted to go on the stage ! '
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 16]: -LRB- Vicar 's wife having seen me act charades at a mild tea fray . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 44]: ` Wait patiently and trustfully , performing faithfully the little duties that arise , and in good time ... ' -LRB- _ She means the curate _ !! -RRB- `` Oh , dear , it 's funny , but I 'm not laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 7]: I 'm trying not to ay .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 37]: In the horrid , ungrateful way we have , I realise for the first time how well off I 've been ; how comfortable , and snug , and independent , and -- _ necessary _ !
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 8]: That 's the crux of it all .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 11]: I _ was _ necessary -- now I 'm superfluous !
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 39]: here I am , you see , for the first time in twenty-six years really at grips with life , about to experience for myself the troubles and perplexities which so far have been mere matters of hearsay !
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 20]: I growsed and grizzled about the dulness of monotony , now I 'm to taste uncertainty for a change .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 16]: It may be very good for me ; the vicar 's wife says -- confidently !
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 6]: -- that it will be .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 34]: I can imagine myself pouring forth the most inspiriting sentiments to my next-door neighbour , similarly bound , but when _ You _ write to me , _ do n't _ be inspiriting !

Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 24]: She , poor girl , is surprised and hurt ; I , on the contrary , am neither one nor t ` other .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 37]: I knew it ; felt it in my bones ; could have drafted beforehand your reply -- and what 's more , dear , I know precisely by what train of argument the refusal came about !
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 10]: -- I -- Jim Blair -- am the bogie !
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 15]: You are saying to yourself : ` A year ago I should have gone .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 12]: It would have seemed the obvious thing to go to Dorothea .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 24]: Her companionship , and the novelty of the surroundings would have been my best medicine and cure , but now it 's impossible !
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 5]: There 's that man !
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 30]: ... Behind the friendly import of his letters , there 's something else , the which I have strenuously ignored , but I have recognised it all the same .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 35]: If I went out now , leaving Martin married and content , he would think , -- that man would think , -- imagine , -- perhaps even -LRB- he 's audacious enough ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 5]: -- _ Expect _ !
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 10]: ... My presence would give ground to these expectations .

Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 8]: ` But my self-respect will be preserved .

Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 8]: Sooner a hundred times death or life-solitude !
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 5]: The question is settled .

Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 16]: I 'll bet there is , and do n't I wish I could see it !

Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 44]: It 's not a new phase , it began a couple of years ago , when I fell in love with the portrait of a girl 's face , and the portrait of the girl herself , as portrayed in her weekly letters .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 43]: And I diagnosed the position from those letters , and thinks I : -- ` That Martin fellow will soon break loose , he 's coming to life with a rush ; -- that little girl 's billet is about run out .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 11]: She will be needing another , one of these days .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 9]: _ I could give her another _ ! '
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 9]: And I set myself to pave the way .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 60]: `` So there it is , Katrine ; you have it at last -- the full and free confession of a man , who , bereft of force , resorted to guile wherewith to win a wife ... `` I 've been sitting for a quarter of an hour staring at that last word , and _ thinking _ !

Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 19]: It 's no good reminding me that this is only the fourth time I have written to you .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 47]: I know that perfectly well , but will you kindly recollect that I have been sharing in letters written by you for the last six years , besides which , of course , I have had the advantage of hearing constant descriptions from Dorothea 's lips .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 14]: It 's more difficult for you ; do n't think I minimise that !
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 32]: If I seem wanting in consideration it is _ only _ seeming ; I realise only too well how hard it must be for you , poor , proud little girl .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 8]: But you must come , you know !
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 8]: There 's no way out of that .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 5]: Be sensible , Katrine .

Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 17]: You 've shown that in your letters , and are honest enough to admit it now .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 8]: Then why not give me a chance ?
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 40]: Is there anything derogatory to a sane woman 's dignity in meeting , at his own request , and on perfectly free , unconditional terms , a man who loves her , and wishes to make her his wife ?
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 6]: You know there is not .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 20]: -- I ask for no promises ; nothing but the chance to meet you on an ordinary friendly footing .

Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 7]: `` I want you , Katrine !

Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 19]: I want to look down into those deep eyes , and to see them look back into mine .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 14]: I want to stroke that curly hair , and to kiss those lips .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 8]: Most of all I want your lips .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 12]: I hunger to love , and I hunger to be loved .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 17]: The thought of your coming would be like life ; your refusal , blackness like death .

Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 26]: `` I hate the thought of giving you pain ; I hate it so much that I will confess that it gives me pain also .

Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 15]: to see _ you _ too ; to continue our friendship face to face .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 23]: I could waive the shyness , waive the pride ; what I can not do is to waive the _ risk _ !
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 35]: You are a man ; you see , man-like , only the plain , obvious facts ; you do n't realise , as a woman does , the hundred and one difficulties and risks .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 26]: You say that you love me , and you _ do _ love the imaginary Katrine whom you have created out of paper and ink .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 23]: What you do n't realise is how tiny a difference between the real and the imaginary might turn that love to disillusion .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 74]: I 'm honest in my letters ; I do n't pretend ; Dorothea has no doubt told you my faults as well as my virtues ; my photographs are not flattered ; because I am young , and healthy , and alert , I am better-looking in real life , yet if I walked into your room at this moment looking my utmost best , you might still feel a shock of disappointment !
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 29]: You might acknowledge that this woman was handsomer , finer , in every way more personable than you had imagined , but that would not soothe the disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 15]: She had made unto yourself a dream , and she was not your dream !
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 33]: `` Such a little thing can do it , -- a little inconsequent thing , a tiny personal peculiarity , a trick of manner , an expression , a _ look _ .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 40]: It 's not a question of whether it is beautiful and admirable in itself ; it is a question of _ attraction _ , the indefinable , all-important attraction about which there can be no reasoning , no appeal .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 10]: `` We discussed it before -- do you remember ?
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 29]: I told you there was every conceivable reason why I _ should _ have loved one man who wanted me , but there it was , -- impossible !
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 6]: and nothing could alter it .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 53]: `` If we had met in the ordinary way , as strangers , we should have been able to test the presence or absence of this attraction in a simple , natural fashion , -- now , the realisation of its failure on either side must bring with it misery and embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 10]: `` Honestly , I ca n't answer for myself .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 7]: I _ do _ like you !
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 40]: There have been times -- my loneliest times -- when I have almost _ loved _ Jim Blair , -- the Jim Blair of my dreams , but how am I to know that he is anything like you ?
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 39]: The face which looks at me from beneath the white topee in the various groups which Dorothea has sent is vague enough to lend itself to mental adaptation , the real one may be a very different thing !
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 45]: `` If I could see you for even five minutes , face to face , I could tell if it were _ possible _ ; but as things are , I ca n't , and I dare not cross the world on the chance .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 23]: I must find a niche at home , and work hard , and try to be of some use in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 32]: Perhaps some day , say on your next furlough , we may meet , if you still wish it , but in the meantime it would be better not to write .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 12]: After what you have said , I should feel it unfair .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 10]: The best thing you can do is to forget .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 7]: `` Do n't think me unkind .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 46]: It seems brutal to write so coldly , especially to-day , when I have just received a letter from Captain Bedford in Egypt , and with it the most wonderful old brass tray -- quite the finest specimen of its kind that I have seen .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 19]: He explains that it is your commission , and sends me quite a genealogical tree of its history .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 9]: From his letter he sounds a charming man .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 7]: He says he returns in March .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 34]: If I had been coming out , we might have travelled by the same boat ... `` Oh , Jim , I _ wish _ I could come -- I wish I could !
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 13]: It 's hard work looking on , and feeling eternally number three .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 16]: Do you think I do n't want to love too , and to be loved ?
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 18]: Do you think it is easy to say ` no , ' and throw away the chance ?
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 8]: If only I could think it right !
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 20]: It is not pride which is hindering me , truly it is n't , it is more like cowardice .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 31]: We have defied convention , and as a result have created an impossible situation , and I shrink from the probable pain and disillusion of a meeting in the flesh .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 27]: Your letters have meant a great deal to me ; I do n't know how I should have come through the last few months without them .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 19]: For my own sake I should not regret the episode , but it has been hard on you .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 17]: At the bottom of my heart I guessed all along that it would lead to this .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 22]: I _ pretended _ that I did not , and deliberately shut my eyes , and now I must pay up .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 12]: I care for you too much to run any more risks .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 13]: I wo n't write again , and please do n't answer this .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 27]: You will hear of my doings through Dorothea , and I shall always care to hear about you ; so it is not like saying good-bye .

Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 15]: Every word that you write only makes me the more fixed in my determination .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 25]: I can understand your shyness and your pride , but I 'm hanged if I can understand all this business about disillusion and humiliation .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 26]: If you find on investigation that I 'm not the man for you , I shall regret it , but I shall feel no humiliation .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 4]: Why should I ?
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 22]: The fact that I do not please your taste , makes me no less a man , nor worthy of esteem .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 55]: If -- by a strength of imagination -- I were disappointed in you , the situation would , I admit , be more charged , but being ` only a man , ' I emphatically deny your assertion that the sentiment which you have evoked could be evaporated by any outward feature or trait .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 21]: My dream woman is very dear , but , have no delusions on the point -- she is not perfect !
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 9]: I have created for myself no plaster saint .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 34]: You have plenty of faults , my dear , but there is this big difference between them , and those of any woman in existence -- they are _ Katrine 's _ faults !
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 21]: `` I have given my word to speak no word beyond those of friendship for three months after your arrival .

Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 6]: You sha n't be troubled .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 21]: After that three months ' trial , I 'll take your answer as final , and leave you in peace .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 13]: I 've no desire to badger a woman into being my wife .

Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 20]: Putting myself out of the question , I think you will come , and I 'll tell you why .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 16]: It would be rank selfishness on your part to stay in England for the present !
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 31]: Martin has had a rough time of it , but life is opening out for him afresh , and if you love him you wo n't stand in his way .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 22]: How do you suppose he will feel if you are wandering about from boarding-house to boarding-house , or working among strangers ?
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 34]: The thought of you will be a continuous shadow over his sun , and that 's what you have no right to be , if there is any legitimate way of avoiding it .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 21]: Real happiness is a rare thing , it is holy ground , which ought to be sacred from our touch .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 20]: I 'd as soon cut off my right hand as cloud a man 's joy in his new-made wife .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 8]: `` And after Martin there 's Dorothea .

Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 6]: The boy is delicate also .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 12]: There 's a talk of sending him home to his grandmother .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 31]: Dorothea wo n't leave Middleton ; she considers that he needs her more than the child , and I think she is right , but it will be a pill .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 18]: There 's nothing on earth which could cheer and help her more than a visit from you .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 9]: She has written to you again I know .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 7]: This time you must not refuse .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 8]: The climate up here is quite reasonable .

Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 11]: He is a good thirty-five , staid , and level-headed .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 8]: It 's quite conventional , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 7]: I never know about these things .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 14]: Book your passage in good time , and cheer Dorothea by the news .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 6]: Write at once , no !

Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 18]: I hope it 's the former , because , to be candid , I 'm chortling myself .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 7]: Oh , I 'm so glad !
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 12]: I wanted so _ badly _ to say ` yes . '
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 27]: It _ was _ clever of you to make it appear so clearly my duty to do just the one thing I wanted above all others !
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 3]: `` Hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 8]: For a whole year I am free .

Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 11]: `` Grizel is the most bracing person to shop with .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 57]: When you think it 's extravagant , she calls it cheap , and when you are wondering if you _ dare _ have one , she orders a dozen , and just for once in a way , when you 've been careful all your life , it _ is _ lovely to go a bust .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 19]: Besides -- `` My bridesmaid 's kit is Grizel 's present , and seems stretching to immense proportions .

Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 16]: Do you think the regiment will give some function to let me show them off ?
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 23]: Now that my own future no longer casts its shadow over the whole landscape , I am immensely enjoying the engaged couple .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 27]: They are so deliriously gay and young , and happy and hopeful ; and the nice part about it is -- it is going to last !
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 36]: I feel _ sure _ it will , for through his long experience of sorrow and loss Martin has learned how to give the one all-important thing that is necessary to a woman 's happiness .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 9]: Have you the slightest idea what it is ?
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 35]: You will smile at the sentiment of women , and say ` Love , of course , ' but it is n't love , at least it is not necessarily included in that term .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 16]: Many a man honestly loves his wife , and yet succeeds in making her miserable .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 17]: it is just a simple , homely quality without which the grandest of passions is incomplete !
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 4]: _ Tenderness _ !
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 22]: Tenderness means kindness and understanding , and sympathy , and imagination , and patience -- above all , _ patience _ !
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 45]: When a man is in love he thinks a woman perfect , but she is n't , she is an irrational , inconsequent creature , whose mate will have need of patience every day of his life , and sometimes many times a day .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 38]: Of course there _ do _ exist female paragons , calm , correct creatures , with smooth hair and chiselled features , who are always serene and self-contained , but then they are also independent of tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 4]: This grows complicated !
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 35]: I 'd better drop pretence and confess at once that when I talk generalities I really mean You and Me , the two people who are at the back of _ all _ generalities !
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 36]: `` I am erratic and variable ... On Tuesday , for no tangible cause , I feel bubbling over with happiness ; on Wednesday , for an equally logical reason , I crave for death .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 8]: On occasions I can be exasperatingly contrary .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 20]: I know it all the time , and am furious with myself , but that only makes me worse !
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 22]: On after reflection I either pray and fast , or in brazen fashion excuse myself on the score of electric influences !
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 8]: After all , why should n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 31]: We are the most sensitive of machines , and if climatic disturbances affect the wires at a distance of thousands of miles , why should _ We _ pass unscathed ?
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 27]: I sometimes think we are too hard on our own moods and tempers , but they are trying enough in any case for the other person .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 28]: The question of the hour is this -- Could _ You _ be tender to _ Me _ ??? `` Only four weeks and I 'm off !
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 26]: It will be more convenient for me to leave directly after the wedding , and if ` twere done , ` twere well done quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 36]: Grizel 's _ trousseau _ is reaching the acute stage , and I thought I was busy enough helping her , without starting a second on my -- `` What _ am _ I saying !
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 5]: I must be mad .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 20]: You understand that I trust to that three months ' truce , and that I promise nothing -- nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 7]: I only _ hope _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 7]: _ Au revoir _ , Jim .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 25]: To-morrow I shall be tearing my hair for writing all this , but the mail will have gone ... It will be too late .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 3]: `` Katrine .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 3]: `` P.S. .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 15]: A happy new year , Jim , _ Will _ it be happy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVENTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 11]: `` Cumly , _ January 7 , 19 -- _ .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 18]: `` Dear Captain Blair , `` This follows quickly to retract everything that I said last week !
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 34]: If I had not already spent so much on cables , and if it were not so difficult to explain , I should have sent a flying order to burn that effusion unread !
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 12]: It makes me hot to think of the things I wrote .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 46]: I am not usually so heady and bold , but the excitement was too much for me , the brilliant shifting of the scene , the finding myself of a sudden a leading lady , instead of a forlorn super , -- the new clothes !
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 19]: -- `` Honestly , I believe the clothes had as much to do with it as anything else !
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 32]: Do you remember a character in a book a year or two ago saying that the consciousness of being perfectly dressed imparted a peace and joy which religion can never bestow !
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 29]: I have quoted that saying to many women in turns , and each and all on the spur of the moment exclaimed ` _ How true _ ! '
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 10]: though the serious-minded ones tried to back out afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 23]: I have wondered sometimes if the difference in temperament between the two sexes is n't after all mainly a matter of clothes .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 35]: A man goes to a decent tailor , puts on a well-cut tweed or dress suit , arranges his tie with a certain amount of skill , and -- kings can do no more !
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 72]: Never in all his life does he experience the agonising sensation of entering a room and realising at a glance that he is all wrong , while the right thing is hanging idly at home in the wardrobe ; never is his heart torn by the consciousness of inferiority , or the necessity of putting up with a second best , when the first is a dream of beauty and becomingness .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 22]: He knows none of these trials , but then , on the other hand , he has none of the thrills !
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 57]: Who could be thrilled by an old black coat , but when it is the exact shade of blue that matches your eyes , when the lines of the skirt make you blush at your own grace , when the trimmings are dreams , and the very linings a picture , then , oh , man !
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 32]: the elation of it mounts to the feminine head like wine , and no mere male can understand ... `` I imagined until now that I was superior to such folly .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 23]: I never cared much about clothes , but then , as Grizel brutally explains , that was because I never had none !
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 32]: Now I am as susceptible as the rest ... `` All this chatter about clothes is simply to cover my embarrassment , because I do n't know what else to say !
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 20]: `` You must all have made very sure of me , to write to Captain Bedford as you did !
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 18]: ... I had the kindest letter from him yesterday , promising every help _ en voyage _ .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 22]: I am to tip the steward to arrange that he has a seat next to me at table from Aden onward .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 22]: I shall have found my sea legs by then , I suppose , and be able to turn up for meals .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 38]: He -- Captain Bedford -- is n't too well , I 'm afraid , for he talks of feverish turns which ca n't be good in his condition , but there seems no doubt of his return .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 8]: I shall cross-question him -LRB- artfully ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 12]: about you , and expect to pick up some useful information .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 10]: Do n't expect me to write again before sailing .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 10]: I am too busy and -- _ shy _ !
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 31]: and when I _ do _ arrive , please arrange to meet me first among a crowd of people , and look the other way hard whenever I 'm looking .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 15]: I 'm capable of coming home by the first boat if I 'm druv !
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 4]: `` Katrine . ''
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 12]: `` P.S. -- I have no money ; not a cent .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 18]: ` My face is my fortune , ' plus a pearl necklet , and a loving heart !
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 17]: The situation is so unusual that I think I am justified in being personal and inquisitive .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 12]: Here 's an examination paper for you on certain burning points .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 25]: You will have time to post answers to Port Said , and if unsatisfactory I can always drown myself , or -- turn back !
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 12]: `` Question I. `` Do your ears stick out ? '' ''

Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 6]: Wife all at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 21]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ `` My Dearest Katrine , `` If I write at once I shall just catch you before you sail .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 51]: When you are here , when I see you face to face , and after the period of truce is over , I shall tell you how I felt when that cable arrived yesterday , and I realised that in less than three months we should meet in the flesh .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 17]: I have felt a new man since that hour , and Dorothea says I look it .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 33]: She had already written to Bedford -LRB- at my instigation -RRB- saying that you would probably be coming by the _ Bremen _ , and giving him elaborate instructions on your behalf .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 10]: No fear that he wo n't carry them out !
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 2]: Heavens !
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 6]: the luck some fellows have .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 33]: What would I give for the opportunity of ` looking after you ' through those long , lazy days , but I 'm not jealous , Katrine -- do n't imagine that !
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 18]: Whatever you may decide in the future , you 'll play fair to me in the present .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 27]: I asked for my chance , and you 've given it by agreeing to come out , so for the time being I hold the field .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 10]: I trust you utterly , with a glad heart .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 29]: `` This will be the last letter you get from me , unless perhaps a line at Aden , and I can write no more to-day , dear .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 9]: My heart is too full ... CHAPTER EIGHTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 35]: The new house had been found ; a sunny , airy , sufficiently spacious house , and the bride-elect having graciously expressed her approval , an army of workmen were busy with the decorations .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 53]: Grizel had come to pay a flying visit to The Glen to superintend their efforts , explaining that though she possessed sufficient strength of character to bear with equanimity such trial as Providence might please to send , to live with a wrong shade of paint passed the limits of her endurance .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 44]: `` If it were even the tiniest degree wrong , I 'd nag at Martin till his life was a burden , '' she announced , smiling the while the slow , imperturbable smile which gave so emphatic a contradiction to her words .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 10]: `` But it would n't be my fault ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 44]: protested Martin , trying to show sufficient distress at the threat to satisfy Grizel 's sense of dignity , but his thanks for the effort were a grimace , and an emphatic : `` It will _ always _ be your fault ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 7]: which silenced him once for all .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 31]: Grizel indeed was in her most irresponsible mood , scandalising Katrine by refusing to be serious even on that most solemn of subjects , the ordering of Martin 's food .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 10]: `` I could n't possibly think of food beforehand .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 4]: It 's disgusting !
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 16]: If I knew what was coming to table , I could n't eat a bite !
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 6]: The cook must do it .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 7]: What are cooks for ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 18]: _ Plain _ cooks at under thirty pounds a year do n't consider menus within their province .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 15]: They stare into space , and twirl their fingers while _ you _ plan .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 8]: And even then they need directing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 3]: Grizel sighed .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 11]: `` But I do n't _ like _ plain cooks !
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 7]: I 'll have a fancy one .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 20]: Forty pounds , -- fifty -- whatever she asks , and a kitchen maid to do the work . ''
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 14]: `` Then , '' prophesied Katrine gloomily , `` Martin will be ruined .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 9]: She 'll fry up all his royalties . ''
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 10]: `` I 'll tell her she 's not to .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 35]: And besides , '' Grizel 's voice swelled with importance ; she had caught the sneer on Katrine 's lips at those first words , and now she had a really sensible addenda . ''
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 7]: _ I 'll bribe her _ !
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 4]: In reverse ratio .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 11]: The smaller the bills , the bigger the bribe . ''
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 16]: `` Then , '' pursued Katrine relentlessly , `` she 'll give you bad qualities .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 15]: Salt butter ; dripping instead of lard ; cheap jams ; rank tea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 7]: `` Oh , my gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 17]: Grizel grimaced again , more violently than before , but the next moment she smiled triumphant .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 7]: `` I 'll buy a vidder !
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 15]: A gentle , domesticated little vidder who 's redooced , and seeks a home .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 16]: She shall have two rooms , and kind treatment , and be paid by results .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 10]: Good food , small bills , -- big salary .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 11]: Small food , big bills , -- out she goes !
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 8]: Do n't tell me I ca n't !
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 8]: There are _ thousands _ of vidders .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 8]: It will be a pious deed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 16]: `` And what , '' queried Katrine the practical , `` will you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 6]: `` Interfere , of course !
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 5]: What d'you expect ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 21]: Grizel turned her head toward her _ fiance _ , who had been a delighted listener to the discussion . ''
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 8]: _ And _ make love to Martin .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 10]: I sha n't have time for anything else . ''
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 21]: Katrine left the room , head in air , whereupon Martin made haste to take his bride in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 4]: `` Happy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 15]: she asked softly , tilting her head so as to look into his face .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 4]: `` Content ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 21]: `` Ah , Grizel , not quite ... When I have you always ... when you are my wife ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 9]: `` No qualms at all -- no doubt ?
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 15]: Because there 's still time ... Sure you realise exactly what you are getting ?
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 8]: An expensive wife , impracticable and lazy .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 5]: And I 'm twenty-eight .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 5]: I sha n't change .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 12]: And not a bit clever , except in one way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 7]: `` What way , Grizel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 13]: `` You know -- '' `` I want to be told ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 11]: The golden eyes grew dark , the pale face glowed .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 7]: Grizel 's lover needed no telling .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 24]: Not one woman in a thousand could love like this soft , sweet thing , whose outer appearance was so calm and still .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 26]: She who had contrived to love with tenderness a cantankerous old woman , lavished a very flood of devotion on the man of her choice .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 35]: His starved nature absorbed it like a thirsty plant , but his delight in her was still fearful , incredulous ; the sudden transformation of his life had the perilous radiance of a dream .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 11]: The engagement had been a veritable nine days ' wonder .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 24]: English newspapers had published more or less accurate life histories of the interesting couple ; American journals had excelled themselves in imaginative details .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 30]: Blurred caricature portraits of the prospective bride and bridegroom had appeared side by side , to the amusement of the one , and the helpless fury of the other .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 38]: The outer world labelled Grizel , fool , and Martin , knave ; envied the unsuspecting distant relations , to whom would come the news of a great inheritance ; and then promptly , mercifully , forgot .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 44]: Friends also ceased in due time to forward notes of ostensible congratulation , behind which the real amaze was plainly stamped ; only one effect was of any lasting nature , and regarding this Martin felt an odd mixture of chagrin and elation .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 28]: His agent reported a large increase in the sale of his books , and publishers bid against each other for the privilege of publishing his new novel .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 32]: The artist in him resented so spurious a success ; the lover rejoiced in the prospect of increased prosperity which would make it possible to provide more luxuries for his bride .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 34]: Grizel was whole-hearted in her choice of love rather than riches , but when one has been accustomed to think in thousands , it is difficult to grasp the importance of fractional amounts .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 64]: She thought it absurd to weigh the matter of an extra hundred a year in so important a matter as the rent of the house in which one would have to live ; she took for granted the existence of a carriage , as simply as that of a table , and had not dimly imagined the possibility of existence without a maid .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 41]: Martin did not delude himself that the financial future was free from difficulty , but as for years past he had been living well below his income , he was prepared to meet the exigencies of a period of adjustment .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 35]: Meantime Grizel 's suggestion of the `` vidder '' seemed an admirable solution , and he told himself cheerfully that with such a check on household expenses , things could not go far wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 42]: In a few years ' time Grizel would have adapted herself to the new conditions and be able to take over the reins ; in the meantime he was well content that she should devote herself to a more attractive role !
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 68]: But one shadow had clouded the sun of Martin 's content , and within the last weeks that also had been removed , for after having obstinately refused all overtures from himself and her friends , after proclaiming by day or by night that she must go out into the world and fight her own battles , Katrine had shown a sudden and mysterious _ volte-face _ .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 40]: One Thursday morning she had retired upstairs to digest her Indian mail , and half an hour later , knocking at his study door , had announced her intention of cabling an immediate acceptance of the Middletons ' invitation !
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 33]: She was trembling as she spoke , and her eyes were moist , but Martin did not need to be told that it was joy and not sorrow which caused her emotion .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 44]: A woman would have pondered the why and wherefore of the sudden change ; Martin merely told himself with a sigh of relief that she had `` come to her senses , '' embraced her affectionately , and proffered money for the cable .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 61]: Later on he came to the conclusion that Katrine must all along have intended to accept , and had been merely indulging in a little feminine fuss , since it appeared all cut and dried that she was to be looked after _ en voyage _ by a member of Middleton 's regiment , now invalided in Egypt , Well !
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 10]: everything was turning out in the most delightful fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 24]: In a hill station , which was a health resort even in the hottest months , the question of climate was practically non-existent .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 35]: After the marriage Katrine would stay behind superintending final arrangements in the new home , then travel overland to Marseilles , where he and Grizel would meet her and give her a good send-off .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 65]: A visit of a year was mentioned , but when a girl so handsome and striking went out to India , one could never tell ... `` Perhaps she 'll marry this Bedford , '' soliloquised Martin happily , Jim or Bedford , what did it matter , so long as he was a good , straight fellow , and made the girl happy !
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 6]: Part 2 -- Chapter XIX .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 19]: Katrine came slowly up the companion-way , and looked around the deck in search of her labelled chair .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 19]: It was ten o'clock in the morning , and the sun was blazing out of a cloudless sky .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 10]: Yesterday in Marseilles it had been grey and chill .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 17]: The only cheerful thing had been Grizel 's face , fresh , pink-cheeked , unashamedly aglow .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 13]: The secret of her happiness was patent to the most casual eye .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 39]: Tired men and work-worn women looked at her as she passed , and glowed in sympathy , and from her their glance passed on to the tall man with the deep-set eyes , who walked by her side .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 21]: Martin 's happiness was as great as his wife 's , but man-like he was at pains to conceal it .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 34]: The consciousness of being observed was enough to extinguish his smiles , and Katrine was amusedly conscious that he was making an effort to appear depressed at the prospect of her own departure .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 68]: The newly-married pair had accompanied her on board the steamer , armed with flowers , with fruit , with scent and bonbons , with cushions and medicines , until the small cabin had been blocked to overflowing , and the passengers who had braved the rigours of the Bay , debated among themselves as to the identity of the handsome girl who had such a luxurious send-off .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 21]: Standing on the deck amid the roar and bustle of approaching departure , the three had spoken their farewell words .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 12]: `` I wo n't say good-bye , '' Grizel declared . ''
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 5]: _ En avant _ !
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 2]: Katrine !
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 8]: There 's a good time coming ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 9]: But the tears stood in Katrine 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 20]: She was leaving the known , the safe , and the sure , and sailing forth into the unknown .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 9]: Fear seized her , and with it regret .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 23]: `` If -- if I come home soon ... You wo n't be cross if I turn up like a bad penny ?
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 13]: You will take me in , until I find some work ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 9]: `` My dear girl , you know it !
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 22]: If you are not happy ; if you do n't want to go , come back with us _ now _ !
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 11]: Never mind the clothes ... We 'll arrange all that .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 21]: You sha n't go one step against your will ... '' Grizel laid her hand on her husband 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 16]: Her cool , calm voice was like a tonic , bracing the hearers into composure .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 37]: `` She is going of her _ own _ will , and if _ You _ would take her back with you now , _ I wo n't _ , so you can choose between us !
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 23]: We 're ready for you , Katrine dear , when you 've tried it , and grown tired , but not before .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 12]: I 'm just afraid we 'll have too long to wait !
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 6]: ... Now smile this minute !
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 15]: Would you leave me stranded on a foreign shore with a lugubrious spouse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 27]: Then Katrine laughed , and they kissed and embraced , and Grizel slipping her hand through her husband 's arm , drew him towards the gangway .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 4]: `` Belovedest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 5]: she whispered softly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 7]: _ I 'm here _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 37]: and Katrine looking down from her towering perch watched the lift of the charming face , caught the swift , mutual glance , and realised that no outside anxiety could mar the perfection of that love .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 13]: She sighed , but the predominant sensation was relief , not pain .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 8]: A chapter of her life was turned .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 9]: She thanked God that it closed in sunshine !
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 13]: And now it was the morning of her first day at sea .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 46]: Tired after her long overland journey , she had retired to bed while her fellow-passengers were at dinner , and had slept so soundly in her narrow bunk that on waking there had been a moment 's blank bewilderment before she could realise her position .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 35]: A stewardess stood before her bearing the early cup of tea ; on the berth opposite a gaunt , grey-haired woman was sitting , cup in hand , staring at her with curious eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 5]: `` Mornin ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 4]: she said tersely .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 4]: `` First introduction .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 10]: You were asleep when I turned in last night .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 7]: Glad you do n't snore ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 3]: `` Goodness !
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 6]: I never thought of that .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 4]: How awful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 8]: exclaimed Katrine , laughing in her turn .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 10]: She sipped at her cup , and grimaced eloquently .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 3]: `` Ugh .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 4]: What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 5]: Tea or coffee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 9]: `` Mixed , '' replied the other gravely .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 7]: `` To suit all tastes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 7]: She drank again with apparent enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 9]: `` Always drink it myself out of principle .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 14]: Charge you too much to leave out a meal ... First trip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 13]: `` First time in my life I ever slept in a berth .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 10]: I 'd no idea they were so comfortable . ''
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 24]: The grey-haired lady fumbled beneath her pillow , placed a pair of spectacles on her nose , and stared across with frank curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 4]: `` Bride ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 7]: `` I beg your pardon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 6]: `` Unnecessary , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 6]: It 's my tenth voyage .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 5]: Met shoals of brides .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 6]: You look the type . ''
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 7]: Katrine ostentatiously displayed her left hand .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 8]: `` I hope that 's a compliment .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 19]: As a matter of fact , I am going out to join some friends in North Bengal . ''
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 4]: `` Missionaries ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 12]: Katrine jumped till the cup rattled in a threatening manner . ''
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 4]: _ No _ !
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 4]: Cer-tainly not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 13]: said the grey-haired woman , and scraped the sugar from her cup .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 32]: `` I 'm sorry for _ any _ girl , '' she announced tentatively between the spoonfuls , `` who goes out to one of those lonely plantations ... No fun .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 3]: No chances .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 8]: Fifty times worse than at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 5]: `` Is that so ?
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 2]: Really ?
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 5]: I 'm sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 11]: Katrine shook her head , and endeavoured to look perturbed .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 25]: The good sleep , the novelty of the surroundings , the glimpse of blue through the port-hole , combined to produce an exhilarating effect .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 25]: She felt gay and mischievous , too light-hearted to resent her companion 's curiosity , but none the less determined not to gratify it .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 24]: She ate bread and butter , and sipped at the compound liquor in silence , the while the spectacled eyes continued their scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 16]: `` Odd thing -- the Indian climate , '' continued the stranger in ruminating fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 5]: `` Changes the constitootion .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 18]: Never know _ which _ way you 'll go , but it 's bound to be one .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 8]: _ You 'll _ grow fat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 4]: That roused Katrine .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 11]: Her head twisted round , indignant colour stained her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 7]: `` I _ sha n't _ !
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 20]: I should n't dream of such a thing ... Far more likely -- '' `` Excuse me -- no !
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 5]: I 've had experience .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 10]: Some dwindle to skeletons , but not your build .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 10]: Niece of mine sailed with me two years ago .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 3]: Twenty-two-inch waist .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 8]: Put on a stone in three months .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 5]: All her bodices altered .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 11]: Two stones more since then , and a double chin .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 6]: Looks like her own mother .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 18]: But of course if you take much exercise ... Some of the civil appointments are quite good .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 19]: If you keep horses , and ride each morning -- '' `` Just so , '' assented Katrine .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 5]: `` Just so . ''
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 32]: She was discomposed by the prospect of obesity , the more so as Dorothea 's excessive thinness would seem to confirm the assertion that the climate was extreme in its effects .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 33]: A moment passed in the earnest consideration of the disadvantages of fat _ versus _ lean , then the grey-haired one plunged boldly into autobiography : `` My husband was a judge .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 2]: Mannering .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 2]: Bombay .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 13]: Thousand a year pension , but not a penny to leave behind .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 18]: No use any one making up to _ met _ Got a boy in the Indian Cavalry .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 9]: Going out now to pay him a call .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 3]: Nice boy .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 11]: Was , at least , when I saw him last .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 8]: May have changed , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 9]: Katrine 's looks became suddenly infused with interest .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 9]: `` Then our destinations are not far apart .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 14]: Do you know -- have you any friends in the -- Regiment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 8]: `` Not -- one -- soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 25]: said the stranger emphatically , and in a manner which seemed to imply that nothing would induce her to consent to such an entanglement .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 13]: She hunched up the pillows behind her back , and continued forcibly .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 5]: `` Detest the military .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 3]: Always did .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 18]: Quite against my wishes that the boy went in ; but there I am -- silly fool !
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 21]: proud as any one of 'em , when I see him dressed up ... Stinting myself for his gold lace !
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 34]: Well , well , we 're all fools at heart , my dear , every man jack of us , and women too ... When are you going to take your bath ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 8]: The catechism was over for the moment .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 42]: Katrine staggered out of bed , robed herself in a dainty blue dressing-gown and smoothed her dark locks , uneasily conscious that not a ribbon , a lace , or a French knot itself escaped the scrutiny of the watching eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 35]: When she returned , fresh and rosy , her companion departed in her turn , and returned just as Katrine was finishing her hair in time to announce briskly : `` Warm sunny day !
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 7]: Seen three girls in white frocks .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 9]: Sport one yourself , and cut 'em out !
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 9]: Great thing to make a good impression ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 25]: `` I do n't care , '' -- began Katrine haughtily , then the spirit of the hour choked the words in her throat .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 12]: `` Yes , after all , I _ do _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 18]: she laughed , and kneeling before her cabin trunk lifted a fresh white frock from the tray .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 15]: `` I 'll put on this , and do credit to our cabin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 4]: `` Cheers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 14]: cried the stranger , and with a pleasing frankness extracted her false teeth .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 8]: Katrine mounted the steps to the deck .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 44]: There was still half an hour to spare before breakfast , but she wished it had been twice as long , as she paced slowly down the shining deck , and tasted for the first time the deep salt brine of the breeze .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 31]: Only fifteen hours before she had shivered in rain and chill ; now the sun was shining out of a cloudless sky , and the breeze was warm and sweet .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 6]: The exhilaration of it all !
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 48]: The great vessel in its shining order , the air , the spray , the lap of the great green flood , the kaleidoscopic procession of passengers , strolling like herself , bareheaded , white-robed , revelling in the first taste of heat after the Northern cold !
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 23]: Katrine was loath to tear herself away from the fascinating scene , but the duty of interviewing the steward lay before her .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 20]: She descended , armed with a golden key , proffered her request , and met with a gracious consent .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 5]: Nothing could be easier .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 32]: A party of three were landing at Port Said ; Miss Beverley could be given a place at the same table , and Captain Bedford could also be accommodated on arrival .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 5]: So far so good !
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 50]: Katrine ate her breakfast with an enjoyment heightened by her fast of the night before , came to the conclusion that she should not grieve over the departure of the Port Said trio , and armed with a book and a sunshade , mounted once more to the deck .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 18]: The first business was to find her chair , and a difficult search it promised to be .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 33]: She was wandering aimlessly to and fro reading the names attached to the backs of the serried rows , when a voice spoke in her ear : `` Can I help ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 3]: it asked .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 11]: `` You are looking for a chair , I think .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 18]: If you give me the name , I 'd be delighted to find it for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 16]: The speaker was a tall , strikingly handsome man of some twenty-four or five years .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 23]: Katrine had noticed him at an adjacent table during the lengthy breakfast ; had also been conscious that he had noticed herself .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 23]: She expressed her thanks , and in an incredibly short time the chair was produced , and placed in a comfortable position .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 8]: `` May I bring mine alongside ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 9]: enquired the stranger , and Katrine bowed assent .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 11]: She had anticipated the request , and was gratified thereby .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 39]: On shipboard one need not trouble about conventional introductions , and it would be agreeable to have a companion who knew the ropes , and who could enliven the morning with agreeable tit-bits of information concerning her fellow-travellers .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 46]: She smiled therefore at the handsome fellow in her most friendly manner ; whereupon he smiled back , and glibly burst into autobiography : `` Austin Murray is my name , England is my nation , Engineering is my game , Bombay my destination . ''
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 10]: `` Thanks very much , '' returned Katrine gravely .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 25]: `` Katherine Beverley is my name -- '' `` Any relation to the author chap who robbed that poor girl of her cash ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 5]: `` I am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 13]: The terse affirmative had a disturbing effect on Mr Murray 's composure .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 15]: He had evidently not expected it , and had the grace to look confused .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 15]: `` I say , you know , I did n't know ... ` Pologise !
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 9]: Did n't really mean it like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 12]: He pondered , and pondering was struck with a brilliant inspiration .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 6]: `` I _ say _ !
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 10]: The couple who came on board with you yesterday !
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 25]: You do n't mean to say -- '' `` I did n't mean to say , '' corrected Katrine calmly , `` but yes !
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 5]: you have guessed correctly .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 10]: That was my brother and his wife ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 5]: _ Brother _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 15]: Mr Murray whistled softly , but made no attempt to apologise a second time .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 14]: Katrine diagnosed him as being little in the habit of eating humble pie .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 34]: `` I _ say _ , '' he exclaimed once more , `` if a girl like that gave up all that for _ me _ , I should be ruined for life !
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 3]: Bowled over !
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 5]: Eaten up with conceit .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 5]: She 's a corker !
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 11]: _ Is n't _ she a corker , now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 12]: `` She is generally considered to be excessively -- corking ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 16]: agreed Katrine demurely , and then suddenly she laughed ; a gay , light-hearted laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 6]: What a change it was !
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 61]: To sit on this wide shining deck among a crowd of strangers , to exchange frivolities with one of the handsomest of men , also a stranger , to feel the sun beat on her neck , on her outstretched feet , to have nothing to do , and nothing to care for , but her own ease and enjoyment !
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 38]: She laughed , leaning her head against the back of her chair ; the sun flecked her hair with gold , the clear healthy tints of her skin seemed to gain in colour in the dancing light .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 30]: Mr Murray hitched his chair a degree nearer , and spoke in a lower voice : `` I say ... You do n't know any one on board ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 4]: `` Not yet .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 3]: No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 19]: `` How would it be if -- what would you say to fixing up a steamship flirtation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 7]: Katrine straightened herself with a jerk .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 8]: `` I _ beg _ your pardon !
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 15]: I do n't quite understand -- '' `` Oh , it 's simple enough .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 9]: Always do it myself on a long voyage .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 42]: Much more satisfactory and amusin ' than just trustin ' to luck ... Spot some one you like , and agree to sit together on deck , be partners at sports , moon about , -- _ under _ the moon !
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 30]: -- confide your woes , comfort and soothe , sentimentalise a bit -- especially towards the end -- '' Katrine threw him a glance , beneath lids haughtily dropped .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 3]: `` Tha-anks .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 5]: It sounds very interesting .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 5]: And then -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 6]: `` Oh , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 6]: Mr Murray twisted his moustache .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 18]: `` Then -- you 're there , you know , and er -- you say good-bye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 5]: `` Very interesting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 15]: commented Katrine once more , `` but I 'm afraid I ca n't play .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 29]: The idea does n't thrill me , and besides I have a -- friend coming on board at Port Said , who will naturally expect some attention . ''
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 5]: `` Rotten luck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 14]: sighed Mr Murray , and for sixty seconds on end looked seriously downcast .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 24]: `` But of course , '' he added thoughtfully , `` if it were only to Port Said -- '' `` Just so .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 13]: It would be a pity to break the continuity of your scheme .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 9]: You have had quite a long voyage already .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 33]: How is it that you have not already -- '' Katrine stopped short , as an expression of discomfiture flitted over the handsome face , and altered the character of her enquiry .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 16]: `` May I ask how _ many _ others you have asked before me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 6]: `` Not -- many ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 5]: stammered Mr Murray ingenuously .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 28]: His gaze wandered uneasily round the deck , and Katrine 's following his , met a pair of mischievous brown eyes set in a plump girlish face .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 28]: The eyes were fixed upon herself with an expression of such interest and curiosity as told its own tale , and Katrine hastily lowered her white umbrella .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 12]: Simultaneously the plump girl lowered her own , but it shook !
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 18]: Austin Murray , looking from one wobbling frame to the other , chewed his moustache in disgust .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 14]: `` Perhaps , '' he explained stiffly , `` I am too ambitious .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 44]: One needs must love the highest ... There are , of course , a dozen girls who would be only too glad -- '' `` Then , '' said Katrine hastily , `` pray lose no time in securing one of the number .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 11]: If you do n't , they may be snapped up .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 22]: Do n't let me detain -- '' Mr Murray leaped from his seat , bowed deeply , and walked rapidly away .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 15]: To the end of the voyage he kept sedulously out of Katrine 's way .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 20]: Katrine lay contentedly in her chair luxuriating in the sun and the breeze , and lazily studying the passers-by .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 13]: As usual under the circumstances she dubbed the passengers dull and uninteresting .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 24]: Further acquaintance might reveal hidden fascinations , but for the present she failed to discover any of the types for which she looked .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 41]: The fascinating grass widow playing havoc with other hearts , while keeping her own serenely untouched ; the beauteous maids sailing forth to conquer new worlds , the purple-faced and choleric colonels ; the flock of interesting , unattached males !
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 7]: -- where had they all disappeared ?
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 54]: She saw before her a company for the most part staid and middle-aged , bearing the chastened air of the outward bound ; the sprinkling of youngsters were of very ordinary attractions , the flock of children , fascinating for an hour , but becoming painfully in evidence as the day wore on .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 17]: Only one figure arrested her attention , and that from a reason more painful than pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 21]: He was a man approaching middle-age , with a finely-hewn face , on which consumption had deeply hewn its mark .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 20]: He paced the deck wrapped in an old Inverness cape , and at intervals leaned coughing over the rail .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 19]: So far as Katrine 's observation went , he spoke to nobody , and nobody spoke to him .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 27]: Her heart softened at his air of suffering , and she determined that if fate threw him in her way , she would open an acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 25]: After tea the grey-haired Mrs Mannering joined her room-mate for a promenade round the deck , and treated her to staccato items of information .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 4]: `` Sticky lot !
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 6]: Always are on these boats .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 10]: Thank goodness there are very few soldiers on board .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 10]: When there are , it 's worse than ever .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 8]: Cavalry cuts Infantry , Infantry snubs civilians .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 5]: Civil servants bar trade .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 5]: So you go on !
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 7]: Do n't trouble _ me _ .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 8]: I know too much about 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 8]: She gave a quick , keen glance .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 5]: `` Like scandal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 6]: `` Thank you , no !
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 5]: I hate it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 6]: `` Quite right , too .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 4]: At your age .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 15]: I do n't mind telling you that it 's the breath of my nostrils .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 5]: No pretence about me .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 8]: What I think I _ say _ !
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 23]: Give me a good , spicy divorce ... '' Katrine quickened her pace , eyelids drooped , corners of lips turned down .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 14]: Never in all her twenty-six years had she listened to such a sentiment .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 20]: Horror seized her at the idea of being shut up in close quarters with a woman of degraded tastes .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 8]: Would it be possible to change cabins ?
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 7]: `` Bless you , my lamb .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 11]: _ I _ wo n't sully your little mind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 22]: The kind , motherly voice spoke in such apt response to the inner thought , that Katrine jumped in her skin .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 21]: She turned , rosy and shy , half-angry , half-ashamed , and saw a wrinkled hand held out towards her .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 8]: That 's agreed -- I like you .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 5]: Right sort of girl .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 5]: Do n't you worry !
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 15]: You might do a lot worse than have old Nance Mannering as a companion .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 19]: I 've lived east of Suez too long not to be able to adapt myself to my company .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 22]: You 'll get no contamination from me , and what 's more , I 'll protect you from getting it elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 29]: You have a word with me , my dear , before you take up with any of these boys , and I 'll put you on your guard .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 30]: Poor lot , most of them ; drinking and gambling ... '' `` I do n't think I shall ` take up ' with any one , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 28]: A fellow-officer of my host in India is to join the ship at Port Said , and will look after me for the rest of the voyage .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 16]: He is not a very young man , but I 'm told he is nice .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 7]: I expect to enjoy his society .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 16]: There 's only one man I 've seen on board who interests me at all .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 12]: The one with the cape , who looks so ill . ''
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 4]: `` Vernon Keith .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 2]: Artist .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 19]: Rather a big wig in his way , or promised to be , a year or two since .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 12]: Consumption of course , -- _ and _ his own folly !
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 11]: Going this voyage for health , if it please you !
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 34]: The mad folly of doctors to allow a man in that condition to start out on such a crack-brained expedition , mewed up among hundreds of people , scattering poison wherever he goes !
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 15]: Sea air is all very well , but what about the smoke-room , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 5]: What about the bars ?
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 14]: Temptation waiting on every hand , and no one to say him nay .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 11]: The passengers steer clear of him , and no wonder .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 30]: By ten o'clock at night -- '' `` Perhaps , '' said Katrine quickly , `` if people did _ not _ steer clear , things might be different .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 12]: _ I _ sha n't , if I get the chance .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 14]: He is ill and weak , and I 'm sure he is sad .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 14]: He looked _ miserable _ this morning , pacing up and down alone .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 19]: Is n't it rather Pharisaical to stand aside because a man is ill , and -- weak ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 6]: The spectacled eyes twinkled humorously .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 30]: `` Well , well , he 'll be pleased enough , no doubt , but do n't be too kind , and raise expectations which ca n't be fulfilled !
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 11]: Port Said 's ahead -- and the nice man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 6]: `` And -- Jim ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 6]: added Katrine softly to herself .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 39]: When the dusk fell , she stood for an hour leaning over the rail , watching the phosphorescent glow on the darkened waves , sending out wistful , timorous thoughts toward that meeting which was growing momentarily nearer .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 4]: `` Jim ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWENTY .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 23]: During the second day at sea , chance arranged the introduction which Katrine had coveted with the consumptive artist , Vernon Keith .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 39]: The breeze had freshened , and wrapped in a light cloak she was sitting on her chair in a sheltered corner , when a sudden gust lifted her scarf and magazine , and blew them along the deck .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 34]: Involuntarily she groped in pursuit , and in so doing overbalanced and alighted in a heap , the chair , after the manner of its kind , doubling up , and following suit .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 24]: It all happened with such startling unexpectedness , that for a moment Katrine sat panting and breathless , making no effort to rise .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 55]: Flushed , bare-headed , white-robed , she made a charming picture , and more than one of the surrounding men dashed forward to her help , but before any one could reach her side , Vernon Keith had seized the chair , twisted it deftly into position , and held out a helping hand .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 9]: `` I hope you are not hurt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 32]: `` I -- I really do n't know , '' Katrine sat down , laid her head against the back of the chair , and smiled in vague , strained fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 10]: She stretched herself cautiously , and gradually regained composure .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 7]: I 'm sure I am not .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 15]: But it was startling ... '' She blushed a little beneath the watching eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 9]: `` I -- I had a book ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 16]: `` It is here , '' he said , and placed it on her knee .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 10]: `` Is there anything I can get for you ?
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 9]: I am sure you have had a shock .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 4]: Some wine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 6]: `` Oh , no . ''
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 24]: The suggestion brought back the remembrance of Mrs Mannering 's hint , and awoke a determination to take advantage of the present opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 20]: `` I shall be quite all right , if I talk about something else , and forget myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 16]: The invitation was obvious , the diffidence of the accompanying smile delightfully naive and girl-like .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 8]: Vernon Keith seated himself with obvious alacrity .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 33]: Seen close at hand he looked older , more worn ; there were lines about his mouth with which country-bred Katrine was unfamiliar , the irises of his eyes were faintly bloodshot .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 17]: For all her inexperience she recognised that these symptoms were not the result of ill-health alone .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 67]: They talked for an hour , a pleasant , inconsequent talk , flitting from one subject to another ; books , pictures , theatres , travel , and when they parted at the sound of the luncheon gong , he stood before her , gaunt and tall , and said gravely : `` Thank you for the first happy hour I have spent for months ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 40]: `` I hope we shall have many more , '' Katrine had answered , confused and startled , but as she took her way to her cabin she could have found it in her heart to regret the words .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 23]: `` He is clever , he is interesting , he is cultivated , -- but I _ do n't _ like him !
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 7]: There 's something in his face .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 18]: -- I am glad it is not _ he _ who is to look after me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 16]: During the luncheon hour , however , her ruminations carried her to a different plane .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 12]: `` It does n't matter whether I like him or not .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 13]: He is ill and lonely , and he -- _ drinks _ !
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 8]: because he has nothing better to do .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 7]: I 'll be kind to him .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 9]: I 'll get Captain Bedford to be kind .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 13]: Perhaps between us we can keep him straight ... '' Poor Katrine !
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 19]: She felt a glow of satisfaction when again that evening Vernon Keith spent an hour by her side .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 87]: She paced the deck with him , acutely conscious of looks of disapproval from several elderly quarters , feeling a childish sense of elation every time that the entrance to the smoke-room was passed in safety , exerting herself to start fresh subjects of interest each time the conversation flagged , but in spite of all her efforts , by half-past nine her companion grew restless , answered at random , and finally excused himself , pleading fatigue , a letter to be begun -- Well !
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 67]: Katrine consoled herself , at least he had had an hour in the fresh air , and could feel that _ some one _ was interested , and that he was no longer ostracised ... She found her cabin companion , and sat demurely by her side until after eleven o'clock , the beauty of the night making her unwilling to retire to the stuffy cabin .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 38]: When at last they rose and turned towards the companion-way , Katrine felt pleasantly tired , and confident of a good night 's rest , but the most exciting incident of the day was still to come .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 45]: Mrs Mannering led the way a few paces ahead , and Katrine , following in the rear , found her way suddenly blocked by a tall form with flushed face , and dulled eyes , from whose garments floated the unmistakable fumes of whisky .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 35]: It was Vernon Keith , and for a moment they stood motionless , face to face , her eyes cold and stern , his lightening into recognition , then flinching with a pathetic shame .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 15]: `` I -- thought -- you -- had gone , '' he stammered thickly .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 7]: `` Getting late -- for you .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 6]: Ver ' -- late . ''
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 25]: He was turning back in the direction of the smoke-room , when with a sudden impulse , Katrine laid her hand on his arm .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 4]: `` Mr Keith !
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 7]: Will you do me a favour ?
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 30]: You are not well , and it is bad for you to sit up late ... Wo n't you say good-night now , and go straight to bed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 10]: He straightened himself , and drew a deep breath .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 30]: As if a veil had been drawn from his face , the blank look vanished , and the soul of the man looked at her through the bloodshot eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 9]: For the moment he was startled into sobriety .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 8]: `` If -- if you ask it .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 3]: Of course .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 6]: At -- at once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 10]: he said , and turning followed in her wake .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 10]: Had Mrs Mannering seen , or had she not ?
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 5]: Katrine could not decide .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 30]: She was thankful at least that she was treated to no remarks , but could hurry into bed and lie quietly in the darkness , thinking over the situation .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 23]: One thing was certain -- the incident had at a stride carried Vernon Keith and herself beyond the stage of conventional acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 17]: It seemed impossible that they could meet again without reference to that short , pregnant meeting .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 5]: What would be said ?
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 9]: Would he be shamed , resentful , defiant ?
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 13]: Katrine could not guess ; hardly knew for which mood to wish .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 34]: Curiously enough the success of her appeal had roused a nervous mistrust , so that she regretted her own audacity , and wished helplessly that she had waited for Captain Bedford 's help .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 11]: `` Will he think it was bold of me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 7]: she questioned of her own heart .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 23]: `` Will they tell him in the smoke-room that I walked about with a man to whom no other girl will speak ?
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 16]: Will he think I am bold and fast , and tell _ Jim _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 10]: Quick as a dart came the answering assurance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 7]: _ Jim will understand _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 11]: and at the comfort of it she laughed softly aloud .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 16]: A sleepy murmur from the opposite bunk reminded her of the existence of her room-mate .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 16]: She blushed and stammered in the dark : `` I -- I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 7]: What did you say ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 6]: _ Bless you _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 5]: repeated the voice distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 8]: `` But do n't do it again .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 13]: -- He 'll keep , my dear -- he 'll keep ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 19]: The next morning , to Katrine 's relief , there was no sign of Vernon Keith at breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 50]: She drew her chair into a quiet corner and sat with her back to the passing stream , affecting to be engrossed in her book , but shortly before noon a shadow loomed , and with a fluttering of heart she divined that the dreaded encounter was at hand .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 37]: He placed his chair by her side , and fixed her with haggard eyes , but he spoke no word , not even the conventional greeting ; it was left to her to open the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 8]: `` Oh , Mr Keith -- good-morning !
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 4]: I was reading .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 9]: -- Is n't it a nice day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 5]: `` Is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 4]: he queried listlessly .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 8]: `` I was not thinking of to-day .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 8]: I was thinking of last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 16]: His eyes pierced her through , he bent nearer , speaking with a horrible deliberation .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 14]: `` Are -- you -- accustomed -- to -- drunken -- men ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 7]: Katrine cowered ; repulsed and frightened .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 5]: `` Never -- never !
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 18]: -- I have never so much as spoken to one -- be -- '' `` Before ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 4]: he concluded calmly .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 21]: I am drunk , more or less , every night of my life , and shall be to the end .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 11]: It 's a habit which it is difficult to break !
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 48]: You thought it would be satisfying for a man to walk round the deck with a beautiful girl for his companion , feeling the fresh breeze , watching the sea and the sky ; more tempting than a foul room with the fumes of smoke and whisky .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 7]: -- It _ is _ better !
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 9]: For an hour I was grateful and content .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 44]: After that -- '' he hissed the words in her ear , `` after that -- sooner than have stayed with you , sooner than exchange your company for the bottle and the glass , do you know what I would have done ?
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 18]: -- I would have lifted you in my arms , and tossed you into that sea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 7]: Katrine shrunk from him , aghast .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 24]: For the first time in her life she faced the despair of a self-wrecked life , and realised the impotence of human help .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 27]: The chains which the years had forged bound this man in his prison , and she had essayed to free him in a few light hours .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 18]: If he had shown signs of excitement or emotion , the moment would have been more bearable .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 10]: It was his dreadful composure which rent her heart .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 12]: Her lip quivered ; she shook her head in helpless distress .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 8]: `` Why do you tell me this ?
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 12]: I did n't ask -- I do n't want to know .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 11]: We can be friends ... '' `` Can we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 4]: he smiled bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 6]: `` Are you so brave ?
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 12]: That 's fine of you , but it 's too late .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 21]: I am a drunkard , and it has come to this -- I do n't even wish to be cured !
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 14]: Drink is my only comfort ; the thing that helps me to forget .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 19]: The good people among whom you have lived -LRB- you have met only good people , I think .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 7]: That shows in your face ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 18]: they have told you that it is drunkenness which causes most of the misery in the world .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 22]: In future will you try sometimes to reverse the statement , and acknowledge that it is often misery which causes drink ?
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 30]: It caused it with me , -- heart-break and treachery , failure and struggle , and then , at the first promise of success , _ this _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 13]: he tapped his bent chest , `` this demon choking my life .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 8]: I have nearly a whole lung left .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 5]: Would you think it ?
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 20]: Down in that cabin , gasping for breath , it is difficult to realise that there 's so much .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 15]: And they sent me this voyage , the people at home ... What for ?
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 7]: My sake , or their own ?
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 13]: To get rid of me -- to be spared the end ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 6]: `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 9]: Katrine protested , `` do n't say it .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 15]: It is n't true , it can only do you harm to think it .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 8]: No one could be so wicked . ''
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 7]: His lips twisted in a sneer .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 6]: `` Would it be wicked ?
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 21]: When the sheep is so black , when he refuses to be washed , and brings disgrace on innocent heads ?
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 27]: There is no hope for me , Miss Beverley ; a month more , or a month less , that 's the only question that remains .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 49]: Sea air is supposed to be good , and sitting at home people think _ only _ of the air , and forget the other incidents of life on shipboard , which are _ not _ conducive to the welfare of a man suffering from my -- complaints !
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 8]: I am worse than when we sailed .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 6]: Shall grow worse every day .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 6]: Doubly infected , you see !
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 7]: A leper to be shunned . ''
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 17]: He stared at her keenly , his mouth twisted by the bitter mockery of a smile .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 28]: There was no sign of softening on his face , rather did he appear to sneer at the puny efforts which had been made on his behalf .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 26]: He had spoken of her as a `` beautiful girl , '' but in a manner so impersonal as to rob the words of flattery .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 21]: Katrine turned her head aside , unable to meet that gaze , and sat silent , gazing out to sea .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 18]: For a long quarter of an hour neither spoke a word , but the silence was charged .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 16]: Each felt the influence of the other 's thoughts , divined the other 's sentiments .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 25]: At a certain moment they turned simultaneously to look into each other 's eyes , and in this last look was kindness and comprehension .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 16]: `` Miss Beverley , '' said the man , `` you are a good woman .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 14]: You have done me good , though not in the way you intended .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 11]: I shall drink as much as ever , understand that !
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 7]: but you 've done me good .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 38]: If you are brave enough to defy convention by giving a little of your time to a prodigal , I 'll take what I can get , and for the rest -- keep out of your way !
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 16]: But you have only to say a word -- '' Katrine held out her hand .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 9]: `` I do n't want to say it .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 9]: It is nothing to me what people think .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 10]: Come and talk to me whenever you feel inclined .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 42]: I have no friends on board , but at Port Said a man is joining the ship who is in the same regiment as my host , and he is supposed to look after me for the rest of the voyage .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 10]: I hope we shall _ both _ like him !
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 10]: We could sit together and have more interesting talks .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 8]: Men get tired of womaney subjects . ''
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 13]: `` Ah , '' he said flatly , `` that 's good !
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 9]: I 'm glad you will have some one .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 7]: You are beautiful , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 8]: You ought n't to be alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 8]: Again the impersonal tone minimised the words .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 44]: Katrine realised that as a woman she had no personality for the man ; she was merely a shape -- a picture ; even his gratitude was a lifeless thing ; the man 's power of feeling , of resistance , was exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 14]: It was indeed , as he had said , `` too late . ''
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 41]: The ship dropped anchor in the harbour of Port Said early in the morning , and almost immediately afterwards four large coal barges , lashed together , were towed towards her , with a not unmusical chanting of `` Oola !
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 2]: Oola !
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 3]: Oola ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 5]: from their Arab crew .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 31]: Veritable imps of Satan did the men appear , dyed to an ebon blackness , and the passengers made haste to depart shorewards to escape the ordeal of the day .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 38]: Katrine , Mrs Mannering , and Vernon Keith formed a little party by themselves ; the elder woman trim and gaunt in grey alpaca , Katrine immaculately white , with a broad-brimmed hat shading face and neck .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 29]: An undercurrent of excitement at the prospect of meeting the first of her Indian friends brightened her eyes , and infused her whole aspect with a delightful animation .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 26]: The first duty on shore was to purchase topees , which to Katrine 's relief proved to be much more becoming than she had anticipated .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 50]: Her choice had indeed quite a fashionable aspect , being of the wide Merry Widow shape , the pith foundation daintily covered with white cotton , while a green lining and light hanging scarf added to the general effect , and sent her out of the shop complacently reassured .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 53]: They walked about the sun-baked streets of the squalid town , the gaunt man , the grey-haired woman , and between them the young blooming girl , passing quickly by the few decent houses which skirt the quay , to visit the native quarters , Katrine 's first glimpse of the East .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 30]: There was none of the glamour which she had expected in the ramshackle buildings , cabins , and hencoops , with but little to differentiate one from the other .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 37]: Dark-skinned men lounged about in every variety of bed-gown , women sported the heavy yashmak , in addition to a brass band across the forehead , from which four large brass rings depended over the nose .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 30]: Children swarmed around thick as mosquitoes , begging in broken English , any claims to beauty which they might have possessed obliterated by the almost universal pitting of smallpox .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 24]: The animals were more attractive , but in the absence of even the smallest blade of grass their presence seemed difficult to explain .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 36]: The goats appeared to live on bits of paper and scraps of orange peel , while the cows , dogs , and cats which with the goats wandered restlessly about the streets fared even worse .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 26]: As for the camels and donkeys , they stood about in groups , or lay in the sand with their usual expression of bored resignation .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 9]: Vernon Keith laughed at Katrine 's undisguised dismay .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 13]: `` Do n't judge the East by Port Said , Miss Beverley !
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 18]: It is a nightmare of a hole , where no one lives who is not absolutely compelled .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 56]: Even these Arab coal-porter fellows bring their families here for two or three months , work like the devil , and then disappear into the desert to live like fighting cocks until their earnings are finished ... Here 's a water hydrant , -- suppose we stand here and watch the people fill their skins !
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 23]: It may give you a laugh , and that 's a difficult thing to achieve in this part of the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 5]: Katrine looked around eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 40]: A group of Europeans had already gathered round the hydrant , some of whom she recognised as passengers on her own boat ; the others were strangers , for whom at the moment she had no attention to spare .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 22]: An Arab woman was holding to the tap a crumpled mass of skin , into which the water was gradually falling .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 15]: Even as she watched , the folded mass swelled and wriggled in life-like contortions .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 20]: The crowd broke into laughter ; the Arab woman , expectant of backsheesh , responded with a gleaming smile .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 10]: Katrine danced on her toes like an excited child .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 5]: `` What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 4]: What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 3]: A pig-skin ?
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 3]: A calf-skin ?
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 3]: A sloper ?
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 10]: It 's _ just _ like a dying sloper !
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 6]: What can it be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 62]: Suddenly from out the sausage-like round shot a leg , kicking , as it were , into space ; a second leg , more legs , a tail -- then the Arab woman gave an adroit twist to the balloon , and a final shriek of laughter from the crowd greeted the cocking of frisky ears , above the life-like head !
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 27]: The sight was so irresistibly comic , that even Vernon Keith was surprised into a smile , which broadened at sight of Katrine 's childlike delight .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 31]: The clear treble of her laughter , the involuntary dance of her eager feet , the beauty of the sparkling face , made her indeed the cynosure of every eye .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 16]: Fellow-passengers smiled at her with a kindliness which had in it an element of remorse .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 47]: `` The girl who walked about with that horrible man '' -- appeared suddenly in a different light , -- not an adventuress after all , but a girl whose experience of life was behind her years , a child at heart who meant no harm .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 21]: The strangers whispered among themselves , and speculated as to her relationship with the man and woman by her side .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 33]: The Arab woman shouldered her burden and walked away , enriched by several voluntary offerings , and the object of interest being removed , Katrine became embarrassingly conscious of the general scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 57]: She cast a rapid glance around the group , skimming quickly from one face to another , until suddenly , startlingly , she found herself held by the gaze of a pair of eyes , a man 's eyes , steely grey , with a curious effect of lightness against the deep tan of the skin .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 24]: There was something in those eyes , a magnetism , an intentness , which gripped Katrine with a force amounting to positive pain .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 47]: Each of us in his turn has had such an experience , but it is all too rare , for the eyes of our fellow-creatures , so far from being windows of the soul , are as a rule little more illuminating than any other feature .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 53]: Tired eyes , shallow eyes , blank , expressionless eyes , one encounters them at every turn , but only at rare and memorable intervals eyes alive , magnetic , which not only look straight from the heart of their owner , but like a searchlight pierce straight to one 's own .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 17]: When this experience comes , it forges a link which neither time nor distance can break .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 11]: Two souls have met , and mutely acclaimed their kinship .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 47]: While one might have counted ten , Katrine stood , motionless , almost without breath , gazing deep into the strange man 's eyes , then with the wrench of physical effort , she turned aside , and slipped her hand through Mrs Mannering 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 3]: `` Come !
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 5]: Let us go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 4]: They walked on .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 31]: Vernon Keith on one side , Mrs Mannering on the other , large , gaunt , protective , her arm gripping the girl 's hand to her grey alpaca side .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 37]: Katrine loved her for that grip , but her mind was still engrossed in visualising the figure of a tall man , thin , yet broad , of a tanned face , and light grey eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 16]: The glare from the sand seemed of a sudden to have become monstrous , unbearable .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 11]: She felt a tired longing for the cool white deck .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 8]: `` How soon can we go back ?
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 13]: How long will those -- sweeps -- take over their work ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 8]: `` Not long , '' Vernon said .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 6]: `` They are incredibly quick .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 12]: Three hours for a matter of eight or nine hundred tons .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 12]: We will go to the hotel and get something to drink .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 9]: Has the sun been too much for you ?
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 7]: You look so suddenly tired . ''
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 13]: Beneath her breath Mrs Mannering grunted disgust at the blindness of man .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 47]: When the hotel was reached , and she and Katrine sat alone for a few minutes waiting the arrival of drinks , she looked at the girl with a kindly twinkle and said abruptly : `` No need to take it to heart , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 4]: Your own fault !
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 14]: You were worth looking at , and he looked -- that 's all !
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 9]: A cat may look at a king . ''
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 4]: Katrine smiled faintly .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 6]: `` Yes -- of course .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 4]: Stupid of me .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 11]: But there was something in his eyes that -- startled !
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 12]: Did you ever have that curious feeling on meeting a stranger ?
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 17]: Not recognition -- it 's more like expectation -- as if he _ mattered _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 5]: Mrs Mannering grunted again .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 15]: `` I know a fool when I see him , and an honest man .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 14]: I know when to be civil , or to give a wide berth .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 11]: Common-sense , I call it ; not curious at all .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 8]: Rather a fine figure , that man !
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 7]: You 'd make a good pair .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 24]: I 've been thinking , you know , he might be that friend who is coming on board ... Eh , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 9]: To her surprise Katrine violently resented the suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 8]: `` Oh , _ no _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 4]: she cried loudly .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 8]: `` I am sure he is not .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 8]: Captain Bedford will be quite different . ''
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 10]: A look almost of fear flitted over her face .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 11]: `` I 'm quite sure it was not he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 9]: Mrs Mannering shrugged her shoulders , `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 6]: have it your own way .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 31]: If I were a pretty , unattached female , and was introduced to that man as my travelling companion , I should feel I was in for a good time !
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 68]: On the other hand , if you were a bride , my dear , I 'd stick to you like glue , out of sympathy for the poor man waiting his turn ... '' Katrine hesitated , fighting an impulse which prompted her to confide in this kind , shrewd woman , to confess the real object of her journey , and secure her help and counsel .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 32]: The words trembled on her lip ; another second and they would have found speech ; then the door opened and Vernon Keith appeared , followed by a waiter bearing refreshments .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 5]: The opportunity was past .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 21]: On returning to the ship Katrine found several letters waiting , one of which bore Jim Blair 's well-known writing .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 19]: She tore it open immediately on reaching her cabin , and was disappointed to find it unusually short .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 41]: Excitement , restlessness , and an unusual press of business made it impossible , he explained , to write at length , the more so as he was pledged not to speak of the subject which lay nearest his heart .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 27]: He hoped she had made some woman friend on board , who would look after her , as not even the best of men could do .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 51]: Bedford would probably have to hurry off immediately on landing to bring up a company of men , but as Dorothea would explain , the agent in Bombay had been instructed to look after tickets , baggage , etc. , and make every arrangement for the four days ' journey .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 18]: Could she not find some woman who would share the carriage for even part of the way ?
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 31]: Her second letter , following hard on the heels of that memorable acceptance , had been perhaps a necessary corrective , but she could hardly expect it to be welcome !
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 28]: So far the letter was grave , commonplace , almost business-like , but at the end an effort had evidently been made to adopt a lighter tone .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 36]: He referred to her examination paper , declared that a careful examination of ears having been made , by means of tape measure and mirror , he might be considered to have passed with honours .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 29]: As to the wife 's little ways , his mode of procedure would in each case be the same , -- '' _ Kiss the wife _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 27]: That evoked a smile , but despite the effort at brightness Katrine was conscious of the underlying depression , which the last sentence put into words .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 15]: `` Now that our meeting is so near , I am consumed with doubts .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 14]: Not of my own feelings -- never think that , but of yours !
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 9]: Why should you care for me , Katrine ?
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 12]: What is there about me to attract a girl like you ?
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 21]: I kick myself for my boldness and self-confidence ; but at least , dear , you shall not be worried .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 5]: Be sure of that !
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 17]: No thought of me must interfere with what seems best for you , and your happiness .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 25]: Keep that thought before you , dear , through all the hours which carry you across the sea , and find courage in it .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 15]: No happiness can come to me , which leaves you empty or dissatisfied ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 24]: Katrine folded the letter , replaced it in its envelope , and sat on the side of her bunk staring vacantly into space .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 21]: For the first time the reading of a letter from Jim had left behind a feeling of disappointment and jar .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 18]: He had struck a wrong note , and one which awoke in her a feeling of resentment .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 26]: Surely now , when she was actually on her way , he should have hidden his doubts and affected an even stronger confidence and determination .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 35]: She had looked forward to the receipt of this letter , expecting to be cheered , assured ; now she could have found it in her heart to wish that it had not arrived !
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 19]: Jim Blair , depressed and doubtful , was an unfamiliar figure , with which she had no association .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 38]: From the beginning of their correspondence it had been his assurance , this breezy self-confidence , amounting almost to audacity , which had captured her imagination ; now when she needed it most that assurance had failed !
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 18]: Katrine laid herself down and made a pretence of sleep , which fatigue presently turned into reality .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 30]: She was awakened by the ringing of the first dinner bell , and lengthened out the process of dressing by a bath , and an elaborate re-arrangement of hair .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 41]: She also displayed an unusual self-abnegation in the matter of the mirror , so that when the last gong rang , her toilette was still incomplete , and Mrs Mannering sailed off alone , clasping jet bracelets round bony wrists .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 15]: Even when she had the cabin to herself Katrine showed no anxiety to hurry .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 19]: The plain truth was that she dreaded entering the saloon , and facing the meeting which lay ahead .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 37]: Until that afternoon she had looked forward with eagerness to the arrival of Captain Bedford , whose society would disperse the feeling of loneliness which is never more acute than in the midst of a crowd .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 45]: He was the Middletons ' friend , Jim 's friend ; reported to be good , staid , steady-going ; not too young , straight as a die , and a splendid soldier , -- in short an elder-brother-sort-of-man , agreeably free from romance .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 38]: They would meet , not as strangers , but with such a bond of common interests , such a certainty of future friendship , as would carry them in a bound past the initial stages of acquaintanceship .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 15]: She had counted the hours until Port Said should be reached , and now !
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 61]: here she was sitting dawdling in her cabin , dreading to leave it , and face what lay ahead ... Could that be Captain Bedford -- that man with the tanned face , whose personality among a crowd of strangers had asserted itself with such magnetic force ; whose eyes had held her own captive , against her struggling will ?
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 10]: Surely it was but one chance to a hundred !
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 59]: There had been other men in that group , other men hanging about the hotel ; tall , bronzed , soldier-like men by the dozen , any one of whom might even now be sitting in the place next to her own in the saloon , wondering , with a tepid curiosity , when Miss Beverley would appear !
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 26]: It was stupid of Mrs Mannering to have suggested the possibility ; not only stupid , but officious , as were also her after insinuations .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 13]: Katrine flushed , as she recalled her own momentary impulse at confession .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 41]: Protection was not needed : even if Captain Bedford were different from what she had expected , she could deal with the situation without help from others ; could see as little or as much of him as she desired .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 22]: She rose , with sudden determination , cast a last look in the glass , and walked resolutely towards the saloon .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 26]: She was late , for the second course was already being cleared away , and a steady hum of conversation rose from the crowded tables .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 32]: Katrine steered her way to her own seat at the far end of the great room , a graceful figure , with head held high , and flushed , frowning face .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 13]: The diners followed her with their eyes , and commented among themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 7]: `` Fine girl -- beautiful eyes !
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 4]: Holds herself well .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 19]: Pretty , but too tempery for my taste ... Pity she mixes herself up with that Vernon brute .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 9]: Expect she 's used to a Bohemian set .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 15]: Beverley 's sister , I 'm told ... Author fellow who married Grizel Dundas .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 4]: Ever met her ?
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 6]: The most fascinating little witch !
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 10]: Could smile the heart out of a stone wall .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 44]: Might have married any one she liked , instead of chucking away a fortune for the sake of a scribbler ... '' Katrine pursued her way unconscious of criticisms , which , if overheard , would have accentuated the `` tempery '' expression .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 25]: Her heart was beating with unaccustomed quickness , she kept her eyes averted from her own empty seat , and -- the seat beyond !
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 38]: Even at the moment of stopping she would not look , but a tall figure rose suddenly , hand shot out , a voice spoke , level and expressionless : `` Miss Beverley , I believe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 4]: It was he !
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 26]: Once more Katrine met the gaze of grey eyes , curiously light in the brown face ; once more felt the sudden , half-fearful thrill .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 4]: `` Captain Bedford !
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 13]: I -- I think I saw you on shore this afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 5]: `` At the hydrant .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 3]: Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 6]: He seated himself after her .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 6]: `` I enjoyed your enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 13]: It 's an amusing sight when one is new to the East .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 9]: Has the voyage been pleasant so far ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 29]: The words were pronounced with an amount of hesitation which comforted Katrine , by their betrayal of the fact that the nervousness was not all on her side .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 17]: She made a determined effort to regain composure , and talk in natural , easy fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 6]: `` Quite , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 17]: My powers as a sailor are untried ; there has been no excuse to feel ill .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 8]: And I 'm luxuriating in the heat .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 16]: I may have too much of that soon ... I hope you are better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 6]: `` Quite fit , thanks .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 9]: Have you made any friends on board ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 12]: Katrine took note of the hasty dismissal of the health topic .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 18]: It was no doubt a painful subject , and one which he was naturally anxious to forget .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 33]: She turned her head with an involuntary scrutinising glance , and had an impression of a long , lean jaw , dun-coloured hair , and a line of eyebrow , unexpectedly dark .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 25]: The whole effect was too thin and lined to look robust after the florid men at home , but was nevertheless instinct with force .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 13]: Reassured she looked away , and attacked the food on her plate .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 8]: `` I have spoken to three people .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 13]: My room-mate for one -- an elderly woman , rather a character .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 14]: She is afflicted with a devouring curiosity which it amuses me to balk .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 12]: Then she lets off steam by confiding in _ me _ !
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 48]: I know to a penny how much she has a year , and what her husband died of , and her son 's virtues and failings , and her plans for the rest of her life ... It 's a bore sometimes , but she 's kind !
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 7]: I 'm beginning to like her .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 26]: Then there are two men -- '' She felt , rather than saw , the deepening of interest , the slight turn of the head .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 8]: `` One sits at the next table .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 5]: Do n't look now !
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 10]: Fair , handsome ; by the girl in blue .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 19]: He spoke to me the first day ; introduced himself , and was rather -- startlingly -- frank !
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 12]: He is evidently an experienced traveller who leaves nothing to chance .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 14]: He suggested that we should ... What do you think he suggested ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 20]: Their eyes met , hers with a laugh ; his stern , with a kindling light which boded danger .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 6]: `` I have no idea .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 7]: I 'd rather not guess . ''
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 45]: `` That we should arrange what he was pleased to call ` a steamship flirtation , ' which consisted of an arrangement to spend practically the whole time together , growing increasingly sentimental during the voyage , but _ only _ during the voyage !
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 24]: On landing we were to part with a ` Good-bye , pleased to have met you , ' and mutually disappear into space .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 22]: -- It was just a thoughtful arrangement for amusement _ en route _ , like providing oneself with an interesting book .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 31]: I discovered on enquiry that he had already proposed the same arrangement to one or two other girls , so that I had not even the consolation of coming first .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 16]: I refused with thanks , but judging by appearances the blue girl was more amiable .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 9]: He has not spoken to me since . ''
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 11]: Captain Bedford looked across the table with a set jaw .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 37]: The subject of conversation was too much occupied with his neighbour to be conscious of that glance , but Katrine saw it , and mentally noted that this man 's anger would be no light thing .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 22]: `` I think , '' he said grimly , `` it is a good thing you are no longer alone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 11]: Then , after a pause , he added a question .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 7]: `` And the other man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 3]: I wonder .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 9]: Perhaps you will think that is worse still .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 9]: I _ hope _ you wo n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 37]: Katrine was conscious of a moment of actual nervousness ; she played with her knife and fork , waited until the conversation swelled to a louder pitch , and turning towards him spoke in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 9]: `` The other man is dying of consumption .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 10]: He is also drunk every night in the card-room .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 8]: No other woman will look at him .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 7]: They cut me because I do .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 6]: We are great friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 25]: Again their eyes met , but this time it was her turn to look grave , while he smiled a smile of unexpected sweetness .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 15]: `` He was with you , I think , this afternoon beside that hydrant .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 10]: I 'm glad you are kind to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 8]: Katrine was conscious of a great relief .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 39]: Her spirits rose ; she straightened herself with an agreeable tingling of blood , caught a glance directed to her from afar , and divined , with a woman 's content , that she was looking her best .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 11]: She drew her breath in a soft , fluttering sigh .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 5]: I 'm so glad .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 8]: I was afraid you 'd be shocked .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 5]: And you will help ?
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 19]: He needs a man friend -- a strong man -- who will be kind , and not judge .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 25]: And you can be with him more , do so much more than I. '' `` I 'm afraid he is very ill . ''
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 12]: The tone , like the words , seemed lacking in fervour .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 19]: Katrine had spoken with so intimate an appeal for help that she could not resist a momentary chill .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 36]: She sat silent , wondering if she had been too quick to claim the privileges of friendship , recalling for her own comfort Jim Blair 's words : `` A curt , shy manner . ''
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 5]: That was the explanation !
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 3]: Only manner .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 10]: The deep , smiling glance had already pledged help .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 8]: She might be satisfied of its fulfilment .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 8]: After dinner Bedford joined her on deck .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 34]: The vessel was steaming its slow course through the canal , and Katrine leaned over the rail gazing at the monotonous banks , listening to her companion 's explanatory conversation with difficult attention .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 29]: She was so much more interested in himself than in geographical facts ; she wanted to talk of himself , his health , of his winter 's experiences !
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 40]: `` Six miles an hour ... Even if we put on full steam we could go no faster , for the bed is so narrow that if the screw revolves too rapidly , it merely draws the water backwards .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 11]: Extra depth would be even more valuable than extra width .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 24]: Years ago I was on board the _ Ophir _ , and we entered the canal to find a German vessel run aground .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 17]: For five days we were stuck there until sixty-three vessels were waiting to get through . ''
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 4]: `` Sixty-three ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 8]: Katrine was startled out of her indifference .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 5]: `` For five days !
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 6]: What did you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 10]: `` Fifty-five of the boats flew the English flag .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 12]: Their passengers amused themselves playing cricket and polo in the desert .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 6]: The others -- swore ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 15]: `` But -- '' Katrine looked blank , `` it might have been dreadful !
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 7]: Suppose there had been a war !
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 8]: What would they have done then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 13]: Captain Bedford smiled , but with a slight curl of the lip .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 10]: `` Played cricket still , and -- muddled through !
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 7]: When do we do anything else !
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 26]: In 1882 , when Arabi was upsetting things in Egypt we sent a string of gunboats and transports along the canal and one ran aground .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 18]: If she had lain in the middle of the channel instead of at the side -- well !
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 9]: Wolseley 's plans might not have come off .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 23]: As it was , she lay near enough to the bank to allow the others to be towed past with ropes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 3]: `` Really ?
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 4]: How interesting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 4]: murmured Katrine vaguely .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 38]: In the pause which followed she was conscious of a sound like that of a suppressed laugh , and turning round beheld her companion 's eyes twinkling with an amusement so infectious that she laughed in sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 12]: `` Well , but I 'm _ not _ interested ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 4]: she confessed boldly .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 36]: `` There is so much else ... Now that we have passed Port Said , I feel quite near to India , and there are so many personal things that I am longing to ask .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 19]: -- It is months since you have seen them all , but for me it has been years .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 13]: Five years since Dorothea sailed , and she is my nearest friend .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 8]: You know her intimately , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 3]: And Jack !
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 7]: Shall I find them changed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 5]: `` In outward appearance ?
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 14]: India ages ; but they are the sort that keep young at heart .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 30]: Jack wears well ; growing a trifle grey perhaps ; she is too thin , and the boy is like her , -- all spirit , too little flesh .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 5]: Amusing little rascal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 16]: Katrine resumed her former position , arms resting on the rail , head turned aside .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 52]: The Lake of Menzaleh stretched to the western horizon , its surface dotted with fishing boats , and covered with vast flocks of pelicans , flamingoes , and duck , which , unlike the fishermen , had caught all the fish they desired , and were now settling for the night .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 20]: There was a strangeness , an unreality about the scene , which gave it the substance of a dream .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 7]: `` And -- Captain Blair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 4]: Katrine queried softly .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 56]: It was an effort to introduce the name , but she was determined to do so ; nay , more , a mysterious impulse seemed to urge her to intimate something of the true position , to let this man realise that she and Jim Blair were more to each other than mere hearsay acquaintances .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 13]: She stared before her , her profile pale in the waning light .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 19]: `` I have never seen him , but , through Dorothea , we know each other quite well .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 20]: He has written to me , -- been so kind -- sent me brasses -- '' `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 10]: `` So , of course , I am interested !
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 5]: Is he nice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 4]: Captain Bedford smiled .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 3]: `` Nice !
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 11]: What composes a woman 's idea of ` nice ' ?
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 17]: Honestly , it is not exactly the word I should have chosen as a description ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 9]: She turned her head , alert and startled .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 8]: `` You do n't like him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 12]: `` Oh , pardon me , I _ do _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 10]: He considered a moment , then added with emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 3]: `` Extremely .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 26]: As a matter of fact , more than any other fellow in the regiment , but ` nice ' seems to picture a different type .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 6]: He is not handsome . ''
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 6]: `` Oh , I know !
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 6]: What does that matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 8]: Katrine 's voice took an impatient tone .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 22]: `` Every one says the same thing , -- Dorothea , you , himself , -- and it is so unilluminating !
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 26]: I have asked so often for a description , and it has never gone further than that : ` He is not handsome ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 4]: Captain Bedford laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 11]: `` That must be because he has no distinctive features .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 14]: What would describe him , would apply equally well to a dozen others .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 7]: Is n't that often the case ?
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 6]: Take these men on board !
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 22]: -- how many of them could you describe to me so that I could pick them out of the ruck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 12]: `` But I do n't like people who are alike ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 4]: objected Katrine pettishly .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 9]: `` I wanted Captain Blair to be different .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 12]: However , I shall soon be able to judge for myself .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 9]: Handsomeness does n't matter , but personality does .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 18]: I can feel in a minute whether I am going to care for a person or not .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 11]: I want to care for -- Dorothea 's friends ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 33]: Captain Bedford did not answer ; he stood tall and straight by her side , his face set in a mask-like composure , but Katrine was conscious that he understood the implication .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 8]: His silence was more eloquent than words .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 25]: The dusk fell ; out of the glare of the vessel 's searchlight the banks glided by , melting into the great desert beyond .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 12]: Katrine bade her companion good-night , and retired early to rest .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 21]: Mrs Mannering had not yet descended , and for once Katrine regretted her company , and ceaseless flow of conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 8]: Her own thoughts were out of control .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 45]: It was only by an effort that she could concentrate them on Jim Blair , as was her custom in moments of leisure , for Jim had contradicted himself , and blurred his own image , while another personality had sprung vividly into life .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 47]: She fell asleep with Jim 's name on her lips , wafting towards him mental messages of hope , but when dreams came , she dreamt of grey eyes in a sunburnt face , and waking before dawn , lay conscious , seeing them once again .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 18]: The view on reaching the deck the next morning was strangely impressive to Katrine 's unaccustomed eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 21]: The sun 's rays flooded the great waste of sand , a limitless expanse crossed by ridges of barren hill .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 12]: Not a tree or a blade of grass was in sight .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 42]: All that Katrine had read and imagined of desert places had not prepared her for such absolute dearth , and the thought of her own green , sweet-smelling land came back to her with the traveller 's first pang of home-sickness .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 31]: A clergyman father was discoursing to a young son and daughter on the probable cause which had transformed the once fertile Lower Egypt and Palestine into their present and poverty .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 18]: Katrine , listening with a wandering attention , gained an impression of camels _ versus _ horses .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 22]: The Egyptians , declared the cleric , were a race of horsemen , owning sheep and cattle , cultivating the soil .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 13]: Palm trees shaded the surface , and extracted dew from the air .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 32]: Later , following the dominion of the Pharaohs , bands of nomadic Arabs wandered over the land with herds of camels , which consumed young trees , in preference to grass .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 28]: The centuries passed , and as the old trees died , and no new ones survived to take their places , the exposed grass withered and died .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 56]: The clergyman proceeded to illustrate his theories by pointing out the results of cutting down the forests of Australia , and Katrine went down to breakfast , recalling the garden at The Glen , with the shining drops of water standing on every leaf and twig , the sweet , moist smell of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 17]: Already with this first sight of the East , England had become dearer , more beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 6]: Captain Bedford had not appeared .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 31]: Katrine knew a pang of disappointment at the sight of his empty place , but each moment which passed seemed to deepen a nervous shrinking at the thought of meeting .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 19]: Had she said too much last night , been too confiding , presumed too much on his help ?
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 11]: She must be careful to show that she exacted nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 28]: It was pleasant , of course , to have some one on board to whom one could appeal in an emergency , but companionship was another matter .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 8]: She must keep out of his way .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 31]: She hurried through her breakfast , reached the deck with a gasp of relief , and ensconced her chair in the quietest corner of the shady side of the deck .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 29]: Gradually , as the next hour passed by , the chairs around her were filled , until she sat hedged in , and hidden from the passing glance .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 22]: A book served as a screen , behind which she could study her companions , and peer nervously at each newcomer .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 23]: An hour passed before Captain Bedford came in sight , looking taller , browner than ever , in a loose white suit .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 31]: Katrine spied him afar off , caught the quick turn of his head , searching the rows of chairs , and involuntarily bent lower to conceal her face from view .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 35]: She kept her head bent , the blood rising in her cheeks , until a child 's cry , followed by a general ripple of laughter from the surrounding throng , roused her curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 57]: She recognised the cry as coming from an urchin of three or four years , a noisy , obstreperous morsel , especially abhorred by elderly passengers , and raising her head beheld him swinging with clasped hand from the end of Bedford 's coat , his small fat feet kicking viciously at the white trousered legs .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 34]: The brilliant idea of annoying a new-comer had occurred to the imp just at the moment when the Captain happened to pass by , and for the moment the situation was his own .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 34]: Only for a moment ; then a strong , lean hand detached his grasp , and lifting him as lightly as a giant would lift a pigmy brought him round face to face .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 34]: Then the lookers-on beheld an amusing scene , as regarding him the while with a calm , expressionless face , the big man taught the youngster a lesson out of his own book .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 72]: Gently , deliberately he swung him to and fro by the tails of his own short coat , reversed him slowly , so that for a breathless moment he dangled by his feet , balanced him by the chin , tucked him under one arm , brought him out beneath the other , and finally swung him over one shoulder , and dropped him lightly as a feather upon the deck .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 11]: The urchin staggered against the gunwale , and gaped bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 21]: Up till now , frowns and threats had been his only punishment , and to these he was scornfully impervious .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 19]: `` They '' were always `` going to , '' but `` they '' never `` did . ''
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 39]: To provoke a storm of invective was the deliberate object of his tricks ; he pranced the deck during its delivery , rejoicing in his triumph , but now for the first time he had met his master .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 28]: He stood staring , his fat face blank with surprise , while the onlookers chuckled approval , seeing themselves avenged in this humiliation of a common enemy .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 17]: As Bedford straightened himself , his eyes met Katrine 's , and contracted in quick recognition .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 55]: The flushed , laughing face stood out in charming contrast among the pallid , elderly throng , but the laughter was replaced by embarrassment , as scattering apologies to right and left , Bedford made a bee line towards her through the serried chairs , and seated himself on the deck at her feet .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 6]: `` Morning , Miss Beverley !
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 10]: I was wondering where you had hidden yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 4]: `` Good morning .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 5]: Thank you very much !
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 41]: I 've wondered several times how one would be able to endure the Red Sea , _ and _ Jackey at the same time , but he will have no spirit left in him , after _ that _ trouncing !
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 19]: He deserved it , little wretch , but -- are you always as drastic in your retaliations ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 44]: Sitting on the deck , his hands clasped round his knees , looking up smiling into her face , he looked young , almost boyish , despite the crow 's - feet round his eyes , the powdering of grey above his ears .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 13]: Katrine felt young too , lapped with a delicious sense of well-being .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 39]: To one who had never before been out of England it was an excitement just to be able to wear dainty white clothes , to sit screened beneath double awnings , looking out on a blaze of light .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 20]: It added to her content that her companion looked so young , that his eyes twinkled when he smiled .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 32]: The night before his face had shown lines , which she had interpreted as signs of the suffering of the past months , but this morning he looked rested and refreshed .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 6]: `` Oh , that nipper !
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 8]: We shall be good pals after this .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 6]: He only needed a lesson .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 9]: I like kiddies , '' he said easily .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 23]: The fingers which had swung the sturdy youngster with such ease , flicked daintily at a scattering of dust on his sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 20]: Katrine noticed the shape of the fingers , long , pointed , the nails filbert-shaped , and carefully manicured .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 19]: His toilette suggested a consideration of ease above fashion , but the hands were evidently tended with care .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 8]: The woman in her approved the distinction .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 32]: As Katrine looked round the deck she noticed more than one pair of eyes riveted upon her in curious scrutiny , but neither Mrs Mannering nor Vernon Keith were in sight .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 18]: She divined that the latter was deliberately keeping out of her way , and struggled after regret .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 32]: She _ was _ anxious to introduce him to Captain Bedford , at the same time there was no denying that a _ tete-a-tete _ was more agreeable than a triologue .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 13]: `` Sister Anne , Sister Anne , is there anybody coming ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 18]: said the deep bass voice in her ear , and she turned towards him with a shrug .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 12]: But I was looking to see if there _ were _ !
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 20]: I want to introduce you to Mr Keith and Mrs Mannering , the lady who shares my cabin . ''
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 28]: He did not reply , and Katrine looking down in surprise , caught a frowning of the forehead and pursing of the lips which betrayed obvious disapproval .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 19]: He met her glance , and smiled back with an attempt at alacrity which was far from convincing .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 3]: `` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 16]: If you wish -- '' `` You do n't _ want _ to know them ?
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 6]: You would rather not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 9]: He frowned again , hesitating over the words .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 7]: `` Honestly , I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 8]: I am not in a sociable mood .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 26]: I look upon these few days at sea as a holiday , when there is no reason why I should exert myself against my will .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 44]: I was relieved to find that there are so few military people on board , and if a man joins a ship half-way , does n't play bridge , and abjures deck games , it 's an easy matter to be left alone .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 29]: I promised myself never to enter the smoke-room until we reach Bombay , or to make an unnecessary acquaintance , but naturally your friends must be the exception .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 8]: Only -- there 's plenty of time !
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 11]: Do n't drag me into a vortex of sociability . ''
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 13]: Katrine laughed at that , but the laugh turned into a grimace .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 30]: `` There is no vortex around _ met _ It comes to this , that if you know me and my friends , you will know no one else !
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 5]: Mr Keith is taboo .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 27]: I 've explained why , and Mrs Mannering is -- is -- '' The while she sought for words , the blood rose in her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 17]: She was embarrassingly conscious that Bedford noticed it , and that his interest was heightened thereby .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 4]: `` Is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 7]: he queried , urging the confidence .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 4]: `` Is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 18]: `` Very nice to _ me _ , '' continued Katrine desperately , `` but -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 4]: `` But ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 9]: Again there was the same _ impasse _ .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 18]: Their eyes met , they laughed together , while Bedford hitched himself a trifle nearer her seat .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 10]: `` It 's -- rather difficult to explain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 3]: `` Obviously !
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 11]: which makes me all the more anxious to find out .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 11]: Very nice to _ you _ , but -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 25]: `` Prom what she said ; from what I 've _ heard _ , not always very -- _ nice _ , herself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 5]: `` I see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 15]: Bedford 's jaw lengthened with a gravity which was the obvious cloak of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 45]: Katrine flushed still deeper , feeling countrified and raw , but it _ was _ true that Mrs Mannering chummed with the fastest women on board , and that the stray fragments of their conversation which she had heard had been far from savoury .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 10]: She tilted her head with a gesture of offence .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 11]: `` I am afraid you think me a prig ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 12]: The grey eyes dwelt on her face with a thoughtful scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 3]: `` Prig !
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 3]: Do I ?
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 26]: I am not versed in prigs , but I hardly imagine that they would be likely to make your somewhat unconventional selection of friends ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 16]: He swung himself gently to and fro , his lips curving in a humorous smile .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 29]: `` So we are to be ostracised , are we , -- you and I , and the Waster , and the woman who is not -- nice !
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 14]: Left to our own devices , by this very worthy , commonplace crowd ?
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 4]: That 's good !
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 5]: Thank heaven for that .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 12]: I think we can contrive to have a fairly agreeable time .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 23]: Prom my own point of view it 's a gain , but you are young , and it 's your first voyage .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 7]: You may regret the crowd . ''
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 3]: Katrine considered .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 15]: Certainly the voyage so far had been strikingly different from her expectations on embarking .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 52]: In imagination she had seen herself the centre of merry parties on deck , dancing beneath the awnings , competing in deck sports , forming friendships with young people of her own age , but there were few young people on board , and so far there had been no dancing .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 78]: The men played cricket on the sunny side of the deck , leaving the more shady regions for the loungers who did nothing ; quoits and bean bags had each their votaries , but a single refusal , prompted by shyness rather than disinclination , had shut her out from their ranks , and henceforth she had been left severely alone , labelled undesirable , and mentally coupled with two of the most unpopular people on board .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 6]: It had been a disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 38]: Always when looking forward to a visit to India , the voyage had loomed large as one of the most exciting portions of the whole , but the first days at sea had been far from exciting .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 74]: Suppose that Captain Bedford had _ not _ come on board , that she had been left to the tender mercies of Vernon Keith and Mrs Mannering , knowing full well that even while they talked with her , the one was longing for the smoke-room , and the other for bridge , and spicy recollections -- how long , how drearily long would have seemed the days which were yet to come !
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 31]: If Bedford had _ not _ come on board ; but he had come ; he was even now sitting at her feet , scanning her face with intent eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 17]: In his presence disappointment became a problematical thing ; she knew herself to be abundantly content .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 11]: `` I am quite happy , '' she said simply .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 19]: `` I have plenty of gaiety ahead , and I can understand that you want to be quiet .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 23]: It must have been -- hard , to be so ill , and to have been constantly thrown back as you were .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 7]: Feverish attacks are so exhausting . ''
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 8]: An indefinite murmur was the only response .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 31]: Katrine noted a sudden stiffening of the lines of the figure : he ceased to swing to and fro , and sat grave , almost stern , avoiding her glance .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 9]: `` Miss Beverley , '' he said suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 8]: `` May I ask you a favour ?
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 13]: I am grateful for your sympathy , but the subject is painful .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 7]: -- I had rather avoid it .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 20]: For the moment I am well , as you see -- will you humour me by forgetting anything else ?
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 9]: It 's a holiday time , you know .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 21]: A few days stolen out of the year in which to laze , and be happy , and -- drift !
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 9]: Ca n't we leave it at that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 4]: `` Of course .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 3]: Of course .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 5]: I 'm sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 4]: cried Katrine eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 20]: Her eyes were soft with tenderness and remorse , for this man 's malady was of no ordinary type .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 28]: She knew him to have been threatened by a fate a hundred times worse than death , and reproached herself for having touched so sore a wound .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 6]: She nodded a glad agreement .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 3]: we will .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 21]: We will just take up our friendship from _ now _ , and be like children living in the hour .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 24]: _ I 've _ had a bad time , too , and for the first time for years I 'm free from responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 18]: It 's a heady feeling , and I feel capable of being as frivolous as you please .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 6]: Forward be our watchword ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 5]: `` Right oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 12]: he called cheerily , and stretching himself stumbled to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 9]: `` Then let 's go for a walk !
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 23]: One gets cramped sitting cooped in here , and there are , '' he lowered his voice , `` so many ears !
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 9]: That looks like a Bedouin camp over there !
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 49]: You are missing all the sights ... Come and look ... '' Katrine followed eagerly to the prow of the vessel , and beheld a small ferry-boat crossing the canal , laden with a load of vague moving shapes , which on closer investigation proved to be donkeys .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 16]: On the shore a number of camels were already lying , their fore-legs tied together .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 48]: As the vessel approached a donkey was pushed from the boat into the water , it went down head first , and emerged a limp and sorry object , which was nevertheless unwilling to go ashore , and struggled feebly to rejoin its companions in the boat .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 32]: Next moment there was consternation on board the ferry , for the wash of the great steamboat made it rock until men and donkeys had much ado to retain their places .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 35]: One turbaned figure curled up suddenly at the bottom of the boat with a donkey seated on its lap ; the onlookers caught the roll of dark round eyes as the ship sped past .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 43]: Even in that undignified attitude there was an air of composure about the figure , of placid acceptance of fate , while his companion cast never a glance at the towering ship with the throng of white faces leaning over the rail .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 35]: To the travellers they themselves might be an unusual sight , but to the Easterners this passing to and fro was an ordinary event , of infinitely less importance than the landing of donkeys !
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 28]: Suez was an agreeable surprise , with its square white houses clustered among palm trees , the mountain in the background showing rosy red in the sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 34]: The vessel came to rest in the roads , and the passengers who were new to the scene welcomed the arrival of a raft of small boats with their various objects for sale .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 38]: Bedford pointed out the crates of fresh vegetables for consumption on the voyage , which had come by train from the valley of the Nile , but Katrine had no interest to spare for such mundane articles .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 23]: Her eyes had caught the gleam of shell and coral , and her eager gesture pointed her out as a probable prey .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 10]: `` It 's no use saying they are rubbish .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 7]: I _ like _ rubbish ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 21]: she declared , brushing aside Bedford 's protest , and nodding her head eagerly in reply to an outstretched hand .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 17]: `` I have some money in my pocket , and I 'm pining to spend it .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 20]: I 've lived all my life in an English village , remember , and finery goes to my head .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 6]: Coral suits me , too .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 6]: Do make him come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 5]: `` Do n't worry .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 6]: He 'll come fast enough .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 15]: Do you think you could manage to stand still , and not -- prance ?
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 18]: He has doubled his prices already , and every additional prance will send them flying still higher .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 10]: In pity to other buyers -- '' `` Prance ?
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 5]: Who 's prancing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 28]: Katrine turned an indignant face , but suddenly discovering herself perched on the tops of her toes , abandoned the attempt at dignity , and laughed instead .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 5]: `` Do n't preach !
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 5]: This is my holiday .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 15]: I 'm not accustomed to negroes walking up ropes with trays of mysterious gems .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 12]: -- I shall be as excited as ever I please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 19]: Meantime one of the negroes manning the small craft was deftly making his way towards the main deck .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 57]: The rope grasped firmly between his great toe and the next , he walked up the halyards bearing the tray of gewgaws with an easy balance , the while the Arab trader leaned his weight on the edge of the boat nearest the ship , making it keel over until the climber could step on board .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 62]: So swiftly , nimbly , and smilingly , was the feat accomplished that the onlookers had hardly time to realise the wonder of it , before the glittering trays were pushed forward , and , while the hardened traveller shook his head and made off in opposite directions , novices to the East gathered thick as flies round a honey pot .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 59]: Katrine fell in love with half a dozen baubles , but her companion noted that they were among the least costly on the tray , pretty , inexpensive bits of colour , such as would satisfy a girl in her teens ; the more costly she fingered admiringly , but laid aside with the trained resignation of years .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 31]: Only one article seemed to exercise a definite temptation , a dainty model of a banjo , in ivory and tortoise-shell , to which her fingers returned once and again .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 49]: Bedford watching her smiled over the by-play , convinced that temptation would override prudence , but he discovered his mistake when , with a final sigh , she thrust the dainty morsel aside , and gathering together a few trifles took out her purse to settle the account .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 12]: `` You are not going to have the banjo then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 11]: he enquired , and she shrugged her shoulders in reply .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 8]: It 's absolutely useless , and unnecessary .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 14]: That 's why I want it , but it ca n't be done .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 21]: These little brooches and chains will do to send home to girl friends , and the coral is for myself .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 8]: I ca n't afford any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 17]: Bedford lifted the tortoise-shell , and turned it over daintily with his long , brown fingers .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 9]: `` But it is good : well made ?
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 7]: You consider it worth having ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 7]: `` I like it , yes !
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 5]: It 's so pretty .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 21]: I do n't know if it is too expensive ... '' `` I was not thinking about the price . ''
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 18]: He fixing a gold piece on the tray , and for a moment Katrine held her breath .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 20]: Was he about to offer her a gift of an article which she had confessed herself unable to buy ?
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 31]: She shrank from the disillusionment which the action would bring , but Bedford slid the tortoise-shell into a capacious pocket , without so much as a glance in her direction .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 12]: Evidently the purchase had been made without any thought of herself .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 13]: Katrine drew a sigh of relief , and than incontinently sighed again .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 8]: Of whom _ was _ he thinking ?
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 29]: Single men in barracks did not indulge in such trifles for themselves , and Bedford 's interest in this special trifle had been of the most detached order .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 28]: Obviously he had questioned her to find out the feminine point of view , so as to decide whether the offering were worthy of its future recipient !
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 6]: `` Whom could it be ?
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 6]: I 'll ask Dorothea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 11]: Katrine decided , and dismissed the matter from her mind .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 34]: But it returned ; a dozen times that day she found herself speculating on the personality of the fair unknown , on the exact relationship which existed between her and her own escort .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 19]: They could not be definitely engaged , or some of the Indian letters would have mentioned the fact .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 32]: Perhaps his health had prevented him from speaking ... Perhaps now that he was stronger ... She tried to recall all she had heard concerning the few girls in the station .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 9]: And of course there were the married women !
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 23]: Bedford might wish to take back remembrances to some woman who had shown him hospitality -- to Dorothea herself , for example .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 17]: Katrine mentally insisted on this point , but in her heart she did not believe it .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 36]: There was something in the manner in which Bedford had thrown down that coin , in the silence in which he had pocketed his purchase , which to her feminine sensibilities betrayed a deeper interest .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 7]: `` I will ask Dorothea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 28]: Katrine decided once more , but before an hour was over curiosity had mastered her , and she was questioning Bedford about every woman in the station .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 27]: The result was as illuminating as such enquiries usually are , and no more so , for Bedford had a good word to say of each .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 23]: When she had exhausted her list of questions , Katrine sat silent , staring before her , her face grave and set .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 23]: Bedford looked at her askance , and his eyes danced , but all traces of amusement were carefully banished from his voice .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 6]: `` You look very serious .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 9]: What are you thinking about so deeply ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 10]: `` I was thinking of what you have said .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 20]: I had no idea , from my letters , that you had so many -- girls in the station !
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 7]: That will be very nice . ''
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 18]: `` I 'm glad you are pleased , '' he said suavely , and Katrine incontinently blushed .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 20]: That night she lay awake once more , struggling with a depression which she assured herself was well grounded .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 27]: If there were already several agreeable and fascinating girls in the station , her own arrival could not be of such moment as she had expected .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 13]: Dorothea would have other friends ; Bedford had apparently one in special .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 11]: They would not need her , but -- Jim would !
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 15]: Jim had declared himself to be impervious to the claims of every other woman .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 3]: Poor Jim !
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 5]: Katrine checked herself angrily .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 5]: Why _ poor _ ?
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 16]: This was the first time she had applied the derogatory epithet to her unknown lover .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 14]: She made haste to atone for the slip by an unusual endearment . ''
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 6]: _ Dear _ Jim ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 12]: She repeated to herself , '' _ Dear _ Jim ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 23]: and with a rush of loyalty and gratitude her heart opened to the memory of her unknown lover 's tenderness and understanding .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 12]: `` Nothing can matter to me while I have Jim ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 14]: she told herself thankfully , and fell asleep holding fast to the thought .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 14]: Katrine 's efforts to bring Bedford and Keith together seemed doomed to failure .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 35]: She managed the introduction indeed , but the attempts at conversation which followed were not promising for future relationships , and for the rest of the day the two men avoided each other sedulously .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 62]: It was duty , pure and simple , which made Katrine waylay Keith after dinner , and appear to take it for granted that he would give her his society for the customary half-hour 's promenade round the deck , when in reality her only longing was to escape , and enjoy a continuation of her talk with the newer friend .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 12]: Keith was in a black mood also ; grim , unsmiling .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 15]: His haggard eyes surveyed her with a scrutiny that was the reverse of friendly .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 11]: `` Still busy at your Reform Bill , I see !
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 11]: I had no idea you could be so persistent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 7]: `` Do n't be nasty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 4]: `` Nasty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 4]: he laughed harshly .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 25]: `` What a bread-and-butter Miss it is , with her ` nice ' and ` nasty , ' and little cut-and-dried maxims and beliefs !
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 21]: One can just see the English village where you have lived , and the worthy Victorians who have lived around .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 30]: You knew about six families in all , I presume , and lived in terror of what they would say ; and they also lived in terror of you .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 15]: There is no monarchy so absolute as the Mrs Grundy of a country town .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 39]: And you went on Sunday to the Church -- rather a low church I should say , breathing forth enmity equally against ritualism and dissent -- went twice a day -- '' '' _ And _ Sunday School !
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 7]: Do n't forget Sunday School . ''
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 3]: Sunday School .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 9]: I 'd forgotten the existence of Sunday Schools .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 5]: That revives old memories .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 9]: I went to one myself in prehistoric times .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 7]: Seems odd , does n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 15]: Can you imagine me a small , curled darling in a Sunday School class ?
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 23]: It was a dank , underground cellar of a place , shaped like an amphitheatre , with seats rising one above another .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 19]: We infants sat bunched together in a corner , and the teacher stood before us on the flat .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 14]: She was a plain soul , with three large warts on one cheek .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 15]: I used to gaze at them fascinated , and ponder what could be done .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 17]: The warts interested me more than her words , but I made gallant attempts at attention .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 38]: We were bribed to attend , -- one little card with an illuminated text for good behaviour and attention ; so many cards , one small book ; so many small books , a prize at Christmas .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 6]: I actually won one prize .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 11]: Can you imagine me gaining a Sunday School prize ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 10]: Katrine regarded him thoughtfully with her deep blue eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 32]: The slighting , almost contemptuous tone in which he spoke seemed to hurt her more for his sake than for her own , as proving the invariable bitterness of his mind .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 26]: She was the only soul on board who had sought his friendship , and even to her -- `` Do you ever think -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 18]: she stammered , confused and shy , yet possessed by a gallant resolve to improve the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 11]: `` Do you ever remember the things you heard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 5]: `` Bible stories ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 10]: He laughed again , his harsh , unmirthful laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 13]: `` My good girl , is it possible to _ forget _ ?
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 6]: They are too terribly true .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 11]: I 've _ seen _ them acted before my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 7]: I 've lived through them myself .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 2]: Heavens !
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 11]: how many of those old stories I 've lived through !
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 67]: I 've eaten of the fruit of knowledge -- a liberal repast , and as a result been turned out of my Eden ; I 've wandered in far lands ; I 've defrauded my neighbour , and sold my birthright for , not gold , not silver , not even a mess of pottage -- for a foaming poison which has killed body and soul !
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 15]: I 've sung my penitential psalms -- and , _ gone on sinning _ !
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 17]: I 've sung my Song of Solomon , also , I must not forget that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 16]: He met Katrine 's eyes , widely questioning , and replied with a defiant flash .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 5]: `` You are astonished !
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 15]: You did not associate romance with such a death 's head of a man !
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 5]: Nevertheless it is true .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 13]: There was a woman : _ one _ woman , only one !
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 23]: I worshipped her for five long years ; I worship her still , but all the same I did her to death .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 6]: Oh , let me explain !
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 5]: It was nothing actionable .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 9]: I am not a prisoner fleeing from justice .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 14]: There is no escape from the court before which I shall be tried .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 18]: I would have killed myself a thousand times over sooner than have lifted a hand against her .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 19]: She was my wife , you see , and I loved her , but I broke her heart .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 19]: I believed that in the joy of her I could break loose from the devil which possessed me .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 19]: I _ did _ go free for a few months , and she married me , poor child !
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 3]: knowing nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 12]: Then , _ He _ came back , mightier than before .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 27]: The first time she saw me -- I may live through a thousand hells , and know nothing more awful than the memory of those eyes !
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 32]: She told me herself , weeping in my arms the next day , that she could not love , she could not even endure , ` _ that man _ ! '
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 11]: If he came back -- if she saw him again .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 7]: -- I promised ; I swore .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 31]: A hundred times over I promised and a hundred times over I failed , and her love changed to fear , fear and dread , and a shrinking of flesh .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 19]: She was a frail thing , and she lived in terror of ` _ that man _ . '
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 7]: In terror of him she died .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 22]: When she drew her last breath he was drunk , lying helpless downstairs -- '' `` Oh , do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 5]: gasped Katrine painfully . ''
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 7]: _ Do n't _ tell me !
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 5]: I did n't ask .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 19]: -- I do n't want to hear ... Do n't remind yourself -- '' '' _ Remind _ !
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 7]: Do you think I can forget ?
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 11]: I am not harrowing myself by conjuring up sleeping ghosts .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 7]: That kind of ghost never sleeps .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 16]: It makes no difference to me whether I speak of it , or am silent .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 23]: I have told you for -- '' he turned towards her with a twisted smile , '' _ your own sake _ !
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 9]: You are a good girl , but crude .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 17]: When you have had time to think for yourself , you 'll make a fine woman .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 8]: You 've been living in a shell .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 6]: _ Let yourself go _ !
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 14]: Forget what you 've been taught , and think things out for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 17]: Meantime , I appreciate your good intentions , but -- _ leave me alone _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 5]: Suddenly his eyes blazed .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 4]: `` Great Heavens !
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 15]: If She could n't help me , what can _ you _ do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 22]: He wheeled round and strode away , leaving Katrine to pass through some of the most poignant moments of her life .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 13]: Never before had she come into such intimate touch with human misery .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 24]: Compared with this anguish of remorse , Martin 's grief over the loss of his girl wife seemed a sacred and beautiful thing .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 22]: Never before had she realised at once so overpowering a longing to help , and so profound a conviction of helplessness .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 38]: To be of use to a soul in such straits , one must needs have suffered also , have struggled , and overcome : have risen to a height far beyond that on which she now stood .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 21]: Katrine knew it , acknowledged it to her own soul , with a humility which was in itself a prayer .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 22]: She made her way to the quietest part of the deck , and leaned over the rail , trembling with emotion .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 38]: Twenty-six years of placid , uneventful existence , of calm looking on at life , and then suddenly here she was , in the maelstrom , each new day bringing with it some new and poignant emotion !
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 10]: She felt dazed , bewildered ; filled with humiliation .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 31]: When presently Bedford strolled up nonchalant and smiling , a cigarette in his mouth , his expression changed swiftly as he saw her , and Katrine flinched before his glance .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 25]: Could she have seen herself she would have been astonished , as he was , at the beauty of the pale , tremulous face .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 35]: To her relief he asked no questions , but averting his eyes talked easily on matter-of-fact subjects , not waiting for replies , but content simply to fill in the time till self-possession returned .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 12]: Katrine divined as much , and did not trouble to listen .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 20]: She also was waiting for self-possession , but only so as to be able to confide and be comforted .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 28]: That Bedford could invariably find the right panacea for a wound was a fact already acknowledged with delight , and to-night the need of him was pressing .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 22]: Her inattention grew increasingly obvious , until at length he ceased speaking , and looked down at her with questioning eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 8]: `` You do n't want to talk !
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 22]: Shall I stay , and be quiet , or would you rather I went away , and left you alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 33]: `` Stay , please , _ and _ talk -- only , for the moment my mind is so full of one thing , that I ca n't think of anything else .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 4]: That poor man !
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 8]: he 's been telling me his story .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 18]: -- I ca n't repeat it , but he has also been scorching me for my interference .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 16]: I deserved it , I suppose , for my self-sufficiency , but -- it hurt !
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 3]: Growing pains !
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 5]: Do you remember ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 6]: `` Poor little girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 20]: he said simply ; so simply , so kindly , that there could be no offence in the familiarity .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 14]: `` I was afraid you had given yourself a stiff road to hoe .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 15]: I 've had experience in these cases , and know something about the difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 30]: The trouble is that like many reformers you are beginning at the wrong end , trying to doctor his mind , whereas it 's his body that is sick .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 23]: Drink is a physical disease , and it 's hard luck on its victims that public opinion refuses to realise the fact .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 31]: Imagine a fellow being called a beast -- a degraded beast , disgraceful , disgusting -- all the usual terms , because he was suffering from tuberculosis or heart disease !
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 65]: It 's unthinkable , but a poor wretch who has to fight against a physical craving as fierce as the claws of a wild beast , tearing him , literally tearing , not to be quenched except by the very poison which is going to set him craving again , -- for one kindly , pitying thought , he gets a hurricane of abuse !
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 6]: You and I know better .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 43]: We do n't judge ; we pity the poor fellow from the bottom of our hearts , but I say -- '' suddenly his voice changed to a crisp , boylike note , `` do n't let 's talk about him to-night !
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 7]: It 's such a ripping night .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 7]: We can do him no good .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 7]: Then why spoil our own time ?
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 8]: Let 's talk about happy things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 27]: He threw away his cigarette as he spoke , leaned his arms on the rail , and turned his face towards hers with a twinkling appeal .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 18]: They were close together , and the smiling interchange of glance seemed a good and pleasant thing .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 33]: Katrine was almost ashamed of the speed with which the mental load slipped away , and disappeared ; one glance into the keen grey eyes , and it had vanished into space .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 46]: It was good to stand in the warm night , looking out at the glory of the star-lit heavens , at the ripple of phosphorous on the water , but the beauties of nature were but a secondary cause for the content which enfolded her .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 28]: The primary cause was the presence of the man by her side , the big man with the grave face , and the clear , boylike eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 42]: Katrine was not given to hasty friendships , but in this case there seemed no preliminary stages to live through , for the moment of meeting had acclaimed a mental understanding , which years of intimacy might have failed to ensure .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 28]: She forgot that she had been unhappy , and laughed a soft , girlish little laugh , the tinkle of which struck strangely on her own ears .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 5]: Such a girlish laugh !
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 3]: Let 's !
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 12]: That will be nice ... What shall we talk about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 18]: `` Ourselves , of course , '' he said promptly ; and at that they laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 16]: Katrine tilted her head , and met his eyes with a frank , gay glance .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 35]: `` Was n't it Isabel Carnaby who said that there was really no other subject to talk about but ourselves , just as there was really no other dish than bacon for breakfast ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 7]: `` What about Lloyd George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 26]: They laughed gaily , laughed into each other 's eyes with a sense of intimacy which sent the spirits racing upwards with a mysterious intoxication .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 14]: `` Oh , well , '' Katrine allowed , `` that 's true !
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 7]: But Isabel lived before his days .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 13]: Did you ever play a game of making up Isabel Carnaby conversations ?
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 6]: It 's rather fun . ''
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 5]: `` Not I. . .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 12]: Could n't to save my life ... Far too difficult . ''
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 18]: `` Oh , it 's easy enough , given the right people , and the right hour .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 28]: It would be no use starting it at the beginning of an evening when every one is stiff and strained , but it goes splendidly after supper .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 20]: Isabel begins by giving a definition of some well-known term , and invites every one else to follow suit .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 12]: It is a favourite game of Grizel 's , my sister-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 32]: We always make her Isabel for she is such a beguiling little thing that she is not only witty herself , but spurs up every one else to be witty too .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 56]: One night we took ` _ Bores _ ' for a subject , and she said : ` A bore is a person who remembers all that I say on Sunday , chews a mental cud over it , and throws up masticated morsels of my own conversation to confound my inconsistency on Wednesday . '
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 12]: Then we all said : ` That is quite true ! '
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 6]: and ` Quite so ! '
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 22]: and she addressed each of us and asked : ` And what is your idea of a bore , Mrs Seaton ?
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 11]: Johanna , give us your definition of the term ? '
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 28]: and we each scintillated to the best of our ability , and then mentally adjourned into the kitchen and interviewed the old servant in her turn . ''
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 33]: `` I should be so devoured with anxiety thinking out my own sally that I should n't be able to appreciate my neighbour 's brilliance ... Bores are a pretty prolific subject .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 17]: I should like , just for curiosity , to hear _ your _ definition . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 3]: ` Katrine !
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 16]: let us now have your definition of the term , ' '' quoted Katrine mockingly .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 17]: `` There , you see , you are already starting the game on your own account .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 8]: Why do you want to know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 12]: `` So that I may act contrariwise , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 9]: `` It is true ... Isabel was right .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 10]: Here you are already , back at our bacon !
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 17]: I am afraid , Captain Bedford , that you are very much absorbed in yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 5]: `` Devoted to him !
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 3]: Of course .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 6]: Why should n't I be ?
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 14]: Know him so well , do n't you know -- understand his ways !
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 8]: Capital fellow , when you know him .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 14]: -- A woman asked me once whom I loved best in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 10]: I said : ` Myself , of course . '
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 28]: It was the bed-rock truth ; it is the truth about most solitary people , if they would only admit it , but she was shocked . ''
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 7]: `` I 'm shocked , too .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 23]: Even if it were true , I do n't think one should admit -- '' `` I do n't say it now .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 6]: It would not be true .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 7]: That was some time ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 22]: Katrine 's thoughts flew back with instant recollection to the day before , to the quiet pocketing of the tortoise-shell trifle .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 20]: She waited silently , holding her breath in the intensity of her anxiety , but no explanation was vouchsafed .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 27]: She tossed her head with a restless gesture , and said tentatively : `` You -- you are not in the least what I expected . ''
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 8]: `` What precisely did you expect ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 8]: `` N-othing precisely , but everything different !
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 16]: I thought you 'd be older for one thing , and would look more worn .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 10]: Captain Blair said you were shy and silent . ''
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 9]: `` Blair would say anything but his prayers .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 16]: As a matter of fact I _ was _ paralysingly shy at dinner that night !
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 7]: Glad I concealed it so well .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 14]: It was rather a formidable occasion meeting an -- '' `` Unknown girl !
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 4]: Was I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 23]: Katrine hesitated on the verge of a question , eager yet bashful , and her companion concluded the sentence with mischievous assurance .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 8]: `` What _ I _ had expected ?
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 4]: to an extent .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 25]: I had seen your photographs , and they are as good as photographs can be , but the original always comes as a surprise .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 18]: You look younger , and -- there 's some red in your hair , is n't there ?
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 24]: It pretends to be dark , but this morning when you were sitting in the sun , I 'll swear it was red !
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 20]: And -- if you 'll forgive me -- your nose is n't quite so classic as it was represented !
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 8]: I suspect that photographer of fakes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 22]: `` He filled in the dips , '' said Katrine tracing with a finger tip the delicate irregularities of her nose .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 14]: `` I like dips , '' said Bedford , and they laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 19]: Katrine wondered if he also approved of the ruddy lights which the sun had revealed in her hair .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 28]: She had noticed them once or twice as she stood before her mirror on bright spring mornings , but no one else had commented on the peculiarity .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 50]: She herself had admired the dull-red gleam , she hoped he had done the same , but it was with an air of forced resignation that she spoke again : `` Very well , then , it is settled that I have red hair , and a bobbley nose .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 9]: Please observe that I remain serene and unruffled .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 22]: That proves that I have a sweet and modest disposition , and do n't care a pin how I look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 23]: `` Or what you wear , or whether that gauzy thing round your head is arranged at a becoming angle or not !
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 7]: Can I help in any way ?
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 7]: It seems troublesome to arrange ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 20]: said Bedford coolly as for the third time Katrine 's hand went up to pull forward the chiffon hood .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 15]: She flushed in the moonlight , and pushed it back with an impetuous jerk .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 8]: `` Now my hair will get rough .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 12]: It 's not my fault if it blows into ends . ''
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 11]: `` I like ends , '' said Bedford once more .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 28]: Katrine thanked Providence that _ her _ ends curled , and did not blow over her face in lanky streaks as did the ends of other women .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 20]: Sometimes when she had been out in the wind she had felt it a pity to brush them back .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 21]: She felt a glow of thankfulness for her own fair looks , which was inimitably removed from an ordinary conceit .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 14]: To look pleasant in the eyes of others -- that gave one joy .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 23]: To-morrow she would wear a blue dress ... `` It 's against my upbringing to be untidy , '' she said demurely .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 11]: `` At home I have walked between a double fire .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 17]: The vicar 's wife on one side , and my Sunday School girls on the other .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 23]: Both would have been scandalised by ` ends , ' both expected me to be a model of neatness and decorum . ''
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 8]: She heaved a great sigh of relief .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 15]: `` Oh , I 'm so thankful not to be a model any more !
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 24]: It 's lovely to begin life again , away from criticism , to be free to do and think what I like ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 14]: He stared at her , his eyes intent and searching beneath puckered brows .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 38]: It was a handsome , almost a beautiful face into which he looked : the softened light , the happy mood , even the floating ends of hair combined to give it an air of unusual youth .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 12]: Nevertheless there were lines written thereon which told their own tale .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 18]: Katrine noticed his scrutiny , and questioned him thereon : `` What are you thinking about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 8]: `` You , '' he said simply .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 7]: `` We are talking about ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 22]: You are so young in many ways , younger than your years , but you look -- '' `` Older ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 13]: `` Yes , '' he said again , serenely unconscious of offence .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 9]: `` It 's not a girl 's face .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 14]: There are the marks of trouble , of suffering ... '' Katrine sighed .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 11]: On her lips flickered a smile which was strangely pathetic .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 8]: `` Or of lack of trouble ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 3]: she corrected .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 7]: `` Oh , I mean it .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 13]: It sounds incomprehensible to a man , but a woman would understand .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 30]: Trouble would be easier to bear than the grey , monotonous routine month after month , year after year , which women have to live in small country towns .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 13]: Trouble is educational and ennobling ; monotony cramps growth at the roots .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 32]: I am twenty-six , but there were women ten years older , still young , still pretty , jogtrotting along the same path , year after year , year after year .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 8]: _ Nothing had happened to them _ !
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 9]: No man can understand all that that means .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 7]: _ Nothing had happened _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 5]: Bedford straightened himself significantly .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 10]: `` They should _ make _ things happen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 21]: `` Perhaps in time to come they may , when they are more developed -- they , and their parents !
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 21]: Many well-to-do parents think that their daughters ought to be contented to stay peacefully at home and arrange the flowers .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 23]: I _ had _ a real duty , but in some families nearby there were three or four women-girls _ pottering _ !
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 13]: I went to see one of them on her birthday last year .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 17]: When I wished her many happy returns she shrank , as if I had hurt her .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 5]: ` Another year ! '
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 14]: ` Three hundred and sixty-five days ... _ And all alike _ ! '
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 15]: It was fear that she felt , poor soul ; fear of the blank !
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 6]: You ca n't understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 5]: `` Personally , no .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 7]: Monotony has not been my cross .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 33]: When a man is knocking about the world he is inclined to envy the people who can vegetate peacefully at home , but thirty-six years of stagnation is a killing business ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 9]: He looked down at her with steady scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 21]: `` I am glad _ you _ had courage to cut yourself free before it came to that point . ''
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 11]: `` But I am different ... I told you so .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 20]: I had my work , '' protested Katrine , flushing , `` and moreover something _ did _ happen .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 13]: Fate came to my aid , and practically forced me away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 4]: `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 20]: Once more Bedford leaned his elbows on the rail , and bent towards her with a keen interrogative glance .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 11]: `` Is it permissible to ask in what form ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 7]: Why on earth need she blush ?
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 20]: Katrine mentally railed at herself , but the more she fumed the hotter blazed the colour in her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 46]: Plying such a flag of betrayal it seemed obviously absurd to reply by a prim : `` My brother married , and no longer required my services , '' and in Bedford 's equally prim `` Quite so , '' the scepticism seemed thinly veiled .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 13]: There was silence for several moments , while both gazed fixedly ahead .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 18]: Without looking in his direction Katrine knew exactly the expression which her companion 's face would wear .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 11]: The lips closed tight , drooping slightly to one side .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 9]: The chin dropped , the eyes unnaturally grave .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 16]: Strange how clearly his changes of expression had already stamped themselves upon her mental retina !
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 27]: She knew how he would look , what she could not guess was what he would _ think _ ... What _ would _ he think !
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 16]: That preposterous blush would surely suggest a reason more personal than a brother 's marriage .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 32]: A love affair , a lover , but mercifully a lover in England , since she had already explained that Jack Middleton and his wife were her sole friends in India .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 27]: that would be the explanation , a persistent lover -- a lover who had been refused , a lover left behind to recover at his ease .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 9]: Katrine 's self-possession was restored by this assurance .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 42]: Certainly she had had lovers ... She adopted what was evidently intended to be an `` Isabel Carnaby air , '' and demanded lightly : `` And now , Captain Bedford , it is your turn to confess your troubles . ''
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 10]: `` I have none , '' he said instantly .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 11]: He looked full into her face with his twinkling eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 11]: `` Or if I had -- I have forgotten . ''
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 8]: The next morning broke hot and still .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 20]: The breeze had died down and its absence was shown in pallid faces , and limp , exhausted attitudes .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 10]: A few daring spirits waxed apoplectic over deck sports .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 54]: Jackey , the mischievous , roamed from one deck chair to another , teasing , protesting , whimpering , and ultimately curled up in a corner of the deck , and falling asleep became instantly converted into a vision of exquisite childhood , all pink cheeks , golden curls , and rounded limbs .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 51]: As for Katrine she felt very tired , very lazy , very thankful that her hair was curled by nature not by art , very content to lie back in her luxurious chair and be amused and waited upon by a man who appeared abundantly satisfied to be so employed .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 45]: The voyage had turned , so far as she was concerned , into one long _ tete-a-tete _ , for Bedford had presented so impenetrable a front to would-be acquaintances , that he was now left severely alone to devote himself to her amusement .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 44]: Mrs Mannering joked and quizzed , Keith kept sourly afar , the passengers stared with mounting curiosity , and Katrine , who had lived all her life beneath the tyranny of `` They say , '' amazed herself by a sudden reckless indifference .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 6]: _ Let _ them say !
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 4]: Let them stare !
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 4]: Let them laugh !
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 7]: -- It meant nothing to her .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 22]: These days were her own ; not an hour , not a moment should be wasted though a whole world criticised .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 57]: -- It is a truism that in the growth of friendship a day at sea is equal to a week on shore ; less than a week had passed since Bedford joined the ship , yet Katrine acknowledged to herself that they had reached a degree of intimacy which she at least had never before experienced .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 78]: There was not a subject which had engrossed her attention , not a problem which had baffled , not a hope or a fear , an ambition or a dream , save only those which concerned Jim Blair , which she had not discussed at length with this friend of a few days , and each fresh discussion left her more conscious of help and sympathy , and of profound admiration for his broad-minded , open-hearted character .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 42]: Now the high-water mark of intimacy had been reached when silence could be prolonged without apology , a vibrant silence broken at length by a remark which but put into words the point to which the thoughts of each had arrived .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 20]: Katrine had at first been amused and delighted at this similarity of thought ; later on she grew afraid .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 11]: This morning the great heat was not conducive to conversation .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 42]: Katrine held a book on her lap , and from time to time flicked over pages , but she was too languid even to read ; from time to time her eyes met Bedford 's and they smiled a wordless greeting .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 25]: The morning was not half over , but already her eyelids drooped heavily ; she shut the book , and composed herself to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 12]: Suddenly , startlingly , the torpid silence was rent in twain .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 15]: A woman 's voice rose in a shriek -- high , frenzied , appalled .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 20]: As by an echo it was repeated on every side , until the very air vibrated with the sound .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 32]: The serried rows of chairs were emptied , and thrust aside ; white-faced , gasping , the passengers rushed to the rail , and hung over , desperately scanning the sea .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 35]: The vibrant cry gained volume ; its incoherence took shape , and became definite words -- words among those the most dreaded in a life on sea ... '' _ Man overboard _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 29]: Katrine had leaped with the rest , had rushed to the gunwale to strain her eyes over the retreating line of foam left by the vessel 's progress .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 52]: Startled she was , and shocked , but the true realisation of the tragedy was delayed until the moment when , afar off , clear in the blaze of the sun , two arms appeared suddenly above the waves , groped into space , flung themselves widely apart , and disappeared !
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 17]: The sight of those helpless hands brought a terrible realisation ; they tore at the heart .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 28]: Every face on board the great vessel was blanched with horror : women wept and clung ; men stood grim and silent , with lips tightly set .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 36]: At the first sounding of the alarm , a life-belt had been tossed into the sea , attached to a flag , which made a patch of colour to mark the spot of the disaster .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 42]: It was horrible to see how far that mark was left behind , before , with a jar which sent a quiver throughout the ship 's great bulk , the engines reversed , in response to the order from the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 37]: Meantime the fourth officer and his men were clambering with cat-like agility into the boat suspended over the stern-davits , which eager hands began to lower , even before the last man had reached his perch .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 52]: Another moment , and the crew were bending to their oars , and the boat was speeding through the water towards that floating patch of red and blue ; but there had been no further waving of hands ; the straining eyes had caught no second glimpse of a dark head .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 33]: Katrine , shaking and gasping , felt the touch of a quieting hand on her arm , and releasing her hold of the gunwale , swayed backward with a sob of relief .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 16]: She did not need to look ; the strong , quiet touch was identification enough .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 9]: She needed him , and he was there .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 12]: She closed her eyes , gripping fast to the outstretched arm .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 8]: `` Will he be able to swim ?
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 8]: Can he keep up long enough ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 5]: `` I hope so .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 5]: The life-belt is there .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 32]: Even if he is not , men are brought back to life , you know , after hours of unconsciousness ... He is bound to rise again ... '' Katrine shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 18]: A moment before she had been exhausted with heat ; now hands and feet were icy cold .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 43]: For the first time in her life she was brought face to face with death , and the violent change of scene , combined with the inability to do anything but stand still and watch , made a hard test of endurance .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 38]: She managed to keep quiet , to refrain from the tears and sobs of the surrounding women , but she clung like a child to Bedford 's arms , and rested her head against his broad shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 56]: For the moment the action was as impersonal as if he had been a stone or a log ; her physical condition necessitated a prop ; she clung to the nearest support out of a natural , unthinking impulse , and just as naturally , just as simply , he cradled her in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 14]: The suffocating moments crawled by , the while the onlookers held their breath .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 47]: The boat had reached the spot marked by the red flag , was drifting slowly round and round , the men 's faces bent low over the water , but there came no sign of the white , waving arms ; the dark , ball-like head .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 15]: Katrine gasped a weak enquiry : `` I thought -- _ three times _ ?
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 14]: If it is one of the crew , surely he can swim ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 5]: Bedford made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 33]: She raised her head , caught sight of a set face , and cried again , with a still sharper edge of surprise : `` It is _ not _ a sailor !
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 4]: A passenger then ?
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 7]: Some one -- we know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 9]: Her thoughts flew swiftly over the familiar forms .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 44]: A jovial head of a family , seated at her own table in the saloon ; a young husband assiduously waiting upon a pretty new wife ; the handsome pursuer of steamship flirtations , -- one after another their figures rose before her .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 21]: These were all young , thoughtless , daring ; a moment 's recklessness might have precipitated them to their fate .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 35]: An hour ago , five minutes ago , they had been nothing to her , less than nothing , now the mere tie of humanity rent her heart at the thought of their peril .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 14]: She lifted her eyes to the face above her , panting breathless enquiries .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 4]: `` Tell me !
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 4]: Tell me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 32]: `` My -- my dear girl , '' stammered the man huskily , `` My poor girl -- '' He passed his arm more firmly round her waist , `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 23]: you know him , I did not mean to tell you yet , but I am afraid you 'll have to know !
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 9]: It 's Vernon Keith -- '' `` No !
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 3]: No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 12]: Katrine fought with outstretched hands , striving to push him away .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 26]: She no longer needed to lean ; the shock had strung her into vitality , and a passionate denial of the tragic reversals of life .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 20]: An hour ago she had beckoned to Keith as he passed by , and had fed him with chocolates .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 18]: He had eaten , smiled , and grimaced , and she had rated him for his ingratitude .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 35]: It was impossible that a man could eat chocolates , and take part in the trivial chit-chat of shipboard , and within sixty minutes be fighting for his life in those churning waves ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 7]: _ It 's impossible _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 12]: `` I was talking to him here , an hour ago .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 17]: He was well -- as well as usual ... we talked -- he _ smiled _ !
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 12]: It is _ impossible _ that he can be dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 7]: `` They may find him yet .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 7]: It 's only a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 4]: Everything is possible .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 10]: You can do no good by waiting , dear .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 6]: Come and sit down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 17]: But Katrine thrust out her arm , pushing him away once more , shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 6]: How could she sit down ?
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 5]: How think of herself ?
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 16]: She leaned her elbows on the rail , and buried her head in her hands .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 30]: Her brain was racing , she was shuddering with suspense , yet through all her misery her perceptions had grasped one word , and photographed it in lasting remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 4]: `` Dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 8]: Bedford had called her `` Dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 7]: For a minute there was silence .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 22]: Then she spoke a few words in so low and trembling a voice that he had to bend to catch them .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 3]: `` How ?
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 37]: How did he -- '' He caught his breath : she heard the sound , and divined that for this man the worst sting of the tidings lay in the necessity for telling it to her .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 5]: `` He ... jumped !
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 5]: There were people about .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 4]: They saw it .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 38]: He was walking about , began to cough , leaned over the rail ... Before they grasped what he was about -- '' He stopped short , and Katrine answered with unexpected composure : `` I understand !
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 11]: It overwhelmed him suddenly , -- a frenzy of impatience .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 6]: He could bear no more .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 24]: I understand -- I think now , I could almost hope -- '' She turned suddenly and laid her hand on his arm .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 19]: The hysteria of the last minutes had disappeared , she was weak and spent , and breathlessly subdued .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 14]: `` Take me away , please , where I ca n't see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 7]: Bedford half led , half carried .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 29]: Katrine found herself extended on a long chair drawn for ` ard , to a spot where the bridge cut off all view of what was happening astern .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 27]: She was cold , and he was rubbing her hands ; his touch had a magnetic warmth , to which she surrendered with a vague content .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 19]: The hands which she had noticed and admired had a beauty of touch , as well as line .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 9]: She watched their movements with a mechanical interest .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 21]: For the moment there appeared nothing strange in the fact that this comparative stranger was performing so intimate a task .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 17]: She needed comfort , and he gave it ; that was the simple , natural fact .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 22]: Presently he raised his eyes to hers with an enquiring glance , and she made a pitiful attempt at a smile .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 9]: `` I was his only friend on board .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 6]: Was I -- kind enough ?
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 11]: Do you think if I had been kinder -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 7]: `` You were an angel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 16]: he assured her warmly , `` and , humanly speaking , nothing could have helped !
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 5]: His brain was diseased .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 31]: It was not deliberate intent , one is sure of that -- just the impulse of a tortured animal , to end it all , and be at peace . ''
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 3]: Katrine nodded .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 15]: `` He told me that at best it was only a question of months .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 6]: We are well and strong .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 6]: We ca n't judge ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 27]: Katrine caught her breath on that last word , her brain pierced by the memory of that death in life which threatened her companion 's life .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 18]: `` At least , '' she continued in a lower note , `` you _ can _ !
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 38]: You have been tried , but you are stronger , more patient ... '' Bedford 's face set ; he turned aside , not answering , and they sat in silence during an interminable hour of waiting .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 31]: Nothing could be seen of the rescue party , but the sounds from the ship , above all , the _ lack _ of sound , told its own tale .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 38]: There came no quick , acclaiming cry , no ringing cheer ; only at last the dull splash of the oars , and the creak of the ropes as the returning boat was hoisted to the davits .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 25]: Bedford roused himself , crept silently away , and returning five minutes later seated himself as silently on the floor by Katrine 's side .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 47]: She did not turn her head , nor question him by so much as a glance , but when once more the ship shivered beneath the throbs of the engine , and the waters raced back from the prow , the tears streamed down her face .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 11]: `` I 'm ... _ not _ sorry I. . .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 16]: I did n't want him to be brought back to more suffering and -- shame !
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 17]: But it seems cruel to go on as if nothing had happened , -- nothing mattered !
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 22]: The only comfort is that for him , it must have been -- _ quick _ ... He was so weak .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 5]: He rose only once .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 6]: Say it was quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 5]: `` Very quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 4]: Bedford assured her .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 25]: Not for his life would he have hinted at the awful explanation of that solitary rising , which was now generally accepted on board .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 10]: He prayed that no one would enlighten her ignorance .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 19]: Once again he stole away , and returned in a few minutes , carrying a cup of tea .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 36]: Life must go on for the living , though death hovers at hand , and already the saloon was filled with a pallid crowd , who seemed to find unusual refreshment in the postponed meal .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 31]: A cup of tea , a rest , a bath , then the passengers would dress for dinner , and brushing aside the cloud , declare that , poor beggar !
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 7]: he had not much to lose .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 30]: By the morrow the incident would be discreetly banned ... Katrine drank her tea , grateful for it like the rest , her face white and disfigured by tears .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 17]: During that long hour of silent waiting she had looked into life with a terrifying insight .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 11]: So one could suffer at the fate of a stranger !
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 15]: How would it be for the _ one _ individuality which made the world ?
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 106]: She shrank at the thought , telling herself , as the untried are pitifully wont to do , that such a possibility was beyond endurance , and therefore could not be ; knowing full well in her heart that a time must surely come when she in her turn must feel the rack ... Vernon Keith had been the acquaintance of a week ; for a week to come she would look involuntarily for the gaunt form ; another week , and in the glamour of new surroundings his image would fade into obscurity ; in a few months his very name might be forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 51]: What she was suffering now was but shock and regret , impersonal , pitiful regret , but , if it had been another man -- _ this _ man , for example , with the brown face , and the grey eyes , who now sat at her feet -- ?
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 13]: Katrine sat up hurriedly , and pushed the hair from her brow .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 26]: The hand which held the cup was shaking so violently that Bedford heard , and took it from her , to place upon the deck .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 15]: `` Do n't you think you could lie down , and get a rest ?
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 6]: Shall I bring Mrs Mannering ?
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 29]: You ought to be perfectly quiet and away from the crowd -- '' Katrine looked at him vaguely as though only half understanding the purport of his words .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 3]: `` Perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 3]: Later on .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 35]: There was something I wanted to say ... '' She was silent for a moment , and then added with the simple inconsequence of a child , `` I 'm engaged , you know !
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 6]: Not definitely , but virtually .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 10]: Engaged to be married to -- a good man !
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 5]: You are good too .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 7]: I wanted you to know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 20]: Bedford twisted the teaspoon in his fingers , laid it down at a new angle , lifted it again .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 19]: His face was hidden , but Katrine saw the brown neck flame darkly red against the flannel coat .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 16]: When he spoke , however , it was the most calm and level of voices .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 19]: `` However good he may be , Miss Beverley , he is not good enough for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 17]: A few minutes later he rose , and walked quietly away in search of Mrs Mannering .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY SIX .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 7]: The next morning Katrine slept late .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 39]: Physically she felt tired and spent ; mentally , despite the shock of Vernon Keith 's tragic end , she was conscious of a feeling of relief , as though a weight had been lifted from her mind .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 30]: Reviewing the events of the day before , she flushed to think of the inconsequent manner in which she had announced the fact of her understanding with Jim Blair .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 8]: How had she come to do it ?
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 6]: What exactly had she said ?
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 24]: Her mental condition at the time of speaking had been so deranged that she had no clear recollection of the sequence of events .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 106]: She _ hoped _ there had been nothing startling or unusual about the announcement , that Captain Bedford had not thought it unnecessary and uncalled for , but even if things were different from her hopes , she was still thankful that on that wave of impulse she had spoken and confessed the truth , for from the moment of her meeting with Bedford -- not the formal meeting in the saloon of the ship , but that other speechless encounter in the streets of Port Said , she had felt oppressed by a sense of disloyalty , which no amount of reasoning could dissolve .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 36]: The personality of Jim Blair , as revealed through the medium of pen and ink , had become suddenly a shadowy , intangible thing when compared with the magnetism of this live man 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 45]: Not once , but a hundred times over , had Katrine regretted the little bundle of letters securely packed in a box in the hold -- those tender , humorous , pre-eminently sane letters which had taken so strong a hold of her imagination .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 63]: She had packed them away for security 's sake , telling herself that she would receive others at Port Said and Bombay , and that on the way out to meet the very man himself , she would have no need of written words , but the Port Said letter had proved a disappointment , and a need _ had _ arisen !
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 21]: It would have meant much to her during the last days to have had those written words before her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 10]: After breakfast Mrs Mannering descended , bustling and energetic .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 8]: `` Now then -- up with you !
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 12]: No use lying here , and glumping over what 's past .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 5]: One man 's gone .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 17]: God rest his soul , and give him a better chance than he ever had here !
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 10]: but there 's another one waiting for you upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 14]: If you 've any sense you 'll be up and join him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 14]: Katrine sat up obediently , and began drawing on her long silk stockings .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 11]: `` Mrs Mannering , -- what 's your religion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 9]: Her companion started , stared , and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 10]: any way I can tell you _ yours _ !
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 4]: Narrow Church ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 4]: she said chuckling .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 5]: `` Eh , what ?
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 11]: Hit it at once , have n't I now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 16]: Katrine settled the heel of her stocking , and raised a flushed , disquieted face .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 5]: `` I suppose so .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 2]: Y-es !
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 3]: For myself .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 13]: But I do n't expect every one to think the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 7]: `` Then , bless your heart !
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 8]: you 're not so narrow after all !
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 14]: Believe what helps you most , but allow other people the same privilege .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 14]: Them 's my sentiments , my dear , and -- for the rest !
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 35]: -- we 'll find out some day , and there 'll be some rare old shocks for the sticklers who 've got it all cut and dried , and expect creation to chant Amen .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 8]: What put you on the religious tack ?
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 12]: The thought of that poor sinner who went out yesterday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 14]: I have been thinking -- wondering where he -- '' `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 9]: the woman 's voice struck a deeper note .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 17]: `` If we knew that , my dear , life would be simpler for us all .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 23]: You 'll find some wise folks who 'd tell you in detail , up to the fifth and sixth stages of development .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 7]: I 'm not taking any myself .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 24]: I prefer to wait till it 's time to move on , and find out for myself , and meantime , -- well !
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 18]: my lights may be dim , but they 're burning , my dear , they 're burning !
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 57]: There are people on earth who would laugh themselves sick at the thought of Nance Mannering talking religion ; your good vicar would probably give me a wide berth , but I 've got my own principles , and , please God , I 'll keep 'em ... That 's a good man , that Bedford .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 7]: He carries it in his face .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 11]: Going to fall in love with you all right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 11]: `` Oh , _ not _ '' contradicted Katrine sharply .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 22]: She stood up , shook back her tangled mane of hair , and began to brush it in long even sweeps .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 13]: Her face was hidden , but her voice was charged with eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 3]: `` Never !
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 24]: He has known me only for a few days , and besides I 've told him that there is -- some one else !
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 41]: I 'm not engaged ; please remember that , but there _ is _ something , -- an understanding , between me and another man , -- enough in any case to make anything else impossible , on either side .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 30]: There was no _ need _ to tell Captain Bedford ; we are the merest acquaintances , but it seemed wise to explain ... '' `` Jest so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 5]: agreed Mrs Mannering significantly .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 18]: `` Since , of course , we are all aware that forbidden fruit loses its charm . ''
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 63]: The next moment , to Katrine 's disgust , she began humming to herself a succession of nursery rhymes : `` Mary had a little lamb , Its fleece was w-hite as snow ... Jack fell down and broke his crown , and Jill came tumbling -- '' Chuckling she left the cabin , while Katrine tugged viciously at a knotted lock .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 20]: `` She can be nice enough when she likes , but sometimes I _ hate _ that woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 15]: Up on the deck beneath the double white awnings the atmosphere was delightfully reassuring .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 24]: A strong wind had arisen , and the water was dashing up against the sides of the vessel in powdery columns of foam .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 12]: The mountains had disappeared and there was no land in sight .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 20]: Katrine felt a distinct surprise ; geographical studies had not prepared her to find the Red Sea so large !
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 33]: By common consent the tragedy of the day before was banished from conversation , and the different little companies of friends were grouped about talking and reading after the ordinary morning fashion .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 25]: Bedford came forward to greet Katrine , looking cool and big in his loose white clothes , and altogether unembarrassed and at his ease .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 32]: As usual a string of children followed at his heels , foremost among them that `` Jackey '' who had been his devout admirer since the episode of his own defeat .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 51]: They scowled at Katrine , as the cause of their hero 's defection , but he waved them away with good-natured decision , and led her forward to a corner of the deck where stood two chairs , and a small table on which was placed a mysterious cardboard box .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 15]: `` You are going to be amused this morning , '' he announced breezily .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 12]: `` Talk is forbidden , so I 've borrowed a toy .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 7]: A jig-saw in four hundred pieces .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 6]: How 's that for high ?
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 13]: You and I are going to get it out before lunch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 7]: Katrine 's aspect was not enthusiastic .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 3]: `` Jig-saw !
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 7]: A puzzle , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 5]: I have never tried .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 8]: Is n't it rather a fag ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 7]: `` You wait and see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 11]: The brown fingers rained the wooden morsels upon the table .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 19]: `` You _ think _ it a fag , until you begin -- then it 's a possession !
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 25]: There 's a man in the regiment who has 'em sent up from Bombay , and we have a sweepstake for the quickest solutions .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 28]: I once sat up half the night , over three horses in a meadow ; brown beggars , all of 'em , as like as three pins .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 31]: Everybody 's bits belonged to everybody else , as much as to himself , and the rest was a mass of green stuff , cut in points , diabolically alike .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 12]: This is a locked fellow ; all the better for shipboard .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 8]: It 's the dickens when they joggle .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 6]: Plenty of colour , too .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 8]: That 's good for a start . ''
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 7]: `` Where is the picture ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 4]: asked Katrine innocently .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 30]: She was bored at the prospect of the jig-saw , but relieved at the geniality of Bedford 's manner , and anxious to respond to his efforts towards amusement .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 35]: It was a shock to hear that there was _ no _ picture , and that the mass of pieces before her were to be sorted with no clue whatever as to their meaning .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 7]: `` How does one begin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 14]: was the awed question , and at that Bedford 's smile deepened . ''
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 5]: _ Cela depend _ !
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 7]: I am rather interested to see .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 12]: There are two ways , and you shall choose between them .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 46]: You can look out all the edges , straight , you see , like this ; study the grain of the wood , make up your frame , and gradually work towards the centre -- that 's one way , and perhaps the most common .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 50]: On the other hand you can abandon method , and dash for the colours , make up little blocks here and there , half a dozen at a time perhaps , and look out for a chance of fitting them together , leaving the frame to look after itself .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 5]: You take your choice .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 6]: Which will you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 15]: Katrine bent over the pieces , turning them right side up with rapid fingers .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 35]: She saw a mass of dull grey green , a second of baffling white and grey , a third of a pronounced white , and dotted among them welcome patches of blue and red .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 6]: `` Colour , please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 4]: she cried quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 17]: `` Let 's dash for the colours , and trust to luck for the rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 5]: `` Right ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 9]: he said , sweeping the pieces towards him .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 39]: Katrine had an intuition that he approved of her choice , but he made no comment , and together they bent over the detached fragments of blue and red , which appeared at this stage so dishearteningly alike .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 16]: Katrine was utterly at sea , but Bedford 's greater experience soon scented a clew .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 17]: `` The blue is sky , which goes on top ; the light beggars are clouds .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 8]: Here 's a quaint hunchback little chap .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 12]: Look out for a scoop for him as a start . ''
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 7]: `` Here 's a scoop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 13]: cried Katrine , picking out another fragment , and wonder of wonders !
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 27]: it fitted , -- absolutely , unmistakably fitted into every curve , so that there could be no doubt as to its right to be there .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 16]: To fit a piece at the very first effort , -- here was success indeed !
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 22]: Bedford cheered , Katrine hitched her chair nearer the table , rubbing her hands with an altogether ridiculous sense of elation .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 4]: `` How fine !
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 5]: _ And _ easy !
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 6]: Much easier than I imagined .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 6]: Where 's the next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 52]: `` The next is probably at the bottom of the Indian Ocean , or will pretend to be , until we 've exhausted ourselves looking for it , and have gone on to something else , when it will jump out and , figuratively speaking , hit us in the face .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 7]: It 's a way they have .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 6]: What about this person ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 10]: `` Certainly not ; you want a jagged edge .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 8]: Nor that , it 's too square .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 12]: I 'm afraid you have not much eye for contour ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 6]: `` Nor you for colour !
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 14]: That shade 's too light ... Here 's a fellow like a button-hook .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 5]: Where 's his button ?
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 24]: I knew an old maid who used to try each blessed bit in turn , until she 'd gone through the whole fandango .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 25]: If it shows a well-regulated mind to work at the rim , what does _ that _ mean in the way of perseverance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 23]: Katrine 's quest for the button was disturbed by the reflection that she had evidently proved herself devoid of a well-regulated mind .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 35]: Regarded as a test of character , her `` dash for the colours '' would seem to prove a predisposition towards impulse and daring , the last qualities of which she was usually accused .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 69]: Friends at home had agreed in pronouncing Katrine Beverley all that was prudent and cautious , and she herself had agreed in their verdict , yet surely those qualities had been upon the surface only , since it was this very prudent and cautious maid who had exchanged love letters with an unknown man -- who was even now on her way across the world to meet him !
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 20]: `` I think , '' said a small voice suddenly , `` the other way is better after all .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 16]: I think , if you do n't mind , I 'll try the frame ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 5]: Bedford lifted his face .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 36]: It was nearer to Katrine than it had ever been before ; startlingly near ; in the momentary glance she discovered wrinkles hitherto unnoticed , a fleck of brown in the iris of one eye .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 30]: Bedford saw a wave of colour mounting to the roots of soft brown hair , eyes of dark blue , their beauty heightened by the contrast of that flush .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 23]: `` Now I wonder , '' he said thoughtfully , `` I wonder just what mental excursion brought you to that decision !
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 12]: A moment ago you were so violently on the other track !
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 10]: Is it a journey that one might share ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 37]: Katrine shook her head , stretching her hand to grope for the first straight edge , but the brown fingers swept them away , and a masterful voice cried : `` No , you do n't !
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 13]: You 've made your choice , and you 'll stick to it .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 28]: We 'll see this thing through as we 've begun , '' He studied her with twinkling , curious eyes , taking no pity on her embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 9]: `` I 'd like to follow that journey !
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 5]: What started your travels ?
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 4]: Something I said ?
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 7]: What _ did _ I say ?
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 5]: Blessed if I remember .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 10]: You take yourself very seriously , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 16]: It 's not a matter of life and death how one works out a jig-saw .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 5]: Here 's the button !
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 12]: He 's been staring us in the face all the time .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 7]: Now it 's a fork ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 11]: Katrine was fumbling industriously at another corner of the table .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 23]: `` I 've fitted two bits of the red , but I have n't an _ idea _ what it 's about .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 8]: It seems divided into small squares . ''
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 5]: `` A wall perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 3]: Bricks . ''
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 9]: Bedford examined the pieces with a practised eye .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 3]: evidently bricks .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 11]: There was a bit somewhere with a rim of blue .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 9]: That must be the junction with the sky .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 7]: Let 's work at that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 30]: Katrine worked for ten minutes on end , resorted in desperation to the old maid 's expedient , and affixed each blue bit in turns to the obstinate red .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 66]: When each persistently refused to fit , impatience seized her , and an impulse to dash her hands wildly over the board , when suddenly , inexplicably , a piece which had hitherto obstinately refused to fit , repented itself after the manner of jig-saw pieces , and slid meekly into its place , exhibiting thereby an enlightening boundary of brick wall against blue sky .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 26]: The tingling eagerness to continue that line , to discover whereto it led , was a revelation of the inherent childishness of the human heart .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 48]: Katrine jumped on her seat , scuffled among the pieces with claw-like fingers , breathed loud and deep , while Bedford looked on , smiling to himself , and flicking likely pieces towards her , so that to her might fall the satisfaction of continuing the chain .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 27]: Above all things he was anxious to keep her amused , and to prevent her thoughts from turning to the tragic event of the day before .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 8]: Last evening she had looked pitifully shaken .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 28]: Mrs Mannering had reported a distressed night ; he dreaded each fresh happening of the monotonous life which would link it with the day that had gone .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 14]: The first jar came with the partaking of the eleven o'clock deck lunch .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 37]: Katrine 's face blanched suddenly as she raised it from the table to confront a steward , bearing the glass of milk and soda , and the bars of chocolate which were her own chosen refreshment .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 16]: A shake of the head dismissed the man , but the mischief had been done .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 50]: Impossible now not to recall how , twenty-four hours ago , she had beckoned a gaunt figure to her side , and insisted upon sharing with him her feast , goaded by his suffering air to put forth little womanly wiles , which he should be unable to refuse .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 11]: Involuntarily she turned her head to glance along the deck .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 10]: It was incredible that he should not be there !
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 8]: The tears rose slowly in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 10]: `` I say , I 've made a discovery !
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 10]: This motley grey stuff is a mass of lilies !
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 27]: I 've put three pieces together , and there it is as plain as a pikestaff -- a lily complete , and others in the background .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 8]: They 'll grow against the wall . ''
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 11]: `` Do you believe in prayers for the dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 19]: Bedford started , met deep , pleading eyes and realised that for the moment the jig-saw must wait .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 9]: `` I do n't believe in the dead !
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 7]: Does that help you at all ?
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 30]: Any prayers or thoughts which you have used here , with the intent of helping a fellow creature , can hardly be limited by the one sense of sight .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 11]: I believe in prayers for the _ living _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 12]: The distress in Katrine 's eyes changed into a soft radiance .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 17]: `` Oh , I am _ glad _ you said that , I 'm glad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 6]: `` That smooths out everything .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 7]: I 'm so grateful to you .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 21]: It would be a comfort to me to feel I could go on -- '' `` Helping that poor soul ?
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 5]: Of course it would .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 25]: Send out your sweet thoughts , then they 'll reach him right enough , but for pity 's sake _ do n't _ cry !
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 20]: _ That _ does n't help him , and it seriously disturbs another man , on a lower plane .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 21]: As a pure religious duty now , do n't you think you could range these lilies against the wall ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 7]: `` I 'll -- try ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 9]: Katrine answered between a sob and a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 16]: Veritably that puzzle was a godsend this morning , claiming her interest in absurd disproportion .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 34]: There were periods of fruitless searchings when _ ennui _ and impatience hovered at hand , but inevitably at that very moment success intervened , and brought with it a renewal of zest .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 32]: Half a dozen blocks of substantial sizes were strewn about the table , but so far each remained separate and distinct , and seemed to have no connection with the other .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 16]: Katrine , eyeing them impatiently , was once more inclined to regret her earlier decision .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 11]: `` I wonder if this is really the best way !
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 8]: We do n't seem to get on .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 22]: The background _ has _ to be fitted in some time , and it might be better to get it over .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 8]: Slow and sure wins the race ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 30]: Bedford lifted a jagged fragment in his hand , examined it carefully , and bent over the table as if looking for a place into which it might fit .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 13]: `` The theory , '' he said thoughtfully , `` is correct .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 4]: Like many theories !
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 11]: But the prizes of life are not for the prudent .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 31]: If we worked out our problems step by step , you and I , we might avoid some difficulties ; incidentally , also , we should miss something else ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 9]: He tilted his head , lifting narrowed eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 7]: `` The _ thrill _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 4]: he said deeply .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 8]: `` We should miss the thrill . ''
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 34]: The unexpectedness of the word , the tone in which it was uttered , the expression on the face so close to her own , smote Katrine with the force of a blow .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 20]: Literally she could not speak ; her heart seemed to stop beating as she waited for his next word .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 14]: `` People who choose the surer way have no doubt their own reward .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 32]: The pattern works out before their eyes , bit by bit , step by step , each moment bringing with it the same satisfaction -- no more , and no less .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 71]: When one dashes for the colours , as you and I have agreed to do to-day , there is a time of blur and confusion , when the future is chaos , but that time passes , and gives place to a moment when suddenly , unexpectedly , the link is found ... One link , an insignificant trifle , such as I hold in my hand , and presto !
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 20]: all is made plain ... The pieces fit , chaos gives place to order , the picture is revealed .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 9]: Then one can work confidently at the background .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 6]: It is no longer uninteresting .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 9]: It has its reason , its place . ''
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 33]: His voice had still that new , deep tone ; the sound of it , the look in his eyes had a significance which could surely not refer only to a toy .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 38]: For one long , tingling moment the blue eyes and the grey held each other , in a thrilling gaze , then they fell , and with swift , dramatic touches Bedford proceeded to illustrate his words .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 62]: The jagged fragment held between finger and thumb fell into its rightful place , the great block of pieces to the right turned upside down beneath a flattened hand revealed an outline which fitted line for line , curve for curve , into the block to the left ; the combined mass showed unmistakable anchorages for the small blocks scattered around .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 57]: There revealed before Katrine 's eyes was the patch of sky , the line of the long red wall , the tangled bank of lilies ; there also was a long sweep of unbroken white which now showed as a dress ; a woman 's dress , with a delicate hand half hidden among the folds .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 19]: More marvellous still , a glimpse of a delicate face looked out from the enveloping folds of veil .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 13]: Where in the name of magic had that face managed to hide ?
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 12]: `` It is a nun walking in a garden of lilies !
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 8]: What a pity she is a nun .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 9]: She looks too sweet to live alone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 22]: said Bedford carelessly , `` Now the excitement is over , and we have all the grey bits to fill in .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 4]: How dull ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 6]: cried Katrine in her turn .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 18]: If _ he _ could be cool and calm , pride forbade that she should lag behind .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 31]: She took an early opportunity of summoning Mrs Mannering to help in the construction of the picture , and for the rest of the morning the conversation was strictly impersonal .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 25]: `` We have had bright weather and dull , we have had smooth seas and rough , and now at last we have fog !
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 28]: It 's experience , '' pronounced Katrine reflectively , `` but , '' she shuddered , `` it 's an experience I 'd as soon be without !
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 23]: There 's something eerie and gruesome about sailing through an invisible sea , where there 's not even enough air to breathe .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 5]: One feels shut in !
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 8]: I think I 'm a little afraid .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 8]: Do _ you _ like it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 22]: `` I have never met any one who _ liked _ a fog at sea , but I am not afraid .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 8]: There 's no need for fear . ''
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 3]: Bedford smiled .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 42]: He had discarded white clothing in favour of a grey suit , a cap to match was pressed down over his head , he was all grey to match the mist , even his skin seemed tinged with the same shade .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 9]: Katrine shuddered again as she looked him over .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 8]: `` And you are a mist man .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 8]: You look unreal , like everything else .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 10]: I think I am afraid of you , too !
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 19]: I shall go into the ladies ' room , and turn on the light , and read . ''
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 8]: Bedford laid his hand on her arm .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 5]: `` You will not !
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 11]: You will sit out here with me in the fog .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 36]: You can sit in the glare of electric light every day of your life , but a fog on the Indian Ocean is an experience by itself ... We are going to share it together .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 12]: I 'm quite real , I assure you , very real .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 7]: I can take care of you .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 5]: Come with me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 33]: His hand slid through her arm , and drew her along ; his head was bent over hers , she met his eyes , and felt the protest die upon her lips .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 41]: Without a word she followed where he led , took the seat pointed out , watched him draw up another , and place himself sideways before her , so as to form a shield between herself and the outer world .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 22]: His face seemed startlingly near to her own ; his hand on the side of his chair almost touched her knees .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 11]: Katrine fixed her eyes upon it with a fascinated attention .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 46]: A moment ago it had rested on her arm , the electric warmth of the contact still lingered ; for a reckless moment she longed to clasp it , to put it back in its place ; then remembrance dawned , and she shuddered again .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 15]: The world was grey , without and within , nothing but mist and gloom .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 40]: Seated as they were , she and her companion seemed solitary atoms in a world of fog ; to right and left nothing could be seen but dense grey walls which seemed with every moment to press more nearly .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 38]: The wide deck was empty ; instead of the usual babble of talk and laughter there was silence save for the regular thud of the engines , and from time to time the sound of the horn .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 8]: The effect of that silence was irresistible .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 19]: Involuntarily the man and woman lowered their voices , and bent nearer ; pale face to pale face .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 7]: `` Are you afraid still ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 9]: Bedford whispered , and Katrine shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 4]: `` Not afraid .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 8]: Dazed -- a little , I think .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 5]: It 's so unreal .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 24]: A world of dreams ... '' `` A world of dreams , and no one in it , but you and me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 25]: His hand was still there , and once again the mad , unreasoning impulse seized her to touch it , to grasp its support .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 18]: So overmastering was the desire , that the physical effort at restraint left her faint and weak .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 19]: She leaned back in her seat , and turned her head aside , her cheeks flaming with shame .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 23]: To what had she come , the reserved , well-disciplined Katrine Beverley , that she should be capable of such a thought !
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 28]: What had become of her modesty , her pride ; had she no decency left , no loyalty towards the man who had given her his heart ?
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 15]: Katrine 's brain formed bitter reproaches , but the vagrant heart brushed them aside .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 3]: His hand !
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 3]: His arm !
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 9]: Compared to them all else was as dross .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 22]: To lay her head for one hour on that broad shoulder , seemed the summit of all that life could give .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 17]: She felt his eyes following her , searching her face , but dared not meet them .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 25]: There had been music in the way in which he had spoken those last words ; his voice had dropped to a lower note .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 15]: So had Grizel 's beautiful voice deepened , when she had spoken to Martin .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 14]: To one who had once heard those accents , their meaning was unmistakable .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 10]: He loved her , and , God help her !
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 15]: she loved him in return with a passion which frightened her by its intensity .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 48]: She had imagined that she was cold , that for her the raptures of love would be exchanged for a calm and moderate content ; for twenty-six years she had preserved an unbroken front , and now all the stored-up forces of her nature arose and clamoured .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 26]: Katrine realised with horror that her life had passed out of her own control , and lay in the hollow of this man 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 18]: What he asked of her , she would grant ; when he commanded , she would obey .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 11]: There was no force in her to say him nay .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 63]: If he claimed her , Jim Blair might go to the winds ; all the world might stand on one side , and if this man beckoned from the other she would leave all to follow him ... The time of self-deception was past , and with a desperate candour she faced the situation , and considered her own course of action .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 9]: The only chance of safety lay in flight .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 29]: Two days more , and the voyage would be over ; if she could avoid Bedford for two days , there would be no more _ tete-a-tetes _ .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 18]: Dorothea would be present , Jack , Jim Blair -- all the little world of the station .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 9]: Jim had promised a truce of three months .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 20]: If she could avoid Bedford during that period , her instinct of loyalty would in some sort be appeased .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 34]: She had promised Jim to keep an open mind for three months , and though his doom was already sealed , she shrank from the thought of putting another man in his place .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 18]: Three months ' separation and waiting , and then -- `` What are you thinking of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 8]: asked Bedford 's voice in her ear .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 37]: So near the voice sounded , so low and gentle , that it was almost like the voice of her own heart , but for all its softness it held an insistence which compelled an answer .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 8]: Katrine made a gallant effort at confession .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 15]: `` I was thinking of the man to whom I am -- engaged . ''
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 5]: `` Virtually engaged ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 4]: corrected Bedford quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 12]: `` But they were sad thoughts to judge by your face .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 11]: Why should you have sad thoughts of a good man ?
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 24]: It would hurt him to have you think of him so , for of a certainty his chief thought is for your happiness .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 8]: Shall we dismiss him for the moment ?
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 33]: -- It 's lonely for me here by myself , when you wander away into dreams , and you look so wraith-like and unreal , -- a typical spirit of the mist .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 13]: If I were an artist I should like to paint you now .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 11]: I wonder if you realise how beautiful you are ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 25]: A glow lighted Katrine 's eyes ; the glow which warms the heart of every true daughter of Eve who hears herself called fair .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 4]: `` Am I ?
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 4]: I 'm glad !
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 15]: I -- I think I 've grown nicer lately , '' she replied ingenuously .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 30]: `` At home no one admired me much ; not half , not a quarter as much as they did Grizel , who is really hardly pretty at all .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 47]: She used to laugh at me in the old days and say that I kept my good looks a secret , while she took people by the throat , and bullied them into admiration , but the last time she came down she said -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 4]: `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 12]: `` She said I had grown ` unnecessarily good looking ! '
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 10]: and wanted to know ` _ Why _ ? '
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 4]: I knew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 4]: Katrine laughed guiltily .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 7]: `` But I could n't explain .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 8]: So I was _ cross _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 6]: Bedford looked at her searchingly .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 19]: For a moment he seemed on the point of repeating Grizel 's question , but he checked himself .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 26]: `` You sha n't be cross , and you sha n't be sad , so long as I am here to manage for you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 35]: he said confidently , and Katrine , looking at his broad shoulders and grave , purposeful face , felt with a thrill that no harm could indeed approach while this strong man was near .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 34]: The dank breath of the fog increased with every moment , driving the passengers into the brightly-lighted saloon , but to Katrine there was a glorious exhilaration in the darkness and the solitude .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 22]: She realised that in time to come she would look back upon these moments , and treasure them in her heart .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 40]: When her only meetings with Bedford should be in the crowded festivities of the little station , the isolation of this hour in the fog would live enshrined in memory , to be recalled with a passion of longing .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 26]: Silence fell , a silence caused not by poverty of thought , but by thought so charged with import that it dared not risk expression .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 66]: Katrine felt with a certainty beyond argument that the longing of her own heart was echoed throb for throb , ache for ache by the heart by her side ; that even as she desired with a passionate intensity to touch Bedford 's hand , and feel the embrace of his arms , so with an ever greater intensity did he also yearn for her .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 6]: Such convictions are above reason .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 20]: They are the language of the heart , which to sensitive souls is stronger than that of the lips .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 25]: As the silence lengthened so did the mental communion grow and deepen , until with each second it appeared inevitable that speech must follow .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 47]: Already with a mutual impulse they had faced each other , already the two hands had stretched out , when suddenly Bedford turned his head , raising it high , with a gesture alert , questioning , the action of a sentry , threatened with danger .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 16]: Through the fog Katrine caught the pose , and felt a sympathetic thrill of anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 21]: She reared her own head , -- could it be fancy that her ear caught a new and unfamiliar sound ?
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 9]: She bent forward , her attitude following his .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 10]: Tense and motionless they peered into the darkness . ''
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 7]: _ What is it _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 32]: Bedford 's voice , sharp and vibrant , called out the words , then with a deep cry he flung out his arms , and strained her to his heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 3]: _ Katrine !
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 2]: Katrine !
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 5]: The End _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 56]: She clung to him , every pulse in her body suspended in the awful grip of fear , for suddenly , awfully , the menacing sound had taken shape ; the shape of a giant hulk which looming through the mist , staggered and crashed , while the thunders of Olympus roared about their ears .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 25]: Tongues of flame followed the impact , the deck shook and reeled , and from a thousand throats went up a shriek to Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 16]: A helpless unit among the number , Katrine stood and looked death in the face .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 18]: The End indeed , but through it all , the clasp of a strong man 's arms !
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 58]: Mercifully it is not to one man in ten thousand that there comes so terrific an experience , and those who make the exception are as a rule incapable of describing their sensations at the dread moment , for even as a mortal wound deadens the physical sensations , so does an overwhelming shock paralyse the mind .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 58]: Consider it in cold blood , one moment , ye who read , seated comfortably in your homes , -- a mysterious thunder crashing suddenly into ordered silence ; the shivering reel of what has stood as solid ground , but which in a lightning flash is realised to be but a plank between safety and destruction .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 34]: The heavens have fallen ; the earth has rocked ; and on all sides tosses the hungry sea ... What wonder if , in its turn , the brain reels and loses power .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 28]: Katrine was conscious of nothing but an impulse to cling closer and closer , a terror of being separated from Bedford by so much as a second .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 18]: If he were with her she could face what might come ; without him madness was near .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 39]: With a second shock , hardly less awesome than the first , the towering mass fell back , and drifted into the fog ; the deck shivered and heeled , as the water rushed through the yawning gap .
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 5]: `` All on deck !
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 5]: All on deck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 13]: The order rang from the bridge , but it was not needed .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 16]: Already every soul on board the huge vessel was fleeing along the companionways and corridors .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 24]: If death threatened , at least let it be death in the open , not the death of a rat in a trap !
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 32]: Ghastly and panting they reached the deck ; ghastly and panting , but with magnificent control , they stood and waited the word of command from the figure on the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 15]: Katrine raised her head from Bedford 's shoulder , and gazed into his face .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 13]: The stewards were pacing the deck , turning on the electric switches .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 18]: There was one near at hand which lit the two faces with a faint , unearthly light .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 45]: The blue eyes and the grey gazed into each other , deep , deep , as they had done at the first moment of meeting , but now that gaze held a deeper meaning , a world of revelation , a world of regret !
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 21]: Katrine had only one desire ; she voiced it with the simplicity of a child : `` Stay with me !
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 6]: Do n't go away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 4]: `` Never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 8]: he cried , and tightened his grasp .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 9]: `` Whatever happens we 're together , Katrine .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 4]: You 're mine .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 12]: I 'll keep you -- '' `` Lower the boats ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 9]: The order rang out , short and sharp .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 7]: The stewards were handing round lifebelts .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 11]: In the brightly-lighted saloons the women were being ranged together .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 23]: A hand gripped Katrine 's arm , and Mrs Mannering 's voice rang out , calm and controlled : `` Miss Beverley !
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 4]: That 's good .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 7]: I 've been searching for you .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 9]: Come , my lass , come with me !
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 15]: They are collecting the women in the saloon to be ready for the boats .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 9]: We must do what we can to help .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 20]: It 's not the first shipwreck I 've been in , and here I am , safe and sound .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 14]: We 'll be all right yet , but we must do our share .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 5]: take my arm . ''
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 6]: Katrine lifted a set face .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 6]: `` I 'm not going .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 13]: Do n't tease me , please -- there 's so little time .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 5]: Leave us alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 9]: Over her head the two exchanged rapid glances .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 27]: Bedford nodded , a quick stern nod , with a glance in the direction of the boat ; the woman nodded back , comprehending his message .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 37]: She was bareheaded , cloakless as she had rushed out of the saloon a moment before ; now with characteristic coolness she glanced around , and made a second announcement : `` There 's time yet .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 8]: I can get some clothes and usefuls .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 5]: You will stay here ?
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 13]: Exactly here , so that I may know where to find you ?
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 9]: There must be no chance of missing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 9]: Bedford nodded again , and she hastened away .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 18]: Prom above sounded the rattle of the wireless , as it sent forth its message of distress .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 15]: Leaning against the rail stood a youthful officer , little more than a boy .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 15]: His face was set , but his pose was the acme of careless ease .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 31]: He had taken from his pocket a silver case , and from time to time he lifted an unlighted cigarette to his lips , with a pathetic pretence of enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 12]: Bedford bent his head until it rested on Katrine 's hair .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 4]: `` Katrine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 14]: She moved , so that her cheek took the place of her hair .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 17]: There was unspeakable comfort in the soft , cold touch of his flesh against her own .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 6]: `` That 's the wireless !
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 7]: They are sending messages for help .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 7]: We are in the direct channel .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 5]: It will certainly come .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 6]: We must hope on . ''
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 23]: Even as he spoke the deck shivered beneath his feet , and with a sickening lurch , tilted heavily on one side .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 18]: Bedford threw out one hand and caught at the rail , holding Katrine firmly with the other .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 31]: The young officer , thrown on one side , fell back into his nonchalant pose , and tremblingly lifted his cigarette , but his lips moved in an involuntary despair .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 4]: `` My God !
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 20]: _ She 's going _ -- '' Katrine caught the gasping words , and looked death in the face .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 4]: It was coming .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 19]: At any moment that shuddering lurch might come again , and the deck glide down into the sea .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 11]: This man said so , and he _ knew _ .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 20]: For the sake of example he preserved an appearance of composure , but he understood , and he despaired .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 24]: With a sob of emotion she lifted her face to Bedford 's , and their lips met in a long , clinging kiss .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 31]: It mattered nothing that there were people around , that the flaring lights lit up their forms ; they were lost to every thought but of themselves and their love .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 20]: Above the fear , above the terror , there clamoured in Katrine 's heart a desperate need of expression .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 22]: All her life she had been dumb ; she could not die without putting in words the one transcendent fact . ''
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 7]: _ I love you _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 5]: `` Do you hear ?
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 4]: Do you understand ?
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 12]: If I must die , let me die in your arms .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 15]: I tried ... but it was no use -- I love _ you _ !
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 11]: There is nobody else -- I belong to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 5]: `` My Katrine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 4]: he cried trembling .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 37]: `` My girl -- '' Prom above , the wonderful invisible machinery rattled and cracked ; the first boat swung low from the davits was already being loaded with its complement of shrinking , trembling women .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 25]: The flare of lights lit up their ashen faces turned up to the deck above as they floated , wraith-like , into the mist .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 17]: A second boat creaked on the ropes and Mrs Mannering 's hand gripped Bedford 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 3]: `` Now !
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 5]: Bring her along ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 21]: Katrine resisted , but the strong arms bore her along until she stood ranged among the line of waiting women .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 30]: Nothing but force should induce her to enter a boat alone , but she had not the physical strength to retain her position against the will of her companions .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 10]: Mrs Mannering had tied a shawl round her head .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 13]: The pockets of her coat were filled to the point of bursting .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 21]: She carried a bundle of small articles , which she proceeded to stuff into the pockets of Katrine 's cloak .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 12]: A steward came up and fastened a lifebelt round her waist .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 14]: Bedford took a second from his arm and himself fastened it round Katrine .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 12]: She laid her cold fingers on his , drawing him back .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 10]: `` You are going to send me away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 18]: He bent and laid his lips to her hand , but he went on fastening the straps .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 15]: There was a relentlessness in his movements which struck ice to Katrine 's soul .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 14]: `` You will send me away , and let me die alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 12]: At that he winced , but still he continued his task .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 8]: `` You must go first , beloved .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 8]: If God wills , I 'll follow .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 7]: The women must go first . ''
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 12]: Katrine laughed ; a wild reckless laugh more terrible than tears .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 3]: `` Why ?
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 8]: Because of a sentiment , a convention ?
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 5]: Better save the men !
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 10]: They are the bread-winners , the heads of households .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 11]: Save the lives that count , and let us drown .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 8]: There are women enough -- too many .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 6]: We should not be missed .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 15]: I have had no choice in life , but my death is my own .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 5]: I will not go !
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 7]: I will stay with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 13]: Mrs Mannering 's practical , commonplace voice struck sharply upon her ears .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 9]: `` My good girl , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 12]: `` You have not to think of yourself at this moment .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 12]: You are not the only woman who would rather stay behind .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 15]: Look at those poor souls over there who have to leave husbands and sons !
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 10]: Is it easier for them , or for you ?
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 21]: There 's only one thing to be done -- obey orders , and do your bit towards smoothing the way .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 26]: When your turn comes , you 've _ got _ to go , and I 'll see to it that you _ do _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 16]: She squared her shoulders , and stationed herself grim and relentless by Katrine 's side .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 27]: In the lurid light her face looked lined , and incredibly old , but she carried herself bravely , and showed not a quiver of fear .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 23]: Along the deck the band had marshalled , and the strains of a popular waltz floated with horrible gaiety on the air .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 56]: Not a note fell flat , or out of time ; stalwart and erect in their smart uniform , the men stood and played , and the conductor waved his baton as composedly as if they had been surrounded by a throng of merry dancers , instead of men and women threatened by instant death .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 14]: Prom within the brightly-lighted smoking-room a man could be seen writing a letter .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 14]: A few feet away a woman was playing bo-peep with a frightened child .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 23]: Gradually , as Katrine stood waiting , her fear subsided , and there stole into her soul a mysterious courage and calm .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 24]: Strung to its highest sensibilities the spirit within her absorbed the atmosphere by which it was surrounded , and nobly answered the call .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 3]: Imagine it !
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 90]: Dwell for one moment on the majesty of it -- a crowd of men and women , each one braced up to his highest , strongest self ; to a _ selfless _ self , stifling , for the sake of others , all signs of distress , obeying the ordinary conventions of society , giving place , the stronger to the weaker , with a smile and bow , as if that matter of preference were some society trifle , not a matter of bald life and death .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 47]: As surely as the music floated from the mouth of those brazen instruments , as the light streamed from the electric arch overhead , so surely did the spiritual influence of those brave deeds spread over the ship , and touch with fire every human heart .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 31]: Into Katrine 's soul in its turn stole some portion of this noble fortitude ; she ceased to struggle , and stood silently by Bedford 's side awaiting her call .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 17]: The women filed slowly by , were lifted one by one and swung into the boat .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 10]: Suddenly Bedford turned towards her , grasping both hands .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 11]: In his face she read that the parting had come .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 3]: `` Katrine !
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 18]: Good-bye ... '' Strong aims seized her , she was lifted high , dropped , and caught .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 14]: There came to , her aid a merciful unconsciousness ... CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 42]: Katrine lay dazed and senseless , a huddled mass in a corner of the boat , mercifully oblivious of the perilous lowering down the great hull of the ship , of the gradual leaving behind of all that was most dear .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 21]: The climax of emotion through which she had passed , had exhausted for the time being all power of sensation .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 10]: While not actually unconscious , her mind was torpid .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 13]: Nothing mattered , her very powers of fear were at an end .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 22]: What was past , was past , what would come , would come ; nothing mattered the cast of a die !
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 44]: In the boat were women , dazed like herself , others again weeping and lamenting ; others , like Mrs Mannering , composed and brisk , showing at their best , when those from whom more might have been expected proved broken reeds .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 7]: It was all dream-like and unreal .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 21]: Tossed on the waves in the crowded boat , the great hull of the ship looked a rampart of strength .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 20]: To have left that stronghold to toss in this cockleshell -- the dazed brain marvelled feebly at such inconsistency .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 26]: High on the deck a confused mass of people moved to and fro , but their faces were indistinguishable , and soon vanished from sight .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 32]: The sounds of a voice shouting peremptory orders mingled with the dashing of the waves , but soon that also became inaudible , as the boat floated farther and farther away .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 12]: Katrine sat motionless , oblivious of all that was happening around .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 23]: The hood of her coat had fallen back from her head and her bleached face had a fixed , almost terrible beauty .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 20]: Nancy Mannering glanced at her anxiously from time to time , and finally shook her strongly by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 3]: `` Now !
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 6]: Brace up , Katrine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 9]: cried the strong voice , `` brace up !
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 16]: It do n't matter much what happens to you and to me , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 42]: We are just women -- unattached women at that -- there are too many of our sort knocking around , but here 's some one here who _ does _ count -- a little man for you to cuddle and protect !
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 28]: Heaven knows the kind he 'll grow up ; he 'll be none the worse , any way , for remembering this night , and who knows !
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 10]: some woman may fare the better for your pains .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 4]: Here , sonny !
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 4]: stop that row .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 6]: Come to the pretty lady .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 11]: She 'll nurse you , and tell you tales . ''
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 34]: A sturdy weight was deposited on Katrine 's lap ; in the dim light she recognised the features of her former enemy , the redoubtable Jackey , all drawn and wet with tears .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 35]: Separated from his father , overcome by the hopeless terror of childhood , he had lost his braggart airs , and appeared just a pitiful baby thing , longing to be kissed and held .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 34]: His wet face nozzled into Katrine 's breast , his little legs in the ridiculous knickerbockers dangled limply over her knees , and the sight , the touch , awoke her to life .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 29]: She gathered the child in her arms and crooned over him , and Jackey wreathed her neck with his arms , and pressed wet kisses on her cheek !
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 15]: Presently , gathering confidence , he began to question after the manner of childhood .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 8]: `` How soon shall we be drowned ?
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 9]: How much does it hurt to be drowned ?
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 6]: As much as a tooth ?
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 6]: Will the water be cold ?
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 7]: Would it be brave to scream ?
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 14]: Will you hold me tight , so that I ca n't leave go ?
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 11]: Must we say our prayers before we 're drowned ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 14]: `` We are not going to be drowned , I hope , Jackey .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 22]: By-and-bye a big boat will come along and take us up , but you can say your prayers all the same .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 42]: Pray for your father on our own big ship , and , and -- '' `` And the parrot , and the goat , and all Thy dumb creatures , '' responded Jackey , who was evidently not without religious instruction .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 8]: He mumbled petitions into Katrine 's neck .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 21]: `` God bless and keep my dear father , ` serve him from danger , make him a good boy .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 4]: Bless the parrot .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 5]: Keep Thy young goat .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 9]: Let him be meek and gentle in spirit .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 21]: Bless the man I kicked , and mend his legs so he can swim when the boat goes down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 10]: `` Oh , Jackey , '' sobbed Katrine wildly .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 6]: `` Oh , Jackey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 17]: She strained the little form in her arms , and buried her face in his curls .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 75]: So far children had not entered intimately into her life , and the maternal instinct had remained dormant , as it does with many women until the time arrives when their own child is laid in their arms , but now as Jackey 's soft , heavy little body nestled against her own , she realised with a new poignancy the possibility of yet another joy , another opening of the gates of life !
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 38]: She rocked to and fro , murmuring soothing words , and Jackey cuddled close , vigorously sucked his thumb , then uncorked his lips to ask another question : `` Will the big ship come quick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 7]: `` I hope so , Jackey !
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 5]: I think so . ''
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 8]: `` Will our own ship go down ?
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 18]: If it goes down to the bottom of the sea , will my Daddy be dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 19]: He lifted his eyes to her face , big , innocent blue eyes , widened in breathless anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 26]: Katrine winced before them , tortured by the thought that suffering could come so soon ; that a babe like this should feel its shaft .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 17]: `` If my Daddy is dead , can I have his penknife for my own ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 5]: Jackey did not realise .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 5]: Thank God for that .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 7]: The babe was a babe still .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 27]: Cradled in kind arms , comfortable and warm , he could dream his little dream , build his airy castles unperturbed by the pain of others .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 21]: That one afternoon 's experience had taught Katrine to be thankful for a callousness which she would previously have condemned .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 14]: Time enough for Jackey and his kind to realise the nature of death !
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 16]: `` You shall have a knife , Jackey ; the best that Bombay can produce .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 9]: And your Daddy , too , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 10]: Could n't you go to sleep now , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 22]: Put your little thumb in your mouth , and shut your eyes , and pretend you are safe in your bunk .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 7]: I 'll hold you fast . ''
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 9]: Jackey was tired , and the suggestion appealed .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 42]: He wriggled to and fro , poked ruthlessly with elbows and knees , until he had fitted himself to his entire satisfaction , burrowed his head beneath the lapel of Katrine 's coat , and relapsed into limp and weighty slumber .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 27]: Katrine was tired too ; tired with a very extremity of fatigue , but not for worlds would she have relinquished the weight of that burden .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 49]: Presently Mrs Mannering held a flask to her lips and she felt the hot smart of brandy , -- just one sip , and then the flask was withdrawn , for Nancy Mannering was jealous of her stores , not knowing for how long they might be needed .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 47]: There were biscuits also in those capacious pockets , bars of chocolate , and fruit taken from the saloon tables , but no adult passenger in the boat was treated to these luxuries ; they were reserved for the embryo men and women of the future .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 16]: The boat drifted on , the men for the most part resting upon their oars .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 24]: It was not desired to float far from the ship , since the best hope of rescue lay in keeping in her vicinity .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 22]: The fog was slowly lightening , and the flare of the electric lights showed a faint gold patch through the grey .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 9]: Katrine kept her eyes fixed on that patch .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 13]: So long as it continued , she could hold on to hope .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 45]: If it died out , so would the light fade from her own life ... Sitting huddled in her seat , Jackey 's little form pillowed in her arm , Katrine 's thoughts reviewed her past life and marvelled at the strangeness of it .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 27]: Paced with the possibility of death , all the years that were past counted for nothing as compared with the happening of a few short days .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 26]: Martin , Grizel , the friends and companions of her youth -- she repeated their names , and sought to visualise each countenance in turn .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 3]: In vain !
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 32]: the likenesses refused to appear ; even Martin 's face was blurred , or was it that she had not enough patience , enough interest , to spare for the effort ?
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 15]: Bedford was the world ; apart from him she was incapable of a regret .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 5]: The boat drifted on .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 16]: Now the sailors had turned her head and were rowing slowly back towards the ship .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 9]: The yellow blur still shone through the fog .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 23]: The men discussed together as to the amount of damage that had been done , the possibility of keeping the hulk afloat .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 17]: Nancy Mannering turned and spoke into Katrine 's ear : `` My dear , one word !
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 14]: ... You may n't suspect it , but I 've a heart -- .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 18]: In a physical Sense , I mean , no sentiment ; and it 's a poor thing .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 22]: I do n't expect to be drowned , but a little more of this excitement , and it may play tricks .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 32]: It 's all one , I 'm not whining , but if I _ should _ pan out , and you get through , will you just write to my boy ?
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 14]: Tell him I asked you , and that he is not to grieve .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 14]: Bound to go somehow , some day , and , why not now ?
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 39]: I 've no particular wish to live on here , but you can tell him this -- wherever I am , whatever comes next , there 'll be no peace for me unless _ he _ keeps straight !
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 16]: That I _ know _ , and he 'd better know it , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 51]: She was silent for some moments , during which Katrine heard the quick intake of her breath , then : `` And tell him , '' she added with difficulty , `` tell him I 've always been an ostrich , hiding , not my head , but my heart .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 49]: Somehow I could n't let it out , but , '' her voice deepened to a full , rich note , `` there 's never been a moment of his life , since he was born , when I would n't have been flayed -- _ slowly _ !
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 4]: for his good !
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 12]: Tell him his mother loved him more than her life . ''
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 11]: `` I 'll tell him ; I wo n't write .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 24]: I 'll travel the length of India , if need be , to tell him myself , '' cried Katrine , deeply touched .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 20]: To discover a hidden weakness in her jaunty , self-sufficient companion was to feel herself infused with new strength .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 13]: She was needed , and the woman in her rose to the ?
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 2]: demand .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 27]: She hitched Jackey on one side so as to free her right arm , and fumbling in her companion 's pocket found and extracted the flask .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 26]: `` Meantime , if you have no care for yourself , think of _ him _ , and be careful for _ his _ sake .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 20]: What is the use of talking of love , if you wo n't do even that for his sake ?
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 12]: Be sensible for yourself as well as for other people ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 10]: `` Mr Dick , your common-sense is invaluable ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 13]: Mrs Mannering drank , smacked her lips , and grunted with satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 5]: `` That 's good !
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 4]: That 's better .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 5]: I needed that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 6]: Then after a momentary pause .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 18]: `` Remember though , _ if I do _ come through , your work is to forget .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 7]: No bringing up of deathbed confidences !
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 14]: ... Anything in the same line that I can do for yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 8]: `` No , '' answered Katrine shortly .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 17]: If the end came , Martin and Grizel could console each other without help from her .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 6]: And their figures were misty .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 21]: Even Jackey himself counted for more at this moment , embodying as he did a great potential possibility of life .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 7]: As for Jim Blair -- ah !
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 12]: let Jim hug his false dreams : let him never awake !
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 5]: The hours dragged on .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 17]: The children slept ; some of the women slept also , worn out by their fears .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 28]: Katrine 's cramped arms still held their burden , but Nancy Mannering had turned herself round in her seat , presenting her broad back as a support .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 14]: `` Let yourself go , my dear ; lean your weight on me .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 8]: Nothing like a support to your back .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 25]: I was at the opera just before I sailed -- six shillings ' worth of gallery , and never a rail at the back .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 16]: Leaned back against a young lad 's knees , and he wriggled in seventeen fits .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 4]: Prudery , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 7]: Or perhaps I was too old .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 3]: Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 18]: The voice had its old jaunty tone , but the language in which she spoke was unintelligible .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 4]: _ Opera _ !
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 6]: Katrine shrank at the sound .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 17]: Face to face with death , the trivial happenings of life retreated to an illimitable distance .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 21]: Was it possible that one had ever cared for such baubles -- had counted them among the goods of life !
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 22]: At the stern of the boat a woman was praying aloud , while those around joined in with tears and sobs .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 15]: Katrine roused herself to listen , and caught fervid confessions of sin and wrong-doing .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 15]: Her thoughts turned inward ; she also ought to pray , to make confession .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 17]: Drearily she asked herself what she had done , and failed to discover a tangible offence .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 10]: Honestly she had endeavoured ; honestly she had refrained .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 23]: Looking back over her life she could find no shrinking from duty , no unfair dealing , no violation of a law .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 29]: She had not `` gone astray , '' she had not been `` vile and sinful altogether '' ; the woman 's abasement of self-blame left her untouched .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 13]: The searchlight of conscience revealed sin indeed , but not of commission .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 40]: _ Lack of level _ -- that was the flaw -- of whole-hearted , unselfish love which gave all and asked for no return ; love which could transform the commonest events , and make of duty a joy !
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 17]: Grizel possessed that love ; a spring of tenderness and sympathy , welling within her heart .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 13]: She had found it easy to live with a querulous old woman .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 14]: `` She does n't worry me : I _ love _ her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 16]: Katrine heard again the tone of the deep , rich voice giving the simple explanation .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 20]: She herself had placed Martin before all created things , but there had been no tenderness in her heart .
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 25]: With opened eyes she looked back on the critical , exacting sentiment which she had called love , and found it unworthy the name .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 8]: Her arms tightened round the sleeping child .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 8]: This then was the secret of life .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 10]: Love -- `` the fulfilment of the law . ''
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 25]: If life were spared , it would be the motive spring for which she would strive ; given that , the rest would follow .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 15]: The women at her side were imploring for forgiveness , and comfort in death .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 5]: Katrine prayed for life .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 7]: `` More life : fuller life !
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 9]: _ Fill my mean heart _ -- ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 24]: Ten minutes later when the rescuing ship steamed into view the sight which should have brought exhilaration broke down the most sternly-kept composure .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 33]: Men and women wept together , wept and laughed , and sobbed and clung , even the most composed giving way to their emotion now that the strain was at an end .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 28]: On she came , a stately form , summoned by the wondrous message of the air , racing through the water to the noble work of rescue .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 21]: Nearer and nearer , until she was close at hand , and white faces looked down from the crowded decks .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 12]: The nightmare of removal from the boat was accomplished in safety .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 22]: Katrine felt her waist encircled by a tender arm , and heard a woman 's voice addressing her in tremulous tones .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 33]: Her cramped limbs could hardly move , she was half-led , half-carried into a luxurious cabin , undressed , laid in a warm , fresh bed , fed with soup and wine .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 18]: The women who waited upon her shed tears as they worked , but she herself was dry-eyed .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 54]: She was thinking of that yellow glimmering light through the fog , the light of the ship which held her world , -- the ship with a hole in her side ... But an hour later Nancy Mannering came to her bedside with a face working with emotion , to tell glad news .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 47]: The passengers of the injured ship had been transferred to the C -- , but the crew remained at their posts , for the water-tight compartments were bravely doing their work , and there was hope of keeping her afloat until Bombay Harbour could be reached .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 9]: Meantime the rescuing vessel had her in tow .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 12]: `` Shut your eyes , my beauty , and sleep ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 5]: said Nancy Mannering gently .
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 8]: `` He 's off to his bed .
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 14]: I 've seen him , and touched him , and heard his voice .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 32]: He 's a real live man and no ghost , as to-morrow morning you 'll see for yourself , and if you ever say good-bye to him again , -- well !
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 7]: you deserve all you may get .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 18]: -- Go to sleep , child , go to sleep , and thank the good God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 10]: But the next morning Katrine did not get up .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 19]: She was prostrate with physical collapse , and there was no mental effort to spur her into action .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 8]: She did not want to meet Bedford .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 34]: Now that safety was assured , it was torture to remember her own words , and to realise that the first confession of love had come from her own lips , not his .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 23]: She welcomed the weariness and pain which kept her a prisoner in the cabin ; dreaded the meeting which must inevitably come .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 48]: The dread and the shame , the excitement and the distress , increased her physical ailments ; the doctor was summoned , once and again , before the day was over , and other methods failing prescribed a sleeping-draught to secure a night 's rest before landing .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 22]: As a result Katrine slept heavily , but awoke to so crushing a headache that movement appeared out of the question .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 8]: No matter , Nancy Mannering assured her .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 22]: It would be hours before the ship had disgorged her double complement of passengers , to say nothing of the luggage .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 23]: She was to lie still , recover slowly , go on shore quietly later on when the fuss and racket were over .
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 16]: The captain had sent a special message to assure her of his consideration and help .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 8]: Two other women were prostrate like herself .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 6]: They also were to wait .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 32]: Katrine settled down again into a fitful sleep , through which the tramp of feet , the clamour of voices , the banging of luggage , beat confusedly upon her brain .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 46]: From time to time Mrs Mannering crept in to look at her , and stole out unnoticed ; it was not until late in the afternoon , when quiet reigned on the deck overhead , that she met opened eyes and a smile of welcome .
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 6]: `` I 'm dreadfully lazy !
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 21]: I 'm afraid it 's ever so late , but I can dress quickly now for my head is better .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 4]: Is -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 13]: She stopped short , flushing , but Mrs Mannering was intentionally obtuse .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 6]: `` Yes , all right !
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 10]: The poor old ship kept up to the end .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 7]: They are getting out the baggage .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 8]: Pray heaven it is _ dry _ !
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 13]: in any case we 'll be thankful for what we can get .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 14]: It looked as if we might not have a rag to our backs .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 32]: That good soul Anderson is looking after our part of the spoil ; Captain Bedford would have done it , but it was all he could do to get through himself .
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 14]: Had to rush off to take up a company by the first train .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 11]: They 've been kept waiting for him by this upset .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 26]: However , our rooms are booked at the hotel , and we can lie low for a few days till we get our breath . ''
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 4]: Katrine stared blankly .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 28]: She had shrunk from the thought of meeting Bedford , yet it came as a shock to hear that he had gone on and left her behind .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 36]: They had _ all _ gone on , -- the passengers among whom she had lived so closely during those last weeks ; but for Nancy Mannering she was alone in the strange new world .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 6]: It was a lonesome feeling .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 14]: She sat on the side of her bunk , smiling a difficult smile .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 5]: That will be nice .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 9]: And my friends have arranged for my journey .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 12]: The agent will call -- '' `` Be hanged to agents !
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 21]: I 've sworn by all my gods to stick to you till I see you safely landed with your friends .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 21]: It 's only a few score miles out of my way , and that counts for nothing in this country .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 12]: The good Bedford will see me housed when we arrive . ''
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 9]: `` Scores of miles out of your way !
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 5]: For _ me _ ?
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 8]: Mrs Mannering , it is too much !
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 8]: I ca n't let you do it .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 11]: You are the kindest , most unselfish of creatures . ''
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 4]: Mrs Mannering grimaced .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 8]: `` Do n't be too sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 4]: she said dryly .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 7]: `` Curiosity poses under many forms .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 12]: I 've a weakness for being on in the last act .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 20]: dress yourself , and come along , and be sure to speak prettily to the captain before you leave .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 7]: He 's behaved like a brick .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 8]: There 's tea in the saloon . ''
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 29]: By six o'clock Katrine and her chaperon were safely housed in the hotel , appreciating as they had never done before the blessings of _ terra firma _ .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 30]: The next morning their baggage was restored to them , practically undamaged , and what was to Katrine most important of all , a letter arrived from Jim Blair .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 25]: She sat alone in her room holding the unopened envelope in her hand , gaining courage for the ordeal of reading the loving words .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 14]: Strange how deep a hold this unknown man had taken of her affections !
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 49]: Bedford she loved with the stored-up passion of her life , but even Bedford himself had not been able to lessen her tenderness towards the man who had come into her life at the moment when she needed him most , and brought solace to her sore heart .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 18]: It was cruelly hard to be obliged to bring pain and disappointment to so generous a lover .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 102]: She flinched and coloured at the thought of her own conduct as viewed from the outside -- just the weak , commonplace story of the pretty girl who starts on a voyage which is to bring her to a waiting lover , meets another man _ en route _ , and is false to her tryst , -- but it was typical of Katrine 's conception of the character of her unknown lover , that through all her troubled thoughts the conviction remained that Jim would understand , -- that however he might suffer he would neither be bitter nor unjust .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 13]: She sighed , and bracing herself resolutely , tore open the envelope .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 22]: The blood rushed to her face as she read the opening words : ------------------------------------------------------------------------ `` My Own Katrine , `` No !
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 7]: I am not breaking my truce .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 19]: This little breathing space between the sea voyage and the start up-country does n't count in the scheme .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 23]: It 's a No-man 's land , of which this man would be a fool if he did n't take possession forthwith !
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 52]: `` Besides , beloved , there are things that I want to say ; things that _ need _ to be said ... Your journey is nearly over , our meeting is close at hand , and if the truth were known there 's more fear than expectation in your heart !
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 18]: I know you too well not to realise that -- _ but the fear must go _ !
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 22]: Get it out of your head once for all , little girl , that you have anything to dread from me .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 18]: I want you , I want you badly , but most of all I want your happiness .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 40]: That sounds the sort of thing one reads in books -- just a bit too lofty and impersonal to be true , but if you come to worry it out , it 's only a higher kind of selfishness .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 48]: Once love with your own heart and soul , love some one , that is to say , _ more than yourself _ , and as the most obvious of consequences , happiness is impossible for yourself unless it has first and foremost filled that other heart .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 25]: Do n't worry yourself by any idea that you are pledged to me , in honour bound , or any nonsense of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 13]: You are _ not _ ; you are as free as air .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 17]: If you should happen to like another man better than me -LRB- you wo n't ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 7]: I 'd help you to him .
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 11]: If you do n't want me -LRB- you will ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 5]: I 'll stand aside .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 7]: Dear little girl , be aisy !
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 6]: I 'm on your side .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 12]: `` That ` mad ' letter of yours was delicious sense .
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 16]: The veritable Katrine revealed herself more therein than in any letter I have yet received .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 11]: And your little discourse on tenderness -- that touched me !
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 34]: It is a quality which , as you say , is wanting in the love of many men , and the lack of it leaves a record on the faces of weary women .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 34]: But , after all , you know , the doing or undoing , whichever you choose to call it , is in the main the fault of some other woman in the past !
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 25]: Why do mothers spoil their boys instead of training them in the small domestic kindnesses and attentions which will be so valuable later on ?
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 17]: If I had a son ... upon my life I believe I 'd spoil him too !
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 31]: `` Seriously though , Katrine , it must be pre-eminently tenderness which is filling my heart today , for I _ can _ imagine ; I _ can _ understand !
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 12]: I am so sorry for you , poor , puzzled girl !
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 9]: Is that a good augury for the future ?
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 17]: `` I shall come in to see you at the Middleton bungalow the day you arrive .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 6]: No club meetings for me .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 17]: Just an hour or two for rest and refreshment , and then -- enter Jim Blair !
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 11]: Poor little girl , are you trembling in your shoes ?
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 10]: If only I could convince you of my sincerity !
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 53]: Was it for nothing , Katrine , that my heart went out to you across the seas ; was it for nothing that my cry touched your heart ; was it for nothing that after years of block and difficulty , the way was opened out which brings you here to me ?
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 9]: Go on in faith for one week longer !
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 5]: `` Jim Blair . ''
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 13]: The letter fell from Katrine 's hands and fluttered to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 8]: She hid her face in her hands .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY NINE .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 33]: The delight and excitement which is felt by most travellers on a first introduction to the East was dimmed in Katrine 's case by the pressure of events past and to come .
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 13]: The shadow of death had loomed too recently to be easily repelled .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 32]: The thought of what might have been pierced knife-like through the thankfulness for what was , and recovered life seemed a frail and dream-like treasure hardly as yet to be realised .
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 30]: Katrine found some comfort in the fact that she was not alone in absent-mindedness and lack of appreciation , since Nancy Mannering also was far from her normal self .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 18]: She was restless , and on edge ; at once excited and reserved , affectionate and chilling .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 18]: She would sit through a whole meal in silence , and leave the table chuckling with laughter .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 46]: She would drag Katrine out for drives through the hot , bright streets , play the part of show-woman with exaggerated fervour , and suddenly , for no apparent reason , stop short in the middle of a sentence , and refuse to speak again .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 76]: Excitement , reserve , tenderness , and sarcasm , followed each other in rapid sequence , and added not a little to the strain of the waiting days , but Katrine bore patiently with the varying moods , realising that to a woman of intensely practical nature the very fact of having opened her heart in the hour of danger would be enough to close it more tightly than ever when that danger was past .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 15]: `` If we get out of this , your work is to forget ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 15]: Those had been Mrs Mannering 's own words , but , poor dear soul !
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 16]: she herself was evidently finding the task difficult , lashing herself for her ill-placed confidence !
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 38]: Moreover , she also had a meeting in store ... Every time that Katrine 's reflections brought her round to this point , Mrs Mannering and her idiosyncrasies were forgotten in the whirl of her own thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 38]: So far as was possible she tried to shut her mind to what lay ahead , to encourage , rather than fight against , the languor of mind and body which gave a dream-like unreality to life .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 31]: As Jim Blair had said , this time was a rest by the way , a No-man 's land , when her chief duty was to rest and gather strength .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 29]: On the third day the two ladies started on their three days ' journey up country , under the most luxurious conditions which it was possible to attain .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 35]: Everything had been thought of , everything arranged ; agent and officials waited upon them with an assiduity which the older traveller , at least , had no difficulty in tracing to its source .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 35]: Short of climatic exigencies the long journey was robbed of discomfort , but the length , the heat , above all the dust , made it nevertheless a trying experience to the English girl .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 48]: At first the novelty of the country arrested her attention , but long before the four days were over , interest had evaporated , and she was consumed by alternate longings to reach her destination , and a panic of dread at what awaited her when there .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 19]: How incomprehensible to be dreading a destination which meant Dorothea , and the fulfilment of a lifelong dream !
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 16]: How still more incomprehensible to find it an effort to think of Dorothea at all !
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 15]: After what seemed an eternity of waiting , the journey came to an end .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 69]: The train drew up before a little sun-baked station which was like a score of others that had been passed before , and on the platform stood a man in uniform , and a woman in white whose thin , sweet face was turned eagerly towards the windows of the train , and with a rush of pain and joy the traveller recognised the friend of her girlhood .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 18]: The two women kissed , and clung , and gazed , and fell back to gaze again .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 18]: On Dorothea 's face was written love and admiration , touched with the wistfulness of the exile .
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 25]: This young , fresh girl was only a year her junior -- how sweet , how pink , how _ English _ she appeared !
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 17]: The sight of her was as a breath of green lanes sunk deep between flowering hedges .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 9]: Katrine 's eyes felt the smart of tears .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 15]: How thin , how old , how changed , but oh , how sweet !
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 15]: sweeter than ever , and with just the old , dear , loving ways .
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 28]: As for Jack Middleton himself , he had improved in appearance , as men have a trying habit of doing , in contradistinction to their women kind .
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 18]: He looked broader , more imposing , the loss of complexion was in his case little detriment .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 26]: When he had left England he had been but a lanky youth , now he was a man , and a handsome man at that .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 9]: Katrine looking on felt a pang of resentment .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 29]: This land of exile demanded many tolls of the women who followed their men-kind to its shores , not least among them the loss of youth and bloom !
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 23]: Captain Middleton took charge of Mrs Mannering , and the two friends drove home together , hand in hand , but silent .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 30]: There was so much to be said that it seemed difficult to begin , and Katrine was subtly conscious that Dorothea shared her own feeling of shyness and strain .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 28]: Three days had passed since Bedford 's return , the story of the wreck had been told -- how much , how little , had Dorothea divined ?
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 32]: Each moment Katrine braced herself to hear a name -- _ two _ names ; when time passed on without mention of either , the silence but added to her strain .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 23]: At each turn of the dusty path she glanced ahead with shrinking eyes , each bungalow held a possibility , a dread .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 7]: Did _ he _ live there ?
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 12]: Was he perhaps even now looking out from behind those shrouding-blinds ?
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 15]: And of what was Dorothea thinking as she sat so silently by her side ?
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 40]: The look in her sweet , tired eyes , the clinging touch of the thin hand were so eloquent of love that Katrine 's heart could not but be content with her welcome , but her thoughts were awhirl .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 25]: It was a relief to both women when the bungalow was reached , and the appearance of the small son set their tongues free .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 38]: Dorothea flushed with pride as she listened to her friend 's appreciation of her son 's beauty and charm , and the urchin , scenting the arrival of a new slave , put forth his best wiles .
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 23]: He was a beautiful child , but in a colourless , fragile fashion which differentiated him sadly from the children at home .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 28]: As Katrine held his limp little hand and looked at the tracery of blue veins on the delicate forehead , her heart swelled with pity and tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 28]: `` I held a child , a little boy like this , in my arms all the time in , -- in the boat , Doll ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 4]: she said softly .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 5]: `` He comforted me !
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 14]: I realised then -- what it might mean -- '' `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 9]: Dorothea 's voice had an edge of pain .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 20]: Her own treasure was held by so frail a thread that the value of him could not be discussed .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 16]: Katrine divined as much , and switched the conversation to the safer subject of appearances .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 7]: `` He 's adorable , Doll .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 3]: A gem !
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 5]: Beyond all my dreams .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 6]: And such a discreet blend !
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 8]: Your eyes , and Jack 's nose .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 20]: Jack 's hair , your complexion -- '' `` Ah , my dear , that 's a lost joy !
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 15]: Do n't talk of complexions to me , and you so pink and white .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 7]: Katrine , you are so pretty !
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 22]: I never thought you were going to be so pretty , though , of course , I 've had photographs . ''
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 38]: Involuntarily Katrine 's eyes turned towards the mantelpiece , where a certain photograph had been wont to stand , a bold photograph which had made eyes at bachelor guests ; had first pitied , and then decoyed .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 18]: `` I give you my word it looked as if it _ wanted _ to come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 22]: The blood rose in her cheeks ; looking across the room at Dorothea , she perceived that she also had flushed .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 7]: Had she read the unspoken thought ?
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 49]: Once again the child 's garrulity came to the rescue , but while she played with him and drank her tea Katrine was conscious that Dorothea 's eyes were wandering towards the clock , and that she was summoning courage for an announcement which had to be made .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 4]: Presently it came .
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 11]: `` Shall I take you to your room , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 16]: Your boxes have arrived and you must be longing to have a bath and change .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 6]: And it 's getting late .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 3]: Pour o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 11]: There is just an hour before -- Jim comes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 5]: `` Comes here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 3]: Dorothea nodded .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 4]: `` He insisted .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 13]: I tried to make it later , but it was no use .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 9]: Five o'clock , not a moment later . ''
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 4]: Katrine rose hastily .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 10]: Suppose he came earlier , and found her unprepared !
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 12]: She was eager to reach the stronghold of her own room .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 14]: `` I think , '' she announced haughtily , `` it 's presumptuous !
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 21]: One wants a little time ... Send word that I 'm tired , and prefer to wait until to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 29]: Dorothea held out her hands with a gesture which signified that she might send as many messages as she pleased , but the result would be the same .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 9]: `` I 'll stay in my room ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 3]: Katrine threatened .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 3]: Dorothea laughed .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 9]: `` It would make _ no _ difference !
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 27]: He 'd interview you through the door , he 'd say all that he _ had _ to say , only -- we should all overhear !
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 14]: It 's no use , Kitty , you might as well give in .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 13]: When Jim Blair makes up his mind it 's useless to fight .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 6]: He carries it through . ''
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 4]: Not this time !
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 5]: Katrine said to herself .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 4]: Not this time .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 9]: Nevertheless it seemed impossible to avoid the meeting .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 5]: It had to come .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 10]: Perhaps the truest wisdom lay in getting it over .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 39]: She looked at Dorothea , a deep questioning glance , mutely imploring confidence , but Dorothea would speak of nothing but such practical matters as baths , the temperature of water , the opening and unpacking of trunks .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 9]: Not once had she mentioned Bedford 's name .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 10]: How much , how little , did Dorothea divine ?
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 3]: CHAPTER THIRTY .
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 13]: Alone in the quaint un-English bedroom Katrine bathed and made her toilette .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 41]: Dorothea 's loving hands had already opened the box which had come safely through so many perils , and there , upon the topmost tray , lay the clothes which had been packed with careful forethought for this special occasion .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 48]: A fine white gown of an elaborate simplicity which bore the hall-mark of Grizel 's taste , dainty shoes and stockings , the touch of blue which was necessary to the success of any costume intended for Katrine , even the large tortoise-shell pins for her hair .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 15]: With what expectation , what fond , shy hopes had they been laid together !
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 23]: It had been with something like the reverence of a bride for her wedding robe , that she had smoothed those folds .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 3]: Katrine shivered .
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 30]: An overwhelming pity rose in her heart , not alone for herself , but also for the good , tender man for whom was stored so bitter a disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 21]: Patient , trustful Jim Blair , who was even now awaiting her coming with a lover 's eagerness and impatience !
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 22]: A moment later , her thoughts had flown back on the wing of a feminine impulse to a still dearer personality .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 40]: On shipboard it had been difficult to attain a delicacy of toilette ; she had been swathed in veils , hot and wind-blown , -- it was impossible to strangle a truant wish that Bedford might see her now !
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 16]: Katrine stood rigid by the doorway , gathering courage , then desperately flung it open .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 23]: The unfamiliar scent of the East assailed her nostrils , that scent which even more than sight proclaimed a change of country .
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 15]: She paced the long corridor , and caught the sound of Dorothea 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 12]: She was talking ; a deeper tone was heard in reply .
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 5]: Jim Blair had arrived !
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 11]: In another moment she would meet him face to face .
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 46]: It seemed to Katrine as if at that sound every pulse in her own body ceased beating ; there came a moment of breathlessness , of almost swooning inability to think or move , then once again she braced herself , and opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 17]: Against the light , his back turned towards her , stood a tall , uniformed figure .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 18]: Dorothea , flushed and trembling , swept forward and enveloped her friend in a fervid embrace . ''
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 7]: _ It is Jim _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 8]: she whispered in low , intent accents .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 4]: `` Jim Blair .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 13]: Be kind to him , Katrine , _ be kind _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 24]: She slid out of the retaining arms , a wraith-like embodiment of the Dorothea who had been , and sped from the room .
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 22]: The door closed behind her , and Katrine stood , a motionless figure , watching another , motionless as her own .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 4]: Had he heard ?
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 6]: Did he realise her presence ?
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 17]: He was tall and broad ; the lines of his uniform fitted tightly to his figure .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 28]: He looked a man of whom a woman might be proud , but he was a man without a personality ; a man whose face was hidden .
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 21]: Katrine laid her hand on the back of a couch and spoke two trembling words : `` Captain Blair ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 74]: At the sound of her voice he turned , wheeling towards her with a swift light movement , so that she might see his face , might look in his eyes -- grey , magnetic eyes , curiously light against the sunburn of his face ... Five minutes later , seated upon the huge bamboo couch , supported by strong arms which seemed to bound the world , Katrine slowly recovered collected thought .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 9]: `` You -- are -- _ Jim _ !
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 6]: ... Jim is -- You !
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 7]: ... Then what of Captain Bedford ?
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 4]: Where is he ?
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 8]: _ Is _ there a Captain Bedford ?
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 20]: Is he a real living man , or just a fictitious person invented for -- '' `` Indeed no !
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 22]: He is real enough , poor fellow , but in Egypt still , laid by the heel ; unable to move .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 9]: I only -- only took his place ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 16]: `` I think , '' announced Katrine slowly , `` I am very angry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 37]: It seemed an incongruous statement to make , considering the position and appearance of the speaker , but the hearer received it with a gravity which showed that his own conscience was not altogether at ease .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 11]: `` Dearest , before you judge , let me speak !
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 7]: Hear what I have to say !
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 8]: I had no intention of deceiving you .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 27]: Such an idea never entered my head until at the last moment a cable arrived to say that Bedford was incapacitated , and could not sail .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 17]: We were worried , all of us , to think that you should miss his help .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 21]: I was racking my brains to think what I could do , when the inspiration came to meet you myself .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 33]: It was an easy matter to get off for a few weeks , as there was leave owing to me , and I had started almost before I had time to think .
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 4]: Then came misgivings !
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 23]: I did not know how you would take it , if it would seem to you like going back on my promise .
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 25]: I had promised to keep on neutral ground for three months , and a _ tete-a-tete _ on shipboard seemed hardly playing the game .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 46]: -- I started on the heat of an impulse , afire to see you at the first possible moment ; I landed at Port Said in a blue funk , the joy at the thought of meeting swallowed in dread of what you might say .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 17]: I would have given a pile at that moment to have been safely back in India .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 6]: Then -- you know how !
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 5]: we met on shore .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 12]: I knew you at the first glance , and , Katrine !
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 6]: you knew _ me _ .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 26]: No matter who I was , or by what name I called myself , you belonged to me , _ and you knew it _ !
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 25]: `` At that moment , for the first time , it flashed into my head to take Bedford 's place in Bedford 's name .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 16]: I had seen the list of passengers , and I knew no one on board .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 16]: Ours is an out-of-the-way station , and I have seldom been home these last years .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 32]: It seemed to me that if I kept close and avoided the smoke-room , I might very well get through the rest of the voyage without an explanation as to name .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 29]: And I remembered what you had said -- all the little feminine arguments you had used rose up and argued with me as they had never done before .
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 63]: You said that to meet a man with whom you were expected , almost pledged , to fall in love , was a big handicap to success ; that if we could have a chance of meeting in the ordinary way , as strangers pledged to no special interest , we could test the strength of the mutual attraction far more surely .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 17]: And another time you said -LRB- I think this influenced me more than anything else ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 24]: you said that one glance at my face , five minutes in my society , would tell you more than a hundred letters !
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 6]: Do you remember saying that ?
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 19]: The inference was that the shape of my nose or ears was to count more than character . ''
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 14]: His strong hands pulled her round , so that her eyes met his .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 3]: `` Katrine !
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 6]: do you like my ears ?
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 14]: Are you satisfied with them now that you see them in flesh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 9]: `` I take no interest in your ears .
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 7]: What are your ears to me ?
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 41]: I was thinking of Jim Blair 's ears , and you are , -- I do n't know _ what _ you are -- a compound person , more strange than a hundred strangers ... Oh , _ Jim _ !
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 4]: how could you ?
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 13]: If you realised so much , why could n't you realise more ?
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 14]: If I was already yours , then why trouble to play a part ?
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 11]: Yes , I am angry ; _ I am _ !
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 7]: I think you were wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 7]: `` Sweetheart , I know it !
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 19]: Nobody knows it better than I. I am not excusing myself , only explaining how it came about .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 13]: One false step , and then it seemed impossible to go back .
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 31]: I could not face the thought of owning up on board , we were so happy , so innocently happy , that it seemed criminal to break it all up .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 15]: Confess now that I behaved well , that I made an exemplary escort ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 41]: `` You -- you -- made me dreadfully in love with you , '' protested Katrine , stiffening her back , and holding him off with determined hands , when his delight at the confession took an active form . ''
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 5]: _ And _ unhappy !
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 35]: Did you think it was a light thing to me to feel my loyalty slipping from me day by day -- to be obliged to love one man , when another man was waiting ?
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 14]: Did you think I had _ no _ heart for Jim Blair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 13]: `` I knew you had , and I loved you for it .
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 11]: Do you remember how you put me on my guard ?
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 16]: But I _ was _ Jim Blair , you darling , so all was well .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 32]: I was afraid you 'd worry , but at the worst it was a matter of _ days _ , and those days were going to save us months of waiting .
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 21]: That 's the way I put it , trying to convince myself that all would work out for the best .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 24]: We should have remained on terms of the strictest friendship , if -- if it had n't been for -- '' Katrine shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 19]: It would be long before she could talk calmly of the awesome experience through which she had passed .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 19]: Her arms relaxed , she sank back , and they clung together in silence for long healing minutes .
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 25]: `` You never told me , '' she whispered , `` even at the end -- what we _ thought _ was the end !
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 25]: You let me leave you , not knowing ... Why did you not tell me then , and let me die in peace ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 10]: His eyes met hers , gravely , questioning . ''
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 9]: _ Would _ it have made for peace ?
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 10]: Would death have seemed more easy , or less ?
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 22]: Was your brain clear enough to grasp explanations , or to have felt any comfort , if you _ had _ ?
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 17]: And , beloved , -- in the face of death what was a _ name _ ?
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 21]: I loved _ you _ , you loved me , what did it matter by what name I was called ?
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 10]: If it had been the end , -- well !
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 22]: it would not have been as Miss Beverley and Captain -- anything , that we should have met on another plane .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 31]: -- If we were saved , it was only a matter of two or three days ... '' `` One can suffer a good deal in two or three days !
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 21]: How do you suppose I felt in that train , looking forward to meeting you -- _ both _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 12]: His eyes twinkled ; the grave face broke into a smile .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 23]: `` Exactly as you would have done , for months instead of days , if we had kept to the original agreement !
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 14]: beloved , I apologise , but do n't expect me to be abject .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 37]: I 've thought it out , not once , but a dozen times , and I ca n't see that on the whole you 've suffered more than you were bound to do in any case .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 7]: And what have you been saved ?
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 7]: Three months of uncertainty and waiting .
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 6]: And what have you gained ?
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 12]: Three months of happiness to add to the score of life .
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 9]: It 's a big haul , my Katrine !
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 8]: It is worth a few pangs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 17]: `` You twist things about ; your arguments are specious ; they are arguments without premises .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 10]: Who said I was going to waive three months ?
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 10]: I 'm not at all sure that I shall .
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 7]: What would they say at home ?
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 21]: They know I 'm not the sort of girl to fall in love on a few days ' acquaintance . ''
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 8]: `` Why bring Cranford into the question ?
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 9]: Does it matter one button what they think ?
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 23]: Besides , I do n't wish to be boastful , but as a matter of fact , you _ did _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 6]: `` I did n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 3]: Katrine contradicted .
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 11]: thank goodness , I am restored to my own confidence .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 30]: I understand now that it was only because you _ were _ Jim , because I recognised _ yourself _ in spite of disguises that I did -- fall !
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 20]: I was really absolutely loyal throughout , but other people wo n't understand -- Mrs Mannering , for instance !
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 12]: I told her there was ` some one else . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 14]: `` And I went one better , and told her who I was !
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 19]: We had a heart-to-heart talk that morning in Bombay before I left , and cleared up all misunderstandings .
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 6]: She 's a good sort .
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 6]: We owe her a lot .
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 19]: Perhaps some day we may be able to pay some of it back , to her boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 4]: Katrine nodded dumbly .
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 50]: She was occupied in reviewing her journey up country in the light of the revelation , and seeing in it an explanation of her companion 's idiosyncrasies , her mysterious chuckles of laughter , her tenderness , alternated with raillery , her suppressed excitement at the moment of arrival .
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 16]: She had known all the time , even in Bombay , when the letter arrived !
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 8]: Katrine started , confronted by another mystery .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 4]: `` The letter !
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 12]: The one at Bombay -- '' `` What about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 13]: `` You wrote it , of course , but how , when ?
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 5]: Not before our voyage .
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 20]: You _ knew _ when you wrote -- '' `` Yes ; I knew , '' he said softly .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 10]: `` It was written on the night we arrived .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 25]: I trusted to your ignorance of the country in the matter of postmarks , and to your femininity to pass the absence of date !
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 9]: Was it selfish of me to send it ?
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 19]: I knew you would be expecting to hear , and it was a comfort to me to write .
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 20]: Besides , I felt that a moment would come when it would be a comfort to you , too .
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 31]: You had trained me to understand that your mind worked in flashes , and that at a glance you could grasp a situation which would petrify a poor male thing .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 46]: Remembering this , I believed -- I _ hoped _ that at the very moment of discovery you might remember what I had said , and realise that all was right between us -- always had been right , always would be to the end !
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 30]: I wanted you to realise that that letter had been written _ after _ we had met , and that my love had changed only to grow deeper . ''
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 17]: Katrine sighed ; a deep , long-drawn sigh in which was the sound of immeasurable content .
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 11]: `` Oh , I am glad , '' she sighed .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 7]: `` I am _ glad _ !
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 17]: Even at the height of my love the thought of Jim Blair tugged at my heart .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 7]: It hurt me to hurt him .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 17]: He had wound his life so closely with mine that I could n't drag them apart .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 18]: And a bit of me loved him still , went on loving , and wanting his love .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 25]: After having accepted so much , I could never have been really satisfied to throw him over , even for -- _ Jim _ !
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 25]: I was going to say for ` _ you _ ' but you _ are _ Jim , and I can have you both !
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 30]: There 's no one to throw over ; no one to be unhappy -- '' Katrine paused ; in her deep eyes a gleam of laughter awoke and danced .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 35]: `` There 's only one drawback , Captain Bedford -- Blair -- Jim -- John -- whatever you chose to call yourself , and for _ that _ you have yourself to blame ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 6]: `` I 'll bear it .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 5]: I 'll bear anything !
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 6]: What is it now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 5]: asked Jim , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 26]: `` I shall always , '' replied Katrine demurely , `` I shall always feel that I am married to _ two _ men ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 3]: The End .
