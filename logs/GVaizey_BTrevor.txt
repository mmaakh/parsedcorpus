Parsing [sent. 1 len. 37]: Betty Trevor by Mrs George de Horne Vaizey -LRB- aka Jessie Mansergh -RRB- This book concerns a family where the children consist of a couple of boys , and a few more than that of girls .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 38]: They live in a Square in London , which bears the name of an existing London Square , but which is placed , according to the story , in quite a different place to the real one .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 22]: The children are fascinated by the occupants of the various other houses , some of whom they gradually get to know .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 25]: The children grow up , the boys are away doing interesting things , and the girls become interested in their own clothes and appearances .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 42]: This may be just a male 's view of the story , but it seems like it to me , for there does n't seem to be nearly as much life as you find in the same author 's Pixie books .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 39]: Well , I suppose that 's not true : there is a subtle undercurrent of old love affairs revived that runs right to the very last page -- and that is one of Mrs Vaizey 's greatest skills .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 35]: If you have n't done so , do read the little biography we have written of her , as it will help you to understand her writing rather better than if you do n't .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 13]: Still , you read the book , and see what you think .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 7]: You may well be pleasantly surprised .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 16]: BETTY TREVOR BY MRS GEORGE DE HORNE VAIZEY -LRB- aka JESSIE MANSERGH -RRB- CHAPTER ONE .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 6]: THE `` PAMPERED PET . ''
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 10]: `` There goes the ` Pampered Pet ' again !
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 10]: Got its little keeper with it , as usual .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 17]: Why do n't they lead her by a chain , and be done with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 60]: Miles stood by the schoolroom window , hands jingling in pockets , as he surveyed a prospect , sufficiently grey and drear to make any diversity doubly welcome , and at his words there came the sound of a general pushing-back of chairs , as the four other occupants of the room dashed forward to share in the view .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 37]: They jostled each other with the scant courtesy which brothers and sisters are apt to show each other in early days ; five big boys and girls , ranging between the ages of eight and nineteen .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 27]: Miles kept his central position by reason of superior strength , a vigorous dig of his pointed elbow being enough to keep trespassers at a distance .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 51]: Betty darted before him and nimbly dropped on her knees , the twins stood on either side of the window-sill , while poor Pam grumbled and fretted in the background , dodging here and there to try all positions in turn , and finding each as unsatisfactory as the last .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 47]: The Square gardens looked grey and sodden with the desolation of autumn in a city , and the road facing the window was empty , except for two female figures -- a lady , and a girl of sixteen , who were slowly approaching the corner .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 41]: The lady was dressed in black , the girl was noticeably smart , in a pretty blue costume , with dainty boots on her tiny feet , and a fur cap worn at the fashionable angle on her golden head .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 19]: `` That 's a new dress , -- the fifth I 've seen her in this month ! ''
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 4]: sighed Betty enviously .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 11]: `` Wearing it on an afternoon like this , too .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 3]: The idea !
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 10]: Serve her right if it were soaked through ! ''
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 9]: `` Look at her mincing over the puddles !
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 19]: She 'd rather go a mile out of her way than get a splash on those precious boots .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 14]: I 'm sure by the look of them that they pinch her toes !
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 18]: I am glad you girls do n't make ninnies of yourselves by wearing such stupid things . ''
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 4]: `` Ca n't !
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 5]: Feet too big ! ''
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 34]: mumbled Jill , each cheek bulging in turn with the lump of toffee which she was mechanically moving from side to side , so as to lengthen the enjoyment as much as possible .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 4]: `` Ca n't !
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 3]: Too poor !
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 14]: Only four shillings to last out till the end of the quarter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 6]: sighed Betty , dolorous again .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 3]: `` Boots !
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 2]: Boots !
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 3]: What boots ?
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 6]: Let me see her boots .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 4]: It 's mean !
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 10]: You wo n't let me see a thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 22]: cried Pam , pushing her shaggy head round Miles ' elbow , and craning forward on the tip of her toes .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 4]: `` I say !
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 12]: She 's grander than ever to-day , is n't she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 6]: `` Look at the umbrella !
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 9]: About as thick as a lead pencil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 10]: scoffed Jill , flattening her nose against the pane .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 39]: `` Aunt Amy had one like that when she came to stay , and I opened it , because mother says it spoils them to be left squeezed up , and she was as mad as a hatter .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 16]: She twisted at it a good ten minutes before she would take it out again .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 9]: She 'd never get _ mine _ straight !
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 14]: I 've carried things in it till the wires bulge out like hoops .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 16]: An umbrella is made for use ; it 's bosh pretending it 's an ornament .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 21]: ... They are going a toddle round the Square between the showers for the benefit of the Pet 's complexion .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 13]: I 'm glad I have n't got one to bother about ! ''
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 6]: `` True for you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 7]: agreed Miles , with brotherly candour .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 30]: `` You are as brown as a nigger , and the Pet is like a big wax-doll -- yellow hair , blue eyes , pink cheeks , all complete .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 7]: Not a bad-looking doll , either .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 14]: I passed quite close to her one day , and she looked rattling .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 13]: She 'll be a jolly pretty girl one of these days . ''
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 9]: `` Oh , if you admire that type .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 11]: Personally , I do n't care for niminy - piminies .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 24]: You never see her speaking , but I daresay if you poked her in the right places she would bleat out ` Mam-ma !
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 3]: Pa-pa ! '
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 5]: ... Now watch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 4]: cried Betty dramatically .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 30]: `` When she gets to the corner , she will peer up at this window beneath her eyelashes , and mince worse than ever when she sees us watching .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 7]: Do n't shove so , Pam !
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 9]: You can see quite well where you are .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 5]: Now _ look _ !
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 9]: She 's going to raise her head . ''
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 36]: The five heads pressed still more curiously against the pane , and five pairs of eyes were fixed unblinkingly upon the young girl who was daintily picking her way round the corner of the Square .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 45]: The fur cap left her face fully exposed to view , and , true to Betty 's prophecy , as she reached a certain point in the road she turned her head over her shoulder and shot a quick glance at the window overhead .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 29]: Quicker than lightning the pretty head went round again , and the pink cheeks grew crimson at the sight of those five eager faces watching her every movement .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 50]: Jack and Jill burst into loud laughter , Betty 's upper lip curled derisively , but Miles ' thin face showed an answering flush of colour , and he backed into the room , exclaiming angrily -- `` I say , this is too much of a good thing !
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 16]: I do n't know what you all mean by swarming round me wherever I go !
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 9]: Why ca n't you leave a fellow alone ?
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 17]: Ca n't I even look out of the window without having you all on my back ?
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 27]: A nice effect it must have to see the whole place blocked up , as if we were staring at a Lord Mayor 's show ! ''
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 23]: Betty sat down by the table and took up the blouse on which she had been working for the last three months .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 20]: The sleeves had been taken out and replaced twice over , and the collar-band obstinately refused to come right .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 33]: By the time it was finished it would be hopelessly out of date , which Betty considered as one of the many contrary circumstances of life which continually thwarted her good endeavours .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 6]: `` Do n't worry yourself .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 8]: She will enjoy being stared at ! ''
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 4]: she said coldly .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 22]: `` She knows we watch her coming in and out , and shows off all her little tricks for our benefit .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 30]: She 's the most conceited , stuck-up , affected little wretch I ever saw , without a thought in her head but her clothes , and her own importance .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 14]: I would n't have anything to do with her for the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 15]: `` Jolly good thing then that you are never likely to get a chance !
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 18]: Her people will never trouble to call upon us ; they are much too high and mighty .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 19]: That 's no reason , though , why you should be so down on the poor little soul .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 32]: I should have thought that you would have felt sorry for her , cooped up with that old governess all her time , with not a soul to keep her company !
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 12]: But girls are such cads -- they never play fair . ''
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 32]: Miles strode out of the room in a fume , and Betty 's lips compressed themselves into a thin straight line , the meaning of which the others knew full well .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 33]: To incur Miles ' displeasure was Betty 's bitterest punishment , and the `` Pampered Pet '' was not likely to fare any better at her hands in consequence of his denouncement .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 6]: Jill beckoned furtively to Jack .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 35]: There was no chance of any more fun in the schoolroom now that Miles had departed , and Betty was in the sulks ; it would be wise to go and disport themselves elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 44]: They left the room arm-in-arm , heads almost touching , as they whispered and giggled together , the most devoted pair of twins that ever existed , and eight-year-old Pam leant her elbows on the table and stared fixedly at her big sister .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 23]: Betty was seventeen , nearly grown-up , inasmuch as she had left school , and now took classes to complete her education .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 30]: Her blue serge dress came down to her ankles , and she made a gallant attempt to `` do up '' her hair in the style of the period .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 46]: Mrs Trevor considered the style too elaborate for such a young girl , but after all it did not much matter what was aimed at , since every morning someone exclaimed innocently , `` You 've done your hair a new way , Betty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 8]: and was fully justified in the remark .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 25]: One day Betty 's ambition ran to curls and waves , and she appeared at the breakfast-table with a fuzz worthy of a negress .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 58]: The next day better judgment prevailed , when she brushed hard for ten minutes , and then pinned on a hair-net , with the result that she looked a veritable little Puritan ; and between these extremes ranged a variety of effects , only possible of achievement to an amateur with no experience , but boundless ambition .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 20]: If you could have honestly pronounced Betty pretty , you would have satisfied the deepest longing of her heart .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 65]: She gazed in the glass every morning , twisting her head from side to side , and deciding irrevocably that she was hideous , a fright , a perfect freak , while all the time an obstinate little hope lingered that perhaps after all , in becoming clothes , and when she was in a good temper , she might look rather ... nice !
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 62]: Chestnut hair , such a pretty colour , but so little of it that it would not `` go '' like other girls ' ; dark grey eyes with curly black lashes ; an impertinent little nose , and a mouth just about twice as big as those possessed by the ladies in mother 's _ Book of Beauty _ downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 38]: At the best she could only be `` pretty '' or a `` sweet-looking girl , '' and she pined to be beautiful and stately , and to reign as a queen over the hearts of men .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 3]: Poor Betty !
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 36]: Many a girl of seventeen lives through the same tragedy in secret , but they are not all fortunate enough to possess an adoring younger sister who thinks her all that she fain would be .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 15]: Pam put out a little ink-stained hand , and stroked the half-finished blouse admiringly .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 10]: `` It 's going to be lubly , Bet !
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 10]: It hardly shows a bit where you joined it .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 9]: You 'll soon have finished it now . ''
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 11]: `` No , I sha n't , '' snapped Betty .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 17]: `` There 's heaps to do still , and it 's getting too cold for cottons .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 4]: Just my luck !
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 8]: I always seem to be making mistakes .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 17]: It was n't my fault that that stupid girl looked up and caught us watching . ''
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 33]: The underlying thought showed itself in the sudden change of subject , but Pam was not surprised , for in her quiet , shrewd little way she had divined it long ago .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 18]: `` But you said she 'd look up , so you could have moved if you liked .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 14]: I do n't think it was very perlite , '' she said solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 20]: `` There were all four of you at the window , and my eyes peeping round Miles ' back .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 7]: I expect it looked pretty fearful .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 8]: She went purple , did n't she ?
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 6]: It 's horrid to blush !
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 17]: I did once when I got a prize before people , and I hated it . ''
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 5]: `` Oh , you !
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 7]: You are a modest little mouse .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 6]: The Pet is quite different .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 16]: Nasty thing , she might have been satisfied without making mischief between Miles and me !
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 19]: She has everything that she wants , and that _ I _ want , and have n't got .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 30]: She 's pretty , and rich , and has a lovely big house and heaps of people to wait upon her , and nice things , and -- everything !
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 10]: You ca n't think how I hate her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 18]: Pam leant her thin arms on the table , and meditated for a long , thoughtful moment .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 17]: When she spoke , it was , as usual , to deliver herself of the unexpected .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 44]: `` That 's what you call ` envy , hatred , and malice , ' I s ` pose , '' she said thoughtfully , and Betty 's head came up with a jerk to turn upon her a glance of suspicious inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 22]: The round , grey eyes were as clear , as innocent , as guilelessly adoring as she had ever seen them .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 36]: They gazed into her own without a shadow of self-consciousness , and as she met that gaze Betty flushed , and the irritable lines disappeared from her face as if wiped out by a sponge .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 13]: `` One for you , Pam , '' she cried , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 8]: `` I _ am _ a pig !
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 15]: A nice big elder sister I am , to set you such an example !
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 6]: I 'm cross , dear .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 9]: Everything has gone wrong the whole day long .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 16]: You had better run off and leave me alone , or I 'll snap again .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 7]: I feel all churned up inside !
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 8]: This is only a temporary lapse . ''
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 15]: `` There 's scones for tea ; I saw the bag in the pantry .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 11]: S'pose I went downstairs and coaxed cook to toast them ?
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 8]: You said yourself toasted scones were soothing .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 27]: If Miles smells them he 's sure to come , '' said Pam shrewdly , and Betty leant forward and kissed her impetuously on the cheek .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 22]: `` There 's one comfort , '' she cried ; `` I 've got you , and the Pet has n't !
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 14]: You are the comfort of my old age , Pamela , my child .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 4]: Yes , toasted !
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 26]: And lots of butter , and leave the door wide open , so that the smell may get out , and lure Miles back . ''
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWO .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 6]: THE PEOPLE OF THE SQUARE .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 47]: Brompton Square is situated on the north side of Hyde Park , between the Marble Arch and Lancaster Gate , and is as stiff and , for the greater portion of the year , as gloomy in appearance as most of the regions in the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 30]: The different sides of the Square differ widely in social status , the northern side being the most , and the eastern side the least , aristocratic and roomy .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 27]: The largest house of all was a great grey stone edifice , having a stretch of three windows on either side of the heavy oak door .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 32]: The smallest and shabbiest stood at right angles to it , showing a shabby frontage of two windows to the gardens , and having its front entrance in a side street .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 46]: Really and truly it could barely claim to belong to the Square at all , though the landlord claimed , and the doctor tenant felt it worth while to pay , a heavy rent for the privilege of printing a fashionable address upon his cards .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 21]: Behind the silken curtains and _ brise-bise _ of Number 14 , the `` Pampered Pet '' had her residence .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 42]: At Number 1 the doctor 's big family was so crowded together that Betty was thankful to appropriate a front attic as the only chance of possessing that luxury dear to every girlish heart -- `` a bedroom to herself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 31]: It was not a luxurious apartment , but it was pretty , as every girl 's bedroom may easily be , if she has the will to make it so .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 52]: The hemp carpet had long since faded to a nondescript grey , but the pink-washed walls were hung with pictures and photographs , and the owner 's love of beauty and order showed itself in the arrangement of the furniture , and the careful setting out of a few treasured ornaments .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 48]: There was no gas in the room , so that Betty was obliged to do her simple dressing for dinner by the aid of a candle , whose flickering beams seemed intent on lighting every corner of the room , and leaving the mirror in inky darkness .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 42]: It was only within the last three months that Dr Trevor had left his old-fashioned house in Bloomsbury , hoping that the change of residence would help him in his ambition to extend his practice among a better class of patients .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 26]: The neighbourhood was new to his family , and none of the residents of the Square had so far taken any notice of their presence .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 42]: Calling is not usual in London unless there is some personal interest involved , and no doubt the occupants of more aristocratic houses looked down with contempt on the sandwiched row of shabby windows which belonged to them only on sufferance .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 28]: If the neighbours showed no interest in the doctor 's family , the Trevors , on the contrary , felt a devouring interest in everyone around them .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 33]: They had invented nicknames for all the residents in the northern row , of which the schoolroom possessed the best view , before they had been a week in their new quarters .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 36]: A glance at the Directory in their father 's consulting-room would have solved the problem at once , but that was a practical and commonplace method of procedure which made no appeal to their imaginations .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 15]: Nicknames were a thousand times better , because you could manufacture them to suit !
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 15]: The two old maiden ladies who lived in Number 15 were Emily and Hannah .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 25]: Emily was dressy , wore a false front , and always took precedence of her sister , who was small and mousy in demeanour .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 38]: It was apparent to the meanest intellect that a godmother had bequeathed her fortune to Emily , and that she gave her sister a home and generally supported her , for which generosity Hannah was duly thankful .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 67]: The two old ladies breakfasted in bed every morning , went out for drives at eleven and three o'clock , -LRB- `` ambles , '' Miles called them in scornful reference to the pace of the sleek old horses -RRB- , retired to their rooms for naps after lunch , ate a hearty dinner at eight , and settled down for the night at ten o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 21]: It does not require the skill of a Sherlock Holmes to discover such proceedings on the part of our neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 13]: The study of electric lights on gloomy autumn days is wonderfully informing !
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 53]: Number 16 was uninteresting , -- only a stupid man and his wife , who looked like a hundred other men and their wives ; and who had tiresome silk curtains drawn across the lower panes of their windows , so that it was impossible to obtain a glimpse of the rooms .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 28]: Number 17 , however , more than ever made up for this disappointment , for there lived `` The Pretty Lady '' beloved by one and all .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 49]: She was tall , and dark , and young ; almost like a girl , and Betty darkly suspected her of being engaged , for she looked so beamingly happy , and was often seen walking about with a tall , handsome man in the shiniest of top-hats .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 50]: The door of Number 17 was somewhat out of the line of vision , so that it was not always easy to see who went in and out , but the young couple often passed the corner of the Square , and always seemed to be in radiant spirits .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 20]: Once when the pretty lady was wearing a new coat , Edwin -LRB- of course he was Edwin ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 19]: fell behind a pace or two to study the effect , and softly clapped his hands in approval .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 32]: It must be nice , Betty thought wistfully , to be engaged , and have someone who liked you the best of all , and brought you home chocolates and flowers !
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 40]: She was anxious to know who formed the other members of the household , but Jill said there was only an invalid mother , who said , `` Go about as much as ever you can , my darling .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 6]: Do n't think about me !
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 21]: The young should always be happy ; '' and this was accepted by all as a natural and satisfactory explanation .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 15]: There were no children to be found in the whole length of the terrace .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 24]: The landlords , no doubt , had too much regard for their white enamel and costly wall-papers to welcome tenants with large families .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 25]: The `` Pampered Pet '' in Number 14 was the nearest approach to a child , and she must have been sixteen at least .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 34]: Her father was a General Somebody out in India , and her mother remained in England to superintend the Darling 's education , and see that she did not get her feet wet .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 31]: As soon as she was eighteen she would be presented at Court , taken out to India , and married to the Viceroy at the end of her first season .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 45]: The Pet 's bedroom was on the third storey of the house , and as its windows faced the gardens of the Square , she had a fancy for leaving them undraped , except for the narrow _ brise-bise _ over the lower panes .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 67]: It probably never occurred to her to remember one little dormer window perched high in the corner house , which of late days had constituted Betty Trevor 's domain , and she would have been greatly surprised to know how good a view of her sanctum could be obtained from this vantage - ground , or how much time its mistress gave to enjoying the same .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 47]: All alone in the dark Betty would kneel on a chair and press her face against the cold panes , staring , staring , muttering to herself -- `` She has a fire to dress by -- I can see the flames flickering up and down .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 9]: What stupid indulgence for a child like that !
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 6]: Electric lights in pink shades .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 5]: It does look cosy !
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 7]: The maid is brushing her hair .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 13]: I can see her arm going up and down like a machine .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 2]: Goodness !
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 9]: How long is she going to keep on ?
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 5]: No wonder it shines !
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 7]: I 'll brush mine , too .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 30]: Ten minutes regularly every night and morning ; but I 'm always late in the morning , and too tired at night , so I know I wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 12]: I do hope they come over here to fasten her dress .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 12]: It was white last night ; on Tuesday it was blue .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 16]: What a fuss to make , when there is only Mrs General and the governess !
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 13]: The Pet plays and sings to them in the drawing-room after dinner .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 23]: That hot night when the windows were open we could hear her distinctly , and it was such a funny little squeak .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 6]: Jill can imitate it beautifully .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 15]: If I could n't sing better than that I would n't sing at all .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 3]: ... There !
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 11]: She Is getting up -- _ pink _ this time !
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 9]: I can see the maid lacing it up .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 6]: Well , what next ! ''
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 10]: Betty crouched back on her knees and sighed dolorously .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 24]: It must be nice to be rich like that and have everything one wanted , -- the only adored darling of the household .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 19]: It did seem hard that one girl should have everything she wanted , and another want so much .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 41]: The furnishing of this attic bedroom , for instance -- everything was a makeshift for something else which was what she really wanted , and had been unable to get , and it was the same all through the house .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 27]: When mother had pleaded for a new paper for the drawing-room , father had said -- `` Not just yet , I 'm afraid , dear .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 11]: There are so many necessities which must be met . ''
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 28]: That was the worst of it ; there never was money enough for the nice ornamental things which were so much more interesting than stodgy old usefuls !
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 10]: Betty sighed again , and shrugged her shoulders impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 34]: The Pampered Pet had finished her toilet by this time ; she crossed the room and stood by the window for a moment , a slim pink figure in the soft pink light .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 7]: `` Horrid , horrid thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 4]: cried Betty fretfully .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 58]: `` How I do -- '' And then at the very moment of repeating her protestations of dislike , Pam 's serious childish face rose before her sight , and she heard the sweet shrill voice saying once again -- `` I suppose that 's what they call ` envy , hatred , and malice . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 15]: ... `` She 's right , quite right , '' Betty acknowledged to herself .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 26]: `` It _ is _ , or just as near it as is possible for a girl to get who is surrounded by good influences .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 5]: How hateful it sounds !
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 7]: I did feel ashamed of myself .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 15]: I 'm the eldest girl , and I ought to set a good example .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 26]: If I were quiet and gentle and resigned , they would all look up to me , and Miles would n't snub me any more .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 46]: I 'll turn over a new leaf from this very hour , and remember my blessings , and never grumble any more , or be cross , or snappy , and be glad , absolutely glad , when other people are better off than myself .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 7]: After all , I 'm seventeen .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 8]: It 's time I was growing resigned .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 9]: I wo n't envy anybody any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 27]: Betty jumped up from her seat , lighted her candles , and began to make her modest toilet for dinner with an air of satisfied finality .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 27]: It was characteristic of her that she was never satisfied with half-measures , and was always supremely confident of her ability to carry out new resolutions .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 57]: The determination to become a perfect character was taken as easily as if it had been a choice between a couple of ribbons , and she put on her quietest blouse , and parted her hair in the middle , brushing it smoothly over her ears , with an artistic satisfaction in dressing for a part .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 58]: The resolution held good exactly a quarter of an hour , at the expiration of which time Jack and Jill dashed suddenly out of the schoolroom as their elder sister was pursuing a staid course downstairs , when Jill promptly seized hold of her silk sleeves with sticky fingers , and Jack exclaimed , `` I say !
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 5]: What a fright ! ''
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 4]: with brotherly candour .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 10]: Betty snapped , of course , and snapped vigorously .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 9]: It was not her fault , she reflected .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 20]: No one could be expected to be patient if other people would insist on being so horrid and exasperating !
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 3]: CHAPTER THREE .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 4]: THE TREVOR FAMILY .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 60]: The family dinner was served at seven o'clock , and all the children , down to Pam herself , appeared at table , for Dr Trevor liked to have his family round him at the close of the day , and , thanks to his wife 's good management , the meal was always a bright and cheery occasion .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 46]: Mrs Trevor was a devoted mother to every one of her flock , but the person in the house whom she mothered most of all was her hard-working husband , whose life was so devoted to others that he had little time to consider himself .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 28]: From the children 's earliest years they had been taught that to `` worry father '' was one of the most serious offences which they could commit .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 46]: `` Father spends his life going about from one sickroom to another ; all day long he is meeting people who are ill , and anxious , in fear , and in pain , and when he comes home he must have a cheery welcome .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 31]: If you want to grumble about anything , grumble to yourselves or to me ; if you have anything disagreeable to tell , let it wait until we are alone .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 14]: Meal - times with father must be devoted to pleasant subjects alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 63]: Such were Mrs Trevor 's instructions , instilled into her children 's minds with such persistent firmness that they were never disobeyed , with the result that the tired doctor came home with the happy certainty of enjoying a cheery , harmonious hour , and the young people themselves learnt a lesson in self-restraint which was of infinite value in after life .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 27]: Betty might grumble and tirade outside the schoolroom door , but as she approached the dining-room she mechanically smoothed her brow and adopted a cheerful expression .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 37]: To-night Dr Trevor was already seated in his place at the end of the long table , for his wife took the head , to save him the fatigue of carving for so large a party .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 24]: He was a tall , thin man , with a lined face lit by the keen , thoughtful eyes of the true physician .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 23]: He looked up as his eldest daughter entered the room , and held out his hand to her in a mute caress .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 29]: She bent to kiss his forehead , and stood holding his hand to chat for a few minutes until the other members of the family made their appearance .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 90]: He noticed the Puritan-like coiffure -- there were few things that those shrewd eyes did not notice -- but made no comment thereon , for , as he frequently observed to his wife when she confided to him her troubles over Betty 's eccentricities , boys and girls who are in the transition stage between childhood and maturity are apt to become a trifle restless and eccentric , and it was wisdom to be for the most part judiciously blind , interfering only in cases of right and wrong .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 13]: Let the little maid run with a loose rein for a time .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 17]: She would soon settle down , and be the first to laugh at her own foibles .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 25]: Mrs Trevor took her place , looking round on her assembled children with the pretty , half-appealing little smile which was her greatest charm .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 17]: She was slight and graceful , not stout and elderly , like other people 's mothers .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 33]: In the morning light she often looked wan and tired , but in the kindly lamplight she seemed more like Betty 's sister than the mother of a rapidly growing up family .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 31]: Miles sat at her right hand , a tall , somewhat heavy-looking youth , with enormous hands and feet , a square , determined jaw , and deep-set brown eyes .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 47]: Even a casual glance at him was sufficient to show that he was going to make a man of power and determination , but , like Betty , he was passing through his awkward stage , and was often neither easy nor agreeable to live with .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 14]: Jack was just a mischievous schoolboy , with protruding ears and twinkling eyes .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 31]: One can see a score like him any day , marching , marching along the street with satchels of books ; but his twin sister had a more striking personality .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 10]: Jill was a mystery to her relations and friends .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 84]: She had ordinary brown hair , and not too much of that , light blue eyes with indifferent lashes , a nose a shade more impertinent than Betty 's own , a big mouth , and a powdering of freckles under her eyes ; yet with those very ordinary equipments she managed to rank as a beauty among her schoolmates , and to attract more admiration than is vouchsafed to many people whose features might have been turned out of a classic mould .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 37]: Betty used to ponder wistfully over the secret of Jill 's charm , and think it hard lines that it had not been given to herself , who would have cared for it so much more .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 10]: Jill did n't care a pin how she looked .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 82]: She wanted to `` have fun , '' to invite Nora Bruce to tea as often as possible , to buy a constant supply of a special sort of almond toffee which was offered for sale at a shop which she passed on the way to school , to be a first-form girl and have one of the new desks , and , incidentally , to pass the Cambridge examination if it could be done without too much `` fag . ''
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 25]: She put on her clothes any way , did her hair in the twinkling of an eye , and the effect was uniformly charming .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 20]: `` If she 's untidy , she 's picturesque ; if I 'm untidy , I 'm a fright .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 5]: It 's mean ! ''
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 4]: soliloquised Betty discontentedly .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 32]: Every day she lived she was the more convinced that the world was topsy-turvy , and that she herself was the only person who was competent to set it to rights .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 16]: Pam was just Pam ; like herself , and no one else in the world .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 50]: A dear little , wide-eyed , pointed-chinned kitten , everybody 's tease , and pet , and conscience all in one , for those clear child eyes seemed to see through all pretences , and what she thought she put into words without a shadow of fear or hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 56]: It was a very plain , almost a frugal , repast , but the table looked cheerful and pretty with the pink-shaded lamp in the centre , surrounded by the four little bowls of flowers which it was one of Betty 's duties to keep fresh , and there was no lack of lively conversation .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 67]: Mrs Trevor had had a trying day , and several of her worries must of necessity be discussed with her husband later on , but she would allow no hint of them to escape until he had been fed and rested , and in the same manner all the children searched their memories for the pleasantest event which they had experienced to retail for his benefit .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 30]: `` I was top to-day , father , '' Jack announced proudly ; `` answered every single question in Latin , and read off my translation like a book .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 16]: If I liked to stew , I believe I could lick Johnston all the time .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 25]: He was pretty sick at having to go down ; looked as glum as an old owl for the rest of the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 14]: `` He takes his work more seriously than you do , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 24]: You say you could be top if you liked : I am glad to hear it ; but why do n't you like ?
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 10]: You ca n't surely prefer a lower place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 13]: `` Oh , well , there 's reason in all things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 29]: returned Jack , with a vagueness which his brothers and sisters had apparently little difficulty in understanding , for they laughed , and sniggered meaningly to each other .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 16]: `` Such a waste of time , when there is football to be played ! ''
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 22]: `` A full back has to keep his energy for his work , and not fritter it away over stupid books .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 12]: That 's about it , is n't it , Jack ? ''
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 37]: they teased , while Dr Trevor said between a sigh and a smile -- `` Ah , well , my boy , you are old enough to judge for yourself how your time should be spent !
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 29]: If you win a scholarship , I 'll manage to help you through a ` Varsity course , but I ca n't afford to keep you there unassisted .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 12]: Remember it is your whole career which is at stake . ''
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 17]: `` All right , father , I _ will _ work , '' said Jack easily .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 20]: He was an affectionate boy , who disliked disappointing his parents , but unfortunately he disliked work even more .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 17]: He was rather sorry now that he had mentioned his easy victory over the redoubtable Johnston .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 30]: The pater would expect him to be top every day , whereas he had only just put on a spurt to show what he could do if he chose .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 25]: Suppose he did lose the scholarship , it would n't be so bad after all , he could still play footer on Saturday afternoons !
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 35]: The doctor 's glance had wandered , as if for consolation , to his elder son -- Miles the strenuous , the indefatigable , who had a passion for work for work 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 39]: He was going through the practical stage of an engineer 's training , and left the house at six o'clock each morning , to return in the afternoon clad in workman 's clothes , incredibly greasy and dirty .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 31]: Betty suffered agonies in case `` they '' -- that wonderful impersonal `` they '' who overclouded her life -- should think he was really and truly an ordinary workman !
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 62]: On one occasion Miles had joined her on the doorstep as she was returning from an afternoon walk , and she had distinctly seen the curtains of the Pampered Pet 's drawing-room move , as if someone were peeping out from behind , when , as she confided to Jill later on , `` her cheeks turned k-r-rimson with mortification ! ''
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 32]: `` Well , Miles , my boy , did you take your little invention with you to - day , and were you able to show it to the manager ? ''
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 10]: `` Yes , I took it all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 8]: `` And what did he say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 9]: `` He said it was all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 17]: `` Does that mean that he acknowledged that it was an improvement on the present method ?
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 11]: Did he feel inclined to give it a trial ? ''
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 9]: `` Oh yes , it went all right .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 7]: He said it would do . ''
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 6]: `` But that 's capital !
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 2]: Capital !
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 5]: I congratulate you heartily !
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 18]: Did n't Mr Davidson seem pleased that you should have hit on such a bright idea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 11]: `` Oh , he said it was all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 23]: Miles made a determined attack on his plate , as if pleading to be left alone to enjoy his dinner in peace .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 51]: Since the days of his babyhood he had shown a strong inventive genius , and now it was his delight to spend his spare moments working in his little cupboard sanctum at home , striving to improve on any bit of machinery which struck him as falling short of perfection .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 49]: It was a very simple thing which he had attempted , but in machinery , as in many other things , trifles are all-important , and it was a triumph indeed that a lad of nineteen should have hit on an improvement which was considered worth a trial .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 11]: Dr Trevor and his wife exchanged smiles of happy satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 25]: They yearned to ask a dozen more questions , but refrained out of sympathy with that natural masculine reserve which they understood so well .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 8]: Betty , however , was less considerate .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 17]: `` I do think you might tell us a little more about it , Miles ! ''
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 4]: she cried resentfully .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 10]: `` You know we are all dying of curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 21]: I ca n't think why it is that boys can never give a decent account of anything that has happened !
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 86]: Now , if it had been me , I should have begun at the very beginning , from the moment I entered the works , and told you how I felt as I went upstairs , and how I began to speak to the manager , and what he said , and how he looked , and -- '' `` What colour of necktie he wore -- '' Betty tossed her head in scornful contempt of the burst of laughter evoked by Miles ' words .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 53]: `` And what he did with the screw , or whatever you call it , when you showed it to him , and what the other men said , and -- Oh , dozens of interesting things ; but you can say nothing but ` all right ' to every single question .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 7]: It _ is _ dull ! ''
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 18]: `` You must allow for diversities of talent , Betty , '' said Mrs Trevor , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 11]: `` We do not all possess your powers of description .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 20]: Miles is very modest over his success , and I , like you , want to hear more details .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 28]: You must be sure to tell us how the trial works , Son ; and if your improvement is permanently adopted , I shall be proud ! ''
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 8]: `` Nothing to be proud of ! ''
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 6]: muttered Miles into his plate .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 26]: If there was one thing he loathed more than another , it was to be praised and petted , and made the centre of attention .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 23]: His roughened fingers clenched themselves tightly round the knife and fork , and he cut his beef into pieces with savage energy .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 9]: Why could n't they leave a fellow alone ?
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 10]: All this fuss about a bit of a cog !
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 49]: Betty divined his discomfiture , as she divined all that concerned her beloved brother , but she had not the tact to come to the rescue , and it was Jill who turned the conversation by a casual question which yet was of interest to all the family .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 15]: `` Father , is there a father at the big house at the corner ?
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 11]: We ca n't decide what 's the matter with him .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 14]: There must have been one , of course , because of the Pet .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 23]: Jack says he 's dead , but she is not in mourning , and the mother does n't wear widow 's things .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 32]: I say he 's gone a tour round the world , and is buying presents at every port so as to pamper her more than ever when he comes back . ''
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 59]: Dr Trevor looked a trifle mystified , but he was accustomed to his children 's mental flights , and , after a moment 's consideration , he replied smilingly -- `` If you mean Number 14 , the tenant is a certain Major Alliot , who is at present , I believe , with his regiment in India .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 27]: I do n't know anything about his household , or the identity of the ` Pet , ' as you are pleased to call her . ''
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 38]: `` I wish she 'd fall downstairs , or have an accident of some sort suddenly , so that they 'd have to fly across for you in a hurry , '' sighed Jill with frank brutality .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 23]: `` I wish all the people in that row would have accidents , so that you could tell us all about them .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 7]: We are dying with curiosity ! ''
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 8]: `` Would n't influenza do as well ?
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 18]: There is no need to be quite so brutal , Jill , '' her father reminded her .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 22]: `` Besides , it is hardly my usual custom to tell you ` all about ' my cases , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 46]: I should be very glad to find new patients nearer here for my own sake ; which reminds me , dear , that I have to go a long drive after dinner , and sha n't be home for the evening , as I hoped .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 12]: It is unfortunate having so many late nights this week . ''
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 35]: Mrs Trevor 's brow shadowed for a moment , but she recovered herself , and smiled bravely at her husband , while Betty cried emphatically -- `` I shall never marry a doctor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 4]: `` Lucky beggar !
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 8]: He 's had an escape anyway ! ''
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 37]: growled Miles beneath his breath , quite unable to resist paying Betty back for her attack on him a few moments before , and Betty laughed as merrily as the rest at the joke against herself .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 10]: `` Well , I shall have an escape too !
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 21]: I do n't like ill people or having anything to do with them ; it 's not my vocation ! ''
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 30]: she announced grandiloquently , and her face fell with dismay when her father said cheerily -- `` Oh , come , you do n't do yourself justice , dear .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 10]: I always find you a very acceptable little nurse .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 9]: Mrs Ewen was asking for you only to-day .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 31]: I should be glad if you would make a point of going to see her some afternoon this week , and trying to amuse her for an hour or two .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 12]: She has had a very sharp attack , poor soul . ''
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 17]: `` Yes , father , '' assented Betty meekly , but mentally she ground her teeth .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 53]: Mrs Ewen was an old patient , a tiresome patient from Betty 's point of view , who never grew better , but was frequently worse , who spent all her life in her bedroom and an upstairs sitting-room , her chief subject of conversation being the misdemeanours of her hardly-worked nurses .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 35]: She had taken a fancy to the doctor 's young daughter , and liked to be visited by her as often as possible in convalescent periods ; but Betty did not return the liking .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 13]: `` She does n't understand girls , '' she grumbled to herself .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 12]: `` I do n't believe she ever was a girl herself .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 14]: She must have been born about forty , with spectacles and a cap .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 11]: I ca n't think why she wants to see me .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 28]: I do nothing but say ` Yes ' and ` No ' while she abuses other people , and yawn my head off in that stifling room .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 12]: And I did so want to get on with my blouse .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 14]: Seems as if I could never do as I like , somehow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 39]: She sat looking such an image of meekness and resignation , with her smoothly-braided locks and downcast lids , that her father 's lips twitched with amusement as he glanced at her , and quickly averted his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 26]: He knew just as well as she did how distasteful his request had been , but he was none the less anxious to enforce it .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 36]: Betty 's horizon was blocked with self at the present moment , and anything and everything was of gain which forced her to think of something besides that all - important personage Miss Elizabeth Trevor .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 5]: A PIECE OF LOOKING-GLASS .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 7]: `` Such a joke , Jill !
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 32]: The sun is shining , and the Pet is sitting reading , in the drawing-room window , and I 've found a broken piece of looking - glass in the street .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 5]: -- There 's luck !
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 14]: Let 's hide behind the curtains and flash it in her eyes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 20]: Jill 's book fell down with a crash , and she leapt to her feet , abeam with anticipation .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 38]: It was Saturday , and she had announced her intention of `` stewing hard '' all the afternoon , but the claims of examinations sank into the background before the thrilling prospect held out by her twin .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 6]: `` Break it in two !
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 5]: Fair does , Jack !
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 13]: Give me a bit , and let us flash in turns ! ''
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 14]: she cried eagerly ; but Jack would not consent to anything so rash .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 10]: `` How can I divide it , silly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 3]: he replied .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 34]: `` I have n't a diamond _ to cut it _ , and if I crunch it with my foot it may all go to smithereens , and there will be nothing left .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 20]: I 'll lend it to you for a bit now and then , but you wo n't aim straight .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 5]: Girls never do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 4]: `` I do !
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 4]: I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 4]: Jill maintained loudly .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 4]: `` I will !
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 3]: I will !
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 6]: Come along , be quick !
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 13]: She might move away , and it would be such a sell .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 12]: I 'll kneel down here and keep the curtains round me .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 7]: I wonder what she 's reading .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 9]: Something awfully dry and proper , I expect !
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 5]: What heaps of hair !
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 20]: It hangs over her face , so that we sha n't be able to dazzle her a bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 10]: `` Yes , we will , '' contradicted Jack .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 22]: `` She 'll see the light dancing about on the page , and look up to see what 's the matter !
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 19]: You watch , but mind you do n't bob up your head and let her see you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 11]: `` Mind you do n't let her see your hand !
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 6]: It 's sticking right out .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 19]: You ought to put on a dark glove , which she would n't notice against the pane . ''
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 38]: Jack was pleased to approve of the glove proposition , and an adjournment was made to the doctor 's dressing-room , where a pair of ` funeral gloves ' were discovered which seemed exactly what was desired .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 36]: Jack drew one on his right hand , Jill drew the other on her left , and thus equipped they crept back to their hiding-place behind the shabby red curtains , and proceeded to work .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 33]: It was rather difficult to move the glass so as to throw the reflection on one exact spot , as the conspirators could only peep out for a moment at a time .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 40]: The little white circle of light danced all over the big grey house before it found the window above the porch , and , moving slowly up and down , eventually alighted on the page of the open book .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 30]: Jill giggled , Jack snored loudly , as was his habit when excited ; the Pet gave a little hitch round in her chair , and read on stolidly .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 4]: `` My turn !
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 4]: My turn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 4]: cried Jill excitedly .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 12]: `` You 've had your innings , now give me mine .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 5]: Hand it over ! ''
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 14]: and the two black gloved hands met in the middle of the window .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 8]: `` You moved it away too quickly !
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 14]: You must follow her about , and bob it g-ently up and down .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 7]: Wait till I get it right .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 4]: There it is !
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 16]: I 've got it better than you , Jack , ever so much better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 11]: `` That 's because the sun 's so much brighter .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 4]: Be careful now .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 4]: That 's enough !
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 24]: If you go on too long at a time , she 'll move away into the room and it will be all up .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 22]: Let her settle down again , and imagine she 's all right , then we 'll give her another treat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 10]: It was wonderful how expert one grew with practice !
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 23]: The light now danced direct to its destination , and move her book as she would , the Pet could not escape .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 22]: At last she grew impatient , tossed back her mane of hair and turned to stare curiously out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 30]: This was the longed-for opportunity , and Jack snored louder than ever with relief that it had come about when it was his turn to hold the treasured glass .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 24]: Quick as thought he waved it to and fro , and the Pet threw up her hands , unable to withstand the glare .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 27]: Safe in the seclusion of their distant room , the twins shrieked with exultation , and had much ado to keep their position behind the curtains .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 27]: Jill kept endeavouring to snatch the glass from her brother , but Jack was too intent on his work to take any notice of her efforts .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 13]: The Pet lifted one hand from her eyes and cautiously peeped out .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 29]: The sun was shining with unusual brilliancy for an October morning , but there was not the slightest difficulty in viewing the landscape as fully as she liked .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 67]: She turned her head from side to side in a curious inquiring fashion , and Jack , with an artist 's appreciation of the right moment , waited until she had abandoned the search , and was about to settle down again , when another blinding flash of light fell full on her face , and she shrank back into the shade with a startled gesture .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 64]: Seated in this last position , she exactly faced the schoolroom , and the twins had a moment 's horrified fear that she had caught a glimpse of their peeping faces , but her next movement put an end to suspicion , for she took up her book and settled down again to her reading exactly as if she had never been interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 7]: And then an extraordinary thing happened !
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 47]: The mane of golden hair was tossed back , leaving the face fully exposed , yet though the twins flashed the light on both eyes and book , the Pet read on stolidly , turning over the pages with leisurely enjoyment , apparently no whit disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 12]: `` What 's the matter with her all of a sudden ?
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 5]: Is she blind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 4]: Jill queried impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 26]: Jack grunted , and flashed more vigorously than ever , but the Pet might have been a hundred miles away for all the effect produced .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 16]: It was most mysterious and perplexing , not to say exasperating to the last degree .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 24]: After ten minutes ' fruitless effort , Jack went off in search of fresh victims , and Jill sorrowfully returned to her lessons .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 23]: How interested they would have been if they could have overheard a conversation which was even then taking place across the road !
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 5]: `` Dear child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 16]: cried a lady lying on a sofa at the far end of a beautifully-furnished drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 9]: `` Dear child , what are you doing ?
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 18]: For the last five minutes I have been watching you pretending to read with your eyes shut .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 27]: It 's not a lesson book , and Miss Mason is not here , so what can you be thinking about , dear wee goose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 14]: The fair head turned round , and the book dropped to the floor .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 30]: `` I 'm thinking , '' said a very sweet , sad little voice , `` I 'm thinking that I wish I were a large family , mother .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 10]: I 'm so tired of being only one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 6]: `` Oh , Cynthia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 23]: cried the lady -- and there was a world of mother-yearning in her voice -- `` is it that old trouble again ?
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 20]: Poor child , it is dull for you , but I do all I can for you , darling .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 28]: I stayed at home especially to be near you , and I do my best to be a companion , and to sympathise in all your interests .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 11]: Do n't tell me that I have failed altogether ! ''
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 23]: Cynthia crossed the room , knelt down on the floor by her mother 's couch and laid both hands on her knee .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 24]: The two faces that confronted each other were as much alike as was possible , given a difference in age of twenty-five years .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 26]: Cynthia was a beautiful girl , and her mother was a beautiful woman , and the beauty lay as much in expression as in feature .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 46]: Miles Trevor had been entirely mistaken when he compared the girl to a doll , for the direct glance of the eye , the sweet , firm lips and well - formed chin , belonged to no puppet , but showed unusual strength of character .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 12]: `` You are a darling , and I adore you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 4]: cried Cynthia fondly .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 16]: `` But you are old , you know , and I am so dreadfully young .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 13]: There 's something all fizzling inside me for want of a vent .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 30]: I 'm just desperate sometimes to do something wild , and exciting , and hilarious ; it does n't matter how silly it is ; the sillier the better !
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 14]: I 'm so dreadfully well-regulated , mother , considering I 'm only sixteen .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 46]: Lessons -- ` studies , ' as Miss Mason calls them -- musical exercises , constitutional , luncheon , more studies , dinner , polite conversation , performances upon the piano , that 's my daily round , and I get _ so _ tired !
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 11]: Do n't think I do n't appreciate you , mother .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 5]: You know I do .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 27]: We are the best friends in the world , but still -- '' `` I know , '' said Mrs Alliot , and sighed once more .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 28]: She stroked her daughter 's golden head in thoughtful silence , then asked curiously , `` What made you feel your loneliness especially to-day , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 11]: A flicker of laughter passed over Cynthia 's pink-and-white face .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 38]: `` The boy and girl in Number 1 , the corner house , were playing tricks on me , trying to dazzle my eyes with something -- a piece of old looking - glass , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 25]: I could not understand what caused the sudden glare until I caught a glimpse of their faces peering out from behind the curtains . ''
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 6]: `` Trying to dazzle you !
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 5]: That doctor 's children ?
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 4]: How exceedingly rude !
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 8]: They must be very badly brought up .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 14]: And you were sitting with your eyes shut pretending to go on reading .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 4]: You curious child !
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 10]: `` It was their joke ; they enjoyed it .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 10]: It would have been mean to cut it short .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 17]: Besides , '' added Cynthia , with a twinkle , `` it was my joke too !
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 46]: They must have been so puzzled when I seemed to go on reading , for they could n't see that my eyes were shut , and I went on turning over the pages at regular intervals , as if I were perfectly comfortable and happy .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 22]: Oh no , I do n't think they are rude , mother ; only frisky , and I love frisky people !
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 17]: There are such a lot of them , and they do have such a good time .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 12]: Schoolroom tea all together , and the big girl pours out .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 17]: I could see them quite well when they first came , and the afternoons were light .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 34]: They go in pairs -- a big boy and a big girl , a middling boy and a middling girl , and then a dear little girl with a face like a kitten .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 28]: I like them all so much , but -- '' and her voice died away in a plaintive cadence , `` they do n't like me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 14]: `` And how have you found that out , may I ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 14]: `` I -- I feel they do n't , '' sighed Cynthia sadly .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 20]: `` They watch me out of the windows , and talk and laugh , and make remarks among themselves .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 19]: The window seemed full of faces the other day ... '' Mrs Alliot 's delicate face flushed resentfully .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 4]: `` Abominably rude !
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 17]: Really , dear , I do n't think you need worry yourself what such people think .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 11]: There can be no possible excuse for such behaviour ! ''
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 18]: `` Oh yes , dear , there is , for they do n't intend me to see !
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 18]: It was quite extraordinary how they all vanished into space the very instant I raised my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 28]: You might just as well say it is rude of me to stare into their windows , and I do , for I ca n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 13]: It 's a sort of magnet to me every time I pass .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 12]: I do so wish I knew them , mother dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 12]: Mrs Alliot smiled and stroked her daughter 's head once more .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 41]: She was thinking that for Cynthia 's sake she must really manage to cultivate some friends with large families ; but she had not the least intention of introducing her daughter to the strange doctor 's mischievous , unconventional children .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 18]: In many cases , however , there is something stronger than the will of parents and guardians .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 12]: Some people call it fate , some by a higher name .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 22]: In later years Cynthia Alliot considered her friendship with the Trevor family as one of the greatest providences of her life .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 4]: AN OLD TRICK .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 37]: It was very dull and dreary for the remainder of the month , typical November weather , with what the Trevors called a `` pea-soup '' atmosphere , deepening now and then into a regular fog .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 44]: The Square gardens were soaking with moisture , the surrounding houses looked greyer and gloomier than ever , until it seemed impossible to believe that the sky had ever been blue , or that gay-coloured spring flowers had flourished in those black-looking beds .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 12]: Jack and Jill had the bad taste to approve of fogs .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 9]: They were `` ripping , '' they declared .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 6]: `` So adventurous and jolly !
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 18]: Yesterday , when I was walking to school , a hansom drove on the pavement beside me .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 5]: Think of that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 8]: cried Jill in a tone of triumph .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 20]: `` The horse 's nose nearly touched my shoulder , and an old lady near me shrieked like anything .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 7]: It _ was _ sport ! ''
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 18]: Jack was rather envious of the hansom episode , but had had his own share of amusement .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 23]: `` I followed Johnston all the way home , and chaffed him with a pebble in my mouth to disguise my voice .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 34]: He was nearly mad with rage , and whenever he turned round I simply bent double , and he went for another fellow , and there was no end of a game . ''
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 19]: `` But how did it happen that you could see him when he could n't see you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 55]: queried Jill , when Jack was forced to admit that he _ had _ made mistakes more than once ; but it only added to the sport to see the consternation of innocent pedestrians when an accusing voice suddenly hissed in their ears , `` Who sneaked the indiarubber from Smith 's desk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 65]: The twins were happily constituted to enjoy all things , and from their conversation it would have appeared that to be hopelessly lost in a fog would be the climax of earthly joy ; but Betty hated the gloom of the long days , when the gas burned steadily from breakfast to bedtime , and was nervous about trusting herself alone in the streets .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 37]: In her leisure moments she devoted herself to the preparation of Christmas presents , and turned over the contents of her scrap-drawers , debating how to make a dozen handsome articles with the least possible expenditure .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 24]: It is to be feared that Betty 's gifts were arranged more to suit her own convenience than the tastes of the recipients .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 11]: `` This will make a book - cover for Jill .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 30]: I do n't suppose she 'll ever use it , but it 's not big enough for anything else , so she 'll just have to like it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 17]: This was the spirit in which she assorted her materials , and set to work thereon .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 50]: Not the ideal attitude by any means , but one must make allowances for a girl with a small allowance and a large family connection , and must also enter it to the credit of this particular damsel that she grudged no work which could beautify the simple background .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 3]: Poor Betty !
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 45]: For two whole gloomy afternoons did she work at a spray of roses on a linen work-bag , and on the third day a feeble gleam of sunlight showed itself , and lo , the roses were a harlequin study in pinks and orange !
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 7]: `` Is it at all trying ?
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 15]: Is it enough to make you pitch the whole thing into the fire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 38]: she demanded dramatically of the chairs and tables , as the horrible discovery burst upon her , and she proceeded to snap at the silk with her sharp little scissors , and viciously tear away the stitches .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 11]: `` Sha n't bother to fill them in any more !
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 24]: They 'll just have to do in outline , and if she does n't like it she can do the other thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 32]: she grunted under her breath ; but that was only the impulse of the moment , and when it came to action each stitch was put in as carefully as before .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 13]: `` What are you sewing away at those old things for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 18]: Jill demanded , coming into the room and seating herself easily on the edge of the table .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 11]: `` It 's much easier to buy match-boxes and needle-books .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 20]: You can get beauties for sixpence three-farthings at the Christmas bazaars , and it saves no end of fag .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 25]: You can give me safety-pins if you like , for my clothes are all coming to pieces , and my pins disappear like smoke .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 7]: Mary eats them , I believe !
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 9]: What are you going to give mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 5]: `` Ca n't think !
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 31]: She wants a palm for the drawing-room , but a nice one costs half a guinea , and I could n't possibly scrape together more than three and six . ''
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 10]: Jill pondered , swinging her feet to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 23]: `` Five more Saturdays at fourpence each , -- one and eight-pence , and I 've got about two shillings in hand .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 8]: I could n't possibly offer to join .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 42]: I wish we could have managed it , for the drawing-room does n't look half furnished , and a big palm would have made a fine effect , but we ca n't , so there 's an end of that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 36]: A gasp of suppressed nervousness sounded from the end of the room , and Pam 's voice said with the usual funny little squeak , `` I 've got sixpence with a hole in it .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 6]: I 'll join , Betty !
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 6]: Do get mother a palm !
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 6]: She wants it so badly .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 22]: We saw one in a shop window yesterday , and she said it was just the thing for our room ! ''
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 12]: `` Sorry , Pam , but it ca n't be done .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 25]: They are a frightful price in the shops , and even old ` All a-growing all a-blowing ' has none under seven and six .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 30]: Perhaps when her birthday comes round we can manage it , but at Christmas there are so many presents to buy that one ca n't afford big things . ''
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 26]: `` I want to get it now , '' squeaked Pam obstinately , while Jill jumped down from the table and turned to the door .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 6]: `` I 'm going out !
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 8]: Ca n't afford to waste holiday afternoons .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 14]: Why do n't you put away that stupid work and come too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 6]: `` Where are you going ?
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 4]: A walk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 4]: `` Rather not !
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 11]: Am I a Pampered Pet to promenade up and down ?
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 13]: Jack and I are going to have some fun in the Square .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 21]: I 'm not going to tell you what it is , but you can come too if you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 11]: Betty raised her head and peered out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 21]: Black railings , black trees , sodden grass , paths strewn with decaying leaves , a fast - failing light .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 13]: She gave a shudder of distaste and sank back in her chair .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 3]: `` Thanks !
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 5]: I prefer the fire .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 22]: I ca n't understand you , Jill , going in for an exam , and wasting every spare moment you get !
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 22]: When I went in , I stewed every Saturday afternoon the whole term , and never dreamed of going out . ''
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 11]: `` Yes , and got plucked for your pains ! ''
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 4]: retorted Jill brutally .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 3]: Poor Betty !
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 22]: She had passed so well in everything but that fatal arithmetic , which made all the difference between success and failure .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 22]: The figures would not add up , the lines danced before her eyes , she could not remember the simplest table .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 10]: It was cruel to rake up that old sore .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 24]: She pressed her lips together and sat in offended dignity , while Jill skipped to the door , tossing her pretty pert head .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 25]: `` I shall take care of my health and my nerves , and not have them breaking down just when I need them most .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 28]: If the worst comes to the worst , I shall be no worse off than you were yourself , and I shall have had my fun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 43]: She ran downstairs into the hall , where Jack was awaiting her with a brown-paper parcel tucked under his arm , and together they crossed the road to the nearest gate , and let themselves into the garden with a heavy key .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 29]: `` The other corner is the best , '' Jack cried , leading the way forward at an eager pace , `` more traffic , and thicker bushes .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 7]: I spotted the exact place yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 12]: Have you got the reel in your pocket all right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 5]: `` Yes , yes !
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 10]: And you must give me my turn , Jack .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 23]: It 's only fair , because you would n't let me have a parcel of my own on the other side . ''
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 5]: `` Of course not !
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 20]: You would n't expect to find two lost parcels within a few yards of each other , would you ?
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 10]: You want to give the whole show away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 7]: cried Jack in indignant schoolboy fashion .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 18]: `` Now do n't talk so much , but creep between these bushes when nobody is passing .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 20]: There 's room for us both , and I can get a pull at the string between these branches .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 14]: We 'll have a rehearsal now , and see how it works . ''
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 49]: He crawled forward on the dank earth , in easy unconcern for the knees of his trousers , dropped the daintily-wrapped parcel on to the centre of the pavement , and crept back to his place , holding in his hand the end of a long black thread .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 58]: They crouched together behind the bushes , as mischievous a Jack and Jill as have been known since the world began , giggling with anticipated glee , nudging each other violently at the sound of approaching footsteps , and peering eagerly through their loopholes to see what manner of prey was about to fall into their hands .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 23]: First , a fine lady walking gingerly along , both hands occupied in keeping her skirt from contact with the greasy pavement .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 16]: She looked at the parcel with blank indifference , and passed quietly on her way .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 6]: The twins gasped with stupefaction .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 5]: Could such things be ?
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 41]: Was it possible that a human creature could be so surfeited with the good things of this world , that she could behold an unopened parcel lying on the ground , and feel no curiosity to discover what was inside ?
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 8]: Imagination refused to picture such a position !
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 4]: `` Mad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 6]: was Jack 's scornful explanation .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 7]: `` Mad as a March hare !
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 10]: Ought to be shut up out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 7]: Walked straight over the string too .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 10]: Hope to goodness she has n't broken it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 26]: A flick to the end of the string proved that this fear was unfounded , and the twins composed themselves for another period of waiting .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 46]: Pedestrians seemed to prefer the pavement by the houses instead of that darker one overshadowed by the trees of the gardens , and several moments elapsed before a brisk footstep announced the approach of a tall , well set-up man clad in a light overcoat .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 21]: His eye lit on the parcel , he bent his head and stretched out a hand to raise it up .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 25]: Instantly Jack gave a flick to the string , to which the parcel responded by jumping an inch or two farther along the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 23]: The brown-coated man straightened himself , gave a funny little grunt , half amused , half-angry , and strode on his way .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 7]: He had been a boy himself !
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 34]: The next victim was an old woman carrying a pile of parcels , and breathing heavily from fatigue , but although over-laden , she was evidently nothing loath to add to her burden .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 26]: The twins could hear her surprised exclamation , and see the hitch of the shoulders with which she freed her right arm for the attack .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 36]: Down she bent , panting louder than before , until , even as her envious fingers approached the prize , it leapt into the air , and as by some magic process disappeared from sight .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 17]: Jack was bursting with pride at his own adroitness , and Jill nudged in enthusiastic approval .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 23]: This came of fishing by the river-banks in the last summer holidays , and gaining dexterity in the art of casting lines !
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 11]: It was wonderful how useful such accomplishments were at times .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 48]: The bewildered face of the disappointed treasure-seeker was almost too much for the conspirators , and had she not been too much engrossed in her own thoughts she must certainly have heard the splutterings which not even the handkerchief stuffed between Jill 's lips could entirely drown .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 24]: With a sigh she went on her way , wondering if eyesight were about to fail , as the culmination of her troubles .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 11]: After this came an errand-boy , whistling as he walked .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 20]: He made a pounce at the parcel , and when it disappeared had no difficulty in understanding the phenomenon .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 10]: `` Ho , you would , would you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 31]: he cried , and picking up a handful of stones , sent them flying in among the bushes with such force that the twins congratulated themselves on escaping without injury .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 27]: They learnt a lesson from this experience , and henceforth made a rule of allowing all boys to pass by when they practised this particular pastime .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 26]: By this time Jill was shivering in her shabby coat , and beginning to cast longing glances across the Square to the lighted schoolroom window .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 32]: Anticipations of tea and hot buttered toast -- the Saturday afternoon treat of years ' standing -- made her present position seem unattractive , and she proposed an immediate adjournment home .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 12]: Jack , however , was not yet satisfied with his achievements .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 17]: `` We have n't had what I call a real proper rise out of anyone yet .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 27]: Just once more , and then we 'll run for it , '' he protested , and Jill shivered , and yielded to his superior will .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 7]: She had not long to wait .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 53]: In less than five minutes a slow , measured tread was heard in the distance , and presently an elderly gentleman hove in sight , portly , well-dressed , and walking with a certain stiffness and deliberation which would have secured for him the sympathetic consideration of people of his own age .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 34]: Jack and Jill , however , had no thought for such uninteresting subjects as rheumatism ; they nudged each other delightedly , and waited in breathless silence to see what would happen next .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 41]: Tramp , tramp , tramp came the slow approach , and then a sudden halt -- the halt they knew so well -- followed by something like a stifled groan as the victim stiffly bent forward to examine the treasure-trove .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 19]: His gloved hand had nearly closed on the parcel when Jack adroitly flicked it a few inches away .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 49]: He bent still farther , with another gasping effort , and then , even as the parcel again moved onward , there came a loud , startled cry , and the horrified twins beheld their victim fall forward on his face , and lie helpless on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIX .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 6]: WHAT CAME OF THE TRICK .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 28]: A moment Jack and Jill stared at each other in horrified silence , then the same words burst from both lips -- `` We must help him !
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 9]: We must see if he is hurt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 24]: Out from behind the bushes they flew , raced for the nearest gate , and ran panting to the scene of the accident .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 46]: The rays from the lamp near at hand lighted up the pavement , and showed the old gentleman already dragging himself to his feet , assisted by a lady whom Jill recognised in the flash of an eye as the much-admired occupant of Number 17 .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 44]: There she stood in her smart fur coat , a little red velvet toque perched on her dark locks , supporting the old gentleman by the arm , and so evidently overpowered by his weight that she was overjoyed to welcome further assistance .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 34]: No words were spoken , but quick as light Jack darted forward and pulled with all his force , while Jill placed both hands against the blue broadcloth back and vigorously pushed forward .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 34]: As a result of these united efforts , the old gentleman was hoisted to an upright position , with a celerity which appeared to startle him almost as much as the preceding fall .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 23]: He leant against the railings , puffed and panted , groaned and grumbled , while the onlookers listened with sympathy and self-reproach .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 30]: `` Injured for life -- strained in every muscle -- nervous shock -- police -- disgraceful -- much obliged -- advice at once -- no time for delay . ''
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 27]: The different phrases detached themselves from attacks of groanings and sighings , and , hearing the last words , Jack was blessed with a brilliant inspiration .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 11]: `` There 's a doctor at the corner , sir .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 12]: Would you like me to help you to the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 7]: he said in his politest manner .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 29]: It seemed as if , after all , good might arise out of evil if the accident were the means of providing his father with a new patient .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 43]: There was not much wrong with the old fellow -- anyone could see that -- but he was fidgety and nervous about himself , which , of course , would make him the more valuable from a doctor 's point of view .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 16]: Later on the boy would be obliged to confess his own responsibility in the accident .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 22]: He would feel a sneak if he did not , but the present was the time for action , not confession .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 8]: `` Doctor at the corner , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 13]: Well , well , get me to him as quickly as possible .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 2]: Shattered !
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 3]: Quite shattered !
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 9]: Must have a rest , and drive home !
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 5]: Bad day 's work !
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 6]: Never the same again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 41]: The old gentleman laid his hand on Jack 's shoulder and hobbled stiffly away , pausing just one moment to lift his hat and say courteously -- `` My best thanks to you , madam , for your assistance . ''
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 23]: Jill and the pretty lady were left standing in the middle of the pavement , staring curiously into each other 's faces .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 22]: The pretty lady was dark , and quite young , astonishingly young , like a big girl dressed in important clothes .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 20]: Her eyes were very bright and happy-looking , and her lips looked as though they were made for laughter .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 33]: Jill 's pert little face was left fully exposed by the cloth cap which was perched at the top of her curly locks ; her expression was divided between triumph and consternation .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 12]: `` Do you think he is hurt , really hurt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 4]: she asked eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 21]: `` He made a great fuss , but men generally do , and he walks nearly as well as before .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 11]: He ca n't have broken anything , can he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 5]: `` Oh no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 5]: cried the pretty lady .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 25]: `` I think you can be quite sure of that , but at such an age any shock of this kind may be serious .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 9]: He is a very heavy old man . ''
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 37]: She paused , looking at the girl with an inquiring expression , as if waiting for something which had not yet been said , and to her own astonishment Jill found herself answering the unspoken question .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 11]: `` It was our fault that he fell at all .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 4]: We did it .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 31]: We were in the Square hiding behind the bushes , and we had a parcel just the right size to hold something nice and pretty -- it was cotton-wool really !
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 6]: -- very neatly tied up .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 30]: We dropped it out through the railings and waited till people came along , and then we twitched it away by the end of a long black thread . ''
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 8]: The pretty lady 's expression changed suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 31]: Up till now she had been all interest and vivacity , almost one might have imagined of approval , but at the last word she frowned and shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 24]: Jill expected a vigorous remonstrance , but the words , when they came , were not in the least what she had expected .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 4]: `` Thread ! ''
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 6]: echoed the pretty lady shrilly .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 5]: `` But how stupid !
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 5]: Elastic is far better .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 36]: It jerks ever so much bet -- '' She stopped suddenly with a gasp of recollection , and continued in a stiff , mincing voice , `` It is very unwise to play practical jokes .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 11]: One can never tell what the consequence may be . ''
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 18]: Jill laughed gaily , being much too sharp to be put off with so transparent a pretence .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 20]: She drew a step nearer to the pretty lady , and looked up in her face with twinkling eyes .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 9]: `` Oh , it 's no use pretending !
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 7]: You were n't shocked a bit !
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 34]: I believe '' -- she gave a little gasp at the audacity of the idea , but her courage did not fail -- `` I believe you have even -- done it yourself .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 9]: However did you manage to think of elastic ?
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 7]: It 's a lovely idea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 13]: The pretty lady wrinkled her brows in a funny , apologetic fashion .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 18]: `` It does n't follow because I did a thing that it is not foolish and rash .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 11]: I am afraid I was known for my foolish tricks .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 35]: I was one of a big family -- such a lot of sisters that people used to call us ` the houseful of girls , ' and I was the most mischievous of all .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 27]: I do n't want to preach to you -- it would n't be fair , would it , when I have done far sillier things myself ?
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 22]: -- but next time you try the parcel trick , get it out of the way when old people come along .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 27]: Do n't let them run the risk of a fall , like this poor old gentleman , or even have the trouble of stooping for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 8]: Try to remember , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 22]: And , '' -- eyes and teeth flashed in an irresistible smile , -- '' _ try the elastic _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 19]: Jill 's merry trill rang out again , and the pretty lady looked at her with smiling approval .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 63]: The girl 's natural attractiveness was as conspicuous as ever , despite the disadvantageous circumstances , and it would have been a cold heart that did not warm towards her , as she stood with hands thrust deep into her pockets , fresh , wholesome , and bonnie , like a bit of summer in the midst of the grey London gloom .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 65]: The pretty lady had heard high praise of the skill of the new doctor who had come to live in the Square , and also of the personal character of himself and his wife , but at this moment it is to be feared that she felt little interested in them as individuals , but regarded them solely as the parents of their daughter .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 13]: `` It is getting rather dusk for you to be out alone .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 9]: I will walk with you to the corner .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 13]: You are one of the doctor 's daughters , are n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 18]: I have watched you and your sisters from my windows , and envied you for being together .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 8]: I do so miss my own sisters .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 8]: I have five -- think of that !
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 8]: -- and only one married besides myself .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 15]: You can think what a lively time of it we used to have ! ''
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 23]: But Jill was too busy thinking of something else to have any thought to spare for the lively times of the past .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 6]: `` Are you married ? ''
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 4]: she inquired breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 5]: `` Truly and really ?
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 6]: You look much too young .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 15]: We thought you were engaged , and had an invalid mother in the house .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 8]: I suppose he is the husband ? ''
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 42]: `` Yes , he is the husband , sure enough , and we keep no invalids nor skeletons of any sort in the cupboards , only such a lot of big , empty rooms , waiting for girls to fill them .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 5]: I do love girls .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 8]: I ca n't be happy without girls .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 41]: We have been away constantly the last few months , but now that we are settled at home I must call on your mother , and ask if she will spare you to come and have tea with me sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 7]: Would you like to come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 4]: `` Rather ! ''
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 15]: replied Jill in expressive , schoolgirl fashion , and the pretty lady laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 6]: `` That 's all right !
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 18]: We must arrange a day quite soon , and I must ask Cynthia Alliot to meet you .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 10]: She is a lonely little soul who needs livening .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 27]: There now , here we are at your door , and I am sure you are longing to see how the old gentleman is getting on .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 2]: Good-bye !
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 7]: We shall meet soon again . ''
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 31]: She waved her hand , and hurried homewards , the red toque gleaming out brightly as she passed under the lamp-post , and Jill gazed after her with adoring eyes .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 44]: Young girls often cherish a romantic affection for women older than themselves , and where could there be a more fitting object on which to lavish one 's devotion -- so young , so pretty , so friendly , so -- so understanding !
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 27]: She had not preached a bit , only just thought it would be better to leave old people alone ; and then that suggestion of elastic !
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 17]: In itself it was sufficient to establish her as a miracle of good sense and ingenuity !
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 5]: WHAT THE VICTIM SAID .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 44]: Jill entered the house to hear from the servant that the doctor had not yet returned from his rounds , that Mrs Trevor was also out , and that Miss Betty and Master Jack were looking after the old gentleman in the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 34]: Listening outside the door , she caught a sound of puffing and groaning , and , unable to resist the promptings of anxiety and curiosity , turned the handle and entered the room .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 34]: The victim was seated in the doctor 's big leather arm-chair , looking very perturbed and sorry for himself , while Jack and Betty hovered near , alternately offering suggestions for his relief .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 51]: `` If you would lie down on the sofa -- '' `` Or have a cushion to your back -- '' `` Or a cup of tea -- '' `` Or wine -- '' `` Or sal-volatile -- '' `` Shall I bathe your head with eau de Cologne ? ''
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 12]: `` Would you put up your feet on a chair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 49]: The victim had apparently been too much engrossed in his own self-pity to take any notice of the separate suggestions , but now their reiteration had an irritating effect , for with startling unexpectedness he thrust forward his big , flushed face , and shouted a loud refusal .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 9]: `` No , no , no , no !
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 9]: Do you want to kill me at once ?
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 13]: I only want rest and a chance to get my breath again .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 2]: Tea ?
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 2]: Wine ?
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 2]: Faugh !
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 17]: I hope I know better than that after the agonies I have had to go through .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 4]: Sal - volatile !
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 10]: Do you take me for an hysterical old woman ?
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 3]: Feet up ?
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 24]: Ay , young sir , I expect I shall have a longer dose of that position than I care for after this adventure !
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 31]: As if I had not had enough of it already -- five weeks on my chair in the summer , three in the spring , two months last winter . ''
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 21]: From his own account he was evidently a great sufferer , yet in appearance he was stout and healthy enough .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 18]: Jack made a swift diagnosis , and said politely -- `` Gout , I suppose , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 6]: Gout in your feet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 13]: `` And what makes you suppose anything of the kind , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 17]: I do n't carry a label to advertise my ailments that I am aware of ! ''
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 22]: cried the old gentleman , with an irascibility which convinced his audience that he was on the point of another attack .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 22]: Then suddenly he looked past his two questioners , saw Jill 's peering face , and went off at another tangent .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 4]: `` Oh ho !
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 4]: What 's this ?
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 8]: I saw you outside in the street .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 10]: What are you doing here , may I ask ?
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 14]: Come in for a treat to see the rest of the show ? ''
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 6]: `` It 's my house !
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 5]: I live here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 4]: replied Jill grandiloquently .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 9]: `` I am sorry you are not well .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 14]: Would you like us to whistle for a cab to take you home ?
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 14]: It 's always nicest to be at home when one is ill . ''
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 11]: It was all very well for Jack to frown dissent .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 35]: Jill was inclined to think that the truest wisdom lay in getting the old gentleman out of the way before her father 's return , and so escape with one scolding instead of two .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 17]: She raised her eyebrows , and mouthed the dumb question , `` Will you tell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 9]: while the victim continued his groans and lamentations .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 11]: `` Great mistake ever to leave home in these days .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 10]: Ca n't think what I am coming to next .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 33]: I merely stooped down to pick up a parcel -- simplest thing in the world ; done it a score of times before -- and over I went full on my face .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 3]: Terrible crash !
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 3]: Terrible crash !
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 12]: Paralysis now , I expect , in addition to everything else .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 4]: Just my luck !
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 8]: A wreck , sir -- a wreck !
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 12]: And I used to be the strongest man in the regiment .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 11]: Ah , well , well , that 's all over !
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 12]: I must be content to be on the shelf now . ''
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 18]: Betty turned towards the twins with a scrutinising gaze , but they had no eyes for her .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 26]: A note of real pathos had sounded in the victim 's voice as he bemoaned his lost strength , and their hearts melted before it .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 9]: Jack stepped boldly forward to make his confession .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 8]: `` It was not paralysis , sir .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 6]: It was -- the parcel !
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 24]: We 're sorry , -- I 'm sorry , but it was only a joke , and we never thought you would fall .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 5]: No one else fell .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 49]: We kept pulling it away by the string , you know , a _ few _ inches at a time , so that you did not notice , but you had really farther and farther to stretch , and it was that that made you topple over . ''
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 19]: He paused , and the old gentleman stopped groaning and stared at him with eyes of crab-like protuberance .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 18]: The crimson flush deepened on his cheeks , and his white whiskers appeared to bristle with wrath .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 7]: He was truly an awe-inspiring object .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 9]: `` It was your doing , was it ?
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 9]: You pulled away the parcel , did you ?
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 10]: I ` toppled over , ' did I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 6]: he repeated with awful deliberation .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 32]: That was the lull before the storm , and then it broke in all its fury , and roared over their heads , so that they gasped and trembled before it .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 44]: The victim went back to his earliest childhood , and thanked Providence that he at least had known how to behave himself , and desist from silly , idiotic , ridiculous , tom-fool tricks , which would disgrace a monkey on an organ .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 21]: He projected himself into the future , and prophesied ruin and destruction for a race which produced popinjays and clowns .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 71]: He announced his intention of dying that very night , so that the crime which his hearers had committed might be duly avenged , and in the same breath would have them to know that he was not the sort of man to be affected by the tricks of unmannerly cubs , and that General Terence Digby was match for a hundred such as they , gout or no gout .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 4]: Gout , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 4]: Toppled , forsooth !
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 9]: The world was coming to a pretty pass !
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 25]: Was it part of the plot , might he ask , to cajole him into the house and poison him with their sal-volatile tea ?
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 8]: This was a case for the police !
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 17]: Betty gave a little shriek of dismay , but the twins exchanged glances of subdued admiration .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 22]: They liked to hear a thing done really well , and the General 's denunciation was a triumph of its kind .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 20]: But when asked if he were not thoroughly ashamed of himself , Jack showed the courage of his opinion .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 4]: `` Sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 3]: he declared .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 12]: `` I said so before , sir , but not ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 27]: We would n't have been bribed to hurt you , and I 'll apologise as much as you like , but we were doing nothing wrong .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 7]: It was only a joke . ''
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 4]: `` Joke ! ''
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 5]: screamed the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 4]: `` Joke ! ''
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 16]: He rolled his protruding eyes towards the ceiling , and gasped and spluttered in disgust .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 9]: `` Is that what you call a joke ?
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 11]: I do n't know what this country is coming to !
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 26]: Have you nothing better to do with your time , young sir , than to prowl about the streets playing monkey tricks on innocent passers-by ?
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 15]: I am sorry for you if that is your best idea of enjoyment . ''
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 7]: `` Boys will be boys ! ''
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 10]: said Jack , in his quaint , sententious fashion .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 25]: `` We can only be young once , sir , so we might as well make the most of it while we can . ''
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 13]: `` Besides , we were n't prowling about in the street ! ''
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 29]: cried Jill , suddenly bursting into the conversation , her determination to keep silent melting away before what she was pleased to consider a slight on her dignity .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 9]: `` Mother would n't allow such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 6]: The Square is private property .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 18]: We have a key , and she knows we are perfectly safe when we are there . ''
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 11]: `` But , by Jove , other people are not !
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 13]: You manage to get into mischief though you are railed up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 21]: cried the victim , and a sort of spasm passed over his face , as of a smile violently suppressed .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 41]: He glared at Jill , from her to Betty , from Betty to Jack , and then let his glance wander round the room -- the big , handsome apartment so sparsely filled with the furniture of a smaller house .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 39]: The sideboard looked poor and insignificant in the recess designed for one twice the size ; the few pictures entirely failed to hide the marks of the places where the last tenant had hung his more generous supply .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 18]: The carpet covered only two - thirds of the floor , and was eked out by linoleum .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 37]: To the most unobservant eye it must have been evident that the owner of this house was a man whose means were so limited that the strictest economy was necessary in the management of his household .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 8]: `` Ha -- ho -- hum ! ''
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 6]: coughed the old gentleman suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 17]: `` Have you ever heard of such a thing as the Employers ' Liability Act ? ''
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 6]: The girls shook their heads .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 8]: Jack had glimmering ideas on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 16]: `` It 's a sort of -- er -- of insurance , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 31]: If a workman fellow drops a sack on your head , the other fellow has to pay up , so he pays the insurance fellow to do it for him .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 14]: That 's the sort of thing , is n't it , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 18]: `` That is the sort of thing , sir , expressed with your natural elegance of diction .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 16]: Does your father contract with an ` insurance fellow , ' may I ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 7]: `` No -- why should he ?
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 8]: He does n't employ any workmen . ''
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 18]: `` He is responsible for his children , however , who are a hundred times more dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 31]: How will he like it , do you think , when I send him in a bill for my expenses , and the loss of time caused by this accident ?
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 14]: I put a high price on my time , let me tell you .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 24]: It is of value to other people besides myself -- of value to my country , sir , I am proud to think !
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 16]: If I am laid aside by the hand of Providence , that is one matter .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 14]: It 's a very different thing when it is done of malice intent .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 16]: What should you say to a hundred pounds a week , eh , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 7]: Jill gave a squeal of dismay .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 21]: Betty set her lips tight , and tried to look composed and haughty , but she felt a trifle sick .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 38]: She could hardly bring herself to believe that such a proceeding would be legally possible , yet the old gentleman had distinctly said that such a law existed , and Jack appeared to know something about it .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 53]: Beneath his air of bravado she could see that the boy shared in her own nervousness , and a wild idea of flinging herself at the stranger 's feet and imploring his clemency was beginning to take shape in her brain , when a sound from without attracted the attention of all .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 44]: It was the click of the doctor 's key in the latch , and a moment later he entered the hall , and paused , as his custom was , to read the messages which had been pencilled for him on a slate .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 25]: Then came the rustle of Mary 's skirt , a few low-toned words , and the sound of quick steps approaching the dining-room door .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 6]: It was a thrilling moment !
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 24]: There sat the victim , scarlet-faced , glassy-eyed , scowling more fiercely than ever , as if in anticipation of the coming conflict .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 37]: There in a row stood the three young people , shivering in their respective shoes , for was it not the greatest of offences to `` worry father , '' and involve him in needless expenses ?
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 28]: `` Sorry to have been out , sir , '' cried the doctor , entering the room , and rubbing his hands in brisk , professional manner .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 12]: `` My maid tells me that you have had a fall .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 13]: I hope my young people have looked after you in my absence .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 21]: Now , would you prefer to have a talk here , or shall I assist you into my consulting-room ? ''
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 79]: The critical moment had arrived , and with it came a rapturous surprise , for even as the young people gazed , the anger faded out of the stranger 's face , the gleaming eyes softened , the lips relaxed , and , as by the waving of a magician 's wand , he was suddenly changed into a kindly , benevolent old gentleman , who would never condescend to such an indignity as a fit of temper .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 11]: `` Thank you , sir , thank you , sir !
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 11]: I fancy I am pretty nearly my own man again .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 23]: Your son very kindly brought me in , and gave me the opportunity of resting , which was really all I required .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 7]: And your daughter offered me refreshments .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 35]: I -- ah -- happened to slip , '' -- the protruding eyes met Jack 's with a flicker , which , if such a thing could be imagined , was almost a wink !
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 22]: -- `` to slip on the pavement , and a man of my weight feels these things more than a boy .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 9]: Gout , sir , gout in the feet !
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 20]: Your good son has already diagnosed my complaint , and , no doubt , you will be equally ready .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 53]: Now , if you could make up a prescription which would give me back my powers of twenty years ago -- '' Dr Trevor laughed , while Betty , Jack , and Jill mentally erected a monument , and placed the figure of the victim upon it in everlasting gratitude and affection .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 31]: `` I am afraid I can hardly do that , but if you will allow me I will give you a draught which will steady your nerves after the shock .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 7]: How did you come to fall ?
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 9]: Was the pavement slippery with the mud ? ''
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 24]: `` The London pavements , sir , '' answered the old man pompously , `` the London pavements are a disgrace to civilisation !
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 9]: Do n't tell me that I am crazy .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 13]: Do n't tell me it is the best-paved city in the world .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 15]: I 've heard that statement before , and I stick to my own opinion .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 18]: My opinion , I trust , sir , is worth as much as any other man 's .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 11]: It is a wonder there are not many more accidents .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 32]: I fell , sir , I would have you know , in consequence of my own selfish and avaricious instincts , and I attach no blame to anyone but myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 5]: exclaimed the doctor significantly .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 19]: He glanced towards his son , caught his air of embarrassment , and hesitated between amusement and indignation .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 11]: `` Jack -- at your old parcel trick again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 15]: `` Boys will be boys , sir , as I have just been reminded .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 16]: Perhaps we can remember the day when we also -- But what about that draught ?
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 21]: Five minutes in your consulting-room , if you please , and then Master Jack can kindly get me a cab .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 14]: I will not trust myself in the streets again to - day . ''
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 37]: Another twinkling glance at the twins , and the old gentleman raised himself slowly from his chair , and followed the doctor from the room , leaving the three young people staring at each other breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 9]: `` This _ is _ a day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 9]: cried Jill , with a caper of delight .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 8]: `` We 've made two new friends !
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 30]: The pretty lady says she is coming to call , and we must go to tea , and then this jolly old man ... What a brick he is !
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 18]: He did n't mind scolding us himself , but he would n't let anyone else do it .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 19]: Jack , do be awfully nice when you get the cab , and offer to see him home .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 7]: Tell him how grateful we are .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 11]: Hint like anything to make him invite us there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 7]: `` Trust me for that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 3]: cried Jack .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 5]: MRS. VANBURGH 'S PLANS .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 11]: The pretty lady came to call the very next week .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 29]: Mrs Trevor and Betty were busy sewing in the upstairs workroom when the maid brought up the card , and the first sight of it brought no enlightenment .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 5]: `` Mrs Gervase Vanburgh !
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 2]: Goodness !
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 5]: What a fine name !
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 5]: Who can she be ?
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 10]: Do you know who it is , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 8]: `` Not in the least , dear .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 7]: One of the neighbours , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 8]: We will go down and see . ''
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 66]: Betty smoothed her hair before the looking-glass , and then as carefully fluffed it out , shook her skirt free from the little ends of thread which would stick to the rough blue cloth , and followed her mother to the drawing-room , for now that she was over seventeen it was Mrs Trevor 's wish that she should learn to help in social duties .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 5]: Half-way downstairs inspiration dawned .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 9]: `` I believe it 's the pretty lady !
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 7]: Jill said she was coming ! ''
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 4]: she whispered breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 38]: The pleasant expectation brought a flush into her cheeks , and an added animation into her eyes , so that it was in her most attractive guise that she entered the drawing-room in her mother 's train .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 93]: It was the pretty lady and no one else , prettier than ever in her very smartest clothes , sitting in orthodox fashion , on a stiff upright chair , card-case in hand , and discussing the weather and the advantages and disadvantages of the neighbourhood with the sedateness of an old married woman ; yet ever and anon as she glanced at Betty there was a something in her face , -- a smile , a tremble , a momentary uplifting of the eyebrow , -- which bespoke an unspoken sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 11]: `` We understand each other , you and I ! ''
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 5]: it seemed to say .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 7]: `` This is only a pretence .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 24]: The _ real _ business will begin when we are alone , but -- _ do n't I do it well _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 19]: Betty twinkled back , and was content to wait her turn , knowing that it would surely come .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 19]: Yes , Mrs Vanburgh said , she and her husband had only lately returned to their town house .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 32]: They had a little place in the country , and spent a great deal of time with an old uncle who was an invalid , and very fond of young society .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 28]: She did not care for town life , but for her husband 's sake she made the best of it for a few months in the year .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 18]: The days seemed very long when one was obliged to turn on the lights before four o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 11]: Oh yes , she was fond of reading -- sometimes !
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 10]: But one seemed to need some more active occupation .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 8]: She did a good deal of wood-carving .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 8]: Did Miss Trevor go in for wood-carving ?
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 8]: Would she care to take it up ?
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 24]: It would be so very nice to have a companion , and all the tools were lying in readiness just across the road .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 6]: `` Thank you so much .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 6]: I 'd love it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 10]: cried Betty , all pink with excitement and pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 19]: `` I take a few classes still -- music and French -- but my afternoons are mostly free .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 7]: I could come any time . ''
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 4]: `` To-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 11]: queried the pretty lady , raising her pretty eyebrows eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 3]: `` Now ?
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 27]: Come back with me and have tea , and I 'll show you my carvings , and you can decide what you will try first . ''
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 49]: It was all very irregular and unconventional , because , of course , the proper thing would have been for Mrs Vanburgh to have waited quietly until Mrs Trevor had returned her call , and even for a judicious period after that , before sending a formal invitation .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 10]: Nevertheless Mrs Trevor had not the heart to interfere .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 71]: She remembered her own youth , and the rapture which it had then afforded her to be able to do things _ at once _ ; she saw the radiance in Betty 's face , and realised that her visitor was only a girl herself , so that when Betty turned towards her a flushed , appealing face , she smiled indulgently , and said , `` Certainly , dear !
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 11]: It is very kind of Mrs Vanburgh to ask you .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 9]: Run upstairs and put on your hat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 49]: Betty lost no time in taking advantage of this permission , and in ten minutes ' time the extraordinary thing came to pass , that she and the pretty lady were walking along the Square , chatting together as if they had been friends of years ' standing .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 39]: Mrs Vanburgh paused upon the threshold to give some instructions to the servant , then escorted Betty straight upstairs to a big , bare room on the third floor , which she described as her `` lair . ''
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 20]: `` No one ever sits here but myself , and I can make as much mess as I like .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 5]: It 's lovely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 24]: she explained , and forthwith turned on the electric light , and poked up the fire , for the atmosphere was distinctly chilly .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 30]: It was certainly not a tidy apartment , no one could have said that for it , but it was extremely interesting from a girl 's point of view .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 82]: The wood-carving bench occupied the place of honour before the window ; but there were evidences that the owner possessed more hobbies than one , for a piece of copper was in process of being beaten into a pattern of pomegranates and leaves , a work-table was littered with odds and ends , and on an old black tray was a weird medallion portrait of a gentleman , manufactured out of plasticine , a lump of which lay by its side .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 14]: Young Mrs Vanburgh held out the tray towards Betty with a dramatic gesture .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 6]: `` That 's my husband !
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 12]: Let me introduce you -- Mr Gervase Vanburgh -- Miss Trevor !
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 22]: Would you believe , to look at him there , that he is quite the handsomest man you ever beheld ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 11]: Betty looked at the grey profile , and sniggered helplessly .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 9]: `` I 'm afraid I never should ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 7]: `` No , it 's horrid !
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 13]: I 'm just beginning modelling , and it 's not a success .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 12]: I suppose it 's because I ca n't draw well enough .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 11]: What _ is wrong _ , do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 4]: `` Everything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 17]: Betty felt inclined to say , but politely compromised by pointing out the most flagrant offences .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 11]: `` The ear is on a level with the mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 23]: The eye is perched upon a mound , instead of being in a hollow ; he has no nostril , and oh !
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 5]: Water on the brain !
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 12]: He must have , with all that bump in front ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 3]: `` Goodness !
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 4]: What a critic !
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 11]: You might be one of my very own sisters ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 6]: cried Mrs Vanburgh , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 7]: She looked at the profile scrutinisingly .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 12]: `` There 's one comfort -- it can soon be altered .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 9]: I 'll take a bit off his head .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 10]: It 's the neatest shape in the world really .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 12]: I do n't think I am born to be a sculptor .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 15]: For one thing , I should never have the patience to clean my nails .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 20]: This plasticine gets into all the nooks and crannies , and simply _ wo n't _ come out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 9]: Betty had no sympathy to spare for nails .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 10]: She was too much occupied in considering another problem .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 43]: Mrs Vanburgh looked almost as young as herself , and was far more spontaneous and lively in manner ; it seemed impossible to imagine her the mistress of this stately house , and the wife of the handsomest man in the world !
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 33]: There was all the natural awe of the unmarried for the married girl in her voice as she said -- `` It is so strange to hear you talk of your husband .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 8]: You do n't look a bit married .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 9]: Does n't it feel very -- queer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 5]: Mrs Vanburgh laughed happily .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 7]: `` It feels very -- nice !
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 17]: I have only one trouble in life , and that is that I am too happy .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 9]: Yes , seriously , it does trouble me !
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 23]: It 's so difficult not to grow selfish when one is always petted , and praised , and considered first of all .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 11]: I want to be of some use in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 25]: My husband says I am of use to him , and of course that 's my first duty , but it 's not enough .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 35]: When I was married a dear old lady wrote me a letter , and said that marriage often became ` the selfishness of two , ' and I do feel that it is true .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 45]: It 's no credit to be good to someone who is dearer than yourself , and giving a few subscriptions is no credit either when you are rich ; it was a very different matter when you scraped them out of your dress allowance .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 31]: I 've thought over heaps of things that I could do , and at last I 've decided -- sit down , and I 'll tell you all about it !
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 6]: This is the comfiest chair .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 15]: It 's so nice getting to know you first , because you can help .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 22]: Ages ago I read a story by Sir Walter Besant , _ Katherine Regina _ was the name , I think .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 52]: I forget what it was about , and all about it , except that one character was a poor governess living in a dreary London ` Home , ' knowing nobody , and having absolutely nowhere to go in her leisure hours , because of course she could not afford entertainments .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 65]: One day she had a desperately miserable fit , and said to one of her companions -- I always remembered those words -- ` Is there no woman in all the length and breadth of this great city who has a thought for us , or who cares enough for us to open the house to us for a few hours a week ? '
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 33]: I made up my mind then and there , that if I ever lived in a city and had a home of my own , I would share it with homeless people .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 41]: I asked my husband if I might have an ` At Home ' every Saturday afternoon , and he said I could ask everyone I liked , so long as I did not expect him to put in an appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 3]: So ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 71]: -- she clasped her hands excitedly , and her eyes flashed -- `` this very week I drove round to three separate Governesses ' Homes and left cards of invitation -- ` Mrs Gervase Vanburgh will be at home every Saturday afternoon between November 12 and December 20 from three to seven o'clock , and will be pleased to see any ladies who may care to call upon her . '
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 11]: What do you think of that for a start ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 5]: Betty stared in amazement .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 3]: `` Governesses !
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 3]: Three Homes !
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 4]: Three to seven !
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 5]: How _ dreadful _ !
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 8]: What will you do with them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 6]: I 've lots of plans .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 64]: I 'll have a scrumptious light , cakey tea in the drawing-room , and in the dining-room a sort of cold high-tea as they have in the North , with chickens , and ham , and potted shrimps , and sandwiches , and all sorts of good things for those who can stay until six , and sit down to a regular meal .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 42]: And I 'll have nice books and magazines in the library , and easy-chairs drawn up to the fire ; and up here , anyone who likes can practise wood-carving , or copper beating , or any of my little hobbies .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 24]: I 'll throw open the whole house , and let each one do what she likes best ; and you shall help me !
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 23]: I 've got another girl coming on Saturday , and between the three of us we ought to be able to manage .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 15]: I do n't ask you to come , you see , -- I command !
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 6]: I need your help . ''
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 7]: Betty hesitated between pride and dismay .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 12]: `` I ca n't imagine myself entertaining a party of govies !
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 9]: I am still under their thrall , remember .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 11]: You are emancipated , so it 's different for you .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 11]: But I 'll come , of course I 'll come .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 8]: How many visitors do you expect ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 18]: `` That 's just what cook asked , and I had n't a notion what to say .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 12]: I do n't suppose we shall have many the first time .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 27]: Only the enterprising spirits will come , but when they go back and say what a good time they have had , the numbers will increase .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 9]: Do you think perhaps -- twenty altogether ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 6]: `` Say a dozen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 11]: said Betty , and Nan 's face lengthened with disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 5]: `` Only a dozen ?
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 10]: Oh , surely there must be more than that !
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 18]: Just think ; there are three Homes , and I expect forty or fifty living in each .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 9]: I am quite sure there will be twenty .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 14]: I shall provide for twenty-five , to be on the safe side . ''
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 48]: She bent forward to poke the fire once more , and Betty 's eyes roamed to the white overmantel , which was divided into five panels , each of which contained a vignette portrait of a girl 's head , printed in a delicate shade of brown .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 41]: She had seen much the same kind of thing in furniture warehouses again and again , but in this case the pictured faces lacked the pretty prettiness which was the usual characteristic , and were unmistakably portraits of living people .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 10]: She looked at her hostess with an eager question .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 5]: `` Your sisters ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 8]: `` Yes ; is n't it lovely ?
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 13]: They clubbed together and gave it to me for a wedding present .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 22]: It feels a little bit as if they were here , to look up from my work and see their faces .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 10]: That 's the eldest -- Maud ; my Maud !
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 7]: She and I were always together .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 11]: She is married , and has a dear little girl .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 15]: That 's Lilias , the next eldest -- the beauty of the family . ''
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 11]: sighed Betty enviously , `` she _ is _ pretty .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 7]: How lovely to be like that !
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 6]: Is she married too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 4]: `` Engaged ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 4]: `` How funny !
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 14]: I should have thought she would have been married the first of all .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 13]: Did n't everyone fall in love with her at first sight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 23]: `` Yes , I think they did , but at second sight they seem to have preferred Maud and -- me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 14]: Mrs Vanburgh did not seem disposed to discuss her sister 's love affairs .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 38]: She pointed to the next portrait , that of a dark , interesting - looking girl with hair parted down the middle and smoothed plainly down , in marked contrast to her sister 's curls and pompadours .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 5]: `` That 's Elsie !
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 13]: She has views , and objects to being like the common herd .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 27]: She writes articles _ for _ papers , not _ in _ them , abusing everything that is , and praising up everything that is n't .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 16]: Gervase , my husband , says she will do very well when she learns sense .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 18]: She is a dear old raven , and I miss her croak more than you would believe .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 4]: That 's Agatha .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 6]: She 's just -- Agatha !
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 13]: A good-natured dear , always terribly in earnest about the smallest thing .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 13]: Christabel is the baby , which means the head of the family .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 14]: She is coming out next year , and means to outshine us all .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 31]: I will tell you lots of stories about the girls and the jolly times we had at home , and soon I hope you will meet some of them here .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 10]: Sisters are such comforts , are n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 31]: Betty mumbled an inarticulate something which might have been an assent or the reverse , and a servant entering with a tea-tray , the conversation turned to less personal topics .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 52]: There was never any lack of anything to say , however , for , strangers as they were , the two girls chattered away without a break until the clock struck six , at which sound Betty leapt from her seat like another Cinderella , and turned hastily towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 3]: `` Six !
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 12]: Oh , and I had Pam 's music-lesson at half-past five !
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 7]: How awful of me to forget !
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 13]: You were so interesting , and I was enjoying myself so much .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 5]: I must fly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 10]: `` It 's no use , I 'm afraid .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 8]: You ca n't put the clock back .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 10]: There 's one comfort -- Pam will forgive you !
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 14]: That 's the little one , I suppose , with the kitten face .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 9]: I must get to know her soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 20]: Mrs Vanburgh tripped downstairs by Betty 's side , and shook hands with the geniality of a lifelong friendship .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 5]: `` Remember Saturday ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 22]: `` Three o'clock punctually , and bring all your stores of small talk with you , for the first half-hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 19]: Betty ran across the darkened street and let herself into her own house , aglow with pleasurable excitement .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 24]: Life looked quite a different thing in the last few hours , wherein a friend and a vocation had alike sprung into being .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 10]: After all , it was a delightful old world !
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 16]: She would never grumble again , since at any moment such delightful surprises might arise .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 5]: The door swung open .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 19]: How cold and grey the hall appeared after the glowing richness of Mrs Vanburgh 's carpets and hangings !
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 45]: Betty made a little grimace at the linoleum , and lifting her eyes was suddenly aware of a wrathful figure confronting her from the threshold of the dining - room -- Jill , standing with arms akimbo , flushed cheeks , and flashing eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 12]: `` So you have deigned to come back , have you ?
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 19]: What business had you to go to tea with her at all , I should like to know ?
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 5]: She 's my friend !
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 5]: I knew her first !
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 11]: What right had you to go poking yourself forward ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 6]: `` I did n't poke .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 4]: She asked me !
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 8]: Mother can tell you that she did .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 8]: I 'm going again on Saturday . ''
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 10]: Jill 's wrath gave way to an overwhelming anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 4]: `` And me ?
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 3]: And me ?
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 9]: I am sure she asked me too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 7]: `` No , she did n't .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 6]: It 's a grown-up party .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 9]: She 'll ask you another time with Pam .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 9]: She said she wanted to know Pam . ''
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 17]: It was the last straw to be classed with Pam , a child of eight summers !
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 6]: Jill stuttered with mortified rage .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 3]: `` S-neak !
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 4]: Just like you !
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 19]: Mark my word , Elizabeth Trevor , _ I 'll be even with you about this _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINE .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 6]: A VISIT TO THE VICTIM .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 57]: During the next week Betty 's thoughts were continually winging across the Square to her new friend , Mrs Vanburgh , though her own time was so fully occupied , that , with the exception of a sudden encounter in the street , they did not see anything of each other until the great Saturday arrived .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 45]: Meantime it rankled in Jill 's mind that she had been unfairly treated , and , in consequence , she was constantly endeavouring to hit on some scheme which would at once vindicate her own importance and put Betty 's adventure in the shade .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 37]: General Digby , as a new and striking personality in her small circle of acquaintances , naturally suggested himself as a fitting object for the enterprise , and she lost no time in consulting her ally .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 25]: `` I say , Jack , when you saw the ` Victim ' home the other night , did you notice the address ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 10]: `` What do you take me for , silly ?
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 8]: I have eyes , have n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 7]: Of course I noticed it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 14]: `` You may have eyes , but you certainly have n't a memory .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 10]: Do you happen to remember where it was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 27]: `` No , I do n't , but I wrote it down in my pocket-book , so I could soon find out if I wanted to .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 15]: `` Because I think we ought to call and ask how he is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 13]: `` Father says he 's all right except for his gout . ''
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 12]: `` I know -- but it would be polite to call .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 12]: Mother always does , even when she knows they are better .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 14]: And as we were the -- er -- what do you call it ?
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 11]: -- cause of the accident -- '' `` Innocent ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 8]: `` No , that 's not it !
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 13]: A much finer word -- un -- un -- _ unwitting _ !
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 17]: -- that 's it , so it 's all the more proper that we should inquire .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 6]: How far off is it ?
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 12]: Could we meet and go together after school this afternoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 22]: `` It 's near enough , as far as that goes -- one of those swagger flats in Prince 's Square .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 8]: I suppose we could manage all right .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 8]: Will you tell mother about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 7]: `` Not till we get back .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 31]: I am sure she would think it very nice and kind of us , but she 'd want me to put on best things , and worry about my hair .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 9]: I wish I 'd been born a savage !
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 10]: I do so loathe being bothered about clothes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 4]: `` Never mind .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 26]: No one would think to look at you that you ever bothered about them at all , '' quoth Jack , with somewhat unflattering sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 14]: `` I 'll wait for you at the corner of Prince 's Square .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 16]: I 'm not going to meet all those sniggering girls if I know it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 32]: So it was arranged , and Jill swelled with importance for the rest of the day , longing for four o'clock to arrive , and set her free from her duties .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 23]: Pam went to the door with her sister after lunch , and stood shivering upon the top step while they exchanged farewells .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 31]: She herself attended only the morning school , and was apt to find the afternoons rather lonely when the twins were out , and Betty was absorbed in her studies .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 9]: `` Come back quickly , '' she pleaded .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 12]: `` Do come back quickly , and ` muse me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 7]: and Jill nodded a bright assent .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 12]: `` I 'll amuse you finely -- when I come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 26]: She pranced off , tossing back her hair , and swinging her satchel to and fro , while Pam looked after her with admiring envy .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 26]: How lovely to be old like that -- quite old -- old enough to do your own hair , and walk to school by yourself !
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 24]: Pam heaved another sigh , and glanced wistfully up and down the Square -- the look of a captive who longs to escape .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 8]: A policeman was strolling along his beat .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 19]: Emily and Hannah were taking their places in the old-fashioned barouche preparatory to starting on their afternoon amble .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 30]: Just across the road old `` All a-growing all a - blowing '' was standing by his barrow , loudly urging a passer-by to purchase one of his plants .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 29]: Pam looked longingly at the branching palms as his guttural accents came to her ear -- `` Buy a palm , lidy , wo n't you , lidy ?
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 14]: Very cheap -- cheaper than you could buy 'em anywhere in the City .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 31]: If you 've got such a thing as an old dress or a pair of trousers , of the master 's , I 'd allow you ` ansome for them .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 8]: I 'd rather have clothes nor money .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 38]: I 'm a married man , lidy , with a fam ` ly of children -- '' `` Pam , Pam , '' cried Mrs Trevor 's voice , `` do n't stand out there , darling .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 6]: It 's far too cold .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 7]: Come in here to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 24]: Pam obediently shut the door , and settled down to the afternoon duties of plain sewing and practice , which her soul abhorred .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 19]: It was characteristic of her that she never rebelled against authority , nor expressed her distaste in words .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 34]: A meek , uncomplaining little martyr , she sat perched on the piano-stool , wrestling with the `` Blue Bells of Scotland , '' the while the wildest rebellion surged within her soul .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 9]: `` I wish pianos had never been born !
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 9]: I wish I 'd been made a boy .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 17]: When I 'm a lidy , '' -LRB- unconscious intonation of `` All a-blowing ! '' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 26]: `` I 'll have no pianos in the house , nor no needles , and my little girls shall ` muse themselves however they like .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 23]: The -- Blue -- Bells -- of -- Scot -- land ... It does n't go a bit nice in the bass !
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 18]: Do n't believe I shall ever get it right if I live a hundred thousand years ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 35]: The moment school was over Jill made a rush for the dressing-room , scrambled into her outdoor clothes , and hurried to the appointed meeting-place , where Jack found her a few minutes later .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 37]: It was already dusk , and they set off at a brisk trot towards the mansions in which General Digby 's flat was situated , in great hopes of finding that gentleman at home and disengaged .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 11]: `` It 's too damp for him to be out .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 21]: Gout 's a kind of rheumatism , and that always has to be kept dry , '' Jill declared learnedly .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 19]: `` He 's sure to be in , but I 've got a card , just in case .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 30]: It 's a correspondence one cut down , and I 've printed our names on it , and ` Kind inquiries ' in the corner , like mother puts .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 4]: It 's fine !
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 25]: When I cough it will mean that I do n't know what to say next , so you must go on while I think .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 23]: If he asks us to stay to tea , we must say we ca n't , until he begs us again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 14]: `` But suppose he did n't -- that would be a pretty sell !
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 13]: I sha n't do anything so silly , '' said cautious Jack .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 8]: `` I 'll accept at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 5]: `` Well -- perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 9]: But it 's politer to make a fuss .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 14]: Is it a man who opens the door , or a woman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 12]: `` A man -- looks like an old soldier himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 13]: `` What 's the proper way to tell him our names ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 10]: `` Jack and Mary Trevor , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 5]: `` It is n't !
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 13]: Miss Mary Trevor and Master Jack Trevor , if you please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 10]: `` If you 're miss , I 'm mister .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 19]: I 'm not going to be called ` master , ' as if I were a kid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 11]: `` All right , then -- Miss and Mr Trevor .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 20]: I 'll speak , because I 'm the lady , and give him the card to carry up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 57]: Jack was not at all anxious to take the lead , so he assented by means of the usual grunt , and when the door of the flat was reached , and the man - servant appeared in response to a furious onslaught on the electric bell , he stood by silently while Jill conducted operations .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 11]: `` Does a gentleman called General Digby live here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 7]: `` He does , madam . ''
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 9]: Jill gave a toss to her saucy head .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 18]: She had never before been addressed as `` madam , '' and the sensation was distinctly agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 10]: `` We want to see him , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 49]: The butler looked in hesitating fashion from one of the strange visitors to the other -- Jill with her elfin locks , shabby hat and thick woollen gloves ; Jack with his hands thrust deep into his pockets , his school cap at the back of his head .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 17]: `` I am not sure , madam , that the General is receiving this afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 28]: `` Then please take in my card and inquire , '' returned Jill with a burst of dignity , which surprised herself and rilled Jack with admiration .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 31]: The butler also looked distinctly impressed , though the card itself , when produced from the recesses of Jill 's pocket , had somewhat lost its first crispness and beauty .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 22]: He placed it on a silver salver and disappeared down the passage , while the twins peered curiously through the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 36]: Old guns , swords , and curious-looking Eastern weapons hung against the wall ; stags ' heads peered over the different doorways ; a great glass - case of stuffed birds stood on a table .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 4]: `` Hidjus ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 3]: thought Jill .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 4]: `` Ripping ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 21]: thought Jack , his mind turning longingly to the exciting scenes of sport in which these trophies had been captured .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 28]: He had time to examine them pretty thoroughly before the servant returned , but when he did make his appearance he brought with him the desired answer .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 20]: The General was `` at home , '' and would be pleased to receive Miss and Mr Trevor forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 3]: CHAPTER TEN .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 5]: THE GENERAL 'S STORY .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 65]: Jill stepped forward , tossing her head , as though to imply that there had never been any doubt about her welcome , and Jack followed closely behind , while the servant led the way down two long passages running at right angles to each other , and threw open a door at the end , announcing the visitors ' names in stentorian tones .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 30]: A strong whiff of cigar smoke filled the air , and there sat the General on a crimson velvet arm-chair , which was hardly redder than his own complexion .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 28]: His protruding eyes looked as glassy as ever , and his grey locks were ruffled at the top until he bore a ludicrous likeness to a paroquet .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 19]: He held the crumpled card in his hand , and greeted his visitors with a chuckle of amusement .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 5]: `` Well , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 11]: Well , ma'am -- ` kind enquiries , ' eh ?
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 15]: Come to see how the poor old man is faring after his fall ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 5]: We wanted to know .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 22]: We thought it would be polite , as we were the un -- er -- unwitting causers of your accident . ''
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 31]: Jill brought out the right word with fine effect , whereupon the General made great play with his outstanding tufts of eyebrow , pretending to frown , and look ferocious .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 7]: `` Un -- witting , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 20]: If that is your idea of unwitting , I should like to know how you would define deliberate intent !
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 28]: I 'll forgive you this time , but let me catch you at any of your tricks again , and the fat will be in the fire !
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 6]: Sit down -- sit down .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 19]: It 's not often an old bachelor like myself has the honour of entertaining a young lady visitor .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 24]: No man has had better friends , or more of them , than Terence Digby , but there are precious few remaining nowadays .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 33]: I 've left them behind me in many a lonely grave , without a stick or stone to show the resting-place of some of the bravest fellows the world has ever known .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 12]: It 's lonely work to outlive one 's best friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 11]: `` Have you been in many wars , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 11]: asked Jack , quick to scent a story of adventure .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 42]: He dropped his hat on the floor and wriggled back in his chair , the rebellious locks of hair which his sisters christened `` Cetewayo , '' after the Zulu chief , sticking up rampantly at the back of his head .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 12]: `` Have you been in any real , proper wars ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 9]: `` I should think I have , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 45]: Many wars , and tough and serious wars at that , though a whipper-snapper like you would not know their names , and the English newspapers sandwich the news of them in a corner -- with a small headline of ` Border War . '
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 30]: It 's the Border Wars which keep the Empire together , let me tell you , sir -- the Border Wars which entail the most self-sacrificing and thankless work .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 9]: There 's no honour and glory about them .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 26]: The people you are fighting for do n't even take the trouble to find out where you are , or what the trouble is about .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 15]: Not that there ought to be any hardship about that to the true soldier .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 6]: He fights for his King !
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 7]: That is enough for him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 18]: A curious softening of expression came over the fierce old face as he spoke the last sentence .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 26]: The young people both noticed it , and dimly suspected a deeper meaning to the words , but they were in no mood for moralising .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 14]: `` I should prefer the honour and glory , '' Jill declared boldly .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 26]: `` I 'd hate to be sent to fight savages in pokey out-of-the-way places where nobody was watching and saying , ` England expects ! '
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 50]: I could be most terrifically brave , if I knew it would be in the papers in the morning , and I should be a hero when I got home ; but I 'd be scared to death up among great lonely mountains with the feeling that nobody cared .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 9]: Were you ever frightened , General Digby ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 6]: `` Soldiers are never frightened .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 21]: You are only a girl , '' interrupted Jack indignantly , but his host did not agree with his conclusions .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 16]: `` She may be a girl , but she knows what she is talking about .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 11]: She understands , because she is a girl , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 8]: Women have that faculty born in them .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 30]: Banners and flags , and bands playing patriotic airs , and the feeling that the world is watching , have an inspiring effect on the most timid of men .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 13]: Who told you that a soldier was never afraid , young sir ?
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 12]: Whoever it was did not know what he was talking about .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 25]: Yes , I have been afraid , deadly afraid , many times over , and no man dared to call Terence Digby a coward .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 78]: To camp with a handful of men among the great lonely mountains , as your sister so aptly puts it , never knowing when or how the attack may fall -- an attack of devils rather than men ; to know that if you are taken torture will be your portion , not death , -- there is nothing to dread in dying for one 's country , -- that shakes the nerves of the strongest man !
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 28]: I hear people talking about modern warfare , and saying it is the hardest trial of bravery to fight an unseen foe three or four miles away .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 4]: Well , well !
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 33]: I wonder if they have ever seen a rush of one of those warlike hill-tribes , and stood waiting to receive it as I have had to do times and again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 10]: `` Did you kill lots of men -- yourself ?
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 7]: How many have you killed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 12]: Jack inquired eagerly , but the General refused to be specific .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 7]: `` I prefer not to think .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 7]: It 's not a pleasant recollection .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 31]: When the world is a little older , let us hope we shall find some better way of settling a quarrel than seeing who can kill off the most men .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 15]: What are you going to be when you are a man , Mr Jack ?
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 7]: Going in for a profession ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 5]: Jack 's face fell .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 17]: For personal questions , especially questions referring to his studies , he had a strong distaste .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 18]: He wriggled on his chair , and mumbled between his lips -- `` Trying for a scholarship .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 8]: Half fees for the next three years .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 12]: If I get it father will send me on to Cambridge .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 20]: He wants me to be a doctor , and help him in the practice when he gets old . ''
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 5]: `` And you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 5]: Jack shrugged his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 9]: `` I 'd like to be a surgeon .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 44]: It would be fine patching people up , setting their bones , and trying things no one had dared to do before ; but I could n't stand driving round every day to look after their wretched colds , and vaccinate the babies .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 13]: I 'd like to be an army doctor best of all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 3]: `` Humph !
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 3]: Would you !
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 6]: Much you know about it .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 15]: I fancy you 'd soon be thankful to take on the babies in exchange .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 36]: Well , I 've only one piece of advice to give you , my boy : never be persuaded to take up a career into which you can not throw your whole heart and soul .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 19]: You are responsible for your life 's work , and will have to account for it some day .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 11]: Do n't make things harder by drifting into uncongenial surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 12]: You look to me like a young fellow who might drift .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 6]: Too easy-going by half ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 4]: Jack flushed uncomfortably .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 21]: He hated being criticised , especially when the criticism was true , as conscience proclaimed the present indictment to be .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 77]: There came to him every now and then moments of illumination , when , as if a flashlight was suddenly played over the future , he realised that he would soon be a man , with a man 's duties and responsibilities to himself and to others , and that these years of preparation were his training-ground for the fight , concerning the spending of which he would either rejoice or sorrow all his life long .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 68]: At such moments the blood tingled in his veins , and he felt strong to do all things , and deny himself all things , if only the goal could be reached ; but the vision soon faded , and he relapsed once more into careless , happy-go-lucky ways , caring more for a `` lark '' than for any solid gain , present or to come .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 33]: The old man stared at the boy for a moment , -- seemed as if about to add something to his denunciation , but changed his mind , and addressed Jill instead .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 6]: `` And you , missy ?
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 10]: Girls have professions nowadays as well as their brothers .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 9]: Have you any special vocation in view ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 7]: Jill shook her pretty shaggy head .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 15]: `` Oh no , I 'm just going to be a plain lady ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 14]: whereat the General threw himself back in his chair with a stentorian laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 8]: `` No , that you never will !
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 11]: That is , fortunately , out of your own hands .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 12]: You will have to make another choice , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 15]: Jill showed her white teeth in a smile , wholly unembarrassed by the compliment .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 15]: `` I mean , I shall get married as soon as I leave school .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 11]: I should hate to have to make money for myself .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 24]: I 'll marry a rich man with lots of dogs and horses , and then I can enjoy myself without any bother . ''
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 20]: The General drew his eyebrows together and stared scrutinisingly at the girlish figure seated on the high-backed oak chair .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 42]: Flowing locks , short petticoats , heavy boots , woollen gloves -- just a bit of a schoolgirl in the hobbledehoy stage in which feminine instincts seem dormant -- and the ambitions are more those of a boy than a girl .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 37]: But Jill was going to be a woman some day , and a fascinating woman into the bargain , with all the power for good or evil over the lives of others which such fascination brings .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 9]: The General shook his head in warning fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 9]: `` Do n't say that , my girl .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 10]: Never say or think a thing like that again !
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 12]: You are only a child , but you 'll grow up .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 11]: It 's wonderful how quickly you young things spring up .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 15]: You 'll be a woman before you can say , ` Jack Robinson ! '
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 29]: and there 's no worse sin a woman can commit than to look upon marriage as a mere profession , an easy way of securing board and lodging .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 23]: It 's not only ruining her own life -- it 's ten times worse -- for it ruins another into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 30]: When I was a young fellow I asked a girl to marry me -- the only girl I ever did ask -- and she would n't look at me .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 34]: She was a poor girl , and I had lots of money , but she was honest with me all the same , and I 've been grateful to her all my life .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 28]: I 've been a lonely old fellow , but it would have been a thousand times worse to have had a wife who did not love me !
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 28]: You put it out of your head , little girl , that you are going to sell yourself for all the horses and dogs in creation . ''
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 8]: `` Um -- '' said Jill vaguely .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 24]: She had scented a love -- story , and with the inherent curiosity of her sex was dying to hear more about it .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 8]: `` And what became of the girl ?
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 8]: Did she marry -- someone else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 4]: `` Which girl ?
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 6]: Oh -- I suppose so !
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 11]: I went out to India and lost sight of her .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 9]: I did not want to see her again .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 16]: I hope she settled down with a good fellow who could take care of her .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 7]: Hullo , what 's this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 23]: The man-servant had entered the room with a tray , which he proceeded to place on a table by Jill 's side .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 32]: It contained the usual paraphernalia for afternoon tea , but it appeared that the General did not as a rule indulge in this meal , hence his astonishment at its appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 11]: `` Thought the young lady would like some , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 6]: Quite right -- quite right .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 10]: You keep me up to my duties as usual !
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 12]: Johnson has been with me for the last thirty years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 6]: he explained to his guests .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 18]: `` We fought together in the East , and I should get on badly without him nowadays .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 8]: Now , my dear , help yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 14]: You are the lady of the party , so you must preside . ''
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 44]: Jill pulled off her gloves , gave a surreptitious lick to an ink-stain on the second finger of her right hand , rubbed it dry on the side of her dress , and proceeded to do the honours with equal self-possession and enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 7]: If Betty could see her now !
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 13]: A real General with a man - servant to wait upon him !
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 16]: It was a hundred times more important and exciting than Mrs Vanburgh and her governesses !
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 13]: `` Have you got any medals -- Victoria Crosses and things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 26]: she asked , with a view to adding point to her account of the interview , and the General gave a loud guffaw of amusement .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 7]: `` A selection of Victoria Crosses !
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 4]: Eh , what ?
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 32]: No , I am sorry to say I have not ; only one or two medals , such as any man might possess who has served the same number of years .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 4]: Where are they ?
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 10]: In a drawer in my bedroom , of course !
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 17]: You do n't expect me to hang them up on the wall , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 6]: `` Yes , I do .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 3]: I should !
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 10]: Where everyone would see and ask questions about them .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 13]: I 'd wear them , too , whenever I possibly could ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 22]: cried Jill , unabashed , and once more the General shook his head and exclaimed -- `` Woman , woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 7]: in a tone of tragic significance .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 40]: When the meal was over , however , he yielded to Jack 's entreaties , and escorted his visitors into the adjoining bedroom , where various warlike trophies reposed with the medals in the drawers of an old cabinet .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 22]: The boy 's interest was intense , but Jill soon wearied and turned to inspect the general furnishing of the room .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 37]: It was very bare and plain -- a narrow camp bed , a few chairs , and a dressing-table -- bare of everything but the absolute necessities of toilet , and those of the simplest description .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 29]: One saw the old soldier in every arrangement , but it was on the opposite corner of the room that Jill 's eyes rested with the greatest astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 79]: On the wall hung a picture which she did not remember having seen before , representing a group of Eastern beggars , and in the foreground the figure of Christ with a beautiful , earnest face -- a _ young _ face , not the worn and haggard representation so often seen -- talking to one whose handsome robes showed him to be a person of position , who stood with hanging head and pained , disappointed expression .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 16]: Beneath the picture stood a kneeling-chair with a pile of devotional books on the ledge .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 39]: The whole effect was that of a quiet corner or `` closet , '' as the Apostle calls it , and Jill was still staring at it with distended eyes when the General turned round and discovered her .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 13]: `` You appear to be astonished by the sight of my corner !
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 48]: he inquired , and a more observant listener might have discovered a certain tension and anxiety in his tone , but Jill noticed nothing , and answered with the brutal candour of youth -- `` I -- I did not think you were -- like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 3]: Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 14]: Because I lost my temper , and railed at you the other day .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 5]: Eh , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 35]: Jack and Jill gave a simultaneous exclamation of denial , for there had been a note of real pain and shame in the old man 's voice which was quick to reach their hearts .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 17]: In truth , they had thought no less of the General for his expression of temper .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 27]: It was only what was to be expected under the circumstances , and he had been a brick in defending them from their father 's anger .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 18]: It was difficult to explain the real reason of their surprise at the discovery of his Christianity .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 89]: One could not say , for instance , `` because your face is so red , and your eyes are so fierce , and your voice is so loud , and your manner of conversation so abrupt and startling ; because you have been a slayer of men , and have lived a life of storm and adventure , '' yet it was in truth the contrast to the pale , anaemic type which young people instinctively picture in a devotee which caused the astonishment in their minds .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 24]: They remained silent , hanging their heads , while the General continued sadly -- `` Well , well , I do n't wonder !
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 37]: That tongue of mine has dishonoured me a hundred times before now , but , bad specimen as I am , I should be a hundred times worse but for the time spent in that corner .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 8]: Have you seen that picture before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 5]: Jill shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 15]: `` No , it is not half so well-known as it deserves to be !
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 20]: ` Christ and the Young Ruler , ' who went away sorrowful ` because he had great possessions . '
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 30]: It has never entered your head , I suppose , to pray to be preserved from prosperity , or _ in _ prosperity , if you like that better ?
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 4]: Of course not !
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 28]: Precious few people ever do , yet the temptations of prosperity are fifty times more subtle , if they are less pressing , than those of poverty .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 57]: I tell you , sir , when a man is young and strong , and feels the blood coursing in his veins , and when his balance at the banker 's allows him to do pretty well as he chooses , it is precious difficult to realise that he needs any help , human or Divine .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 10]: Even now -- selfish old beggar that I am !
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 39]: -- I have no one 's convenience but my own to consider , and if I want a thing there 's no end of a fuss if I do n't get it in the twinkling of an eye .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 25]: So I keep that picture there to remind me that my money is only lent to me to use for the good of others .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 5]: Christ , the Captain !
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 9]: I am here to obey His orders ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 36]: As he spoke he lifted his hand to his brow in stiff military salute , and over the fierce old face came the same wonderful softening which the twins had noticed a few minutes before .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 52]: They were speechless with embarrassment , as young things often are when a conversation suddenly takes a serious turn ; but when they had taken their leave , with many invitations to repeat their visit , the same thought lingered in the mind of each as they made their way homeward .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 10]: `` Fancy him turning out so -- good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 4]: cried Jill wonderingly .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 7]: `` He really almost -- preached .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 7]: I _ was _ surprised ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 28]: returned Jack vaguely , for the figure of the old soldier saluting his Captain had made too deep an impression on his heart to be lightly discussed .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 7]: `` Christ , the Captain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 14]: The idea appealed to his boyish instincts , and awoke a new ambition .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 43]: Hitherto he had looked upon religion as a thing apart from his own life , the monopoly of women and clergymen , whose business it was ; now for the first time it appealed to him as a fine and manly virtue .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 20]: Sitting by his lonely fireside , General Digby reproached himself for his lack of influence on his new friends .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 32]: He would have been a happy man if he had known that by God 's grace he had that afternoon planted a seed for God in Jack Trevor 's careless heart .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 7]: `` Christ , the Captain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 30]: To the last day of the boy 's life he never forgot those words , nor the picture of the old soldier with his hand raised to the salute .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 3]: CHAPTER ELEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 5]: BETTY AND CYNTHIA MEET .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 14]: `` Jill , do you know where my green check blouse has gone ?
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 8]: I ca n't find it anywhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 6]: `` How should I know ?
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 16]: I have n't taken it -- would n't be seen in the horrid old thing !
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 9]: Why are you worrying if it has disappeared ?
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 18]: I thought you said the other day that it was too shabby to wear any more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 17]: `` So I did , but I want the buttons to put on a new blouse .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 11]: It was hanging up in my cupboard last week . ''
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 23]: `` I expect it 's there still , only you ca n't see it because it 's hidden away behind your dresses .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 9]: What is far more important is my umbrella .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 16]: Somebody has eaten it , I believe -- it 's simply _ gone _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 9]: `` You have left it at school again .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 8]: You are always losing your umbrellas . ''
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 14]: `` People steal them , I suppose , because they are so beautiful !
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 6]: Alpaca -- three and eleven !
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 16]: Mother says it 's no use giving me a silk because I 'm not careful .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 5]: That 's bad reasoning !
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 10]: I should be careful if I had a silk .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 9]: But it 's not my fault this time .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 21]: I know I brought it home , because there was an apple inside it which Norah gave me in prep .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 14]: I ate it last night , and this morning the brolley has vanished .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 28]: It 's hard lines , for I shall get a rowing if it does n't turn up , and it is n't my fault a bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 12]: `` Oh , I expect you 'll find it all right .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 42]: It 's so tiresome , because the buttons exactly match this blouse , and I want it for Saturday , '' returned Betty , too much absorbed in her own affairs to have any sympathy to spare for Jill 's loss .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 38]: All the week long she lived in the thought of Saturday , and when at long last the day arrived she could hardly wait until three o'clock , so anxious was she to be at her post .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 18]: Mrs Vanburgh came to meet her at the door of the dining-room , looking flushed and excited .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 6]: `` Come in here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 17]: `` We are beginning to set out the table , so you are just in time .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 13]: I want to have everything ready by the half - hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 11]: `` Who are ` we , ' I wonder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 54]: was Betty 's mental question as she crossed the threshold , and the next moment brought with it a shock of surprise , for , standing in the middle of the room , her hair shining like an aureola round her head , stood no less a person than the Pampered Pet herself .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 44]: A plate of cakes was held in one hand , and a plate of bread-and-butter in the other , and she stood stock still , staring at the new-comer , apparently as much surprised to recognise Betty as Betty was to recognise herself .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 16]: `` This is my friend Cynthia Alliot ; this is my friend Betty Trevor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 16]: cried Mrs Vanburgh , introducing the two girls with an easy wave of the hand .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 22]: `` She ca n't shake hands , poor dear , so you 'll have to take the will for the deed .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 7]: Where shall we put those plates ?
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 9]: There does n't seem much room left . ''
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 6]: There did not , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 17]: Betty stared in amazement at the noble feast which had been provided for the expected guests .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 19]: The dining-table was profusely decorated with flowers , which looked especially beautiful at this dull , wintry season .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 24]: Dishes of cold fowls , ham , and tongue , were flanked by every imaginable description of cakes , both small and large .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 25]: Different sorts of jam were dotted here and there among the larger dishes ; tea and coffee cups were ranged at the farther end .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 18]: It was , in fact , a North Country high-tea of the most complete and tempting description .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 11]: `` Light refreshments are to be served in the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 12]: This is for those who can stay on for several hours .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 43]: My husband is going to dine at his club , so we can keep the dear things as long as they are happy , '' said Nan with a gush , while the two girls smiled at each other with shy friendliness .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 9]: `` Now I shall get to know them !
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 25]: Now they may get to like me , and ask me to sit with them in their schoolroom , '' thought lonely Cynthia longingly .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 5]: `` The Pet herself !
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 6]: She _ is _ pretty !
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 24]: Miles would admire her more than ever ; and oh , what a blouse , and I thought mine was quite nice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 4]: sighed Betty dolorously .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 29]: Both Mrs Vanburgh and her friend were very simply attired , but with a dainty finish and elegance from which Betty 's home-made garment was very far removed .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 15]: She felt plain and dowdy beside them , and her spirits suffered in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 27]: Superior people may despise her for so doing , but they do n't understand how a girl feels , so their opinion is not worth having .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 23]: At seventeen it takes real grace to be a contented Cinderella , and poor Betty did not at all enjoy the position .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 35]: It was difficult , however , for any companions of Nan Vanburgh to be depressed for long together , so bright was she , so radiant , so brisk , friendly , and confidential .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 78]: The girls were sent flying hither and thither until all the preparations were finished , then -- `` Let 's go out into the hall , and pretend to be governesses , and walk in again , to see how the effect strikes us , '' she cried ; and out they rushed , like a trio of merry schoolgirls , drawing their faces into expressions of abnormal gravity , to march back again solemn and slow .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 5]: `` Pray be seated .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 9]: You must be exhausted after your long walk .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 8]: To what can I assist you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 40]: `` The breast of a fowl , please , and a portion of ham ; a cup of tea and a few hot muffins -- Goodness me , are you going to talk to the poor creatures like that ?
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 8]: They _ will _ be daunted ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 8]: replied Cynthia , all in a breath .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 24]: She was not at all proper , Betty was glad to see , but as full of fun as an ordinary commonplace girl .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 12]: `` What are you going to talk to them about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 24]: she demanded of her hostess , who shook her head in somewhat helpless fashion , and replied -- `` I do n't know !
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 17]: I 'm hoping for inspiration at the last moment , and eating is a grand resource !
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 45]: Ply them well with muffins till the ice is broken -- '' At this moment the conversation was interrupted by the sound of an electric bell , upon hearing which Mrs Vanburgh uttered a sharp exclamation of dismay , and rushed for the hall .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 28]: Her two assistants followed , but even they in their schoolgirl stage could not keep up with the pace at which she literally flew up the staircase .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 27]: Her feet seemed hardly to touch the ground ; she sprang up two steps at a time , crying continuously , `` Quick , quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 14]: until , just as the head of the staircase was reached , cr-r-r-ur !
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 19]: Came the sounds of ripping seams , and a long dangle of silk flounce showed underneath her skirt .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 6]: `` Just my luck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 4]: she cried disconsolately .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 14]: `` It never seems as if I could get upstairs like anyone else .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 17]: Now they 'll think I 'm an untidy wretch , and it will all be spoiled .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 9]: What 's the use of silk flounces anyway ?
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 12]: I 'll never have another -- I vow I wo n't !
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 13]: I 'll pin it up with a brooch till they 've gone .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 10]: We must be in the drawing-room ready to receive .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 12]: Cynthia , sit over there , and pretend to be reading .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 11]: Miss Trevor , you might be casually poking the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 16]: Whatever we do , we must n't alarm the poor dears by looking formal . ''
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 19]: `` I am a great deal more alarmed of the poor dears than they will be of me !
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 16]: My sister Jill pretended to swoon at the idea of a room full of governesses .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 16]: She said it was more like a nightmare than a piece of real life . ''
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 4]: `` Hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 5]: whispered Mrs Vanburgh tragically .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 5]: `` They come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 31]: for footsteps were heard ascending the staircase , and the assistants flew to their posts , while the hostess endeavoured to hum a tune in a light and jaunty manner .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 22]: Another moment and the door was thrown open to disclose -- a servant , bearing a note upon a silver salver .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 8]: It was not a governess after all !
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 15]: The two girls came forward into the room , divided between relief and disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 26]: Mrs Vanburgh tossed the note impatiently aside , and said resignedly -- `` Ah , well , it gives us all the longer to prepare !
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 21]: I 'll run into my room and mend this horrid dress , and you might arrange these books of photographs .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 15]: They are really awfully interesting , and of almost every country you can imagine .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 30]: Old Mr Vanburgh collected them on his travels , so you have only to find out which country interests your special governess most , and -- there you are !
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 9]: It will save no end of exertion ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 24]: She ran out of the room , and the two girls stood together , seized with a sudden shyness at finding themselves alone .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 35]: `` I -- I think we know each other very well by sight , '' said Cynthia , and Betty blushed and blinked , remembering the crowded schoolroom window and her own scathing criticisms .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 13]: `` Yes -- I 'm afraid we have stared a great deal .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 24]: We are so interested in our neighbours , but they are almost all old -- you were the only young one like ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 11]: We were frightfully anxious to know all about you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 7]: Cynthia gave a pathetic little sigh .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 8]: `` There 's so little to know !
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 17]: There 's just mother and me -- and father at the other end of the world .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 24]: It is n't half so exciting as having brothers and sisters , and going to school , and having good times all together .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 7]: I have envied you so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 4]: `` Me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 5]: cried Betty , aghast .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 7]: `` You envied _ me _ !
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 3]: How extraordinary !
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 10]: I 've perfectly ached with envying you sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 6]: `` Oh , why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 21]: asked Cynthia ; and as Betty looked into her wide earnest eyes she felt of a sudden shamed and silenced .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 44]: How could she acknowledge that she had envied the greater luxury , the cosy fire in the bedroom , the pink evening dress , the monopoly of attention , she who was so rich in the dear human companionship which the other lacked !
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 16]: `` There are drawbacks to a large family , you know , '' she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 11]: `` We do n't _ always _ have good times .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 30]: Sometimes we all get cross together and quarrel like cats , and then it feels as if it would be so nice and peaceful to be the only one .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 9]: You have no one to quarrel with . ''
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 5]: `` I have myself .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 10]: I quarrel fearfully with myself , '' said Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 20]: She perched herself on the arm of a high chair and stared at Betty with her grave grey eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 32]: She wore an enamel buckle on her belt , a gold bangle encircled her wrist , her shoes , her stockings , her ribbons were all in the perfection of taste .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 26]: Betty felt another twinge of envy at the sight , and wondered what in the world such a lucky person could find to quarrel about !
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 12]: In manner Cynthia was as simple and direct as Pam herself .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 23]: A Pet she might be , but there was nothing pampered or self - satisfied for the most carping critic to discover .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 14]: `` I do get so bored with myself , '' she said plaintively .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 51]: `` My mother has stayed in England on purpose to look after me and my education , and it is always a case of ` This would be good for Cynthia , ' ` That would be bad for Cynthia , ' ` What would be best for Cynthia ? '
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 18]: -- there is altogether too much Cynthia in my life , and I am sick of her .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 23]: In a big family one would have so many people to think of that there would be no room for self . ''
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 6]: `` No -- o ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 4]: said Betty doubtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 59]: Her conscience told her that despite father and mother , and Miles and Jack , and Jill and Pamela , Betty loomed very large on her own horizon , but she was ashamed to confess the fact in so many words , and it was a relief when Mrs Vanburgh came bustling back in her quick energetic fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 10]: `` I 've put in a row of safety-pins .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 13]: I could n't spare the time to sew it up just now .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 13]: It 's half-past three , and they may be arriving any moment .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 34]: I 'll talk to each one as she comes in , and artlessly find out how long she can stay , then I 'll hand her over to you to be treated accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 19]: Tea and cake if it 's a call , photographs and light conversation if it 's a visit .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 13]: Sister Anne , Sister Anne , do you see anyone coming ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 11]: Cynthia looked round from the window and shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 5]: `` Nary a governess !
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 13]: They would n't like to come exactly at the hour you mention .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 20]: Perhaps they are prowling round the Square , whiling away the time until it is polite to appear . ''
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 10]: `` Oh dear , I wish they would n't !
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 8]: I like things to happen at once !
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 32]: I get fidgety and nervous if I have to wait , '' cried Mrs Vanburgh , poking the fire with such violence that the ashes were strewn all over the grate .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 15]: `` Let 's pretend that you are the first-comers , and rehearse the conversation !
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 19]: Now then , go out of the room and come in , and I 'll welcome you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 70]: Cynthia and Betty dutifully retreated to the hall , whence came a sound of subdued giggling and whispering , lasting for several minutes , at the expiration of which the door was thrown open and `` Miss Perks '' announced in a voice shaken by laughter , whereupon Cynthia bounced into the room , transformed almost out of recognition by a few touches accomplished by Betty 's nimble fingers .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 56]: Her long mane of hair was twisted into an exaggerated `` door-knocker , '' at the top of which , with all the appearance of a very fly-away toque , was perched one of the frilled pink shades which covered the electric lights ; a piece of Eastern drapery was folded scarf-like round her shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 30]: Perk by name and Perk by nature did she appear as she minced across the room , while hostess and maid alike looked on in helpless convulsions of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 45]: No rehearsal was possible under the circumstances , though Cynthia persisted in acting her part , and sat on the edge of the sofa tossing her head , and delivering herself of staccato little sentences in reply to imaginary questions suitable to the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 5]: `` Oh , really !
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 3]: No indeed !
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 8]: Unusually cold for the time of year .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 9]: Most kind of you , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 4]: Charming opportunity ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 14]: `` You impertinent girl ; go and put back those things this minute !
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 16]: How dare you make fun of me and spoil the look of my hall ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 22]: cried Nan , wiping the tears from her eyes ; then she turned towards the clock , and her face fell .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 6]: `` Ten minutes to four !
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 6]: They ought to be coming !
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 6]: Why do n't they come ?
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 14]: -- Now then , I _ told _ you how it would be !
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 10]: There 's the bell , and everything upset ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 29]: With a bound Miss Perks was in the middle of the floor , tearing the scarf from her shoulders , and shaking her hair loose from its fastenings .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 44]: Betty jumped on a chair to put the shade back in its place , Nan threw the drapery over the easel , which being done , all three rushed to the head of the staircase , and peered curiously into the hall beneath .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 42]: Once more disappointment awaited them , for a brown-paper parcel was the nearest approach to a governess which met their gaze , and the return to the drawing-room was conducted in a much more leisurely and dignified manner than the exit .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 18]: For the first time the awful possibility of failure seemed to dawn on the hostess 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 13]: `` Suppose , '' she said blankly , `` suppose Nobody comes !
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 19]: It would be a terrible disappointment , but the worst of all would be Gervase -- my husband !
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 7]: He laughed so at the preparations .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 7]: I 've provided enough for twenty .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 13]: He would tease me to death if it were all left . ''
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 7]: `` It wo n't be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 4]: cried Betty stoutly .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 35]: `` If the worst comes to the worst , I shall be so ravenous with disappointment and nervous strain by six o'clock , that I shall be able to demolish enough for ten . ''
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 11]: `` And you ca n't say you have had nobody .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 47]: You have had Miss Perks , '' added Cynthia slyly ; but Mrs Vanburgh refused to be comforted , and wandered disconsolately up and down the room , peering out of each of the three windows in succession , and watching the clock with anxious dismay .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 9]: `` Half-past four , and not one here !
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 5]: What can it mean ?
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 33]: Three big Homes I went to , and there must have been at least a score of inmates in each ; it is n't _ possible _ that nobody will come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 29]: `` In all the length and breadth of this great city , is there not _ one _ governess who will take pity upon a hospitable lady ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 4]: quoted Cynthia mischievously .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 41]: It was evident that she also knew the source from which had sprung the inspiration of these Saturday gatherings ; but though Nan laughed , it was with a somewhat uncertain sound , and her brown eyes looked suspiciously moist .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 27]: The two girls were quick to realise that it was not a time for teasing , and hastened to give a safer turn to the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 13]: In truth , Nan 's heart was very deeply in her enterprise .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 21]: Hers was one of those sweet , generous natures which expand , instead of shrivelling under the influence of prosperity .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 56]: Just in proportion as her own life was beautiful and hedged round with all the sweet fences of love , so did she yearn more and more over her sisters whose lots were cast in such different places -- which is the true spirit of Christ , who left the very heavens for our sakes .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 56]: She had woven many happy dreams about these afternoon meetings , seeing the radiance of her own happiness lighting up dark places , and the power of love and sympathy cheering starved and lonely lives , and was it all to end like this -- in a joke for her husband and these two girls ?
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 27]: Would Gervase come home , and laugh his tender , happy laugh , and stroke her hair , and call her `` Poor little pet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 17]: as if she , and not the missing guests , was the real object of compassion ?
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 59]: Nan blinked the tears from her eyes , but they rose again and again -- tears of bitter disappointment ; and then , just as the clock was about to strike the quarter , there came another quick whirr of the electric bell , and Cynthia , running out into the hall , came back aglow with excitement .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 4]: `` It is !
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 6]: It _ is _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 7]: she hissed in an excited whisper .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 5]: `` I saw her .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 5]: She 's coming upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 2]: Quick !
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 2]: Quick !
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 5]: To your posts ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 18]: Betty rushed to the fire , Nan stood in the middle of the floor radiant with expectation .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 18]: The servant threw open the door , and announced in solemn tones -- `` Miss Beveridge . ''
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 6]: The first governess had arrived !
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWELVE .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 3]: MISS BEVERIDGE .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 23]: She was small and thin , with a bleached , joyless face , which seemed all of the same dull grey tint .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 16]: Grey hair , grey eyes , grey complexion , a pinched-in mouth and deeply-furrowed forehead .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 57]: She was dressed in black -- shabby black , which is the shabbiest of all shabbies -- and , looking at her , it seemed impossible to believe that there had ever been a time when she was young and happy , and had frisked and frolicked , and liked pretty things like any ordinary girl .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 19]: Cynthia and Betty felt a chill of dismay , but Nan 's heart gave a throb of delight .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 30]: This was one of the very starved , joyless lives which she longed to brighten ; it would have been difficult to find a better type of the class .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 14]: She walked quickly forward , and held out a warm , welcoming hand .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 6]: `` How do you do ?
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 9]: I am so pleased you have come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 46]: Miss Beveridge looked at her coldly , then cast an inquiring glance around the room ; at the luxurious hangings and furniture , at the glowing fire , at Betty slim and childish in her simple blue frock , at Cynthia with her flowing locks .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 11]: `` Is -- is Mrs Vanburgh not at home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 15]: she inquired , drawing up her thin figure with an air of wounded dignity .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 38]: `` I understood that the hours mentioned were from three to seven , but if she is engaged -- '' Nan smiled in the merry , radiant manner which made her look even younger than her years .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 7]: `` I am Mrs Vanburgh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 6]: `` Oh , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 5]: said Miss Beveridge coldly .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 44]: Why she should have taken the announcement as a personal insult the girls could not understand , but that she did receive it in such , a spirit was proved by the sudden stiffening which passed over her features even as she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 31]: She seated herself on the edge of the chair to which Nan escorted her , sternly refused an offer of tea , and vouchsafed only monosyllabic replies when spoken to .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 6]: It was a terrible occasion !
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 22]: Nan took refuge in the resort of the destitute , and exhausted the subject of the weather in all its branches .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 9]: `` It is a very chilly afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 5]: `` Very chilly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 16]: `` It seemed in the morning as if it were going to clear up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 5]: `` It did . ''
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 11]: `` The forecast says it will rain before night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 11]: `` November always _ is _ a dreary month . ''
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 3]: No reply .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 22]: `` In London there are so many fogs , but in the country the fallen leaves are almost as depressing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 5]: `` Perhaps so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 14]: Nan looked across the room and made a desperate grimace at her companions .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 42]: Before doing so she made sure that Miss Beveridge was not looking , but she forgot that in turning her head in the opposite direction she was naturally _ vis-a-vis _ with Cynthia and Betty , and they -- silly things !
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 19]: -- simultaneously jerked with surprise , flushed and struggled after speech , thereby hopelessly giving away the situation .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 18]: `` Er -- are you _ quite _ sure you will not have a cup of tea ?
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 6]: Or -- er , coffee ?
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 5]: We have both ready .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 14]: Or a high-tea downstairs , if you care for anything more solid . ''
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 9]: `` I have had luncheon , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 21]: I am not in the least in need of food , '' replied Miss Beveridge in tones of scathing coldness .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 6]: There was a ghastly silence .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 4]: `` Horrid thing !
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 6]: Always did hate 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 3]: soliloquised Betty .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 5]: `` How dare she ?
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 4]: Ungrateful wretch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 3]: queried Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 19]: `` She 's cross because she 's miserable ; she 's just as miserable as she can be !
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 11]: Somebody else could comfort her , but I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 8]: She thinks I am a presumptuous chit .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 15]: Perhaps I am , trying to do work that is far beyond me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 11]: sighed Nan , with a heavy sinking of the heart .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 46]: She could not attempt to speak , and the silence lasted several minutes , until at last Miss Beveridge roused herself to inquire hesitatingly , yet with a certain suppressed eagerness -- `` Were you perhaps wishing to -- er -- to organise some classes ?
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 8]: My time is disengaged on Saturday afternoons .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 25]: My special subject is music , but I hold very high certificates , and am of course competent to take up other subjects . ''
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 5]: Nan gasped with dismay !
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 16]: Here was a situation , to be treated as a schoolgirl whose education required finishing !
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 26]: She could hear Gervase 's derisive laughter , the amused chuckle with which he would say , `` Silly girl , serve you right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 14]: Across the room Cynthia and Betty were sniggering , and biting their lips .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 11]: This was indeed a travesty of what she had expected .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 26]: The blood flamed in her cheeks , but she answered steadily enough -- `` Oh no , I was not thinking of anything for myself .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 44]: It occurred to me that it might be dull in those ` Homes ' on holiday afternoons , especially for ladies who are strangers in London , and I hoped it might make a little change for them to come out to tea .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 13]: It would certainly be a pleasure to me to receive them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 5]: said Miss Beveridge coldly .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 31]: The momentary animation which had flickered in her face at the thought of the possibility of classes died away , leaving her looking even more bleached and hopeless than before .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 31]: She pressed her thin lips together , looked at the clock , and inquired suddenly -- `` Can you tell me the nearest way from here to Maida Vale ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 36]: It was a direct intimation of departure , and Nan accepted it as such , giving the desired information , without protest , it is true , but in a manner absolutely devoid of offence .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 36]: It was raining heavily by this time , and she would fain have offered to whistle for a hansom , but she felt that such a proceeding would have been interpreted as an additional offence .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 31]: When the visitor rose , however , she insisted upon accompanying her downstairs , where in the privacy of the vestibule she allowed herself the luxury of a farewell appeal .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 12]: `` I am so sorry that it has been a failure !
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 28]: You are vexed with me for having brought you here for nothing , and on such a terrible afternoon too , but I _ meant _ well !
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 37]: I 'm young , and foolish , and do n't know how to do things properly , but I could n't bear to keep everything to myself , and I could think of no better way .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 9]: You 'll forgive me , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 10]: I 'm so sorry you 've been bored ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 31]: Miss Beveridge looked at her swiftly , and as she looked her thin features twitched beneath her veil , and two little patches of colour showed themselves on her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 12]: `` There is nothing to forgive , '' she said hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 9]: `` Nothing on your side , at least .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 11]: I was taken by surprise and did not quite understand .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 13]: If you will allow me I will come again another time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 8]: `` Will you -- will you really ?
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 10]: Oh , it would make me so happy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 4]: cried Nan rapturously .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 6]: `` Thank you so much !
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 5]: Next Saturday , perhaps ?
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 11]: I shall look forward to it all the week . ''
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 29]: She motioned the servant aside , and , accompanying her visitor to the door , insisted upon opening her umbrella and helping to tuck up the well-worn skirt .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 22]: Her bonnie face shone out under the light as she waved her hand and cried out eagerly , `` Come soon !
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 4]: Come soon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 36]: Miss Beveridge shut her lips tightly and did not reply in words , but she did something which was more expressive -- she dropped her skirt into the mud on purpose to wave a response !
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 32]: The November evening was dark and cheerless enough to strike a chill to the stoutest heart , but one solitary woman walked through it with a new glow at her heart .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 24]: The warm light streaming out into the darkness , the sweet welcoming voice , were as meat and drink to her starved soul .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 35]: In the drawing-room the girls awaited Nan 's return with some anxiety , but , to their amazement , she came bounding upstairs two steps at a time , all abeam with complacent delight .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 15]: What a comfort it was that she had so soon returned to her senses !
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 5]: `` Has she gone ?
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 3]: Really gone !
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 5]: What a relief ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 6]: `` She 's coming again !
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 5]: She said she would .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 6]: Thank goodness for that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 12]: `` Mrs Vanburgh , you -- you ca n't mean it !
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 5]: She was a horror !
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 10]: You ca n't possibly want to see her again !
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 24]: She was as cross as two sticks because she had come once , so why should she try it a second time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 18]: `` She did n't understand , and it was a shock to find us all so young .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 8]: Yes , of course I want her !
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 20]: She 's just the sort I do want ; the happy , prosperous ones have no need of me .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 11]: Oh , did you see her poor grey face ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 4]: Betty shivered dramatically .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 4]: `` I did !
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 22]: It made me think of vinegar and , lemon-juice , and all the sour things you can think of mixed together .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 23]: Her lips were so thin you could hardly see them at all , and they turned right down at the corners . ''
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 18]: `` She was pretty once , prettier than any of us -- her features are perfect still .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 11]: She 's worried , and ill , and badly dressed .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 7]: Did you see her blouse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 4]: Betty sighed sententiously .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 9]: `` It was such a comfort to me .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 33]: I 'd been feeling so grumpy because my own was horrid compared to yours , but when I saw that grey flannel atrocity I felt I ought to be thankful instead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 4]: Nan laughed happily .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 8]: `` Then she did you good too ?
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 5]: That 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 6]: Girls , I 'm hungry .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 8]: This has been a most exhausting afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 30]: I do n't think there is a chance of anyone else coming , so had n't we better go downstairs and eat up some of the good things ourselves ?
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 6]: How do you feel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 10]: There was no doubt about the girls ' feelings .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 31]: They might have been starving , from the alacrity with which they sprang from their seats , followed their hostess downstairs , and seated themselves at the dining - table .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 10]: `` We will not wait any longer , Johnson .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 14]: Bring in fresh tea and coffee , and then you can leave us .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 39]: We will attend to ourselves , '' said Nan to the solemn-faced butler ; and , as soon as he had departed , `` Is n't it just wonderful how servants contrive to keep their faces straight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 4]: she cried laughingly .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 51]: `` I 've no doubt they are all laughing themselves ill downstairs at the collapse of my great ` At Home , ' but Johnson looks as if it were the most correct thing in the world for three people to sit down to a table laid for a dozen !
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 10]: I 'll carve , and you can pour out .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 14]: Now for the chicken and ham -- now for the gay Sally Lunn !
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 7]: Eat , my darlings , eat !
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 14]: Do without dinner for one night , and save a friend 's reputation !
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 25]: I shall never hear the last of it from Gervase , unless I can tell him that some of the things were used . ''
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 33]: It was a merry meal , and lasted for an inordinately long time , and when it was over the three girls felt that their mutual acquaintance had progressed by giant strides .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 46]: Cynthia went home to give a graphic description of Betty 's charms , and to cry -- `` You must , you really must , call upon Mrs Trevor , mother , for I ca n't be happy till I know the whole family . ''
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 47]: Betty burst into the dining-room in a flutter of excitement , exclaiming all in a breath -- `` She 's a darling , a perfect darling ; and the Pet was there , and her name is Cynthia , and she 's not pampered a bit .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 12]: We are awfully good friends ; and what do you think ?
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 17]: -- only one governess turned up , and there are heaps and heaps of cakes left .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 16]: And may Jill and Pam go to tea on Monday to eat them up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 21]: As for Nan , she laid her pretty head on her husband 's shoulder , and refused to be comforted .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 9]: `` No , it was not a failure !
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 7]: I 'm not disappointed a bit .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 27]: I was silly , and expected too much , but the one who came -- oh , Gervase , she was the very incarnation of homelessness .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 17]: If she will let me help her , I shall be quite , quite satisfied ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 3]: CHAPTER THIRTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 2]: LETTERS .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 3]: Christmas approached .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 54]: Cynthia drove from one big shop to another , accompanied by mother or governess , and selected costly remembrances for her friends , Betty Trevor among the rest , for Mrs Alliot had at last been induced to call on the doctor 's wife , and so formally sanction the girls ' friendship .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 29]: Nan Vanburgh crossed out every day as it passed on the calendar , and danced for joy at the thought of going `` home '' for the festival .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 8]: `` It 's rather rough on me .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 30]: I flattered myself that I was sufficient for your happiness , '' her husband told her , `` and -- '' `` So you are , you darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 5]: Nan assured him gushingly .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 84]: `` I do n't want anyone else in the world but just you , and father , and mother , and Jim , and the girls , and Kitty , and Ned , and your old uncle , and Maud 's baby -- and -- '' `` And Cynthia Alliot , and this newly-discovered family at Number 14 , and twenty governesses rolled into one as exemplified by Miss Beveridge , and a few score of friends scattered up and down the country !
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 15]: What it is to have married a little soul with a big heart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 46]: cried Gervase , shrugging his shoulders with an air of martyrdom , though , as a matter of fact , he was well satisfied with his place in his wife 's affection , and loved her all the more for remaining faithful to old claims .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 33]: As for Betty Trevor , she shivered up in her attic bedroom , putting in last stitches to the presents which had been manufactured at the cost of much trouble and self-denial .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 28]: The table-centre for mother had cost only one and threepence , but looked every bit as nice as those displayed in the shop-windows for six and nine .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 41]: The shield of white wadded satin seemed an ideal protector for a dress shirt , and if father did not use it as such when he went out in the evening , it would be his fault , not hers !
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 51]: The blotters for Miles and Jack , the work and shoe bags for the girls , to say nothing of endless odds and ends for cousins and aunts , made quite a brave show when she laid them all out on the bed preparatory to wrapping them up in paper .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 27]: Jill was invited to the private view , her own present being discreetly hidden away for the occasion , and expressed an admiration tempered by pity .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 6]: `` Such a fag ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 3]: she declared .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 15]: `` Look at me , I 've done the whole thing in one afternoon !
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 74]: Sallied out with my savings in my purse -- two shillings pocket-money , one and three for waking Miles in the morning , sixpence from mother -- reward of merit for not biting my nails for a week -- ninepence from Norah for my pink silk tie -LRB- it cost half-a-crown , and I hated the old thing -RRB- , four and sixpence altogether -- and I got fifteen really handsome presents . ''
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 7]: `` Jill , you have n't !
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 6]: It is n't possible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 10]: `` It is then ; it only needs management .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 36]: I 've kept all the chocolate boxes we have had given to us by grateful patients during the year -- six of them -- and they look ripping filled with sweets at sixpence a pound .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 24]: I collected mother 's old scent-bottles too , with cut-glass stoppers , and bought a shilling 's worth of eau-de-Cologne to fill them .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 4]: Such a joke !
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 23]: It did n't quite go round , so I put some water in the last , and it 's turned quite milky .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 9]: I 'll have to give that to Pam .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 9]: She 'll think it something new and superior .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 39]: I 've got sticking -- plaster for the boys -- they are sure to cut their fingers some day -- and a beautiful needle-book for mother -- ninepence halfpenny -- and it looks worth it , every penny .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 35]: Oh , I say , while I remember , I do n't mind lending you my snow-shoes , but you might take the trouble to put them back when you 've done with them !
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 8]: I wanted them badly this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 9]: `` I have n't got your old snow-shoes .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 11]: I do n't know what has come to this house .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 7]: Everyone is accusing me of stealing !
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 19]: Mother was on the rampage about her gloves this morning , and father 's old smoking-jacket is missing .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 36]: Mother says it 's a good thing , for it was disgracefully shabby , but he loved it because it was so comfy , and we had such a fuss searching all over the house .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 10]: Christmas seems to put everything out of gear . ''
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 10]: `` Oh , well , it 's worth it !
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 6]: Think of the presents ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 4]: cried Jill gleefully .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 49]: She skipped downstairs , and , sitting down before the writing-table in the drawing-room , pulled out a number of sheets of her mother 's writing - paper , on which she proceeded to indite a number of epistles , in which words and spaces were curiously mingled .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 21]: `` Dear Aunt Margaret , -- Thank you so much for the beautiful ... It is just what I wanted .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 12]: It was so nice of you to send it to me .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 29]: I think it is ... I hope you are quite well , and not having asthma any more , -- Your loving niece , -- `` Margaret . ''
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 24]: `` Darling Cousin Flo , -- I am so awfully obliged to you for the lovely ... It is just what I wanted .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 8]: I am so pleased to have it .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 16]: It will just do for ... I think Christmas is ripping , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 7]: Please write soon to Jill . ''
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 21]: `` Dear Mrs Gregory , -- It is most kind of you to remember me with such a nice present .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 8]: The ... is just what I wanted .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 10]: I am much obliged to you for remembering me .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 9]: Has not Christmas Day been ... this year ?
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 13]: -- I am your loving little friend , Margaret Meredith Trevor . ''
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 38]: `` My own dear , darling Norah , -- What an angel you are to send me that perfectly ripping ... It is just exactly what I wanted , and I am so proud to have it .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 8]: Come round to-morrow and see my things .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 6]: I 've got ... altogether .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 6]: Is n't that a lot ?
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 8]: Do n't you call this weather ... ?
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 6]: -- Your own Jill . ''
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 31]: She was scribbling away -- the table littered with the finished productions -- when a hand fell on her shoulder and a stentorian voice cried -- `` Eh , what ?
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 11]: Too busy to hear me come in , were you ?
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 10]: What 's the meaning of this sudden industry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 21]: and , starting up , she beheld the red , parrot - like visage of General Digby bending over her .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 23]: This was not by any means the first visit which the General had paid in return for the `` kind enquiries . ''
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 29]: He was a lonely old man , and to spend a few minutes in the cheery atmosphere of a family made a pleasant break in his daily constitutional .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 38]: Mrs Trevor was always pleased to welcome him , but as she was aware that it was not herself but the children who were the attraction , she did not hurry downstairs on occasions like the present .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 8]: `` Writing Christmas letters , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 5]: boomed the General loudly .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 9]: `` Sending off your presents , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 4]: Eh , what ?
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 11]: _ Thanking _ people for presents , do you say ?
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 10]: That 's a bit previous , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 6]: What 's the hurry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 33]: `` Oh , there 's always so much going on after Christmas , when the boys are at home , and it 's such a bore sticking in the house writing letters .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 31]: I use up the odd times before , in getting them as ready as I can , and then it only takes a minute to fill in the spaces . ''
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 42]: She held out a specimen letter as she spoke , and , looking at it , General Digby went off into such a convulsion of laughter , coughing , and panting for breath , that he presented a truly alarming spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 29]: The protuberant eyes protruded farther and farther , the tuft of grey hair seemed to rear itself more stiffly erect , his cheeks changed from red to purple .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 37]: It was not a time for ceremony , and Jill promptly pounded him on the back until he recovered himself sufficiently to shake her off , declaring forcibly that the cure was worse than the disease .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 17]: Then he subsided into a chair , and wiped his eyes elaborately with a bandana handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 7]: `` Where 's my letter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 14]: `` I suppose there 's one addressed to me among all that number .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 14]: Was I as fortunate as the rest in sending just what was wanted ?
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 16]: You are a young woman of a great many wants , it seems to me .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 11]: Tell you what now : I 'll strike a bargain !
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 17]: Fill up the blanks , and I 'll see if I can come up to expectation !
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 5]: Eh , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 5]: `` Oh no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 36]: cried Jill , blushing with an embarrassment which yet had in it a fearful joy , for who would have thought that such a new friend would enrol himself in the blessed ranks of present-givers ?
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 8]: `` There is no letter for you .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 15]: I truly never thought you would give us anything , '' she explained hesitatingly .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 8]: `` I could n't possibly choose myself .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 33]: It 's awfully good of you to think of it , but , really , anything -- It 's like this , you see ; I want everything I can get ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 10]: `` Oh , you do , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 17]: cried the General , beginning to shake again in the old , alarming , jelly-like fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 11]: `` Nothing like honesty in this world , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 12]: Well , well , we must see what we can do !
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 21]: I 'll bend my great mind to the question , and you shall know the result on Christmas Day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 4]: Jill smiled uncertainly .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 9]: Already she was beginning to repent her modesty .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 48]: Suppose she had taken her courage into her hands , and had said boldly , `` A gold watch , '' could it possibly have been true that the ambition of a lifetime would have been gratified , as by the stroke of a magician 's wand ?
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 45]: Really and truly the General had tumbled -LRB- literally tumbled -RRB- into their lives in the most unexpected fashion , and to begin talking of presents upon an acquaintance of a month 's standing proved him to be something far superior to ordinary mortals .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 20]: Jill made up her mind to change the nickname of Victim for that of Magician from this time forward .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 56]: Presently Betty appeared , a pensive , melancholy Betty , chilly about the fingers , and nippy about the nose , much oppressed by the feeling that she worked while others played , and had no thanks for her pains , and was altogether too good for a world in which her excellencies were unappreciated .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 36]: As usual , her hair was dressed in accordance with her mood , a brush dipped in water having been employed to flatten out the curls which had been painfully achieved a few hours before .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 13]: The General looked at the dismal little figure with a twinkling eye .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 29]: Already he had been introduced to three separate Betty Trevors , and it would be interesting to ascertain which of the various representations approached nearest to the reality .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 34]: Judging from Miss Betty 's conversation this afternoon , Christmas would appear to be her _ bete noire _ throughout the year , and she could see no bright spot in the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 52]: The presents which she had prepared were all failures ; unlike Jill , she wanted nothing in return ; it was dull having `` no one but ourselves '' in the house on the great day , while , on the other hand , it would be horrid to have strangers .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 49]: Mrs Vanburgh had gone off home to enjoy herself , and had left the `` Govies '' in the charge of herself and Cynthia Alliot to `` cheer up and entertain , '' and how could they do it , pray , a couple of girls like themselves ?
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 46]: She scowled quite fiercely at the General as she put the question , but he only chuckled in reply , having already been treated to the history of Nan 's first ` At Home ' from the lips of an historian more sceptical than sympathetic .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 3]: `` Aha !
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 3]: Those governesses !
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 6]: How many may they be ?
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 21]: Do you still entertain the few to conversation , and yourselves to the good things provided for the many ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 31]: he cried teasingly , whereupon Betty assumed what she conceived to be an air of haughty reproach , and replied coldly -- `` We had four at our last reception .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 12]: They all want to come again , and were most agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 20]: Two of them have gone home for the holidays , but the others have no homes to go to .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 32]: They are the ones we have to entertain , and it 's silly , because they are so tired of girls that we are the last people they wish to see .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 14]: Mrs Vanburgh is different -- she 's married , and is more interesting .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 38]: Mother says she 's sorry , but there are a dozen poor ladies who have a greater claim on us -- father 's patients , and so on -- and what can I do by myself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 20]: She sighed , and raised her eyes in a meek , resigned fashion to the cornet of the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 28]: `` It 's not for want of will , or want of thought I lay awake for quite half an hour worrying about it one night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 18]: `` Send them a Christmas card , and be done with it , '' cried Jill callously .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 17]: `` You can get beauties for a halfpenny at the little sweet shop round the corner .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 9]: I 'll sell you one I bought yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 14]: Convolvulus , and ` May all your hours be filled with joy . '
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 7]: Just the thing you want ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 7]: Betty 's lip curled in disdain .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 8]: `` So appropriate , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 7]: So likely to be true ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 15]: `` All the more reason to wish for it , '' maintained Jill pertly .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 15]: `` What 's the good of wishing if you do n't wish something nice ?
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 20]: You do n't want to take for granted that she is going on mumping and grumping all next year .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 15]: Something nice might happen to her , as well as to anyone else . ''
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 7]: `` Quite right , quite right !
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 17]: Always expect the best , and prepare for the worst , '' cried the General heartily .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 10]: `` Now , I 've a suggestion to make !
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 20]: There 's a big concert advertised to take place in the Albert Hall on the afternoon of Boxing Day .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 24]: Some friends of mine who are wandering abroad have a box there which is at my disposal when I choose to use it .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 16]: I 'm not going with you , mind -- none of your governesses for me !
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 30]: -- but I 'll give you the tickets , and you can make up a happy party , and get rid of some of your responsibilities , at least .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 15]: How does that idea strike you , Miss Betty -- eh , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 9]: `` Oh , I -- I love it !
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 7]: You _ are _ sweet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 4]: gushed Betty fervently .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 3]: A box !
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 4]: The Albert Hall !
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 22]: Herself the head of the party , the gracious dispenser of favours -- it was almost too ecstatic to be believed !
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 45]: `` The two governesses , Cynthia and myself , Miles , because he loves music , and we want someone to bring us home , and father , if he has time , for Miles wo n't come if he is the only male .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 8]: That would be a delightful party ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 3]: she decided .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 15]: There were points , after all , about being left `` in charge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOURTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 3]: CHRISTMAS PRESENTS .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 23]: The Trevors ' programme on Christmas Day differed from those of their friends , and possessed in their opinion many striking advantages .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 34]: No presents were given in the morning ; it was enough excitement to know that it was Christmas Day , and to linger over a late and luxurious breakfast before going to church .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 39]: There was something particularly inspiring about the moment when the great congregation rose in the ivy - decked church and burst into song -- `` Hark , the herald angels sing , Glory to the new-born King ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 50]: Even Jill had a fleeting realisation that the true meaning of Christmas was something quite apart from presents , and turkey , and plum-puddings , while Betty 's thoughts flew back to the day of her confirmation , and she vowed herself anew to the service of the King .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 31]: Jack sang the well-known words with a new attention -- `` Christ the everlasting Lord ; '' this was the same Christ who was General Digby 's `` Captain . ''
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 34]: `` I am here to obey my Captain 's orders , '' -- the words rang in his ears , and he saw once more the wonderful softening of the fierce old face .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 44]: Miles did not sing at all ; his voice was still hoarse and broken , and his set expression gave little clue to his feelings , but Pam 's treble was clear and sweet , and her little face shone with innocent fervour .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 10]: After church came a walk through the -- well !
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 41]: It should have been `` the crisp cold air , '' but unfortunately the weather showed no sense of propriety , and in reality it was as dank and cheerless a day as even London itself can produce in mid-winter .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 43]: As the advance guard in the shape of Miles and Betty neared their own doorway , a dainty figure ran down the steps , and there was Cynthia Alliot , blooming like a delicate pink rose in the midst of the fog .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 4]: `` You ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 15]: cried Betty in surprise , and then awkwardly attempted the difficult task of introduction .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 9]: `` Er -- this is my brother Miles !
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 12]: Miles -- this is -- '' `` The Pampered Pet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 5]: interrupted Cynthia , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 29]: Miles knit his brows in the fashion he had when ill at ease , and mumbled an unintelligible greeting , but Cynthia was not in the least embarrassed .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 32]: She smiled at him as frankly as if he had been another Betty , yet with a little air of gracious dignity which is rarely found in girls of her age .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 33]: She was quite simple and unaffected , but one could never imagine her taking part in the free-and-easy , slangy , unchivalrous intercourse which so often prevails nowadays between girls and boys .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 28]: She held herself like a Queen , and silent Miles looked at her , and in the depths of his honest heart vowed himself to her service .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 8]: `` What did you call for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 3]: Betty queried .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 8]: `` Did you want to see me ?
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 5]: Was it about to-morrow ?
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 11]: We are going to call for you at half-past two .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 13]: We can walk , I suppose , unless it is wet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 10]: `` Oh yes , it will be far nicer .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 8]: I do hope it will be fine .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 12]: This is not at all a cheerful Christmas , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 2]: Good-bye !
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 11]: I do hope you 'll have a lovely time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 15]: returned Cynthia , waving her hand and crossing the road towards her own doorway .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 46]: It was too late to remind her that she had not answered the last question , and the first sight of the hall table banished every other thought , for on it lay the pile of Christmas cards whose advent had been so eagerly expected .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 24]: Betty seized the bundle and began doling them out , while her brothers and sisters clustered round , and clamoured for their share .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 25]: `` Miss Trevor -- Miss Trevor -- Miss Trevor -- -LRB- Betty , it 's not fair , you are taking them all ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 24]: Miss Jill Trevor , Miss JM Trevor , Mrs Trevor , James Trevor , Esquire , MD -- -LRB- Looks like a bill !
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 11]: How mean to send a bill on Christmas day ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 53]: Miss Trevor , Miss Pamela Trevor , '' so it went on , the major share falling to the three girls , the boys coming in only for an occasional missive from an aunt or some such kindly relation , who suddenly awoke to the fact of their existence at Christmas time .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 30]: When the cards were dealt out there still remained a little pile of envelopes which had apparently been delivered by hand , as no stamps appeared beside the addresses .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 12]: Betty pounced on them , and gave a shout of delight .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 6]: `` There 's money inside !
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 8]: There is , I can feel it .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 26]: Mine 's quite small -- like a -- a -- '' She dropped the remaining envelopes to open her own in a flutter of excitement .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 32]: Inside there was a folded piece of paper enclosing a second envelope -- one of those tiny , dainty affairs in which some old-fashioned tradesmen still deliver change to their customers .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 18]: In her haste Betty ripped it open , and held up to view a brand new sovereign .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 4]: `` It is !
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 3]: It is !
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 4]: How s-imply lovely !
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 9]: I was so hard up -- and now !
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 9]: What perfect angel can have sent it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 43]: She picked up the piece of paper which she had dropped in her haste , and read aloud , `` With the best wishes of Terence Digby , '' the while her brothers and sisters made short work of their own envelopes .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 29]: Jack and Jill had each a new ten-shilling piece , and Pam a magnificent silver crown , the size of which delighted her even more than the value .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 18]: `` He said he would send me something , but I never thought it would be money .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 19]: It 's what I like better than anything else , to be rich in the Christmas holidays ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 18]: Jill cried rapturously , and Mrs Trevor smiled and said -- `` So he seemed to think .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 60]: He asked my permission before sending his presents in this form , and said he would like to give you money , because when he was a boy an old lady used to send new coins to himself and his brothers every Christmas in these same little envelopes , and he had never forgotten the pleasure they gave him .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 33]: You will feel rich , but do n't be in too great a hurry to spend your fortunes , for the General may wish to speak to you on that point . ''
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 6]: Jill shrugged her shoulders disgustedly .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 3]: `` Bother !
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 12]: I hope he wo n't want us to spend it sensibly !
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 8]: That would take away all the fun .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 18]: I want to keep it in my purse , and fritter it away just as I like .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 19]: What 's the good of giving presents , and not letting you use them as you like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 23]: `` Well , well , what 's the use of grumbling before you know if there is anything to grumble about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 6]: returned Mrs Trevor , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 32]: She moved away , carrying her bundle of letters , and the children followed her example , and spent a happy half-hour examining , displaying , and comparing cards and calendars .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 30]: Then came lunch , a glorified lunch with `` party '' sweets , and dessert , finishing up with a big dish of chestnuts to roast over the fire .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 33]: The doctor was at home for the afternoon , having made the round of his serious patients in the morning -LRB- abominably selfish of anyone to be ill on Christmas Day ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 29]: , and that fact alone gave a festivity to the afternoon tea , while ever in the background lurked the delightful anticipation of presents -- presents to come !
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 66]: Other people had done with all their excitement before now , and had even grown accustomed to their new possessions , but Betty and Jill donned last year 's party dresses for dinner in a flutter of anticipation , and then hurried downstairs , each with an armful of parcels to add to the store which had been accumulating in the library all day long .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 51]: The sofa was full of them -- neat brown -- paper parcels , bulky parcels , shapeless parcels , tissue-paper parcels , large and small , dainty and the reverse , boxes , envelopes , and a mysterious pyramid covered with a sheet , over which Pam mounted jealous guard .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 37]: Betty had just time to arrange the parcels on two large trays , and see the larger articles conveyed into the dining-room and hidden behind a screen , before the gong rang , and dinner began .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 53]: There was the orthodox turkey and roast beef , plum-pudding and mince - pies , but when dessert was over there came a moment of thrilling excitement , as the servants placed one heaped trayful of presents on the table before Dr Trevor , and another at the bottom before his wife .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 8]: The long-looked-for moment had come at last !
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 39]: Well , it was a pleasant sight to see the twinkle in the doctor 's tired eyes as he looked round the table at his five children , and exchanged a smile of comradeship with his pretty wife .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 46]: His long delicate hand , the true doctor 's hand , lifted the topmost parcel from the tray , and held it aloft while he read aloud the laborious inscription -- '' ` To Miles , hopping he will like it , from Pam . '
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 7]: Here you are , Miles ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 30]: and down the table it went , from one eager pair of hands to another , while Pam blushed a vivid red , and wriggled bashfully on her chair .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 43]: There were a great many wrappings , and the dimensions of the parcel diminished so rapidly as to excuse serious fears that it contained nothing more substantial than a joke , but such an idea was an insult to Pam 's generosity .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 47]: She had bestowed much thought on the choice of this special present , and could not in the least understand the roar of laughter which rose from every side as the last paper fell away to disclose a magnificent sixpenny tooth-brush in all its creamy splendour .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 20]: Miles ' face was a study as he gazed upon it , and turned it speculatively to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 8]: `` Anything personal meant , Pam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 13]: he inquired , and , `` Yes , please , Miles ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 19]: replied innocent Pam , and blushed again to the verge of tears at the second shout of merriment .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 35]: `` It 's a very useful present , dear , '' Mrs Trevor said consolingly , and hastened to give the conversation a turn by doling out another parcel from her own tray . ''
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 10]: ` Betty , with love from Jill . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 50]: It was a very small parcel , and Betty looked at it with suspicion , remembering the sticking-plaster and watered eau de Cologne , but things turned out better than she expected , the enclosure being quite a pretty hat-pin , of a colour to match her best hat .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 7]: `` Just what I wanted ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 33]: was both the true and the gracious manner of acknowledging this trophy , as also the book from Jack , and the gloves from Miles , which presently fell to her share .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 47]: Then it was the doctor 's turn , his wife having retired behind the screen to bring forth an enormous parcel , which could only be laid on a chair by his side , since it was far too big to place on the table itself .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 4]: `` For me ?
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 7]: Why , what can this be ?
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 7]: It feels like a blanket ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 32]: he cried in astonishment , and his face was a picture of mingled surprise , pleasure , and consternation , as a handsome fur-lined carriage rug was presently revealed to view .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 8]: `` Oh , this is too much !
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 5]: This wo n't do !
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 7]: Edith , what reckless extravagance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 12]: `` Not extravagance at all , '' his wife answered sturdily .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 14]: `` You must be kept warm , driving about from morning till night .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 16]: It is nothing less than a necessity which you ought to have had years ago .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 15]: Besides , it 's not my gift alone -- it 's a joint affair .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 23]: The children all contributed -- it 's from all six of us , with our best love to you , dearest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 42]: `` I gave threepence , '' announced Pam proudly , thereby bringing a smile to her father 's face , though his voice had a suspicious quiver in it as he said -- `` Thank you , my six darlings ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 9]: and smoothed the rug with a loving touch .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 20]: Its presence would keep not only his body but his heart warm on many a wintry day to come .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 11]: After this , the parcel-opening went on fast and furious .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 21]: Pam received a young lady doll , and had barely recovered from the rapture of her arrival when , presto !
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 31]: There appeared a miniature travelling-box , covered with leather , provided with straps , and a white PT painted at the sides , just like a real true grown-up box !
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 7]: And inside -- a veritable trousseau !
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 46]: The work of loving mother hands on many a winter evening -- a blue serge coat and skirt , a party frock of pale pink silk , a long white cloak ; a straw hat for ordinary wear , and -- could you believe it ?
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 29]: -- a toque , boa , and muff of real fur , just like that old muff of mother 's that she wore before the new one arrived .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 24]: Beneath these treasures a supply of under garments , including a dear little flannel dressing - jacket , and bedroom slippers to match .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 26]: Never , no , never since the creation of the world did a little girl of eight years receive a more all-satisfying and delightful offering !
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 29]: In her parents ' eyes at least , Pam 's little face , aglow with innocent rapture , was the most beautiful sight of that happy Christmas Day .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 27]: Jack had a book from his father , a knitted tie from Betty , skates from his mother -- oh , for a good hard frost !
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 16]: -- some cast-off tools from Miles , and a packet of black sticking-plaster from Jill .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 23]: He grinned broadly over this last offering , and while the parcel-opening went on on both sides fumbled mysteriously beneath the tablecloth .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 26]: Five minutes later , as he joined the others in a burst of laughter , his mother started violently , and cried , `` Jack !
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 7]: What _ has _ happened ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 12]: in a tone of dismay which brought every eye upon him .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 26]: Freckled nose , twinkling eyes , outstanding ears -- no change to be seen in these well-known features , but the teeth -- the teeth !
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 23]: Between lips extended in broadest of smiles appeared horrible , isolated tusks standing out conspicuously from the black gaps on either side .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 30]: What in the name of all that was mysterious and perplexing had happened to those rows of sound regular ivories which had been his chief beauty five minutes before ?
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 9]: And what an alteration in his whole appearance !
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 19]: Extraordinary to think of the change which was effected by the loss of half a dozen little teeth !
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 12]: After the first start of surprise , understanding dawned quickly enough .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 46]: Jill 's present had been short-lived , but it had served its purpose , both in her eyes and Jack 's , in causing the sensation of the evening , and the mother 's pitiful , `` Take them off , Jack dear , do !
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 8]: You look _ so _ dreadful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 12]: could not persuade Jack to peel off the disfiguring black squares .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 23]: It was too dear a triumph to a schoolboy 's heart to create shudders of disgust every time he opened his mouth !
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 34]: The pile of presents on the trays waxed rapidly less and less , the last parcel of all being of exceptional daintiness , -- tissue-paper , tied round with a narrow blue ribbon .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 45]: It was addressed to Betty , and to her rapturous surprise contained a line of congratulation from Cynthia Alliot , and the exact duplicate of an artistic silver and enamel buckle which she had admired on her friend 's belt a few days before .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 39]: She was so entirely occupied crooning over this treasure , that she did not notice that Pam had suddenly slipped from her chair and pushed the screen aside , leaving the tall draped mystery fully exposed to view .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 11]: `` It 's my present , '' she explained proudly .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 4]: `` For mother .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 5]: Just what she wanted !
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 14]: Cook hid it for me , and covered it with these clothes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 18]: She stood on tiptoe as she spoke , taking out the pins which held the coverings together .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 22]: They fell to the ground , and revealed a handsome branching palm , standing four or five feet from the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 48]: Mrs Trevor uttered an exclamation of incredulous surprise , and indeed every face round the table expressed the same sentiment , for the plant was obviously expensive , and how in the world could Pam have purchased it out of an income of a penny a week ?
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 4]: `` My darling !
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 3]: For me ?
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 7]: That is indeed a magnificent present .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 8]: Where did it come from , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 13]: Has someone joined with you to give a present to mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 61]: Before now it had happened that a friend of the family had consulted the children as to their mother 's wishes in the matter of Christmas presents , and it seemed the most likely solution of the mystery that this had occurred once again , Pam contributing in the same proportion as she had done to her father 's rug .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 3]: But no !
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 22]: Pam proudly denied the insinuation , and repeated -- `` It 's my very own present I bought it myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 24]: `` But , my sweetheart -- '' began Mrs Trevor anxiously , and then checked herself at the thought of another possible explanation .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 17]: `` Did someone give you some money , dear , that I knew nothing about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 4]: `` Oh no !
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 14]: I have n't had any money , only General Digby 's to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 36]: `` Then how -- I am very pleased and delighted to have the palm , but I ca n't enjoy it properly until I know a little more about how it came into your possession .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 12]: It is such a very big present for a little girl .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 11]: How did you get all the money , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 9]: Pam smiled with an air of innocent pride .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 10]: `` It was n't -- all -- money ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 5]: she said , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 5]: `` Not all money ?
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 5]: What do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 13]: If it was not all money , what was the rest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 4]: `` Clothes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 4]: `` Clothes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 5]: cried Mrs Trevor vaguely .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 4]: `` Clothes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 4]: echoed her husband .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 4]: `` Clothes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 7]: shrieked Betty in a shrill treble .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 4]: `` Cl-othes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 5]: repeated the boys curiously .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 16]: Only Jill 's face lit up with comprehension , mingled with a spice of resentment .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 7]: `` I know -- I know !
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 8]: _ Old _ clothes , she means !
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 30]: She has been selling old clothes -- our old clothes , if you please -- to ` All a-growing all a - blowing ' in exchange for the palm !
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 7]: He likes them better than money .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 17]: I heard him say so one day when Pam was seeing me off at the door .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 37]: That 's where dad 's old coat has gone to , that 's where your blouse is , Betty , not to mention some of the boys ' ties , and gloves , and my umbrella .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 6]: Oh , you wretched child !
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 9]: The hours I 've spent searching for it !
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 17]: That 's where everything has gone that we have been searching for for the last month .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 11]: She has been gathering them together for the palm ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 29]: Mrs Trevor 's face was a study of complex emotion as she looked at her baby , but Pam 's triumphant satisfaction did not waver for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 18]: She nodded her head , and cried cheerfully -- `` Oh , lots more things than that !
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 40]: He wanted so much , because palms is most expensive of all before Christmas , and I bought it when you were all out , and cook hid it , and we sprayed its leaves to make them bright .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 18]: In her last place Miss Bella did them every week with milk-and-water to make them shine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 32]: She had not the least idea that there was anything to be ashamed of in her action ; on the contrary , she was full of pride in her own cleverness .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 23]: But it was impossible to allow such an occasion to pass , even on Christmas evening , when discipline is necessarily relaxed .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 37]: Mrs Trevor 's face was an eloquent mingling of tenderness and distress as she said -- `` But did it never strike you , Pam dear , that these things were not your own to sell ?
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 10]: That you had no right to sell them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 6]: `` They were no use .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 45]: You said to father , ` That coat is too disgraceful to be worn , ' and Betty said the blouse mortified her pride , and Jill made fun of her umbrella because it was three and eleven-pence , and the wires bulged out .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 35]: She said , ` I ca n't think why it is that I always lose silk ones , and I ca n't get rid of this wretched thing , do what I will ! '
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 31]: I thought , '' -- Pam 's voice sounded a tremulous note of disappointment -- `` I thought you would all be pleased with me for clearing them away . ''
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 28]: `` It would have been different , dear , if you had asked our permission , though we all have to put up with shabby things sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 26]: As it was , it was both wrong and dishonest to take things which belonged to other people , and sell them without permission . ''
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 8]: `` But I sold my own too !
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 26]: My blue coat and hat , because you said yourself they did n't suit me , and you could n't bear to see them on .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 13]: I heard you speaking to Betty , and saying those very words .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 15]: I thought you 'd be pleased if you never did see them again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 6]: Mrs Trevor gasped in consternation .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 15]: `` Oh , Pam , Pam , what am I to say to you ?
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 7]: This is worse than I imagined !
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 11]: Your blue coat -- and it was quite good still !
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 14]: I ca n't possibly accept a present obtained in such a way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 40]: She cast an appealing glance at her husband , who had been sitting covering his mouth with his hand , and trying in vain to subdue the twinkle in his eyes as he listened to Pam 's extraordinary confession .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 35]: Now he looked at the child 's frightened , shrinking face , and said kindly -- `` I think Pam and I will have a quiet talk together while you adjourn to the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 31]: She did not mean to do wrong , and I am sure she will never offend again in the same way when she understands things in their right light . ''
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 39]: So Mrs Trevor and the elder children went to the drawing-room , and , ten minutes later , a subdued little Pam crept up to her mother 's side , holding out a bright crown-piece on her palm .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 14]: `` Father says General Digby would like me best to pay my debts .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 17]: Will you please give some to the others to pay for the things I took ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 6]: `` Thank you , Pam .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 15]: I shall be very pleased to do so , '' said Mrs Trevor quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 34]: Her heart ached at being obliged to take the child 's fortune from her , but she knew it was the right thing to do , and would not allow herself to hesitate .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 15]: `` And now , darling , I shall be delighted to have the palm .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 10]: It is indeed the very thing I wanted . ''
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 10]: Pam tried to smile , but her lips quivered .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 12]: A whole crown-piece , and a new one into the bargain !
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 21]: A Vanderbilt deprived of his millions could not have felt his poverty more bitterly than she did at that moment !
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIFTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 3]: THE CONCERT .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 68]: Next afternoon Betty left Jill engaged in filling up the blanks in her Christmas letters , and Pam lovingly dressing up Pamela junior in her various costumes , and , accompanied by her father and Miles , called for Cynthia and set out to walk across the Park to the Albert Hall , where Miss Beveridge and a friend had arranged to meet them in the box .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 67]: Cynthia looked delightfully graceful and pretty in a blue costume and hat , which had already caused Betty many pangs of envy , and perhaps it was a remembrance of his own youth which made Dr Trevor pass his hand through Betty 's arm and lead her ahead , so that his son should have the pleasure of a talk with this very charming little lady .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 43]: Miles was the best of good fellows , all solid goodness and worth , but he was still in the boorish stage , and it would do him good to be drawn out of himself , and forced to play the gallant .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 14]: Miles himself was by no means sure that he approved of the arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 59]: He would have preferred to walk behind Cynthia , and admire her pretty hair , her tiny feet , and the general air of daintiness which was to him the greatest charm of all , but he had not the slightest idea what to say , and thought of the long walk before him with something approaching consternation .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 40]: Fortunately for him Cynthia was not in the least shy , and had so seldom an opportunity of talking to anyone of her own age , that she could have chattered away the whole afternoon without the slightest difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 16]: `` It is n't often _ you _ have a holiday , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 13]: she said , smiling at him in her bright , friendly manner .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 39]: `` Once when I was up very early I saw you going out before six o'clock , and now if I 'm awake I hear the door slam -- you do slam it very loudly , you know !
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 12]: -- and know it is you going out to your work .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 33]: It makes me feel so lazy , because I am supposed to do half an hour 's practising before nine o'clock breakfast , and I do feel it such a penance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 4]: Miles laughed shortly .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 10]: `` Did you ever see me coming back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 35]: he inquired , and when Cynthia nodded , with a twinkle in her eye -- `` Betty was afraid you would believe I was a _ real _ workman , '' he told her .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 22]: `` She thought you would put us down as quite impossible people , having a workman living in the house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 22]: `` Betty is a goose , '' said Betty 's new friend cheerily , `` but she is a nice goose .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 4]: I like her .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 20]: I guessed you were learning to be an engineer , because I have a cousin who did the same .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 9]: I like a man to do manly work .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 14]: I suppose you are dreadfully interested in all those noisy engines and things .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 6]: Tell me about them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 50]: It was rather a large order , and Miles would have answered shortly enough if an ordinary acquaintance had put such a question , but there was a magnetism about Cynthia which broke down reserve , and to his own astonishment he found himself answering quite easily and naturally .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 16]: `` I am not studying for railway engineering -- I am going in for mines .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 15]: It 's a different course altogether , and in some ways much more difficult .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 41]: There seems nothing that a mining engineer ought not to know -- assaying , and surveying , and everything to do with minerals , and , of course , a thorough understanding of pumps , and all the machinery employed .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 59]: Then he ought to know something about doctoring , and even cooking , if he wants to be an all-round success , for ten to one he will be sent to some out-of-the-way wilderness where there is no one else to look after the comfort of his men -- '' `` Is that what you intend to do ?
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 12]: Go and bury yourself at the end of the world ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 13]: `` I expect so -- any time after the next six months .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 23]: I shall have finished my course by that time , and be on the look-out for the first opening that comes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 9]: `` What will Betty do without you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 26]: Betty 's brother shrugged his shoulders with the unconcern with which , it is to be feared , most lads regard their sisters ' feelings .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 10]: `` Oh , she 'll get used to it !
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 17]: It 's no use sticking at home if one wants to get on in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 21]: I should never be content to jog along in a secondary position all my life , as some fellows do .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 23]: I do n't care how hard I work , but I mean to get to the very top of the tree ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 9]: `` Wish I 'd been born a boy !
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 38]: It must be delicious to rough it in the wilds , '' sighed Cynthia , stepping daintily over a puddle , and looking down with concern to see if perchance there was a splash on her boots .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 34]: `` Boys have much the best of it ; they have a chance of doing something great in the world , while girls have to stay at home and -- darn their socks !
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 33]: All the great things are done by men -- in war , in science , in discovery , even in art and literature , though a few women may equal them there .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 29]: All the great things are made by men , too , the wonderful cathedrals and buildings , and the great bridges and battleships -- all the big things .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 9]: There 's so little left for us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 21]: Miles looked at her beneath drawn brows , his rugged face softening with the smile that Betty loved to see .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 8]: `` And who makes the men ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 27]: he asked simply , and Cynthia peered at him in startled , eager fashion , and cried -- `` You mean -- _ we _ do ?
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 8]: Women , mothers and sisters and wives ?
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 8]: Is _ that _ what you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 13]: Oh , I _ do _ think you say nice things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 22]: -LRB- Shy , silent old Miles being accused of saying `` nice things '' to a member of the opposite sex !
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 6]: Wonders will never cease ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 51]: `` I shall remember that , next time I see a lucky boy pass by rattling the railings , and looking as if the world belonged to him , while I must stand behind the curtains , because it 's not ` lady-like ' to stare out of the windows !
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 8]: I do ramp and rage sometimes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 15]: Miles ' laugh rang out so merrily that Betty turned to stare in amazement .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 31]: The idea of Cynthia doing anything so violent as `` ramp and rage '' seemed impossible to realise , as one looked at her dainty figure and sweet pink-and-white face .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 32]: All the same it was a pleasure to find that she did not belong to the wax-doll type of girl , but had a will and a temper of her own .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 21]: `` Yes , you may laugh , '' she cried , laughing herself , `` but it 's quite true .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 27]: Or perhaps it would be more ` lady-like ' to say that I feel like ` a caged bird , ' as people do in books .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 20]: In future I shall console myself with the thought that I may be the lever which supplies the force .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 9]: Is that simile right , or ridiculously wrong ?
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 12]: It 's rash of me to use engineering terms before you .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 28]: I mean that I 'll try to be a good influence to some man , and so inspire work , if I ca n't do it myself .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 10]: The worst is , I know so few men !
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 28]: Father is abroad , all our relations are far away , and until I come out I seem to meet nothing but girls , old and young .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 19]: Of course , if I got to know you better , I might influence _ you _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 49]: She turned her laughing face upon him , the face of a frank , innocent child , for , though she was nearly seventeen years old , Cynthia was absolutely innocent of the flirtatious instinct which is strong in some little girls in the coral and pinafore stage .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 64]: She offered her friendship to Betty 's brother as composedly as she had done to Betty herself ; it was Miles who blushed , and stared at the pavement , and his voice sounded hoarse and difficult as he mumbled his reply -- `` I wish you -- I 'm sure I should -- awfully good thing for me if you did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 15]: `` Very well ; but you will have to do great things , remember !
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 9]: I sha n't be satisfied with anything less .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 27]: It will be good for me too , for I shall have to be very stern with myself , if I am to influence someone else .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 6]: What are your chief faults ?
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 23]: I ought to know , ought n't I , so as to be able to set to work the right way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 31]: She was so deliciously naive and outspoken , that once again Miles ' rare laugh rang out , and once again Betty marvelled , and felt a thrill of envy .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 58]: By the time that the Albert Hall was reached , the two young people had progressed so far towards intimacy that Miles had forgotten his shyness , and confided to his new mentor some of the trials and grievances which beset him in his work , the which he had never before confided in a human being .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 14]: The attraction of one sex to another is a natural and beautiful thing .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 27]: God designed it as one of the great forces in His universe , and an almost omnipotent power it is , either for good or evil .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 29]: Do the girls who jest and frivol with the young men with whom they are brought in contact , realise their responsibility in all they say and do ?
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 38]: Do they ever reflect that the beauty and charm which they possess are weapons with which God has endowed them , -- weapons which may have more power in the battle of life than a two-edged sword ?
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 60]: Laugh and be merry -- enjoy the sunshine of your youth ; it is a sin to see a young thing sad ; but never , never , as you value your womanhood , speak a slighting or irreverent word against God 's great laws of righteousness , nor allow such a word to pass unreproved in your presence .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 37]: Remember in the midst of your merry-making to preserve your dignity as women , knowing that by so doing you will not lose , but trebly strengthen your hold on any man worthy of the name .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 35]: Say to yourself , dear girls -- `` With God 's help I will be a good angel to this man , who has to meet trials and temptations from which I am exempt .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 25]: So far as in me lies I will make him respect all women , and help , not hinder him in his work . ''
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 15]: It is n't necessary to be prim and proper -- do n't think that !
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 65]: The Misses Prunes and Prisms , who are always preaching , weary rather than help , but when the bright , sweet-natured girl , who loves a joke , and can be the whole-hearted companion of a summer day , speaks a word of reproof , or draws back from a proposed enterprise , her action carries with it a treble weight of influence .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 75]: When the whole party were seated in the box -- Miss Beveridge and Betty in the front row , Cynthia and governess number two in the second , and the two `` men '' at the back -- Miles had little attention to spare for the music , so absorbed was he in gazing at Cynthia 's delicately-cut profile , and in weaving about her the halo of a young man 's first romance .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 52]: There was no romance in the two girls ; they were absorbed in admiration of the wonderful building itself , in enjoyment of the music , and in anxiety to do their duty to dear Mrs Vanburgh 's `` Govies , '' as they irreverently termed Miss Beveridge and her companion .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 16]: Even when on pleasure bent , the former could not be called `` responsive . ''
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 10]: When asked , `` Do you like music ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 7]: she replied curtly , `` No !
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 5]: I teach it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 15]: which reduced the questioner to stupid silence , though her thoughts were active enough .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 5]: `` Oh , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 13]: That 's one for me , as I am a pupil still !
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 24]: It 's the stupidity of pupils which has made her dislike music , but then -- why does she come to a concert ?
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 19]: Why could n't she have had the decency to refuse , and let someone else have the ticket ?
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 22]: Oh , I do dislike you -- you cold , -- cutting , disagreeable , ungrateful , snappy old thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 29]: Betty sat back in her chair and let her eyes rest on Miss Beveridge 's profile , as that lady in her turn stared fixedly at the orchestra .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 22]: She was wearing quite `` a decent little toque , '' and had taken pains with the arrangement of her hair .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 59]: Betty was at the stage when she imagined that it was impossible that life could retain any interest after the age of thirty , but it dawned upon her now that , at some far-off , prehistoric period , Miss Beveridge had been handsome -- even very handsome , which made her present condition all the more pitiable .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 24]: Suppose , just suppose for a moment , that one became old and lonely , and poor and plain and snappy , oneself !
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 22]: It was too horrible a prospect to be believed ; much more satisfactory to take refuge in the usual rose-coloured dreams !
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 16]: The Royal Box was close at hand -- empty , unfortunately , of interesting occupants .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 26]: How would it feel to be a princess , and loll back in one 's chair , conscious of being the cynosure of every eye ?
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 41]: Betty lolled , and tried to project herself into the position , pleasingly conscious of a new blouse , quite immaculate suede gloves , and Cynthia 's buckle showing its dull blues and reds at the front of her belt .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 16]: She turned her head slowly from side to side , and cultivated a charming smile .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 23]: -- `` Princess Elizabeth appeared in the Royal Box , looking as fascinating as ever in a costume of her favourite grey .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 53]: -- '' The musical programme was interesting and varied , but during the second half of the concert the cheerfulness of the scene was sadly marred by the ever-increasing fog which crept in from without , filling the vast interior with a gloom against which the many lights seemed powerless to contend .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 41]: Dr Trevor began to feel a little nervous about the safety of his party , and suggested making a move before the end of the concert , but Miss Beveridge insisted that she and her friend needed no escort home .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 14]: `` It would have to be a very bad fog to frighten us .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 29]: We are accustomed to going about town in all weathers , '' she declared , and this was so obviously the case that it seemed affectation to protest .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 42]: The doctor therefore explained that as he was in charge of Cynthia he wished to allay her mother 's natural anxiety as soon as possible , and the young people bade farewell to their guests of the afternoon and hurried downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 32]: Early though it was , hundreds of people seemed to have been inspired by the same fears , for the stairway was thronged and the passages downstairs were becoming momentarily blocked .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 10]: Dr Trevor tucked Cynthia 's hand through his arm .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 20]: `` Look after your sister , Miles , '' he cried , turning a quick glance over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 9]: `` I 'm afraid it 's very thick .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 8]: Keep close behind me if you can .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 12]: In any case make the best of your way home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 35]: A moment later they passed through the doorway into a world of black gloom , in which phantom shapes at one moment pressed against one , and at the next vanished utterly from sight .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 29]: Betty gave a little cry of dismay , for , London-bred as she was , never before had she been out of doors in such an impenetrable fog .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 26]: She put out her hand towards the spot where Miles had stood a moment before , but her fingers gripped nothing more substantial than air .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 33]: She gave a quick leap forward , and clutching at a shadowy coat-sleeve shook it violently , calling out in accents half-frightened , half-angry -- `` Miles , how horrid of you !
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 9]: You must not stalk on ahead like that !
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 13]: I shall be lost , and then what will become of me ?
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 11]: For pity 's sake keep hold of my arm ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 31]: She had walked a few paces forward as she spoke , but now she stopped short , in response to a determined movement of the arm to which she clung .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 49]: Betty glanced upwards in surprise ; she could not see the face so near to her arm , but the blood chilled in her veins as a strange voice answered slowly -- `` But -- I 'm sorry , but I do not happen to be Miles ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIXTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 5]: LOST IN THE FOG .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 32]: The feeling of despair , of helplessness , of desolation , which overcame Betty at that moment , remained with her as a poignant memory to the end of her life .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 48]: She was lost , as hopelessly lost as if she had been in the midst of a solitary waste , though close at hand , perhaps only a few yards away , were her own father and brother , the latter no doubt desperately searching for her .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 25]: Dr Trevor would make the best of his way home with Cynthia , knowing his son to be as good a guide as himself .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 4]: Poor old Miles !
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 37]: He would have a bad time of it when he arrived home alone ; -- yet he had not been to blame , for she herself had refused to take his arm before leaving the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 7]: `` It looked so silly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 24]: She had intended to take it the moment they were in the street , but even that one moment had been too long .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 48]: As she heard the stranger 's voice she turned in a panic of fear , and tried to drag her hand from his arm , but he held her tightly , saying , with an odd mixture of weariness and impatience -- `` Do n't be foolish !
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 9]: You can do no good by running away .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 11]: You can never find your friends again in this blackness .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 17]: Tell me where you want to go , and I 'll try to help you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 4]: Betty trembled helplessly .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 9]: `` But I must -- I must try !
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 11]: It 's a long way off -- across the Park .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 12]: Father is here , and my brother , and some friends .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 18]: I 'll go back to the Hall -- they may go there to look for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 5]: `` Look round ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 40]: said the strange voice , and Betty turned her head and stared in amazement , for the great building had vanished as completely as had Miles himself , and nothing was to be seen but a wall of darkness .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 25]: On every side she heard the movement of invisible forms , but their very unreality added to the sense of desolation which possessed her .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 14]: It was terrible even to think of venturing alone through the ghost-like ranks .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 29]: Instinctively she clung more closely to her companion 's arm , and , as if recognising her feelings , his voice took a gentler , more reassuring tone .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 6]: `` Do n't be afraid .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 9]: I had a sister of my own once .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 10]: You can trust me to see you safely home .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 23]: I am afraid it is no earthly use trying to find your friends among all the thousands who are leaving the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 28]: Better tell me where you live , so that we can get there as soon as the rest of your party , and save them needless alarm .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 7]: Across the Park , you said ?
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 22]: The gates will be closed , of course , and in any case that would be the last route to take .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 7]: Tell me your exact address . ''
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 18]: `` Brompton Square -- we turn off at Stanhope Terrace , just past the Lancaster Gate Station .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 15]: It is one of those squares lying between the Park and Edgware Road . ''
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 7]: `` I know , I know .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 16]: Its a long walk , but perhaps it will get lighter as we go on .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 8]: These dense fogs are often very local .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 9]: Keep tight hold of my arm , please .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 16]: If we are once separated , it might not be easy to meet again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 5]: `` No , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 13]: I could not have believed it was so easy to get lost .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 16]: My brother was beside me one instant , the next -- it was your coat-sleeve !
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 10]: I hope I did not shake it too violently !
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 16]: I was so nervous and frightened I did not think what I was doing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 21]: She laughed as she spoke , her youthful spirits beginning to assert themselves again , as her confidence was assured .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 38]: The face of her companion was unknown , but the tone of that quite , `` Do n't be afraid , I had a sister of my own , '' had put an end to her fears .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 10]: Here was an adventure indeed -- a full-fledged adventure !
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 23]: In anticipation she felt the joys of relating her experiences to a breathless audience in the schoolroom , and thrilled with importance .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 24]: The stranger did not echo her laugh , however , but merely murmured a few words of conventional disclaimer and relapsed into silence .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 30]: Betty could hear him sigh now and then as they made their way onward -- slowly feeling the way from point to point through the eerie , all-enveloping gloom .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 100]: Sometimes a brief question to a link-boy would assure them that they were still on the right road ; sometimes they wandered off the pavement and were suddenly aware of the champing of horses dangerously near at hand ; sometimes for a minute or two they stood still , waiting to find a clue to their position ; but through all the strange man preserved an unbroken silence , until Betty 's nerve gave way again , and she cried in plaintive , child - like fashion -- `` Oh , please would you mind talking a little bit !
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 4]: I 'm frightened .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 43]: It 's like a dreadful nightmare , feeling one 's way through this darkness -- and when you are so silent , I feel as if you were a ghost like all the rest , instead of a real live man . ''
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 7]: `` I wish I were ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 5]: returned the stranger bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 17]: Then recovering himself with an effort , `` I beg your pardon , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 10]: `` I am afraid I have been very remiss .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 42]: To tell the truth , I was lost in my own thoughts when you came to me a few minutes ago , and I am afraid I had gone back to them , and forgotten that I had a companion ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 2]: Forgotten !
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 5]: Forgotten her very existence !
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 37]: A young man rescues a beauteous maid -- really and truly she had looked unusually well in all her smart Christmas farings -- from a position of deadly peril , and straightway forgets her very existence !
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 17]: This part of the story , at least , must be omitted from the home recital .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 35]: Betty pursed her lips in offended dignity , but in the end curiosity got the better of her annoyance , and she said tentatively -- `` They must have been very nice thoughts ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 4]: `` Nice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 14]: The foolish girl 's word was repeated in a tone of bitterest satire .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 6]: `` Interesting , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 20]: `` In so far as the last of anything is interesting , be the beginning what it may ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 5]: `` The last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 25]: It was Betty 's turn to play the part of echo , as she stared in amazement at the shadowy form by her side .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 9]: `` How could they be your last thoughts ?
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 7]: You seem quite well and strong .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 14]: It is n't possible to go on living and not to think . ''
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 27]: `` No , it is not , and therefore when thoughts become unbearable -- '' He stopped short , and Betty felt a thrill of foreboding .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 40]: The strange silence , followed by the hopeless bitterness in the stranger 's voice , seemed to bespeak some trouble of overwhelming magnitude , and , viewed in that light , his last words admitted of only one conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 14]: Life had become unbearable , and therefore he had decided to end it .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 31]: Hitherto Betty had carelessly classed all suicides as mad ; but this man was not mad ; he was , on the contrary , remarkably sane and quiet in manner !
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 21]: He was only so hopelessly , helplessly miserable that it did not seem possible to endure another day 's existence .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 12]: Betty thrilled with a strange new feeling of awe and responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 46]: The hidden strength of her nature , which had come to her as the result of being brought up to womanhood in a household dedicated to God and His Christ , broke through the veneer of youthful folly , and came triumphantly to the surface .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 23]: Her nervous fear dropped from her like a mantle , and she was possessed by a burning longing to comfort and save .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 17]: In the midst of the fog and darkness God had sent to her a great opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 23]: She rose to it with a dignity which seemed to set the restless , self-centred Betty of an hour ago years behind .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 17]: Her fingers tightened on the stranger 's arm ; she spoke in firm , quiet tones .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 8]: `` I can guess what you mean !
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 16]: Forgive me for teasing you with my silly questions when you are in such trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 11]: Do you think you could tell me what it is ?
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 16]: It seems a strange thing to ask , but I am no real person to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 13]: I am just a shadow that has come out of the fog .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 10]: I have not even a face or a name .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 25]: You might speak to me as safely as to the air itself , and it might be a relief to put it into words .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 11]: It is so sometimes when one is in trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 21]: There was a moment 's silence , then -- `` Thank you , '' he said in a softened voice .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 11]: `` It 's kind of you to think of it .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 19]: You might have condemned me at once , as not fit to speak to a girl like you .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 10]: You are only a girl , are n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 7]: Your voice sounds very young . ''
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 9]: `` Yes , only eighteen -- nearly eighteen .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 25]: But my father is a doctor , so I am always being brought near to sad things , and sometimes I feel quite old .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 13]: I think I could understand if you told me your trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 11]: `` Suppose it was not so much sorrow as sin ?
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 3]: What then ?
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 15]: What can you at eighteen -- ` nearly eighteen ' -- know of that ?
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 10]: You could not understand if I did speak . ''
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 7]: `` Oh yes , I could .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 7]: I sin myself -- often ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 25]: cried Betty , with a swift remembrance of all those little things done or left undone which made the failure of her home life .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 52]: `` A girl living at home , with a father and a mother to look after her , has no temptation to any big thing , but it 's just as bad , if she is idle and selfish and ungrateful , and I am all three together many times over .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 36]: I 'd be too proud to say that to you if I saw your face and knew your name ; but , as I said before , we are only shadows in a dream to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 8]: It does n't matter what we say .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 12]: Tell me your trouble , and let me try to understand .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 13]: It is n't because I am curious -- it is n't really !
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 6]: Do you believe that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 12]: `` Yes , '' he said instantly , `` I do !
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 14]: Poor child , you want to help ; but I am past that .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 19]: I have ruined my own life and the life of the man who has been my best friend .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 26]: I have had my chance -- a better chance than is given to most men -- and I have made an utter failure of it .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 33]: If I -- went on , it would mean starting again from the very beginning , with the stigma of failure to hinder me at every turn -- a hopeless fight . ''
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 26]: `` But , '' -- Betty 's voice faltered nervously -- `` is n't it cowardly to run away just when the fight is hardest ?
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 12]: A soldier would be called a traitor if he did that .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 6]: And what would come afterwards ?
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 15]: Do you believe that you have a right to take your own life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 10]: `` You mean from a religious point of view .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 10]: I 'm afraid that 's out of my line .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 14]: I have lost what little faith I had in these last few years .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 33]: You believe in it all , of course -- it 's natural for a girl -- but to me the idea of a personal God is as unreal as a fairy tale .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 8]: It does not touch my position . ''
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 14]: `` But just suppose for a moment that it _ were _ true .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 20]: Suppose He does exist , and has been longing to help you all this time -- what then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 14]: cried Betty earnestly , and her companion gave a short , derisive laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 16]: `` It would have been easy enough for Him to have prevented all this trouble !
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 14]: I can see no help in the story of the last few years .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 6]: Everything has gone against me .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 29]: In the beginning I borrowed some money -- of course , it 's a case of money -- to help a friend who was in a tight fix .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 5]: That was innocent enough .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 29]: But when the time came round I could not repay the debt , and in my position it was fatally easy to help myself to what I needed .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 7]: I called it just another loan .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 29]: I was sure of repaying it before anything was discovered , but again it was impossible , for there were calls upon me which I had not expected .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 28]: If I had been short in my accounts I should have lost my situation , and it was a handsome one for a man of my age .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 38]: You wo n't understand the details , but I began to speculate , to put off the evil hour , always hoping for a _ coup _ which would put everything right ; but it never came .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 8]: I was not helped , you see !
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 15]: Things went from bad to worse , until I could go on no longer .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 26]: Then in despair I confessed the whole story to my friend -- he is a near relation also , but that is by the way .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 35]: He would not allow the family name to be disgraced ; he paid up all that was due , and saved me the shame of prosecution , but even he could do no more .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 17]: I am sent about my business -- a felon in deed , though not in name .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 8]: Incidentally , too , he is ruined .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 21]: He must give up his house , remove his children to cheap schools , live in poverty instead of ease .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 12]: Naturally enough he will have no more to do with me .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 20]: There is not a soul on earth who would regret me if I passed out of being to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 27]: There was a long silence while the strangely-matched couple wended their way slowly along the bisecting roads which lead from Kensington High Street to Bayswater Road .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 44]: The fog had slightly lessened by this time , but it was still too dense to show anything but a dim outline of passers-by , and the face of the stranger was but a blur against the darkness to Betty 's searching eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 40]: Her heart was beating rapidly ; she was praying with a whole-hearted earnestness unknown to her usual morning and evening supplications -- praying to be guided to say the right thing to save this man 's soul from despair .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 37]: At last -- `` You say you were not helped , '' she began timidly ; `` but if your speculations had succeeded as you hoped , it might not have been really good for you .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 28]: It would have been easier , of course , but if all had gone smoothly you might have been tempted to do the same thing another time .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 22]: Perhaps God knew that , and that there was no way of bringing you back to Himself except through trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 12]: The stranger laughed again -- his hard , mirthless little laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 12]: `` I am afraid I can hardly believe in that theory .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 30]: I can see no reason for believing that my doings are the slightest interest to Him , or that He cares in the least what becomes of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 6]: `` Ca n't you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 4]: cried Betty eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 6]: `` Oh , I can !
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 24]: Just think more carefully , and you will remember many , many things which you have not stopped to notice at the time .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 5]: To-night , for instance !
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 26]: Do you think it chance that I missed my brother , and came to you out of all the hundreds of people who were around ?
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 6]: _ I _ do n't !
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 39]: I believe God sent me to you because you would not speak to anyone you knew ; because you needed help so badly -- and I need it , too -- and we could help each other . ''
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 16]: The shadowy head bent nearer to hers , and the arm pressed against her hand .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 20]: `` Thank you , '' said the voice in a softened key ; `` that is a kind thought !
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 18]: It is quite true that I could not have spoken as I have done under ordinary circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 13]: When I met you I was going straight for the nearest water .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 16]: There are many places where an accident might easily occur on a night like this .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 14]: I do not wish to make any scandal , only to disappear . ''
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 7]: Betty drew in her breath sharply .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 45]: The sound of that one word `` water '' gave a definite touch to the situation , and thereby trebly increased its tragedy , but the gentleness of the voice gave her increased hope , and she cried eagerly -- `` Disappear , yes !
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 33]: I can understand it would be difficult to stay among the old surroundings , but why not disappear _ to come back _ another day , when you can redeem the past ?
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 32]: Suppose you went away to a strange place , and worked hard , oh , very hard , and denied yourself every possible thing , so as to save up money .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 34]: Suppose you succeeded -- when people are terribly in earnest about a thing , they generally _ do _ succeed -- and in some years ' time could pay off what you owe !
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 12]: That would be braver than killing yourself , would n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 7]: That would be worth living for .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 32]: Or if it took too long to pay it back in your friend 's lifetime , he has children , and you could help them as their father has helped you .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 15]: That would be paying back the debt in the way he would like best .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 4]: Think of it !
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 49]: They would imagine you dead , or perhaps worse than dead , but they would n't be angry with you any more ; people do n't go on being angry for years and years , especially if they are good and kind , as your friends must be .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 65]: But some day it might happen that they were in trouble , or getting old and tired , and feeling it was hard to go on working , and a letter would come in -- from you -- and inside that letter there would be a cheque , and they would be so happy , and so thankful , and so _ helped _ !
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 29]: And they would send for you to come back , and the old trouble would be wiped away , and they would honour you for your brave fight .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 10]: Oh , you will -- you _ will _ !
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 5]: You must do it !
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 8]: Promise , promise that you will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 24]: Her voice broke into a sob , and something like a faint echo of the sound came to her ears through the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 26]: It seemed the most promising answer she could have had , in its contrast from the biting self - possession of a few minutes before .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 7]: Her heart beat high with hope .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 11]: `` Is there any place to which you could go ?
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 11]: Have you enough money left to take you there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 25]: she questioned , as if the matter were already settled , and , consciously or unconsciously , the stranger replied in the same vein .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 17]: `` I have an old friend in America ; he would help me to a start .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 30]: I have a good many possessions left ; they would bring in enough to pay the passage if -- '' `` No , there is no ` if ' !
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 7]: Do n't let yourself say it !
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 20]: Sell the things to - morrow , and begin again in a new world , in a new way .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 49]: Believe that God _ does _ care , and that it is a chance that He has given you , and every night and every morning , oh , and so often through the day , I shall remember you , and pray that you may be helped !
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 34]: Sometimes when you feel lonely you may be glad to know that one person in the Old Country knows all about you , and is waiting to see the reward of your work .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 10]: You must let me know when the success comes .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 19]: I shall always be waiting ; and remember , this talk is going to do me good too !
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 40]: I have _ made _ troubles for myself because I did not know how well off I was , but now that I have come so close to the real thing I shall be ashamed to grizzle over trifles .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 10]: It _ is _ settled , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 7]: You are going on fighting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 6]: There was a long silence .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 32]: She could feel rather than see the struggle in the man 's face , but the pressure tightened on her hand , foretelling that the decision would be what she wished .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 10]: `` Yes , '' he said slowly at last .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 4]: `` I promise !
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 36]: An hour ago it seemed as if there was not a soul in the world who cared whether I lived or died , but as you say you came to me -- in the darkness !
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 6]: You think you were sent .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 9]: My old mother would have thought the same .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 26]: I do n't know , I ca n't tell , but it may be so , and that gives me courage to try again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 18]: He paused for a moment or two , then suddenly -- `` What is your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 4]: `` Betty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 4]: `` Betty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 10]: His voice lingered over the pretty , girlish name .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 7]: `` Thank you , Betty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 5]: `` And yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 4]: `` Ralph . ''
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 6]: `` Thank you , Ralph !
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 19]: You have given me something real to think of in life -- something to look forward to . ''
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 8]: He drew a long , stabbing breath .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 12]: `` But at the best it will be a long waiting .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 19]: You will be far from eighteen -- ` nearly eighteen ' -- before I can hope for success .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 8]: The years will seem very long . ''
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 7]: `` But they will pass ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 3]: cried Betty .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 6]: `` I can wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 48]: She was in a state of exaltation when no trial of patience seemed too great to face , and difficulties presented themselves only as glorious opportunities ; but the man , who had experienced the heat and burden of the day , sighed , and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 32]: By this time they had made their way past the great houses standing back from the road , and were close on the Lancaster Gate Station of the Central London Railway .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 28]: A faint light streamed into the gloom from the glass fanlight , and for the first time Betty began to feel that she trod on familiar ground .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 21]: `` Ah , here we are ; if we go round this corner I shall be home in five minutes .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 11]: Perhaps we shall arrive before the others , after all .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 25]: You have brought me so quickly that there is no time for them to have been anxious , unless Miles went in alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 6]: The stranger did not answer .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 28]: They turned round the corner of Stanhope Terrace and walked along for twenty or thirty yards , then suddenly he stood still , and dropped her arm .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 36]: `` I may never meet you again , '' he said slowly ; `` in all probability we never shall meet , but before we part , let me see your face , Betty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 26]: There was a sound of a match being struck against the side of a box , then a tiny flame flickered up in the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 28]: Betty gazed upwards into a face still young , but haggard and drawn with suffering , a long thin face with deep-set eyes and a well-cut chin .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 15]: `` Now , now , now , '' she was saying breathlessly to herself .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 5]: `` I must notice !
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 4]: I must remember !
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 18]: I shall have to remember for so many years -- '' The flame quivered and faded away .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 10]: `` Thank you , '' said the stranger quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 6]: `` I shall remember ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 11]: Evidently his thoughts and hers had followed the same course .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 37]: They walked along slowly side by side , but no longer arm in arm , for that momentary exchange of glances had brought a touch of personal embarrassment into the situation which had been unfelt before .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 52]: Betty was anxiously pondering what to say in farewell , feeling at the same time that further words would be more likely to mar than to aid the impression already made , when suddenly a form loomed through the darkness , and a well-known `` Coo-ee '' sounded in her ears .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 7]: `` Miles -- oh , Miles !
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 4]: I 'm here !
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 9]: Oh , Miles , I am so glad !
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 13]: I was so frightened , but this gentleman has been so kind .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 10]: He has brought me all the way home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 34]: Miles grunted discourteously ; he disapproved of stray acquaintances for his sister , and now that anxiety for her safety was assuaged , began to feel aggrieved at having been frightened for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 13]: `` What on earth did you mean by rushing off by yourself ?
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 7]: Might have been lost all night .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 21]: I 've been hanging about for an age , not daring to go into the house and scare the mater .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 11]: Never go out with you again in a fog ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 4]: Betty laughed merrily .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 7]: `` I can return that compliment .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 12]: It seems to me that you ran away from me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 11]: She turned to hold out her hand to the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 15]: `` Now that my brother is here I need not trouble you any more .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 2]: Good-bye !
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 6]: Thank you very much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 5]: `` Thank you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 4]: he said earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 9]: `` Good-bye until -- a brighter day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 12]: `` What does that bounder mean by talking of another day ?
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 3]: Cheek ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 37]: grunted Miles , leading the way onward , but Betty only pressed his arm and replied irrelevantly -- `` Do n't say anything about our having missed each other when we first go in , Miles .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 6]: I 'll tell mother quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 11]: I 'd rather , if you do n't mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 44]: Miles did not mind a bit -- in fact , he was thankful to be spared questioning and reproach , so he made his way upstairs to his room , while Betty entered the study , where Dr and Mrs Trevor were seated .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 9]: `` Here we are , safe and sound !
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 13]: It has been adventurous , but all 's well that ends well .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 8]: Have you been anxious , mother dear ?
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 6]: I do hope not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 22]: She bent to kiss her mother with an unwonted tenderness , which brought a flush of pleasure into the thin cheek .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 8]: `` How sweet that child looks to-night !
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 5]: Did you notice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 12]: she said to her husband when they were once more alone .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 9]: `` And she was so gentle and considerate .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 19]: It 's such a pleasure to see her like that , for she is sometimes so difficult . ''
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 4]: Dr Trevor smiled .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 11]: `` She is mellowing , dear , she is mellowing !
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 7]: I told you it would come .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 17]: The child is turning into a woman -- and a bonnie woman she will be too .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 5]: Dear little Betty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 46]: And in the shelter of her attic bedroom the child woman was holding a lighted candle before the looking-glass , and staring half abashed into an oval face with dilated eyes , and dark hair twisted by the damp into a cloud of tiny ringlets .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 12]: `` Did he -- did he think me -- nice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 6]: she was asking of herself .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVENTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 3]: THE SISTERS .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 25]: Upon the first quiet opportunity Betty confided the history of her walk to her mother , who listened with the deepest interest and sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 17]: `` It was a great opportunity , dear , and you made the most of it .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 11]: I am proud of my daughter , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 20]: `` I will join with you in praying that the poor fellow may be kept true to his pledge .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 42]: It 's not the first step which costs in these struggles , whatever the proverb may say ; the hardest part of the fight comes later on , when the first excitement is over , and progress seems so pitifully slow .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 13]: So do n't let yourself grow weary in well-doing , dear Betty .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 17]: Your poor friend will need your prayers more and more , not less and less . ''
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 15]: `` Oh no , I shall never grow tired , '' said Betty confidently .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 9]: Then her face clouded , and she sighed .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 15]: `` Mother , do you suppose I shall ever -- see him again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 8]: `` It is very unlikely , dear .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 18]: He is going so far away , and will have no money to spare for visits home .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 27]: It must be a large sum which he has to repay , if the loss of it necessitated such a change in his friend 's household .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 15]: With everything in his favour it would take a long time to earn . ''
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 7]: `` How long , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 8]: `` Dear child , what a question !
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 6]: It is impossible to say .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 21]: It would be extraordinary , I should think , if he managed it in less than a dozen years . ''
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 5]: `` A dozen years !
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 5]: I should be thirty !
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 33]: I shall be hideous at thirty , '' thought Betty ruefully , recalling the vision of the sweet , flushed face which had looked at her from the mirror the day before .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 26]: Could it be possible that a dozen years -- twelve whole years -- could pass by without bringing her any tidings of `` Ralph '' ?
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 43]: In the state of exaltation which had possessed her last night she had felt raised above the need of words , but already reaction had set in , and with it a strange sense of depression at the thought of the future .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 63]: It was good to know that there was Cynthia to talk to -- Cynthia , who might not be able to advise and strengthen as wisely as mother did , but who was a girl , and knew how girls felt -- `` up and down , and in and out , and -- oh , and so topsy-turvy upside down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 6]: thought poor Betty to herself .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 20]: A breathless , `` I want to speak to you ; I have something dreadfully interesting to tell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 51]: whispered in a chance encounter in the street , brought an immediate invitation to tea ` in my own room , where we sha n't be bothered ' ; and under these happy auspices the adventure was once more related , while Cynthia 's grey eyes grew wide with excitement .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 10]: `` Dear Betty , how glorious for you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 4]: she cried ecstatically .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 8]: `` What a wonderful thing to remember !
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 18]: You can never be blue again , and say that you are no use in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 22]: To have saved a man 's life , and started him on the right road -- at eighteen -- not eighteen !
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 11]: You are the most fortunate girl in the whole world !
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 83]: It 's so strange that this chance should have come to you on that particular day , because your brother and I had been talking about the different work of men and women as we walked over the Park to the Albert Hall , and he said that if it was men 's province to make the greatest things in the world , it was women 's work to make the men ; and that was what you did , Betty dear .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 9]: You helped God to make a man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 13]: Betty raised her brows in a surprise which was not altogether agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 9]: `` Miles -- _ Miles _ said so !
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 3]: How extraordinary !
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 16]: He never talks like that to me , and he hardly knew you at all .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 11]: However did you come to discuss such a subject ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 19]: `` I asked him about his work , and envied him for being able to do something real .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 6]: He is a nice boy .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 11]: I like him very much , '' said Cynthia placidly .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 15]: Imagine being favoured with confidences from Miles , and remaining quite cool and unconcerned !
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 23]: For a good two moments Betty forgot all about her own affairs in sheer wonder at such an astonishing state of mind .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 25]: Then remembrance came back , and she asked eagerly -- `` Cynthia , do you think I shall ever hear anything more about him ?
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 14]: Mother says it will take years and years to save so much money .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 9]: Do you think I shall ever know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 4]: said Cynthia confidently .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 7]: `` Of course you will know .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 9]: He will find some way of telling you .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 21]: You told him your address , so it was the easiest thing in the world to find out your name .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 26]: You will get something from him every year -- perhaps on Christmas Day , perhaps in summer , perhaps on the anniversary of the night .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 43]: It may be only a newspaper , it may be a letter , it may be just a flower -- like the man in _ The Prisoner of Zenda _ sent to the princess , but it will be _ something _ !
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 34]: He may n't sign his name or give his address , but he will want you to know -- he will feel you ought to know that he is alive and remembering . ''
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 9]: Oh , the beauty of a girl confidante !
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 9]: How truly she understands the art of comfort !
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 10]: `` And shall I ever see him again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 8]: `` Yes -- if you both live .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 20]: He will want to see you again more than anything in the world , except paying off his debt .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 20]: When that is done , he will rush straight off to you and say , ` Here I am .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 9]: I have worked hard and kept my promise .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 18]: To-day I can look the whole world in the face , for I owe not any man .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 15]: I have regained my friend and my position , and it is your doing .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 6]: _ You _ saved me !
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 12]: All these years the thought of you has been my inspiration .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 22]: I have lived in the thought of seeing your face again -- ' '' `` Oh , oh , oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 5]: cried Betty , gasping .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 11]: `` And I shall be hideous , Cynthia , hideous !
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 7]: Fancy , I may be thirty !
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 13]: What will he think , when he sees me so changed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 12]: `` He wo n't mind a bit -- they never do .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 26]: He will say , ` Though worn and haggard , you are still in my eyes the most beautiful woman in the world ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 3]: cried Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 60]: And then , being only eighteen -- nearly eighteen -- each girl suddenly descended from her high horse , and went off into peal after peal of laughter , merry , heart-whole laughter , which floated to Mrs Alliot 's ears as she lay on her couch in the drawing-room , and brought a smile to her pale face .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 12]: This new friendship was doing great things for her lonely girl !
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 33]: Towards the end of the Christmas holidays the great news circulated that Mrs Vanburgh was coming home , and bringing her two younger sisters for a few weeks ' shopping in town .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 22]: Agatha and Christabel had just returned from two years ' sojourn abroad , and were presumably `` finished '' young ladies .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 29]: Cynthia and Betty wondered how much finished , and whether finished enough to look down with contempt upon unfinished damsels still undergoing the thraldom of `` classes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 47]: It was a thrilling occasion when they were bidden to tea `` to meet my sisters , '' and Betty felt she would hardly have had courage to face the ordeal but for the fact of a new blouse and that fascinating buckle on her belt .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 40]: She had a sensation of being all arms and legs -- a horrible , almost forgotten remnant of schoolroom days -- as she crossed Mrs Vanburgh 's drawing-room to be introduced to the two strange figures on the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 61]: One was dark and one was fair ; both possessed a wonderful wealth of beautiful glossy hair , gold in the one case , in the other brown , rolling back from the brow in upstanding pompadours , which were , however , more picturesque than stiff , and rolled into coil after coil at the back of the neck .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 11]: Done-up hair -- that was very `` finished '' indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 31]: Both were distinctly good-looking , and the younger , though the smaller of the two , possessed a personality which at once seemed to constitute her mistress of the ceremonies .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 39]: Both were perfectly at ease , and so full of conversation that they talked both at the same time , emphasising every second or third word after a quaint fashion of their own which Betty found very amusing .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 8]: They were fear-fully pleased to see her .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 12]: They had heard such _ reams _ about her from Nan .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 11]: It was so charming for Nan to have girl friends .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 8]: Nan was _ devoted _ to girls .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 12]: It was such _ sport _ to be staying with Nan .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 12]: They had been simply _ dying _ to live in town .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 13]: My dear , they had not a _ rag _ to wear !
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 7]: Nobody wore decent clothes in Germany .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 8]: Frumps , my dear , per-fect frumps !
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 7]: They were on their own allowance .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 7]: Was Betty on her own allowance ?
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 3]: Lucky girl !
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 21]: It was simply _ agonising _ to have to buy _ everything _ you needed on a quarter 's allowance .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 12]: They had lain awake for _ hours _ considering the problem .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 7]: They were in _ despair _ !
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 10]: Nan had given them each a dress for Christmas .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 7]: Nan was an _ angel _ !
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 15]: They wanted Nan to give a dance for them while they were in town .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 23]: Betty 's heart leapt , but Mrs Vanburgh shook her head , and said -- `` Sorry , but Nan ca n't !
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 22]: Mother would n't like it , as you have only just left school , and are not properly out yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 12]: `` Well , I shall _ leak _ out , then !
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 14]: I am not going to wait another year , if I know it .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 26]: There 's a dance coming on at home in February , and I 'm going to it , or my name is not Christabel Rendell .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 28]: I 'm going to buy a dress and all the _ et-ceteras _ , and then mother wo n't have the _ heart _ to say No .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 20]: Nan , if you wo n't give us a dance , what _ are _ you going to do ?
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 16]: You ca n't be so mean as to provide _ no _ evening jollification ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 6]: `` My dear , remembah !
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 7]: You were a girl yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 20]: echoed Agatha , in deep - toned remonstrance , and then they began rattling out a list of suggestions .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 12]: `` Tableaux -- '' `` Progressive games -- '' `` Dinner-party .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 4]: No old fogies !
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 7]: We will choose the guests . ''
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 5]: `` Music and conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 11]: You do the music , and we 'll converse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 10]: `` General frolic , and supper to finish up .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 12]: If it develops into a dance , so much the better !
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 12]: It 's not coming out to dance on a carpet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 18]: `` Really , Nan , it 's piteous to think how _ stodgy _ you have grown !
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 6]: Married sisters are a delusion .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 29]: We used to imagine coming to stay , and doing whatever we liked , and eating all sorts of indigestible things that we may n't have at home .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 24]: But now Maud can think of nothing but that baby , and you are so prim -- too fearfully prim for words . ''
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 4]: `` Prim ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 4]: shouted Mrs Vanburgh .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 15]: There is really no other word to express the outraged indignation of her tone .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 23]: To hear her , one might have supposed it the greatest insult in the world to be accused of primness of demeanour .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 15]: `` You dare to sit there and call me names in my own house !
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 14]: If I am prim , you had better go home and leave me .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 12]: I would n't stay any longer , if I 'm prim .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 12]: I 'm sorry I asked you , if I 'm prim .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 14]: If I 'm prim , I wonder why you ever wanted to come .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 4]: Prim , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 24]: If it 's prim to know what is correct and what is not , it 's a pity you are not prim too !
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 14]: If I 'm prim , I wo n't give any party at all .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 29]: You had better sit round the fire and knit stockings , and I 'll read aloud _ The Old Helmet _ , as I 'm so prim . ''
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 11]: Christabel raised her hands to her ears in affected distraction .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 13]: `` Stop her , somebody -- stop her for pity 's sake !
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 15]: When she is once wound up like this she will go on for hours !
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 13]: My dear , I crawl , I _ grovel _ before you !
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 7]: You are _ not _ prim !
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 8]: Nothing is further removed from your character .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 14]: You are going to give us as many parties as we like . ''
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 5]: said Mrs Vanburgh shortly .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 23]: She was by no means appeased , and during the meal which followed ejaculations of `` Prim -- prim , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 31]: fell from her lips at intervals like so many minute-guns of indignation , while Christabel ate cakes and scones with undiminished zest , and smiled upon her with patronising indulgence .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 28]: In relating the history of the afternoon to Jill , later on , Betty declared that she herself had not spoken a single sentence the whole afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 8]: She had exclaimed , `` Really ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 4]: `` Fancy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 4]: `` Goodness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 5]: `` How killing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 48]: each about a hundred times over , had laughed and smiled , nodded her head and said `` Yes '' to a dozen propositions , had been unceasingly amused and interested , but had never been allowed a breathing space in which to air her own opinions .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 51]: It had been finally decided that `` a general frolic '' should be held on the following Thursday evening , Christabel proposing , seconding , and triumphantly carrying the resolution that each guest should come prepared to entertain the company for a period of at least five minutes on end .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 18]: The protesting groans and denials of her companions beat in vain against the rock of her decision .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 12]: She smiled graciously upon them , and cried -- `` Rubbish !
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 7]: Of _ course _ you can !
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 36]: Sing , play , dance , recite , read aloud , tell a story , show some new tricks ; there 's no _ end _ to the things to choose from , my deah !
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 20]: If you begin by protesting and excusing as you are doing now , there will be no time left .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 10]: It will be too lovelay for _ words _ !
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 13]: A sit-down supper , Nan , -- no light refreshments , please !
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 20]: -- and , as a matter of precaution , as much furniture as possible moved out of the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 13]: I ca n't think why you did not have a parquet floor !
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 11]: People grow so selfish and inconsiderate when they are married .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 9]: _ Piteous _ , I call it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 5]: `` Anything else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 4]: queried Nan loftily .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 12]: `` Selfish , and inconsiderate , and prim , am I ?
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 4]: Prim , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 17]: I 'll tell Gervase the moment he comes in what a wretched wife he has married !
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 10]: He 'd never find it out for himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 3]: THE PARTY .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 15]: `` She may request as much as she likes ; I 'm not going !
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 12]: I would n't go if I were paid for it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 45]: was Miles ' ungallant comment upon receipt of Mrs Vanburgh 's invitation ; but before he had time to pen his refusal , Cynthia , in her new character of mentor , issued her regal decree that it should be turned into an acceptance .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 15]: In vain he grumbled and protested ; the silken chains never relaxed their hold .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 4]: `` Hate parties !
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 6]: Senseless waste of time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 16]: `` It would be kind of you to help to make it more profitable . ''
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 27]: `` I 've no parlour tricks -- and do n't see the fun of making a performing bear of myself among a lot of strangers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 16]: `` It would be bearish to refuse , and allow your sisters to go alone !
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 12]: I 've always longed for a brother to take me about .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 10]: A nice man is always considerate to girls . ''
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 3]: Miles grunted .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 16]: `` If I did go , they would n't speak to me all the evening !
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 9]: I never know what to say to strangers .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 11]: I should have to sit in a corner by myself .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 27]: There 'll be a crowd of girls -- you , and Betty , and Mrs Vanburgh 's sisters , and who knows how many more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 8]: Cynthia bowed her head in stately salute .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 16]: `` You would not be ungallant enough to insinuate that there could be too many !
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 16]: It will be your proud privilege to introduce a masculine element into the assembly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 20]: `` It likewise appears probable to me that Mrs Vanburgh may know a few nice men besides yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 22]: Betty would have said `` boys , '' Cynthia knew better , and reaped her reward in Miles ' wavering air .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 15]: `` Could n't entertain a party for one minute , let alone ten . ''
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 13]: `` We will go into partnership then , and do it together !
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 6]: Ten minutes instead of five .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 10]: We 'll be confederates , and show them tricks .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 18]: I know a lovely one about telling the time from the position of a poker -- no !
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 12]: How silly I am , I always give away the secret !
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 11]: You tell a _ card _ , not the hour .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 5]: It 's quite easy .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 46]: You have an imaginary clock face on the hearthrug ; twelve o'clock is the fire , and you lay the poker on the rug with the point on the number you want -- one , two , three and so on , up to queen .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 19]: For king , you simply hold it in your hand , which puzzles them more than ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 7]: `` What about the suits ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 8]: `` Oh , that 's quite easy .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 39]: When the person outside comes in , he must notice first of all how his confederate is looking ; to the left means hearts ; to the right , diamonds ; upwards , clubs ; downward , spades .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 7]: It 's really a lovely trick .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 16]: We 'll rehearse it , and I 'm sure you must know many more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 12]: `` I know some balancing tips , -- Georgia Magnet business .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 15]: You might be the Magnetic Lady , and I 'd be the showman . ''
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 7]: `` Oh , lovely , lovely !
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 6]: Could you teach me really ?
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 23]: Could I lift up a table with two or three men sitting on it , like you see in the advertisements ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 14]: cried Cynthia fervently , and though Miles replied , `` Rather not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 29]: he condescended to state one or two less strenuous feats which she might safely accomplish , and even to put her through a preliminary drilling on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 5]: The battle was won !
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 19]: For the next week Mrs Vanburgh 's party was the one subject of discussion with the Trevor sisters .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 77]: Betty was agitated on the subject of her dress , and being denied a new sash , subsided into gloom for the space of ten minutes , when with a sudden turn of the wheel a mental picture was presented of a ship ploughing across the seas , bearing a lonely emigrant to his difficult task , when it became , all of a sudden , contemptible beyond words to fret oneself about -- a ribbon !
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 28]: As she herself had said , having once come face to face with tragedy , her eyes were opened to the petty nature of her own trials .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 21]: She ironed and pressed , and viewing the shabby bows and insufficient ends , said bravely : `` Who cares ?
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 12]: It will be all the same in a hundred years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 24]: Jill wished to know exactly how late the party would be kept up , and if there was to be a sit-down supper .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 14]: `` I loathe ` light refreshments ' like we have at breaks up .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 9]: Bitter lemonade and sangwidges -- who wants sangwidges ?
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 27]: I like to sit down , and have courses , and stay as long as you like , and crackers , with things in them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 30]: When asked how she proposed to amuse the company when her turn came round , she shrugged her shoulders , and replied , `` Have n't the faintest idea !
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 16]: Shall think of something , I suppose , '' in true Jill-like , happy-go-lucky fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 26]: Pam sat glued to the window , and kept an unerring record of everything which entered the Vanburgh house for two days before the fray .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 43]: Baskets from the fruiterer 's , trays from the confectioner 's ; mysterious paper boxes from the Stores ; flowers from the florist 's ; they were all registered in her accurate little brain , and described at length to her sisters .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 11]: `` Could n't you bring me back somefing nice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 4]: she pleaded wistfully .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 18]: `` Sweets -- or a cracker -- or a very pretty cake with icing on it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 10]: -- and though Betty proved adamant , Jill succumbed .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 15]: `` What are pouches for if you ca n't carry things in them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 3]: she demanded .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 9]: `` My party body has a huge pouch .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 21]: I 'll bring you samples , Pam , and if there are enough , we 'll share them together ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 40]: When the great night arrived , Miles was decidedly short as to temper , but he looked so tall and imposing in his dress suit , that Cynthia 's designation of `` man '' seemed nothing but his due .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 48]: Like all male beings , he seemed to regard the behaviour of his tie and shirt front as the only things of importance in the universe , and so completely engrossed was he thereby that he had only an absent , `` Oh , all right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 13]: to return to Betty 's anxious inquiries as to her own appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 31]: They crossed the road together , three ungainly-looking figures in ulsters and snow-shoes , and were admitted to the Vanburgh hall , which was instinct with the air of festivity .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 62]: Flowers everywhere , plants banked up in the background , attentive servants to wave you forward ; more servants to greet you at the head of the staircase , to help you to unwrap in the bedroom , and make you feel ashamed that your tweed coat was not an opera mantle , like the charming specimens displayed on the bed !
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 30]: In the drawing-room quite a number of guests were assembled , and Miles was relieved to discover that he was by no means the only member of his sex .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 28]: Betty 's first shyness died away as Christabel smiled at her across the room , and patted the empty seat by her side with an inviting gesture .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 38]: She looked very charming and imposing in her evening dress , but when Betty ventured to admire it she was informed that it was `` A rag , my dear -- a prehistoric _ rag _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 37]: and warned that at any moment the worn-out fabric might be expected to fly asunder , when `` As you love me , fling yourself upon me , and _ hurl _ me from the room !
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 8]: My entertainment comes on last of all .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 28]: I arranged it so for a special reason , '' Christabel explained , with the _ grande dame _ air which was one of her chief characteristics .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 19]: `` We are to draw lots for the rest , so that there shall be no favouritism . ''
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 20]: Presently the lots were drawn , and who should draw number one but Jill , the casual and unprepared !
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 39]: Betty blushed for her , and felt a wild longing to creep beneath the grand piano , but Jill herself laughed , and went forward to seat herself on a chair facing the whole assembly with undisturbed composure .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 39]: Everyone stared at her , and she stared back , dropping her head on one side , and screwing up her saucy nose with a transparent pretence of embarrassment , which aroused the first laugh of the evening .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 26]: Everybody was amused and interested , and ready to be pleased , so that the announcement , `` I 'm going to ask riddles ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 20]: instead of falling flat , as might have been expected , was received with quite a burst of applause .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 108]: And there she sat asking riddles -- venerable old chestnuts for the most part , and the marvel of it was that it was a most lively performance , for the orthodox answers were mischievously replaced by newer and more amusing editions , and one person after another would cry , `` That reminds me -- do you know what is the difference , '' etcetera , etcetera , so that presently everyone was asking riddles and catches , and really good ones into the bargain , and it was only after fifteen minutes had elapsed that Jill retired from her post beneath a hurricane of applause .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 10]: Happy Jill , it was her birthright to charm !
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 12]: It seemed impossible that she should ever do the wrong thing .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 31]: When it came to Betty 's turn she played conscientiously through the Sonata Pathetique , with which she had been wrestling for two hours a day for the last month .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 73]: That very morning she had played it over without a single fault , and really and truly the runs had sounded quite professional ; but when your head throbs , and your cheeks burn , and your heart pounds , and your feet grow cold , and your fingers are hot , and stick together , and refuse to do what they are told , it is wonderful how differently things sound !
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 3]: Poor Sonata !
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 34]: It really _ was _ rather pathetic , and it is to be feared that the audience was almost as much relieved as was Betty herself , when it came to an end .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 49]: The Magnetic Lady performance was a great success , Miles as showman being an agreeable surprise to his relations , for if he were not discursive , he was at least perfectly composed and business-like , and the poker trick and balancing feats were alike marvellous and perplexing .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 32]: Agatha recounted a story of a haunted castle , and of a ghost which was not a ghost at all , but simply a gentleman 's bath-gown hung on a nail .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 32]: The plot was decidedly thin , but the audience found amusement in the quaint and truly Rendell-like phraseology in which it was presented , and in the lavish use of italics .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 31]: Poor crushed Betty congratulated Agatha on her success , and Agatha rolled her eyes , and cried tragically -- `` My dear -- I nearly _ expired _ with embarrassment !
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 8]: I was _ purple _ with agitation .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 19]: As a candid friend , tell me truly -- _ has _ it spread to my nose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 51]: Somebody recited ; someone sang a song ; somebody introduced a new game ; somebody showed card tricks ; a budding artist took lightning portraits of host and hostess and a few of the leading guests , and presently supper was announced before Christabel had had time for her turn .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 4]: `` Never mind !
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 7]: It will be even better afterwards !
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 32]: I intended it to be afterwards , '' she said , smiling mysteriously , as she was led down to supper by the oldest and most important man in the room .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 51]: Miles eagerly appropriated Cynthia , and Betty 's partner was one Mr Ned Rendell , the only brother of the houseful of girls , a somewhat lofty and self - satisfied gentleman , who let her see that he considered her a mere child more plainly than was altogether polite .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 47]: Not being possessed of Jill 's youthful love of good things to eat , she was thankful when it was time to return to the drawing-room , where Christabel was already awaiting her turn , with an eagerness which had been lacking in any other performer .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 15]: `` Put your chairs against the wall , please -- quite against the wall !
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 24]: I need all the room I can get , '' she directed , waving her hands to right and left in masterful fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 5]: `` That 's better !
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 6]: Move that table , please .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 9]: I do n't want to knock it down .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 8]: I shall want someone to help me .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 9]: Mr Ross , will you be so kind ?
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 9]: We must have a musical accompaniment , too .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 11]: A little slow music -- Agatha knows what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 7]: Begin at once , please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 23]: A meaning glance passed between the sisters as Agatha obediently seated herself on the piano-stool and struck up -- a waltz tune !
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 4]: When , presto !
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 30]: Christabel and her partner were whirling round the room , while she laughed a merry defiance at Nan , and nodded to the assembled guests to follow her example .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 24]: In a trice the floor was covered with dancers , and for the rest of the evening no other amusement had a chance .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 7]: Christabel had her way after all !
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 16]: It was safe to predict that Christabel generally _ would _ get her own way .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 55]: It was in the middle of the final Sir Roger , just as she was curtseying in the centre of the two long lines , that Jill 's pouch played her false , and a meringue , a sausage roll , and a couple of crackers fell on the ground in a sticky heap .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 33]: Betty wished that the ground would open and swallow her up , and even Jill had the grace to blush , but Mrs Vanburgh came to the rescue with truly delightful understanding .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 9]: `` Oh -- oh , what a pity !
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 14]: You were taking them home for the children -- I always did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 4]: she cried sympathetically .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 15]: `` Bring a shovel , Gervase , please , and take away the crumbs .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 19]: You should have smuggled them into the bedroom , Jill -- that 's how _ I _ managed .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 6]: Now then , partner ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 30]: and off she went , dancing down the line , and setting everybody else going , so that it was impossible to dwell any longer on the tragic discovery .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 31]: Never since the creation of the world , Jill decided , had there lived anyone more deliciously suitable to play the part of hostess to an assembly of young people !
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINETEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 4]: A STRANGE MEETING .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 36]: Time passes rapidly to the young and light-hearted , and winter fogs had given place to blue skies and flowering trees before -- as Jill expressed it -- one could say `` Jack Robinson . ''
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 33]: Miles was finishing his course of study , and had so distinguished himself above his fellows that there was little doubt that a good opening would be offered to him ere long .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 48]: Dr Trevor was very proud of his clever son , but the mother 's face took on a wistful expression as she looked round the table at her assembled family , and realised that the time was close at hand for the stirring up of the nest .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 25]: She was unusually indulgent during those spring months , as if she could not find it in her heart to deny any possible pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 8]: `` We shall not long be together .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 14]: Miles will be going away , and after then -- who knows ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 5]: she told herself sadly .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 28]: `` Once children begin to grow up and go out into the world , one can never be sure of meeting again as a complete family circle .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 9]: Let them be happy while they may ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 34]: So those spring months saw an unusual succession of gaieties in the doctor 's shabby house , in the shape of merry , informal gatherings , which went far to cement newly-made friendships .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 30]: Agatha and Christabel Rendell returned home , only to be succeeded by the remaining three sisters of the family , who proved quite as interesting in their various ways .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 35]: Dear good Maud was as sweet and placid as her own fat baby , while Elsie was an intense young person , quite different from anyone else whom Betty and Cynthia had ever encountered .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 27]: Her hair was parted in the middle and brushed smoothly over her ears ; she wore quaintly unfashionable garments , and -- thrilling item of interest !
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 24]: -- was engaged to be married to a sub-editor of a magazine , who was reported to be even more intense than herself .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 57]: Elsie disdained the ordinary sign of betrothal ; a ring , she explained to the astonished girls , was a badge of servitude to which no self-respecting woman should submit , and she wore in its place a gold locket , bearing strange cabalistic signs , the meaning of which the beholders vainly yearned to discover .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 46]: With regard to the future , Elsie and her editor announced their intention of living `` the higher life '' -- a high-sounding phrase which was not a little impressive , until one heard the details thereof , which scarcely appealed to the ordinary imagination .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 75]: They were going to subsist on a diet of bread and nuts , a regime which did away at one fell swoop with the need of such superfluities as cook and kitchen ; they would have no curtains nor draperies , as woollens harbour microbes ; no wall-papers , as papers exude poisons ; no ornaments , since it was a sin to waste the precious hours in dusting what was of no use .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 28]: What they _ were _ going to have , soon became the question in the minds of the anxious hearers , while `` Poor old Elsie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 6]: cried Nan Vanburgh , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 20]: `` I give her a month before I am taken for a day 's hard shopping at Maple 's !
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 23]: She rides her hobbies so violently that they collapse of sheer exhaustion before she has time to put them into practice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 35]: In the matter of conversation , Elsie swayed between the high-flown and the natural , sometimes chatting away in ordinary commonplace fashion , at other times confounding her hearers by weird and mysterious utterances .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 14]: `` Have you ever felt the intense meaning in _ colour _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 24]: she demanded one day , at the end of a silence during which she had been gazing into the heart of the fire .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 23]: Betty stared aghast , but Cynthia , with finer humour , smiled demurely , and replied -- `` Of blues -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 27]: I feel it horribly at times , '' whereupon , being a Rendell , Elsie descended promptly from her high horse , and chuckled with enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 29]: After Elsie appeared Lilias -- a vision of beauty and elegance , but far too grown-up and superior to care for the society of chits in the schoolroom .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 53]: Her visit was a round of gaiety , for she did not care for quiet home evenings , but she never seemed really satisfied nor pleased , and there was always a `` but '' or an `` if '' at the end of her description of the last day 's doings .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 15]: Nan looked at her with troubled eyes , and her `` Poor Lilias ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 13]: had a very different ring from the `` Poor old Elsie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 10]: which was after all only a pretence at pity .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 43]: Cynthia 's prophecy had been fulfilled , for at the end of January Betty had received from America a copy of the _ New York Herald _ , with the significant letter `` R '' printed on a corner of the wrapper .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 37]: Her friend of the fog had evidently possessed himself of her full name and address before leaving town , and now wished her to know that he had safely reached the scene of his future labours .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 7]: How carefully that wrapper was preserved !
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 23]: How diligently it was searched for further messages , long after it had been definitely concluded that no such message could exist !
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 35]: Betty considered the handwriting the most manly and distinctive that she had ever beheld ; and Cynthia , without going so far , was still prepared to read in it all the desired meanings .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 16]: `` The letters are joined together ; that means sequence of thought and mental ability .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 12]: The line rises at the end ; that shows proper ambition .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 11]: There are power and success written in every stroke ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 5]: `` Dear Cynthia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 4]: sighed Betty ardently .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 6]: `` How clever you are !
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 6]: You are always right . ''
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 19]: As for Jack , he was working , absolutely working hard , instead of playing with his tasks .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 30]: The redoubtable Johnson was constrained to take a second place in the class as a permanency nowadays , and hopes of the scholarship grew apace in the parental heart .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 61]: Jack did not appreciate home references to his newly-developed industry , and , so strange and unaccountable a thing is schoolboy nature , that when Betty injudiciously remarked on his `` goodness , '' he `` slacked it '' of intent for a whole week , just to have the satisfaction of telling her of his descent in the class .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 31]: Not for all the riches in the world would he have explained the real reason for the change , but those three words , `` the Captain 's orders ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 24]: rang in his ears like a battle-cry , and the voice within gave him no peace if he did less than his best .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 4]: Poor General Digby !
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 60]: It seemed hard that he should be denied the exquisite satisfaction of knowing what good he had been the means of working ; but , though Jack 's lips were sealed on this point , he showed an appreciation of that gentleman 's company and an affectionate forethought for his comfort which were very comforting to a lonely bachelor .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 40]: It became a habit to drop in at the flat for a cup of tea and half an hour 's chat on the way home from school , and to accompany the General for a walk on Sunday afternoons .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 62]: Dr and Mrs Trevor were pleased that the boy should be brought so much in contact with a man for whom their admiration and respect increased more and more with better acquaintance , for the General 's faults were all on the surface , and behind the loud voice and irascible mien were hidden a child-like faith and purity of heart .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 9]: And then one day an extraordinary thing happened !
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 41]: Talk of story-books , as Betty said , -- talk of three volume novels , -- talk of a whole circulating library at once , and never , no never , could you think of anything more exciting or romantic !
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 24]: Mrs Trevor had invited Miss Beveridge to spend Sunday at Number 1 , in response to a plaintive appeal from her eldest daughter .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 46]: `` She weighs on my mind like a lump of lead , for I know Mrs Vanburgh thinks I 'm mean never to have asked her here , but I really ca n't contend with her alone , she is so frightfully snubbing and superior .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 31]: If you would let her come some Sunday when everyone is at home , and you are not busy all the time , we could take turns at entertaining her .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 14]: I 'd love you for ever and ever if you only would ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 10]: `` Well -- it 's a big bribe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 6]: said Mrs Trevor , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 11]: `` Yes , by all means ask her to come .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 19]: I shall be very glad to welcome her any Sunday , if she seems to enjoy coming . ''
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 9]: `` Oh , she wo n't do that .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 8]: She has n't any enjoying power left .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 8]: It 's all taught out of her .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 31]: I do n't believe she could feel anything if she tried , '' quoth Miss Betty in her wisdom , and was fated to see the folly of her words .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 24]: Mrs Trevor was pouring out tea in the drawing-room at a little table set almost beneath the shadow of Pam 's branching palm .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 37]: Miss Beveridge was sitting bolt upright in an easy-chair , looking as if she were accustomed to be uncomfortable , and uncomfortable she was determined to be , in spite of all conspiracies to the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 22]: She wore a severe black dress , and her iron-grey hair was brushed back from her face with almost painful neatness .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 48]: Betty looked from one to the other as she handed round cakes and scones , and wondered if her mother was really years and years younger than Miss Beveridge , or if she only looked it because she was pretty and dainty , and happy at heart .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 22]: Miss Beveridge had beautiful features , but the listless gloom of her expression spoiled what beauty she might still have possessed .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 58]: Nan 's persistent efforts had to some extent thawed the icy barrier of reserve , but in a strange atmosphere it seemed to have frozen even harder than before , so that Mrs Trevor was devoutly thankful for the arrival of the tea-tray , and wondered no more at Betty 's unwillingness to tackle this silent visitor .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 14]: And then the door opened , and Jack 's cheery voice was heard .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 14]: `` Hallo , mother , here 's a friend come to tea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 45]: he announced , and the next moment the whole atmosphere of the room was changed , as the General 's big form hobbled forward , the big red face smiled its big kind smile , and the big voice boomed out a thunderous greeting .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 5]: `` Afternoon , madam !
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 5]: Afternoon , Lady Betty !
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 9]: This boy tempted me , and I fell .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 12]: What 's this I hear about hot muffins and apricot jam ?
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 24]: When I was a nipper there was no boy in the length of Ireland that could beat Terence Digby at a muffin struggle .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 6]: Where 's my friend Jill ?
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 3]: Plain Jill !
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 4]: Eh , what ?
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 20]: No , my dear -- I said to her -- that , at least , you never can be .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 8]: That 's taken out of your power !
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 6]: Where 's Miss Pussy Pam ?
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 11]: I ca n't see you all in this half light .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 22]: Very picturesque for young eyes , madam , but when you get old like me you 'll be thankful for electricity .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 2]: Eh !
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 5]: Who 's this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 23]: He had caught a glimpse of the figure in the easy-chair , and , wheeling suddenly round , stared full at it .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 6]: Stared , and grew silent .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 17]: And Miss Beveridge stared back , and her eyes looked big , big , and oh !
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 5]: So dark and deep .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 41]: And her lips worked as if she were going to speak , and a red spot came out on each cheek , and she was not Miss Beveridge any longer , but someone whom the onlookers had never seen before .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 16]: The General 's figure seemed to stiffen , his bent shoulders straightened and broadened out .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 8]: He stretched out his right hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 5]: _ Alice _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 11]: he said , and his voice was soft and breathless .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 12]: One could hardly imagine it could be General Digby 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 3]: `` Alice !
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 5]: Is that you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 11]: She put her hand in his , and nodded dumbly .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 63]: Mrs Trevor rattled her teacups , questioned Jack volubly as to his walk -- frowning at Betty to second her efforts , and so leave the two old friends undisturbed ; but it was beyond girl nature to resist sly peeps , and if one 's ears were made sharp by nature , how could one help hearing odd scraps of conversation ?
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 11]: `` And you have been living in London for years ?
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 17]: You are not -- '' a glance at the ringless hand -- `` not married then ?
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 7]: I always thought you would marry .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 8]: ... You will give me your address .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 9]: I must not lose sight of you again .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 6]: -- A Governesses ' Home .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 5]: Oh , Alice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 14]: ... General Digby had no appetite for muffins and apricot jam that afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 27]: His fierce old face worked strangely as he sat with the untasted tea in his hands , his glassy eyes were for once moist and tender .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 68]: As for Miss Beveridge , the flush died away from her cheeks , leaving her looking even more worn and grey than before , and Betty , looking at her , was conscious of a sudden tender outgoing of the heart , a longing to help and comfort , such as had inspired Nan Vanburgh months before , but after which she herself had striven in vain .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 14]: This was evidently a meeting of old lovers parted by some untoward fate .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 12]: Ah , poor soul , and it had come too late !
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 21]: Youth and health , and joy and beauty , had all paid toll to the long years as they passed .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 20]: How shocked and pained the General must be , to meet his love in such a sadly different guise !
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 12]: It was not possible he could care for her any more .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 14]: Better not to have met , and to have preserved the old illusion .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 8]: `` I 'll be nice to her !
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 16]: I thought she had been born old , but she has been young after all .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 7]: I will be nice to her .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 8]: I 'll try to make up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 6]: said Betty pitifully to herself .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWENTY .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 3]: A TETE-A-TETE .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 53]: Half an hour later , when Betty escorted the General to the door , he paused in the hall to lay his hand on her arm , and inquire in a voice unusually tremulous -- `` You have often spoken to me about your ` Govies , ' as you call them .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 12]: Was -- was _ She _ one of the number ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 16]: Betty murmured an assent , guiltily conscious of the criticisms which had accompanied the references .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 24]: Was he about to take her to task for all the scathing remarks she had made on the subject of his old love ?
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 28]: But no -- the grip tightened on her arm , and he said gently -- `` God bless you , my dear , for all your kindness !
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 17]: May it be meted out to you a hundred times over in your hour of need .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 8]: A Governesses ' Home -- Alice Beveridge !
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 10]: And Terence Digby living in the lap of luxury !
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 4]: Well , well !
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 23]: Twenty years , my dear , since we last met -- I was over forty , but she was a mere girl .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 19]: A beautiful girl , -- I never saw her equal , and the years have not touched her .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 7]: I should have known her anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 6]: She is marvellously unchanged ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 44]: Betty gazed at him dumbly , and there came to her at that moment , for the first time in her life , a realisation of the deep , abiding love which sees beneath the surface , and knows neither change nor time .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 22]: She had no inclination to laugh at the old man 's blindness ; rather she felt towards him reverence and admiration .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 4]: Happy Miss Beveridge !
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 15]: To one loyal heart at least she would remain always young , always beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 11]: Happy Terence Digby , who had kept his ideal untouched !
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 43]: When Betty retraced her steps to the drawing-room a few minutes later , another surprise was in waiting , for behold , Miss Beveridge sobbing , with her hands over her face , while Mrs Trevor patted her tenderly on the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 14]: She looked across the room and shook her head at her young daughter .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 9]: `` Go away , Betty dear , please !
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 30]: Leave us alone , '' she said gently , and Betty tottered across the hall and collapsed in a heap on the nearest chair , positively faint with excitement .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 16]: The first real romance with which she had come in contact , -- and behold !
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 10]: The leading characters were General Digby and Miss Beveridge !
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 5]: Wonders would never cease !
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 22]: The next afternoon the General appeared once more , and had a long _ tete - a-tete _ with Mrs Trevor .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 53]: `` I am sorry to be such a trouble to you , madam , but you have no one to blame but yourself , for you have been so patient and forbearing with me during the last six months , that I feel as if there were no limits to your kindness .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 33]: I went to that Governesses ' Home to-day -- for that matter I passed it half a dozen times , but I could not screw up my courage to do any more .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 12]: The look of the place daunted me , to begin with .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 9]: To think of Alice Beveridge shut up there !
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 27]: Besides , I 'm a soldier ; my life has been spent among men ; I have n't the pluck to face a houseful of women .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 13]: Be a good angel , and let us meet here once more !
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 23]: I was too much overcome yesterday to know what I was saying , but something must be done , and done quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 19]: I ca n't go on living as I am , and think of her working for her living .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 10]: Of course , you know what it all means .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 15]: You are a woman , and women are quick enough at guessing these things .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 7]: I never cared for another woman .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 37]: I was a middle-aged man when we met , and it went very hard with me when she said Number 1 was not a boy , to forget at the sight of the next pretty face .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 17]: I have tried to make the best of things , but it 's been lonely work .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 16]: I went abroad immediately after she refused me , and heard no more about her .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 10]: She was visiting a common friend when we met .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 18]: I knew nothing of her family , so we simply passed out of each other 's lives .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 50]: I always thought of her as happily married years ago ; it never dawned upon me that there could have been any misunderstanding , but yesterday when we met there was something in her face , her manner -- She seemed almost as much agitated as I was myself .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 32]: I may be a conceited old idiot , but it seemed to me as if she _ had _ cared after all , -- as if there had been some mistake !
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 11]: Women talk to each other more openly than we do .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 17]: If she told you anything about it , I think you ought to let me know .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 8]: I have waited a long time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 31]: There was a pathos in the sound of those last few words which went straight to Mrs Trevor 's heart , and she answered as frankly as he had spoken .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 15]: `` Yes , indeed , it has been a hard time for you both .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 44]: Miss Beveridge quite broke down after you left last night , and I gathered from what she said that at the time of your proposal she was taken by surprise , and felt nervous and uncertain of herself , as girls often do .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 36]: It was only after you had sailed , and she was at home again , that she realised what a blank your absence made , and knew that she had loved you all the time .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 14]: She hoped you might write , or see her on your return . ''
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 16]: `` But she had not the courage to write herself , and acknowledge her mistake ?
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 4]: Well , well !
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 20]: Women have their own code of honour , I suppose , but it would have been a gracious act .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 43]: I remembered her always , but it did not seem to me the straight thing to force myself on a girl half my age , who had already refused me once , and so we have gone on misunderstanding all these years .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 6]: Then I suppose trouble began ?
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 20]: Her people were not rich , but she had a comfortable home , so far as I knew . ''
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 15]: `` The parents died , and she was obliged to earn her own living .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 14]: She has been teaching music in London for the last fifteen years . ''
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 4]: The General groaned .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 4]: `` I know !
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 3]: I know !
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 19]: Dragging about in all weathers , to earn a few shillings for hearing wretched brats strumming five-finger exercises .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 14]: Beg pardon , ma'am -- I should not have said that to you !
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 8]: You have children of your own . ''
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 13]: `` But I do not in the least envy their music-mistress ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 6]: cried Mrs Trevor , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 26]: `` It is a hard , hard life , especially when it is a case of going back to an Institution instead of a home .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 20]: It is young Mrs Vanburgh , Betty 's friend , to whom you are really indebted for this meeting .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 23]: It was her idea to welcome lonely gentlewomen to her home , and Miss Beveridge happened to be her first visitor . ''
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 6]: `` God bless her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 5]: said the General reverently .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 21]: He sat in silence for some minutes , gazing dreamily before him , a puzzled look on the red face .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 16]: At last -- `` Now there 's the question of the future to consider ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 4]: he said anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 35]: `` I 'm getting old -- sixty-four next birthday , precious near the allotted span of life , but she is twenty years younger -- she may have a long life before her still .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 37]: It would break my heart to let her go on working , but she 'd be too proud to take money from me , unless -- unless -- Mrs Trevor , you are a sensible woman !
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 11]: I can trust you to give me a candid answer .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 28]: Would you consider me a madman if I asked the girl a second time to marry me , old as I am , gouty as I am ?
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 23]: Is it too late , or can you imagine it possible that she might still care to take me in hand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 27]: He looked across the room as he spoke with a pathetic eagerness in his glance , and Mrs Trevor 's answering smile was full of tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 5]: `` Indeed I can !
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 45]: I should not think you a madman at all , General , for I am old enough to know that the heart does not age with the body , and that the happiness which comes late in life is sometimes the sweetest of all .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 28]: You are a hale man still , in spite of your gout , and with a wife to care for you , you might renew your youth .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 26]: I hope and believe that all will go well this time , but let me advise you not to be in too great a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 31]: Twenty years is a long time , and you and Miss Beveridge have led such very different lives that you may find that there is little sympathy left between you .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 31]: It is only a ` may , ' but I do think you would do well to see more of each other before speaking of anything so serious as marriage .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 16]: You shall have plenty of opportunity of seeing each other , I promise you that !
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 37]: I will invite Miss Beveridge to spend as much of her time with us as is possible , and you shall be left alone to renew your acquaintance , and learn to know each other afresh .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 12]: That will be the wisest plan , will it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 6]: `` Um -- um ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 5]: grunted the General vaguely .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 23]: He frowned and looked crestfallen , for he retained enough of his youthful impetuosity to make anything like delay distinctly a trial .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 21]: `` Perhaps you are right , though I can not believe that any number of years could change my feelings .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 5]: Alice is -- Alice !
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 10]: The one woman in the world I ever loved .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 22]: That 's the beginning and the end of the matter , but perhaps for her sake I should not be hasty .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 9]: Must n't frighten her again , poor girl !
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 42]: That 's arranged , then , ma'am -- you let us meet in your house , and if we live , we 'll try to pay you back for your goodness , and I 'll wait -- two or three weeks .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 15]: You would n't wish me to wait longer than two or three weeks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 26]: He put up his hand and raked his grey locks into a fierce , upstanding crest , while a curious embarrassment flashed across his face .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 5]: `` A married man ?
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 4]: Terence Digby married !
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 12]: There 's only one thing I 'm afraid of -- Johnson !
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 11]: What will Johnson say to a woman in possession ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 49]: Mrs Trevor laughed , but could give no reply , and presently the General took himself off , and left her to write an invitation for the next week - end to his old love , which was accepted in a grateful little note by return of post .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 49]: For three nights running did the General dine at Dr Trevor 's table , while Miss Beveridge sat beside him , with pathetic little bows of lace pinned in the front of her shabby black silk , which somehow looked shabbier than ever for the attempt at decoration .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 153]: At the beginning of the meal she was just Miss Beveridge , stiff , silent , colourless ; but as time passed by and she talked to the General , and the General talked to her , attending to her little wants as if they were of all things in the world the most important , fussing about a draught that might possibly distress her , and violently kicking his opposite neighbour in his endeavours to provide her with a footstool , gradually , gradually the Miss Beveridge of the music-lessons and the Governesses ' Home disappeared from sight , and there appeared in her place an absolutely different woman , with a sweet smiling face , out of which the lines seemed to have been miraculously smoothed away , while a delicate colour in her cheeks gave to the once grey face something of the fragile beauty of an old pastel .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 57]: For fifteen years she had fought a hand-to-hand battle with want ; a lonely battle , with no one to care or to comfort , and now it was meat , and drink , and health , and sunshine , to find herself of a sudden the most precious object on earth to one faithful heart !
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 70]: Although the General had given a promise not to be too precipitate in his wooing , it was easy to prophesy how things would end ; but before the `` two or three weeks '' had come to an end , another event happened of such supreme importance to the Trevor household as to put in the background every other subject , interesting and romantic though it might be .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 3]: TRYING DAYS .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 42]: One May afternoon Miles came home with the news that , through the influence of an engineering friend , he had been offered a post in connection with a new railway which the ever-increasing mining industry in Mexico had rendered necessary .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 13]: The salary proposed was a handsome one for so young a man .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 28]: He owed the offer entirely to Mr Owen 's good offices , and would be required to sail as soon as his outfit could be got together .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 26]: Dr Trevor rejoiced in his son 's success , and warmly congratulated him on having had so short a time to wait for an opening .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 47]: He took a man 's view of life , and felt that it was time that Miles faced the world on his own account ; but the youth faded out of the mother 's face as she sat in her corner and listened to the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 4]: `` Luck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 42]: They called it luck that Miles , her darling , should be sent to the other side of the world , to a wild , dare-devil country , the very name of which conjured up a dozen thrilling tales of adventure .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 8]: `` A five years ' appointment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 10]: The words rang like a knell in her ears !
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 50]: Of course , she had known all along that a separation must come , but she had hoped against hope that an opening might be found somewhere within the borders of the United Kingdom , when she would still be able to feel within reach in case of need .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 24]: Now it was indeed good-bye , since it must at best be a matter of years before she could hope for another meeting .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 17]: Oh , this stirring up of the nest , how it tears the mother 's heart !
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 45]: Mrs Trevor looked across the room to where Miles stood , almost as tall and broad as the doctor himself , and her thoughts flew back to the time when he was a little curly-headed boy who vowed he would never leave his mother .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 15]: `` I wo n't never get married , '' he had announced one day .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 7]: `` You shall be my wife .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 24]: You are daddy 's wife , and I do n't see why you should n't be wife to both your darlin 's ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 33]: Another day -- `` I 'll stay with you all my life , and when you 're a nold , nold woman I 'll wheel you about in a Barf chair . ''
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 36]: Later on had come the time when the first dawning of future responsibility began to weigh on the childish mind -- `` I ca n't sink how I can ever make pennies like daddy does !
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 16]: I ca n't write proper letters like grown-ups do , only the printed ones ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 29]: he had sighed , and she had bidden him be a good boy and do his best for the day , leaving the future in God 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 9]: `` God will give you your work ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 35]: she had told him ; and how she and his father had rejoiced together when his absorption in a box of tools , and his ingenuity therewith , had pointed out a congenial career .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 52]: She had prayed and trusted for guidance in bringing up this dear son , and that being so , she must now believe that the offered post was the right thing , and that the distant land was just the very spot of all others where God wished him to be .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 30]: When Miles turned to his mother , she had a smile in readiness for him , and if it were rather tremulous , it was none the less sweet .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 47]: She would not allow herself to break down , but threw herself heart and soul into a study of the Stores ' list , which could not be delayed another day , seeing that it was suggested that Miles should sail in a week 's time .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 3]: A week !
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 4]: Only one week !
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 23]: Was it really possible that the following day was the last Sunday which would see a united family circle round the table ?
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 37]: Every female member of the household shed tears on their pillows that evening , and Betty was convinced that she had lain awake all night long , because she had actually heard the clock strike one .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 42]: Mrs Trevor 's vigil was real , not imaginary , and she was thankful when it was time to get up , and get ready for that quiet early service at church which would be her best preparation for the week .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 34]: Her hard-worked husband was sleeping soundly , and she would not waken him , but a feeling of unusual sadness and loneliness oppressed her as she made her way through the silent house .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 37]: She had depended so much on her big strong boy , had grown into the habit of consulting him on many matters , in which , by helping her , he could save his father trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 6]: That was all over now .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 10]: She must learn to do without Miles ' aid !
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 36]: And then suddenly from behind the dining-room door a big figure stepped forward to meet her , and Miles ' voice said , in half-shamefaced tones -- `` I thought -- I 'd come too !
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 8]: I thought we 'd go together ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 6]: `` Oh , Miles ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 47]: cried his mother , and could say no more , but her heart leapt with thankfulness for all that that action meant -- for this sign that her boy was anxious to dedicate himself afresh to Christ 's service at the beginning of his new life .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 36]: She passed her hand through his arm , and they went out of the house together , unconscious of the presence of a third figure which had looked down at them from an upper landing .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 52]: Betty had awakened to fresh tears , and , hearing her mother stirring , had hurried into her clothes , so as to accompany her to church ; but in the very act of slipping downstairs Miles ' voice had arrested her , and she had drawn back into the shadow .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 47]: The Betty of a year ago would have continued her course unabashed ; the Betty of to-day divined with a new humility that her presence would mar the sacredness of that last Communion of mother and son , and turned back quietly to her own room .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 4]: The days flew .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 29]: The first mornings were spent at the Stores , choosing , ordering , and fitting ; the afternoons in marking and packing the different possessions as they arrived .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 23]: Then there were farewell visits to be paid , and to receive , and a score of letters and presents to acknowledge .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 36]: Relations turned up trumps , and sent contributions towards the outfit in money and in kind ; the General presented a handsome double-barrelled fowling-piece , which thrilled Miles with delight and his mother with horror .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 22]: Miss Beveridge gave a `` housewife '' stocked with all sorts of mending materials -- fancy Miles darning his own socks !
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 21]: -- and Cynthia Alliot sent across a case containing one of the most perfect quarter-plate cameras that ever was seen .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 12]: `` When this you see , Send snaps to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 18]: was inscribed on the inner wrapping , which Miles quietly folded and put away in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 26]: He would not need the camera or any external aid to help him to remember his mentor of the golden hair and sweet grey eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 43]: Cynthia came over very often those last few days , and diffused a little fun into the gathering gloom by constituting herself Miles ' sewing - mistress , and sitting over him in sternest fashion while he fumbled clumsily at his task .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 49]: Rumour had it that she even rapped his knuckles with the scissors when he took up half a dozen threads at once in his second darn ; and even Mrs Trevor was obliged to laugh at her imitation of Miles ' grimaces when trying to thread a needle .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 40]: In the end Pam was made happy by being commissioned to thread dozens of needles with long black and white threads , and then stick them in a special needle-book , with their tails twisted neatly round and round .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 12]: As for Cynthia , she revelled in her position as instructress .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 25]: `` I 've suffered so much myself , that it is simply lovely to turn the tables on someone else , '' she announced .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 16]: `` I am going to see this business through in a proper and well-regulated fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 22]: Now that the technical course is finished , you are going to be put through a _ viva voce _ examination .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 18]: Sit down in front of the work-basket , and answer without any shuffling or trying to escape .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 3]: Now then !
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 9]: Distinguish between a darning-needle and a bodkin . ''
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 35]: She nipped up Mrs Trevor 's spectacles from a side-table , as she spoke , perched them on the end of her nose , and stared over them with an assumption of great severity .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 4]: Miles grinned complacently .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 4]: `` Easy enough .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 9]: One pricks and the other does n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 6]: `` A very superficial reply !
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 13]: To what separate and distinctive duties would you apply the two ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 70]: `` Would n't apply them at all if I had my way , '' began the pupil daringly , but a flash of his mistress 's eye recalled him promptly to order , and he added hastily , `` One you use to darn things up with , and the other to drag strings through tunnel sort of businesses , and bring them out at the other side . ''
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 7]: `` No engineering terms , please !
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 14]: Your matter is correct , but the manner leaves much to be desired .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 32]: Question number two is -- Which thread would you use to affix -LRB- a -RRB- a shirt , -LRB- b -RRB- a boot , -LRB- c -RRB- a waistcoat button ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 58]: `` The first that came handy , '' replied Miles recklessly , whereupon Pam squealed with dismay , and was for labelling all her needles forthwith , but Cynthia rapped sternly on the table , and would have each bobbin brought out in turn , and so carefully examined that its qualities could not easily be forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 27]: Then , and only then , would she consent to pass on to the third question , which concerned itself with the vexed question of darning .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 25]: `` Three , State clearly , and in sequence , the steps necessary for repairing a hole in the sole of your sock . ''
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 9]: Miles shrugged his shoulders with a despairing gesture .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 65]: `` Oh , if you mean how a woman does it , -- drag the old thing tightly over your left arm , so that you have only one hand to work with , fill your needle with a silly stuff that breaks if you look at it , and begin see - sawing away half a mile from the scene of the accident .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 34]: Stick at it until you have pulled off most of the skin on your fingers , and then turn it round and start the whole thing over again , the other way round .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 12]: Then walk about and get a blister on your heel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 23]: The audience sputtered with laughter at this eloquent description , but Cynthia gazed down her nose with an expression of contemptuous disgust .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 17]: `` And how many blisters would you have if you did not mend it , pray ?
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 11]: May I suggest that you make the experiment and see ?
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 8]: No marks at all for that answer !
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 16]: Question number four is , Work a buttonhole on the accompanying strip of linen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 5]: But here Miles struck .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 24]: No power on earth , he declared , would induce him to attempt to `` festoon '' a hole in the accepted fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 17]: `` When I want one I 'll make it with the nearest implement that comes handy .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 10]: There are always my teeth as a last resource .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 16]: It 's silly nonsense cutting out a hole and immediately proceeding to sew it up !
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 14]: Time enough for that when it begins to split -- '' `` Plucked !
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 4]: Hopelessly plucked ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 9]: cried Cynthia , rolling her eyes in dismay .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 29]: Then the spectacles dropped off her nose , and she joined in the general laughter , and forgot her role of mentor for the rest of the evening .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 32]: But it was not only in the matter of amusement that Cynthia made herself invaluable during those last trying days ; she seemed ever on the watch for opportunities of service .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 23]: If anything was overlooked or late in delivery , she was ready to drive to the shop , and bring it home .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 55]: She invited Pam to lunch and tea , thereby setting her elders free and keeping the child happy and occupied , and she steadily refused to accompany Miles and Betty on any of their expeditions , thereby earning her friend 's undying gratitude , though perhaps Miles himself was less appreciative of her self-denial .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 40]: Her turn for a quiet word came only on the last day of all , when Miles accompanied her for the few yards which intervened between the two houses , and stood on the doorstep to wish her farewell .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 18]: His face was white , and his words came out with even more than the usual difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 19]: `` It 's been -- a jolly good thing for me -- knowing you for these last months .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 7]: You 've been -- a help !
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 21]: If I ever turn out anything of a man -- it will be a good deal -- your doing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 10]: Cynthia stared at him with her beautiful grave eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 4]: `` Mine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 5]: she cried in amazement .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 5]: `` Oh , why ?
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 6]: What have I done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 7]: `` You 've been yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 4]: said Miles gruffly .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 4]: `` Good-bye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 17]: He held out his big hand , and Cynthia 's little fingers closed tightly round it .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 5]: `` Good-bye , Miles !
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 10]: I wo n't forget , '' she said simply .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 18]: And with those words ringing in his ears Miles Trevor sailed away to begin his new life .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 5]: THE GENERAL 'S WOOING .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 13]: Tears and lamentations made up the story of the next few days .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 8]: `` When 's the washing coming home ?
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 17]: I 've cried out all my handkerchiefs , and I get scolded if I sniff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 56]: grumbled red-eyed Jill on the evening of the third day after Miles ' departure ; and it appeared that most members of the family found themselves in the same predicament , for the first break in the family circle is a painful experience , especially when its members are as devoted as were the Trevors .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 25]: It was a relief to all to watch the progress of the General 's wooing , and to have his genial presence among them .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 50]: Now that the evenings were beginning to be really summer-like , he and Miss Beveridge would adjourn to the Square Gardens after dinner , and sit on a bench not far removed from that historic spot where he had fallen a victim to the twins ' love of adventure .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 61]: As a rule , so soon as dusk approached , Miss Beveridge would take an omnibus and return to her `` Home , '' while the General would step stiffly into a cab and return to his flat , where the faithful Johnson was no doubt wondering what had happened to induce such young habits in his once stay-at-home master .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 34]: One night , however , instead of separating as usual , they returned to Number 1 , and the first glance at their faces showed that the _ denouement _ had been reached .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 23]: The General was red , Miss Beveridge was white ; he was voluble with excitement , she was too excited to speak .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 40]: Mrs Trevor read the signs of the times , and thoughtfully led the way to the drawing-room , so that the formal announcement of the engagement could be made away from the somewhat embarrassing scrutiny of the young people .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 12]: `` Alice has promised to let me take care of her !
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 7]: Congratulate me , my dear madam .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 10]: I am the happiest man in the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 5]: cried the excited Irishman .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 17]: `` We have wasted enough time , but we are not going to waste any more .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 7]: ` Haste to the wedding ! '
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 6]: -- that 's our motto .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 2]: What ?
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 5]: Alice talks about clothes .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 6]: Fiddlesticks , I tell her !
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 23]: We can buy the finest dress in London in half an hour 's time , or my name 's not Terence Digby .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 6]: Then she talks about pupils .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 8]: Pack of rubbish , I tell her !
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 19]: There are fifty women in London wanting to give lessons , for every pupil who wants to learn .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 17]: Let someone else hear the ` nid , nid , nodding ' for a change ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 24]: -LRB- This last was a dark reference to the Scotch air with which poor Pam had been wrestling for weeks past . -RRB- ''
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 6]: ` A June wedding ! '
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 32]: Always said I 'd be married in June if I had the chance , and it 's a poor thing if I ca n't have my way after waiting twenty years .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 10]: Do n't like July -- nasty , treacherous month !
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 12]: Best way to spend it is a honeymoon in the country .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 2]: What ?
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 10]: You 'll tell the boys and girls , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 7]: Tell them after we 've gone .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 8]: Too bashful to stand the racket to-night !
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 8]: Besides , there 's Johnson to face .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 8]: Bit of a pill to face Johnson .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 2]: What ?
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 22]: Do n't know what he 'll say to a mistress , but it will be all right when he sees Alice .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 9]: Alice will get over him fast enough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 45]: It was charming to see the look of proud admiration which he cast at his _ fiancee _ ; charming to see her changed and softened mien ; charming to see the smile of complete and happy confidence which was exchanged between the two .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 30]: For the first time for many days the weight of depression lifted from Mrs Trevor 's heart , and she forgot Miles ' departure in rejoicing in their joy .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 34]: Her face had its old bright look as she re-entered the study to tell the news to her children , who , truth to tell , were not too sympathetic in their reception .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 24]: The three elders were , of course , more or less prepared for the announcement , but Pam gasped in shocked surprise . ''
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 5]: _ Married _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 4]: she cried shrilly .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 7]: `` But they are so old !
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 16]: What 's the good of being married , and having all the bother for nothing ?
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 8]: They 'll be dead so soon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 7]: `` It 's an awful fag .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 28]: It wo n't be half so much sport going to tea , '' commented Jill with outspoken selfishness , while Jack shrugged his shoulders and grimaced disapproval .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 25]: `` Got everything he wants -- rattling good food , all his relics and things around him , and Johnson to save all bother .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 11]: Ca n't think why he could n't be satisfied ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 22]: Only Betty was silent , her heart warming with a tender sympathy over the story of an old and loyal love .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 31]: Miss Beveridge was quite , quite old , over forty , and her hair was grey , yet the General called her a girl , and thought her beautiful still .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 9]: Somehow the thought had a direct personal comfort .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 15]: Other people might feel the same ; and thirty -- thirty was comparatively young !
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 50]: The next day the General was taken in state to call upon Nan Vanburgh , who had heard from Betty which way the wind was blowing , but had , of course , been obliged to preserve an unconscious demeanour until the engagement was a _ fait accompli _ .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 16]: `` Under Providence , madam , I am indebted to you for this happiness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 67]: cried the General , bowing over her hand in his courtly old-world fashion ; and Nan looked at him with what her friends called `` the shiny look '' in her eyes , and said , in the honest , big-girl fashion which she never seemed to outgrow -- `` And I am so happy that you are happy that I could just jump for joy !
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 11]: It 's a perfectly beautiful ending to my Saturday afternoons .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 19]: I 'm only a little bit jealous that Mrs Trevor has had you to herself all this time .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 6]: Now it 's my turn !
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 5]: What about the wedding ?
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 7]: Where is it to take place ?
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 11]: Are you perhaps going to some relation 's house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 20]: Neither of us owns anyone very near and dear , so we prefer to stay quietly in town . ''
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 9]: `` Then it must certainly be from here !
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 14]: You could n't dream of being married from the Home , Miss Beveridge !
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 36]: Come to me a few days before , and I 'll be your tire-woman , and help to get everything ready , and you shall have a nice breakfast and invite all your friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 6]: But here the General interfered .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 5]: `` No , no !
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 4]: No breakfast ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 25]: `` None the less grateful to you , madam , but fuss and speechifying do n't come naturally to a man of my age .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 26]: I want to get my wife to myself as soon as possible , so we 'll make a bolt of it from the church door .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 14]: Capital plan , though , to stay with you for a bit before .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 2]: What ?
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 11]: You 'd like that , Alice , would n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 7]: Need someone to fix your fal-lals .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 2]: What ?
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 27]: Another debt of gratitude , madam , which we will hope to repay , God willing , when we settle down in our new home . ''
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 48]: Miss Beveridge gratefully accepted Nan 's invitation , but when she went a step further and offered to assist in the choice of the wedding-dress , it appeared that the bridegroom had decided views of his own on the subject , and had already made his selection .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 6]: `` She must wear blue !
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 10]: Says it ought to be grey at her age !
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 13]: Her age , indeed , as if she were an elderly woman !
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 28]: She was wearing blue when I saw her first , and she 's going to be married in blue , or I 'll know the reason why !
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 18]: Blue dress , and a hat with blue feathers ; and those Trevor lassies shall be bridesmaids .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 9]: Must have bridesmaids , however quiet it is .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 2]: What ?
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 25]: Besides , I owe them something , and it will be an excuse to give them their kit -- white muslin and blue ribbons .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 24]: That 's how young girls used to dress when I was a lad , and I 've never seen anything to touch it .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 11]: There will be no trouble about the dresses , madam .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 6]: I 've decided all that .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 28]: You just tell me the name of a dressmaker -- a tip-top dressmaker , mind you -- and we 'll send in the order at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 28]: The bride-elect turned to her friend with a somewhat horrified expression , but Nan flashed a reassuring smile , and adroitly turned the subject in another direction .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 6]: `` Do n't worry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 16]: she whispered , the first time that there was an opportunity for a quiet word .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 17]: `` The General shall have his way , and everything shall be charming into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 11]: I know of a dressmaker who could make sackcloth elegant .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 24]: She will manufacture even the hat with blue feathers , so that you will never have had anything so becoming in your life .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 13]: Fortunately the General does not confine you to one shade of blue .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 26]: And the muslins and blue ribbons will be wonderful filmy creations , as different from the Early Victorian stiffnesses as anything you can possibly imagine .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 7]: How Betty will enjoy herself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 3]: Betty did !
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 40]: In all the course of her eighteen years , it was the first occasion on which she had been provided with an outfit with no regard to money , but simply to what would be prettiest and most becoming .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 76]: The dress , the hat , the shoes , the gloves , the basket of pale-hued roses , were all perfect of their kind , and , to crown all , on the morning of the wedding there arrived two small morocco boxes , which , being opened , displayed two miniature gold watches , encircled with turquoise , and provided with blue enamel bows , by which they could be attached to the dress .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 14]: Jill 's whoops of delight might have been heard half-way across the Square .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 25]: There seemed nothing left to wish for in life , now that the long-dreamed-of `` real gold '' watch was actually in her grasp .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 61]: And so Terence Digby took Alice Beveridge to wife , for better for worse , for richer for poorer , in sickness and in health , till death did them part ; and more than one spectator prayed fervently that the hour of separation should be long delayed , so that the reunited lovers might enjoy a peaceful golden summer .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 54]: They drove away from the church door , and when the bride thrust her blue-feathered toque out of the window to smile a radiant farewell , Nan Vanburgh nodded her pretty head at Betty , and cried triumphantly -- `` Now behold for yourself what miracles love and home and appreciation can work !
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 43]: That was Miss Beveridge once on a time , and you called her a frump and a fright , but the _ real _ woman was that charming Mrs Digby , and the magician 's wand has brought her to life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 5]: A BUNDLE OF LETTERS .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 8]: _ Miles Trevor to his Mother _ .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 11]: Dearest Mater , -- A merry Christmas to you all !
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 39]: I can hardly believe it is nearly four years since I said good-bye and came out here , though there are times , when I am down on my luck , when it seems more like a hundred .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 39]: One does n't have much time for moping during the day , but the evenings are the trying times , when one wonders what on earth made him such an idiot as to leave the dear old country .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 25]: In saner moments I 'm precious glad I did , for I should n't have had half the chance of getting on at home .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 26]: The manager went off for a holiday last week and left me in charge , and I 'm thankful to say all has gone well .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 22]: It was my chance of showing what I could do , and I was determined to make the most of it .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 28]: All the same , I am sorry at times that I did not go in for mining , as I once thought of doing , you remember .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 11]: My chum Gerard is going ahead at a great rate .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 29]: He came out here without a penny , and has simply worked his way through the different processes in the big Aladdin Mine with which we are connected .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 41]: He took the most profitable stages first , and when he had saved up a little money went in for the ones which paid least , until he had a real practical working knowledge of everything from start to finish .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 63]: Of course he had had no training at home , or this would not have been necessary , but as he is a beggar to work , and a genius at making other people work too , he has risen to the post of sub-manager , and as soon as he has saved enough money is going prospecting on his own account .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 43]: He has promised me a share in his gold-mine when it is discovered , and you may trust Gerard to find one if it is in existence , so you may see us home together some fine day to float our company .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 18]: The sooner it comes the better , or everything and everyone will be changed out of knowledge !
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 32]: It is beyond my imaginative powers to think of Jill as a young lady with her hair up , and Jack at Oxford , and Betty `` an old maid . ''
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 19]: -LRB- There 's not much of the old maid about that photograph she sent out last mail ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 22]: All the fellows admire it tremendously , and it gives quite an air of beauty and fashion to my little cabin .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 22]: I never thought Betty would turn out so pretty , but there 's no denying that she looks a lot older .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 11]: Tell Pam not to grow up if she loves me !
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 14]: I want to find _ someone _ the same as when I left !
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 31]: Glad to hear the General and Mrs Digby are still happy and satisfied with each other , and that pretty Mrs , Vanburgh 's little boy is all right again .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 14]: Remember me to them , and to Cynthia Alliot when you see her .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 4]: Is she well ?
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 7]: You have not mentioned her lately .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 29]: Many thanks to father for the papers ; you can hardly imagine how welcome they are out here , or how eagerly one looks forward to mail days .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 13]: Tell that lazy Jill to write to a fellow now and then .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 15]: She shall have no nuggets out of my El Dorado if she does n't .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 7]: Yes , I 'm all right !
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 8]: Do n't worry about me , dear .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 27]: I had a bit of a breakdown a month or two ago , but Gerard nursed me almost as well as you could have done yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 10]: He is the best chum a man could have .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 14]: Love to everybody , and most of all to yourself , dearest mater .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 7]: -- From your son , Miles .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 9]: _ Betty Trevor to her Brother Miles _ .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 24]: Dearest old Lad , -- I missed the last mail , so I must send you an extra long scrawl to make up .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 10]: Thanks so much for your last batch of photographs .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 27]: I am glad you marked the names on the back , for really it is difficult to believe that that ferocious-looking bearded person is really you !
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 25]: I am glad you have promised to shave it off before you come home , for -- honestly speaking -- it 's not becoming !
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 22]: Mr Gerard looks just a shade less disreputable than yourself , but I like him because he is nice to you .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 8]: You can give him my kind regards .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 36]: I 've had ever such a good time since I wrote last , staying with the Rendell girls -- Nan Vanburgh 's sisters , you know , whom you met at that first historic party .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 20]: They are dears , and so amusing that it 's as good as a play to be with them .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 21]: Elsie is married , and Lilias , the beauty , is engaged -- to a clergyman , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 33]: Everyone is surprised , for she has always been rather selfish and worldly , and cared only for people who were rich and grand , and Mr Ross is not like that .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 67]: He is rather old , nearly forty , I think , and rather delicate , and very grave , and not a bit well off , and he thinks Lilias a miracle of goodness and sweetness , and the nice part is that she really _ is _ growing nicer , because she likes him so much , and does n't want him to be disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 36]: They are all awfully pleased , and Agatha and Christabel think it will be great sport to be the only girls in the house , and have no elder sister left to rule over them .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 69]: The brother , Ned , is in love with the girls ' great friend , Kitty Maitland , but she snubs him , though the girls say she likes him all the time , and only does it to pay him back for the way he used to snub her as a child , and because he is so conceited that she thinks it will do him good .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 15]: He really _ is _ a good deal spoiled by all those six sisters .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 23]: You see everybody seems to be falling in love and getting married except me , and I shall be an old maid .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 16]: I do n't like anyone , and I do n't like anyone to like me .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 19]: I feel quite angry if anyone pays me the least attention , and yet I 'm lonely inside .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 32]: Oh , Miles , why did you go so far away , and turn into a great bearded stranger , when I wanted you at home to talk to every day ?
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 36]: I hate Mexico , and the valley , and the mine , and `` my chum Gerard '' -- `` my chum Gerard '' most of all , because I 'm so jealous of him .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 14]: What business had he to nurse you , I should like to know !
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 36]: But I pity him , if you were as cross as you used to be when you had a cold in the old days , and had to put your feet into mustard and water !
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 6]: How well I remember it !
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 33]: First the water was too hot , then it was too cold , and in the end there , was no water left in the bath , and the furniture was afloat .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 14]: Jack is not half so _ difficile _ as you used to be !
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 29]: He has grown such a dear old thing , just as merry and mischievous as ever , but so kind , and thoughtful , and nice all round .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 27]: Father is very proud of him , and he is the old General 's special pet , and half lives there when he is at home .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 12]: As for Jill , she is a MINX in capital letters .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 64]: So pretty and gay , and funny and charming , and naughty and nice , and aggravating and coaxing , and lazy and reckless , and altogether different from everybody else , that my poor little nose is quite out of joint , and I heard an impertinent young man speaking of me the other night as `` Jill Trevor 's sister '' !
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 20]: That 's what I have descended to , after all my lofty ambitions -- _ Jill 's sister _ !
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 20]: How furious I should have been in the old days , but now I do n't seem to mind .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 9]: Are you changed very much , old Miles ?
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 14]: Inside , I mean , I 'm not thinking of the horrid beard .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 20]: You are such a reserved person that your letters leave one in ignorance of the real _ you _ .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 13]: `` My chum Gerard '' knows you better than I do nowadays .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 5]: What an awful thought !
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 20]: Life seems so different now from what it did at eighteen , and all one 's ideals are changed .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 55]: I had my usual yearly `` token '' from my friend of the fog this spring -- just a newspaper posted from New York , as before , so that I know he is alive and well , but I long to know more , and sometimes it seems as if I never should .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 31]: Sometimes -- when I am in the blues -- I feel as if that night was the only time in my life when I was really and truly of use .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 21]: I suppose that 's what makes me remember it so well , and think so much of the poor man .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 10]: I can remember his face still -- so distinctly !
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 5]: Poor , poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 13]: Father says it 's more difficult than ever to make money nowadays .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 17]: He may work all his life , and never be able to pay off his debts .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 2]: Cynthia !
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 9]: No ; Cynthia is _ not _ well .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 23]: We did n't tell you before , because it 's horrid to write bad news , and you two were good friends .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 9]: Besides , we hoped she would get better .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 11]: It began six months ago with an attack of influenza .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 20]: She did not seem to throw it off , but grew thin , and coughed -- a horrid cough !
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 33]: They took her away , and did everything they could , but so far she is no better , and I 'm afraid there 's no doubt that her lungs are affected .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 27]: Mrs Alliot is awfully anxious , and so is her father , who has retired now , as you know , and is home for good .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 33]: They have taken her away to the sea , and she lives out of doors , and has a nurse , and everything that can possibly be got to make her better .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 22]: She is very thin , but is quite bright and cheerful , and thinks about everybody in the world but herself .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 31]: They hope she will get better ; she _ must _ get better -- she 's so young , and dear , and lovely , and everything that 's sweet .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 15]: I ca n't tell you what Cynthia has been to me all these years !
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 11]: Pray for her , Miles -- pray _ hard _ !
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 9]: I rend the heavens for Cynthia 's life .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 13]: That 's all , old boy -- I have no more news .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 4]: Bother the nuggets !
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 7]: Come home the instant you can .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 7]: Father does n't believe in gold-mines .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 15]: Do n't let `` my chum Gerard '' lead you into any wild-goose chase !
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 8]: -- Always your lovingest sister , Betty .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 9]: _ From General Digby to Jack Trevor _ .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 19]: My dear Boy , -- If you were my own son -LRB- which I wish you were ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 20]: I could not have felt happier and prouder than I did on the receipt of your letter this morning .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 38]: To hear that you have decided to read for the ministry , and that you attribute the origin of this choice to some chance words of mine uttered years ago -- that is indeed an unexpected joy !
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 43]: This tongue of mine has uttered so many foolish sayings in its time , and got me into so much trouble , that I am thankful beyond expression to know that in this instance it has done some good for a change .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 16]: Thank you , my boy , for giving me the satisfaction of knowing as much .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 13]: I know it is hard for you young fellows to speak out .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 16]: You might easily have kept it to yourself , and left me a poorer man .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 24]: Since you ask my opinion , I 'm convinced that it would be a thousand pities to drop any of your athletic interests .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 33]: I 'd rather advise you to put more grist into them , and come to the front as much as possible ; short , of course , of interfering with your studies .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 65]: When you have a parish of your own , or assist another man in his parish , you will have a big work to do among the boys and young men , and how do you think it will affect _ them _ to hear that you have pulled stroke in your boat , or played for the ` Varsity in football or cricket ?
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 10]: Will they think less of you , or more ?
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 20]: If I know masculine nature , it will give you an immediate influence which scarcely anything else could command .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 52]: They will know you for a man , and a manly man into the bargain , a man who has like interests with themselves , and is not merely a puppet stuck up in the pulpit to babble platitudes , as so many fellows do nowadays -- more shame to them !
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 41]: Play with the young fellows on Saturday ; -- let them feel that you understand and enter into their interests , and my name 's not Terence Digby if your serious words do n't have a tenfold influence on Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 14]: We must have a good talk on this subject when you come home .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 10]: It is one on which I feel very strongly .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 19]: Let me know at any time if you want help as to books , or any other expenses .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 31]: Your father has enough to do with the rest of the family , and it is a pleasure to me to pretend now and again that you belong to me .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 7]: All goes well at Brompton Square .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 9]: Your mother wears well -- a wonderful woman !
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 30]: None of her daughters will ever equal her , though Betty is twice the girl she used to be , and Mademoiselle Jill makes havoc among the young fellows .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 25]: My dear wife looks after me so carefully that my gout is steadily on the decline , and I grow younger year by year .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 11]: Get the right woman for your wife , young fellow !
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 15]: I waited twenty years for mine , and she 's cheap at the price .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 7]: -- Your friend , Terence Digby .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 10]: _ Christabel Rendell to her sister Nan Vanburgh _ .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 58]: Dearest Mops , -- I am in a state of abject collapse after rushing after the beagles yesterday , tearing all over the countryside , and leaping wildly over mountainous barriers , so I think I might as well spend my time writing to you , as you have been hurling reproaches at me for my silence .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 31]: I could n't possibly attempt letters while Betty was here , for we only had a fortnight , and I did n't get through half what I wanted to say .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 31]: We enjoyed having her immensely , she 's a perfect dear , and very pretty when she takes enough trouble , which is n't by any means always the case .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 16]: I read her a severe lecture on the subject , and retrimmed her blue hat .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 9]: I 'm sure you 'll think it improved .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 26]: Talking of hats -- I ca n't understand why I am not a lunatic , after all I 've experienced with my clothes this spring !
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 19]: Agatha and I went to a tailor 's at Hertford and ordered coats and skirts for morning wear .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 50]: She was n't in a hurry for hers , but I was simply panting for mine to take to the Goodmans ' the next Wednesday , so it was arranged that he should rush on with mine , and that I should go over for a fitting on Monday .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 10]: My dear , on Monday I was a wreck !
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 17]: -- toothache in every joint , chattering with cold , and the rain descended in floods .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 77]: I ploughed to the station in a sort of dismal , it - is-my-duty-and-I-must kind of stupor ; sat in the train with Mrs Ellis , who yelled at me the whole time about the Coal Club , and Mary Jane 's little Emma 's mumps ; staggered along the roads to the tailor 's shop , and sat shuddering in his nasty little room with my feet on a slippery oilcloth as cold as ice .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 24]: After about twenty minutes -LRB- it seemed three hours and a half -RRB- -- he came in with a coat over his arm !
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 6]: _ Agatha 's coat _ !
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 4]: I nearly swooned !
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 11]: ... `` Now you do n't say so -- really !
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 4]: Your sister 's ?
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 9]: And I made so sure it was yours !
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 7]: Is n't that curious , now ?
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 34]: I may say I have been in the tailoring trade , man and boy , for a matter of twenty years , an ' I never knew such a thing to occur before !
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 53]: Of course it would n't be any use saying I could make another by Wednesday , for I should only disappoint , but if Miss Hagatha was to run over , such a thing as this hafternoon , she could have ` er 's ` ome in the place of yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 39]: ... I got home _ somehow _ , I do n't know how , for my mind was a blank , fell into bed , and lay prostrate until the next day , when hope revived once more .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 36]: If the worst came to the worst , I was sure of a new voile dress which Miss Green was making , and the old coat and skirt would do very well for the mornings .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 93]: The voile dress promised to be charming , for she really makes very well when she likes ; so I felt restored to equanimity , until at eleven o'clock , behold a small girl , to see Miss C Rendell -- `` Oh , if -- you -- please -- Miss Green -- says -- as -- she 's -- two -- yards -- short -- of -- the -- material -- and -- could -- you -- make -- it -- convenient -- to -- get -- it -- to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 4]: My brain reeled !
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 16]: As soon as I had sufficiently recovered , I rushed round to see her myself .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 18]: `` You _ told _ me you only needed twelve yards , and I got thirteen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 20]: `` Yes , madam , but you see , madam , these guagings run into a deal of material .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 13]: You would n't like them not to be full and ` andsome .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 6]: Just another two yards ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 56]: There was nothing else for it , so I promised to go up to town next morning -LRB- I could n't possibly go that day -RRB- , and impressed upon the wretch to finish the bodice _ first _ , -- as , if necessary , we could do with less trimming on the skirt .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 10]: My dear , the worst is still to come !
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 44]: The shop was _ sold out _ of the shade of voile , and could not get it again , and when I went back to Miss Green , she had finished the _ skirt _ , and had nothing left for sleeves !
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 27]: `` Yes , I remember you _ did _ say do the bodice first , but I thought I 'd be getting on with the guaging .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 9]: Guaging runs into a deal of time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 26]: ... I just lay back , and said to myself , `` Can it be real -- or is it only a terrible nightmare ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 35]: We sat turning over hundreds of dirty old fashion plates , to find out how to make sleeves out of nothing , and they are sights , and I look an owl in them .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 20]: There 's only one comfort -- if my brain has stood such a strain , it will stand anything !
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 18]: Lilias and Mr Ross are really very satisfactory , and considering that she is thirty -LRB- thirty !
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 6]: Is n't it appalling ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 9]: , he is not a bit too old .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 54]: It 's nice to see her look happy and satisfied , and she has been as sweet as sugar ever since , and as pleased as possible with furnishing her little house , which will be quite poky and shabby compared with yours , or Maud 's , or even Elsie 's sanatorium .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 4]: Poor old Lil !
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 15]: I 'm glad she 's going to have a good time , at last .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 17]: I 'm afraid she has felt very `` out of it '' the last few years .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 23]: Old Mr Vanburgh is longing for your next visit , and has his study simply plastered over with portraits of the boy .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 26]: I go to sit with him on wet afternoons , and listen meekly to praises of yourself , which I know to be absolutely undeserved .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 9]: By the way -- is Betty in love ?
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 38]: Never a word could I get out of her , but her indifference to the admiration she got down here -- and she got a good deal -- was quite phenomenal , unless there is something behind !
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 11]: Methinks at times I trace a melancholy in her eye .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 15]: Adieu , my love ; this epistle ought to make up for past delinquencies .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 6]: -- Yours ever , Christabel .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 4]: MILES ' RETURN .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 19]: It was six years after his departure from home when Miles Trevor sailed again for his native land .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 40]: There had been some talk of his return during the previous winter , and bitter indeed had been the disappointment when it was again postponed , and postponed on account of that ubiquitous person `` my chum Gerard . ''
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 51]: The prospecting expedition of Will Gerard and his partner had at last been blessed with success ; -- if reports could be believed , with extraordinary success , for the opinion of the experts who had visited the claim predicted for it an even greater future than the Aladdin itself .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 56]: Between the partners in the venture a sufficient sum had been raised to enable the mine to be `` proved '' by several shafts and cross-cuts , and the analyses of samples produced were so abundantly satisfactory , that there could be no difficulty in obtaining all the money necessary to thoroughly develop the mine .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 56]: Miles was intensely interested in his chum 's prospects , which to a certain extent were coincident with his own , for , according to promise , he had been allowed to buy a share in the land , which , small as it was , might turn out a more profitable investment than engineering .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 49]: It was decided that while one partner stayed on the spot , Miles should fit in his holiday so as to be able to help Gerard with the work of floating a company in England , an arrangement which it was believed would necessitate but a short delay .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 49]: As is invariably the case in these affairs , however , matters took much longer to set in train than had been originally expected , and it was a good six months later before the welcome cablegram was received stating that the travellers were really on their way .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 3]: Six years !
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 16]: Miles was a man of twenty-six , matured by a life of enterprise and adventure .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 42]: Betty admitted with horror to being `` twenty - four next birthday , '' and shivered at the remembrance that six more years would bring her to that dreaded thirty which she had once considered the `` finis '' of life .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 62]: Jack and Jill were twenty , and if he were still a lad , she was a very finished product indeed , the acknowledged belle of her set , with a transparent satisfaction in her own success which would have been called vanity in a less popular person , but which in her case was indulgently voted as yet another charm .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 36]: Pam was fourteen , a lanky schoolgirl , who had outgrown her kitten-like graces , and entered the world of school , where everything -LRB- including the return of a half - forgotten brother ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 40]: was secondary in interest to the strictures of `` Maddie '' on the subject of French verbs , the ambition of some day becoming `` head girl , '' and the daily meetings with her bosom friend Nellie Banks .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 55]: Everyone had grown older ; even little Jerry Vanburgh , who six years before had been by his own account `` a baby angel up in heaven , '' was now a sturdy rascal of four , in man-of-war suits , whose love of fun and frolic was worthy of his mother 's son .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 8]: What would Miles think of them all ?
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 17]: Betty asked herself as she donned her prettiest dress , in preparation for the long-expected hour .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 32]: Would he be prepared for the changes which had taken place , or feel surprised and chilled , perhaps even disappointed , to find his old companions turned into comparative strangers ?
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 11]: He had never had much imagination , dear old lad !
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 26]: -- it would be just like him to come home expecting to find everything looking as if he had left it but a month before .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 17]: Betty leant her arms on the dressing-table and stared scrutinisingly at her reflection in the mirror .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 47]: She had always been a severe judge of her own charms , and now the remembrance of Jill 's sparkling little face made her own appear unnaturally grave and staid ; still , when all was said and done , she looked very _ nice _ !
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 15]: -- the old schoolgirl word came in as ever to fill an awkward place .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 47]: Twenty-four though she undoubtedly was , it was certain that she was prettier than she had been at eighteen , and pink was Miles ' favourite colour -- she had remembered that in buying her new dress , and had chosen it especially for his benefit .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 10]: `` Oh , I hope he 'll like me !
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 8]: He _ must _ like me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 17]: she cried to herself , with a rush of love and longing swelling at her heart .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 27]: How was it that as one grew older , home ceased to be the absolutely complete and satisfying world which it had been in early days ?
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 45]: Why was it that , surrounded with father and mother , and sisters and brothers , all dear and kind and loving , the heart would yet experience a feeling of loneliness , a longing for something too intangible to be put into words ?
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 9]: `` I want something -- _ badly _ !
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 6]: What can it be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 24]: Betty had questioned of herself times and again during the last few years , and the invariable answer had been -- `` Miles !
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 20]: It must be the loss of Miles which I feel more and more , instead of less and less .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 18]: When Miles comes home there will be nothing left to wish for in all the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 20]: And now in an hour , -- in half an hour , Miles would be with her once more !
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 26]: Dr Trevor and Jack had gone to the station to meet him , but his mother and the girls had preferred to wait at home .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 21]: `` So that you can all howl , and hang round his neck at once -- I know you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 5]: Jack had cried teasingly .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 11]: `` Take my advice , and cut short the huggings .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 15]: When fellows have roughed it abroad , they do n't like being mauled ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 14]: -- at which a chorus of feminine indignation had buzzed about his ears .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 5]: `` Mauled , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 4]: Howl , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 11]: They trusted they knew how to behave without his advice !
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 20]: Would it not be well if he allowed Miles himself to say what he did and did not like ?
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 18]: Had he not better rehearse his own conduct , before troubling himself about other people 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 17]: So on , and so on , until Jack fled in dismay , fingers in ears .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 18]: That was the worst of chaffing girls -- they would always insist upon having the last word !
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 52]: Downstairs in the sitting-rooms all was _ en fete _ , the best mats and covers and cushions being exhibited for the benefit of one who would probably never notice their existence , or might even be misguided enough to imagine that chiffon-draped cushions were meant for use , not ornament .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 45]: Flowers were tastefully arrayed in every available position ; the tea-table lacked only the presence of pot and kettle ; Jill had arranged the little curl on her forehead at its most artless and captivating angle -- in a word , preparation was complete !
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 9]: `` Sit down , dears -- sit down !
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 16]: You make me nervous fidgeting about , and -- I 'm nervous enough already ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 24]: said Mrs Trevor tremulously , and her three big daughters obediently sank down on chairs and stared at each other across the room .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 17]: `` I 'm very sorry to say so -- but I 'm _ ill _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 4]: cried Betty tragically .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 5]: `` I feel awful .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 23]: A kind of crawly , creepy -- all -- overish -- sick-swimming-kind - of-feeling -- I think I 'm going to faint !
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 17]: I 'm sorry to alarm you -- '' But no one was in the least alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 17]: Mrs Trevor only smiled feebly , while the other girls expatiated upon even more alarming symptoms .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 13]: `` My heart is going like a sledge-hammer , '' sighed Jill .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 13]: `` I feel every moment as if it might _ burst _ !
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 7]: -- I ca n't see you .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 21]: The air is full of spots -- '' `` I 'm as dizzy as dizzy , '' declared Pam eloquently .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 22]: `` I feel exactly as I did that Wednesday Nellie and I ate chocolates all the afternoon in a hot room .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 13]: If he does n't come soon we 'd better all lie down .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 12]: We could get up again when we heard the bell . ''
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 6]: `` The bell , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 31]: Miles shall not have to ring the bell when he arrives home after six years ' absence , if his mother is alive to open the door for him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 19]: cried Mrs Trevor indignantly , and then suddenly she gave a cry , and rushed across the room .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 12]: A cab laden with luggage had drawn up before the door .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 4]: Miles had arrived !
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 8]: Well , after all Jack was right !
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 11]: They _ did _ all hang round him at once .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 46]: Mrs Trevor was folded in his arms , but Betty and Jill each hung on to a side , while Pam stroked the back of his head , and if they did not exactly `` howl , '' they were certainly by no means dry-eyed .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 4]: `` My boy !
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 4]: My boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 4]: cried the mother .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 8]: `` Miles , oh , Miles ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 27]: sobbed the girls ; and Miles mumbled incoherent answers in his big man 's voice , and quietly but surely pushed his way into the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 21]: _ His _ eyes were shining too , but he had no intention that the passers-by should witness his emotion .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 12]: He looked enormously big and broad , and tanned and important .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 48]: Handsome Miles would never be , but his was a good strong face , with the firmly-set lips and clear , level gaze which speak so eloquently of a man 's character , and his mother thanked God with a full heart as she welcomed him back .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 56]: As for Miles himself , the sight of his mother brought with it a pang of sadness , for though outsiders might exclaim at her youthful appearance , six years on the wrong side of forty can never fail to leave behind them heavy traces , and to the unaccustomed eyes she looked greatly changed .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 18]: He kept his arm round her as they moved forward , and his eyes grew very tender .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 7]: The little mother was growing old !
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 24]: Her hair was quite grey , her pretty cheeks had lost their roundness -- he must take more care of her than ever .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 12]: She enjoyed being cared for , as all nice women did .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 26]: And then Miles sat down and drank tea , and they all settled themselves to the difficult task of making conversation after a long absence .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 49]: It seems sad that it should be difficult , but it is invariably the case , for when there is so much to tell , and to ask , it is difficult to know where to begin , and a certain strangeness follows hard on the first excitement .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 26]: Were these smart young ladies truly and actually Betty and Jill ; this young man with the Oxford drawl the once unkempt and noisy Jack ?
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 22]: And who was this shy and awkward maypole , who had taken the place of dear , cuddlesome , wee Pam ?
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 45]: If it had not been for Dr Trevor , conversation would have halted sadly during the first difficult quarter of an hour , but that gentleman was fortunately free from sentimental embarrassment , and kept the ball rolling by his practical questions and remarks .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 32]: The voyage , it appeared , had been unusually calm and agreeable , and the partners had thoroughly enjoyed the rest after the somewhat worrying work of the last six months .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 30]: Yes , everything was working out splendidly as regards the new mine , and Miles was convinced that only time was necessary to turn it into a huge success .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 25]: Will Gerard would be a millionaire some fine day , or something very like a millionaire , and he would deserve all he got .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 60]: The best fellow and the smartest , and the hardest working , and the truest chum -- In the background saucy Jill dumbly echoed these well-worn sentiments , rolling her eyes ceilingwards , and declaiming with outstretched hands , till Miles , turning suddenly , caught sight of her , and burst into one of his old hearty laughs .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 10]: `` Well , what does that mean , Jill ?
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 9]: What have I said to amuse you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 11]: Jill sparkled at him in her most captivating manner . ''
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 7]: _ Toujours le bon _ Gerard !
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 16]: We have heard so much of this marvel that we are dying to behold him .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 38]: Snap-shots , we know , are not the most flattering medium , so we ought not to judge by the likenesses we have already seen , but he hardly appeals to me as a miracle of beauty !
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 17]: When does he propose to dazzle our eyes by appearing before us in the flesh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 5]: Miles laughed once more .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 16]: `` Not till next week , so you must exercise your patience , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 27]: He has his own people to see , and besides that he has too much tact to intrude upon a fellow 's first days at home .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 22]: Gerard always knows what is the right -- '' He broke off hastily as Jill resumed her silent pantomime of admiration .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 6]: `` Oh , all right !
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 8]: I wo n't praise him any more .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 10]: You can find out his good points for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 25]: If the truth were known , I daresay he is anxious to get a new rig-out before he pays calls on fascinating young ladies .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 22]: We have neither of us a decent coat to our backs , and must go tailor-hunting the first thing to-morrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 10]: We have not had much ladies ' society abroad .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 19]: I expect Gerard will fall headlong in love when he sees you in that blouse , Jill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 6]: `` I expect he will .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 4]: They generally do !
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 6]: But it 's no use .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 8]: I do n't care for Colonials ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 32]: drawled Miss Jill , chin in air , and Miles ' heated repudiation of the term as applied to either his partner or himself failed to move her from her front .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 10]: `` Jill is waiting for Prince Edward of Wales .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 32]: There 's no other unmarried male who comes up to her standpoint , '' said her father , laughing ; and once more Miles marvelled at the changes of the years !
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 58]: When bedtime came , Betty looked shyly at the new Miles , who seemed still more than half a stranger , and felt her heart throb with pleasure as his grasp tightened on her arm , and he said affectionately -- `` Come into my room for a chat , old girl , before you turn in !
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 25]: It wo n't seem like home unless I see you perched on my bed nursing your knees and your grievances at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 7]: Got any grievances nowadays , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 11]: You used generally to have a good stock on hand .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 13]: We 'll have to lay them together while I 'm at home .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 16]: That 's what I want to do -- give you all a rattling good time !
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 13]: It 's what I have looked forward to most in coming home .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 7]: How are things going , really ?
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 3]: Quite well ?
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 20]: No bothers and worries that you have been keeping to yourselves , for fear of making me anxious ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 20]: `` Nothing big , dear -- only the little worries which one must grin and put up with . ''
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 64]: Betty perched herself on the bed , and fell into the old position , while Miles sat down on the chair by the dressing-table , and began unlacing his shoes with the same , oh , the very same gestures which he had used every night during the many long years when this evening conference had been the brightest spot in the day !
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 22]: It was as if time had flashed back for a moment , and they were boy and girl together once more !
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 25]: Betty 's eyes melted in tender rejoicing , and Miles cried heartily -- `` Bet , my dear , you 've grown rattling pretty !
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 11]: You beat Jill into fits when you look like that .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 11]: You must wear that frock when Gerard comes next week .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 6]: It suits you splendidly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 13]: `` I got it for your sake -- not Mr Gerard 's .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 7]: You always liked pink , Miles .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 14]: Oh , I sha n't have any grievances now that you are home .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 14]: I am really and truly far less grumbly than I used to be .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 21]: I have tried hard to make it a duty to be happy , since I discovered -- you know how !
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 16]: -- how imaginary my troubles really were -- but sometimes I have felt very lonely .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 28]: I think one does , as one grows older , for there seem so many things that one ca n't talk about to the best of friends .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 18]: Of course you may not understand the feeling -- you are so devoted to Mr Gerard . ''
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 12]: Miles kicked his shoes in opposite directions -- another old trick !
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 7]: -- and stroked his chin silently .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 24]: The offending beard had disappeared , but the skin was dark with constant shaving , and there were new lines in his face .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 6]: This was a man indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 7]: The boy had disappeared for ever .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 19]: `` I do n't think I should advertise my loneliness even to Gerard , '' he said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 20]: Then , leaning forward and opening a drawer in the dressing - table , `` How is Cynthia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 4]: he queried abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 4]: `` Better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 33]: replied Betty , so quietly that no one would have guessed the leap of excitement which her heart had given at the sound of her friend 's name uttered in this connection .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 9]: `` Very delicate still , but certainly better .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 28]: They live entirely in the country for her sake , and the doctors think that in a year or two she will probably be quite well again .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 14]: Meantime she is treated like an invalid , and we can seldom meet .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 24]: It is n't good for her to chatter , and it is n't supposed to be good for my health to be there .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 9]: I _ ache _ for her , Miles !
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 18]: No one will ever know what it has meant for me to be separated like this . ''
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 9]: Miles sat silently staring at his stockinged feet .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 43]: His eyes were hidden , the heavy moustache covered the lines of his mouth , yet as Betty looked at him she felt a stab of reproach , as if , while pitying herself , she had inadvertently probed a deeper wound .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 7]: Had Miles also ached for Cynthia ?
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 14]: Had the separation from her been the hardest part of his long exile ?
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 24]: She longed to question him on the subject , but the stern , set face gave no encouragement to curiosity , however affectionate .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 13]: `` We are to go down to see her some day soon .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 30]: She was almost as much excited about your coming home as we were ourselves , and we can run down to Franton and back quite easily in the day .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 20]: You wo n't be occupied with business every day while you are at home , will you , Miles ?
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 15]: You will be able to give up some of your time to us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 6]: `` Oh dear , yes .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 28]: This is by way of being a holiday , and I mean to take you girls about , and the mater too , if she will come .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 23]: We must see the mining business in train first , and then we 'll go off somewhere and have a good time .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 23]: I have n't worked for nothing all these years , and the best chance of enjoying myself is to see your enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 44]: Things do n't always work out as we expect -- but we must make the best of what remains -- '' He sighed , and rose from his chair with a gesture which somehow made Betty conscious that he wished to be alone .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 18]: It had been a very short chat , and the impression left was rather sad than cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 25]: She put her arms round Miles ' neck , kissed him fervently , but in silence , and stole away to her own room .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 3]: MR. GERARD .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 53]: Clad in an immaculate frock-coat , with a hat of irreproachable shininess on his head , a flower in his buttonhole , and every detail of his attire correctly up-to-date , `` my chum Gerard '' made his appearance to call at Brompton Square on the Monday afternoon following Miles ' return .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 12]: `` I 've met him a hundred times in Piccadilly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 31]: was Jill 's comment on the stranger , and indeed he had far more the air of a fashionable Londoner than of a miner from the far-off wilds of Mexico .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 53]: As tall as Miles , though of a more slender build , showing in the same eloquent fashion the marks of recent shaving , rather handsome than plain , rather dark than fair , there seemed at first sight little to distinguish him from a hundred other men of the same age .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 40]: On a closer acquaintance , however , a further attraction was found in the grave , steady glance of the eyes , and in a rare smile , lighting up somewhat careworn features into a charming flash of gaiety .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 23]: Mr Gerard was evidently unused to laughter -- with all his sterling qualities Miles could not be described as a humorous companion !
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 16]: -- and the programme of the past years had been all work and no play .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 81]: As he sat in Mrs Trevor 's drawing-room that first afternoon , he listened in a somewhat dazed fashion to the banter which went on between Jack and his sisters ; but after some time had passed his face began to soften , the corners of his mouth twitched , and presently out flashed that delightful , whole-hearted smile , and Betty , meeting it , buried at once and for ever all lingering prejudices against her brother 's friend .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 41]: It was fortunate that Mr Gerard had made a favourable impression on the young people , for , at Miles ' earnest request , he was invited to take up his quarters at Brompton Square for the next few weeks .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 40]: `` His own people live in the country ; he has no friends that he cares about in town , and I hate the thought of him moping alone in an hotel after all he has done for me .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 10]: Besides , we ought to be together just now .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 46]: There will be business to talk over every night until we get this company floated , and if he were not here I should always have to be going over to him -- '' The last argument settled the matter in Mrs Trevor 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 47]: Truth to tell , she was not too anxious to introduce a stranger into her reunited family circle , but if it were easier and more convenient for Miles , and ensured for herself a greater amount of his society , it was impossible to refuse .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 41]: She reaped the reward of merit in a growing liking and admiration for her guest , who was even pathetically grateful for her hospitality , and appreciative of the home atmosphere to which he had so long been a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 60]: Business engrossed the greater part of the time , but there were odd hours of leisure when the girls were suddenly commanded to get ready with all possible speed , and spirited off for an afternoon on the river , or on bicycle expeditions to the country , ending up with an evening meal at some old-fashioned country inn .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 45]: They were treated to concerts also , and to entertainments of all sorts , including welcoming parties at friends ' houses , and when they bemoaned the speedy wearing out of evening dresses , Miles insisted upon providing new ones , regardless of expense .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 27]: `` It 's most grateful and comforting to have a gold-mine in the family , '' cried Jill , making languishing eyes at the senior partner .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 38]: Of course she flirted with him -- Jill flirted with everything in the shape of a man -- monopolising his attention on all occasions in a manner which would have been somewhat trying to most elder sisters .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 9]: `` But I know you do n't mind .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 33]: You like best of all to be with Miles , '' said Jill easily , when some remark of the sort was made , and Betty 's reply held an unexpected tartness .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 9]: `` I do n't mind in the least .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 20]: It is a matter of perfect unconcern to me how Mr Gerard behaves ; but you are my sister .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 21]: I am sorry to see you lowering your dignity , by being so silly , and flighty , and ridiculous !
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 12]: I am sure he must laugh at you in private ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 9]: `` He laughs to my face , dear .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 5]: I amuse him wonderfully .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 13]: He told me yesterday that I was as good as a tonic .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 13]: Such a pity you should bother your poor old head about me !
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 10]: _ I _ understand men , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 11]: The insinuation of that emphasised `` I '' was unmistakable .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 27]: Jill began to hum -- an aggravating habit of hers when she felt the mistress of a situation -- and tripped lightly out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 6]: And Betty sat and thought .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 36]: Burning like a furnace , throbbing in every nerve , shaking her even as she sat , came a sudden fierce heat of anger such as she had not experienced for many a long year .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 53]: She had been accustomed to regard Jill 's flirtation from a mental height of affectionate disdain , to laugh with purest amusement at her assumption of superiority , but now of a sudden indifference had changed to anger and a sore rankling of jealousy , which puzzled as much as it disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 13]: It could not be that she herself coveted Mr Gerard 's attention !
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 59]: Cynthia , Nan Vanburgh , all her friends had remarked times and again upon her indifference to masculine admiration , for , strange as it might seem , that romantic interview in the fog six years before had linked her sympathies so strangely with one man 's lot that she had had none to spare for later comers .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 30]: Under God 's providence she had saved a life , and while those voiceless messengers told of its preservation , it must remain the one supreme interest of life .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 9]: Some day `` Ralph '' would come home .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 22]: Some day he would appear before her to announce his task completed , and to claim her friendship as his reward .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 43]: Her mother pleaded with her not to allow a romantic fancy to ruin her life , pointed out that `` Ralph '' might have married long before now , that even if he returned she might be bitterly disappointed in his identity .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 3]: In vain !
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 5]: Betty could not argue .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 14]: She _ felt _ -- and that was the end of the matter .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 10]: The sympathetic attraction was too strong to be one-sided .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 28]: At the other side of the ocean `` Ralph '' was waiting for her , even as she for him , and the meeting would surely come .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 11]: It might be years hence , but -- marvellous thought !
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 6]: -- it might be to-day .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 12]: Each fresh awakening brought with it a thrill and a hope .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 40]: All these long years had this fantasy lasted ; it was not possible that it was beginning to fade at the sight of a pair of grave grey eyes , at the sound of a man 's deep-toned voice !
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 5]: Betty sat and thought .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 11]: Ten minutes passed , twenty minutes , half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 16]: Jill thrust her head round the corner of the door to give a careless invitation .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 10]: `` I 'm going for a trot before dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 4]: Come along too .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 7]: It will do you good . ''
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 6]: `` No , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 6]: I 'd rather not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 4]: `` Sulking still ?
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 12]: Goodness , I thought you 'd have recovered by this time !
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 5]: Bye-bye , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 10]: Hope you 'll get it over before dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 25]: She was humming again as she made her way to the door , where , no doubt , Mr Gerard waited to accompany her .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 17]: The invitation had been a polite matter of form to which an acceptance was not desired .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 43]: Betty leant her head on the table and lived through a moment of bitterness before the door opened once more , and a voice said -- `` If you are not going out , may I come in for a few minutes ?
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 21]: Miles has not yet -- '' Then , in a tone of startled concern , `` I beg your pardon !
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 5]: I am interrupting you .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 6]: You are in trouble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 8]: Betty straightened herself with a nervous laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 7]: `` Oh , please come in !
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 4]: It 's nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 7]: I only felt rather -- upset .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 12]: Something vexed me , but it 's nothing of any importance .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 7]: Can I do anything for you ?
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 5]: Are you expecting Miles ?
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 9]: He said he would be home quite early .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 7]: Were you going out together ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 20]: `` Yes , we have some calls to pay , but there 's still half an hour to spare .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 11]: He will be up to time , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 6]: Miles is always punctual . ''
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 26]: Mr Gerard seated himself , and looked with concern at Betty 's face , on which the signs of her mental conflict were clearly printed .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 40]: It was almost the first time that they had been alone together , for _ tete-a - tetes _ were of rare occurrence in the doctor 's busy household , and there was a perceptible hesitation on both sides .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 6]: `` No , thank you !
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 19]: You can do nothing for me , but I wish I could help you , '' said Gerard .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 7]: `` Ca n't I pummel somebody ?
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 11]: Miles will tell you I have a good fighting arm .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 34]: If anyone has been annoying you -- '' That made Betty laugh , with a quick wonder as to what Mr Gerard would say if he knew the identity of his proposed opponent .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 8]: `` No , no , thank you !
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 7]: I must fight my own battles .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 14]: As a matter of fact , it 's more temper than anything else .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 7]: I have a most intrusive temper .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 21]: It is always pushing itself forward -- '' She expected the usual polite disclaimer , but it did not come .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 29]: Will Gerard looked at her for a minute , as if thoughtfully weighing her in the balance , and then the delightful irradiating smile passed over his features .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 43]: `` And it is more difficult to fight now than in the old days , when you could let yourself go , have a grand rampage , and trust to time and the aroma of roast chestnuts to make the peace ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 20]: he said mischievously ; and when Betty started in dismay -- `` Oh , I know all about it !
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 14]: The subject of home is very attractive when one is alone in exile .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 18]: I could hardly know more about you if I 'd been a member of your schoolroom party .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 12]: I used to lure Miles on to talk of old days .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 6]: It kept us both occupied .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 44]: Do you remember the occasion when you decided to starve yourself to death , because you imagined that you had been unjustly treated , and then got up in the middle of the first night to raid a cold chop from the larder ?
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 52]: Or the time you vowed vengeance on Miles for cutting off the ends of your hair to make paint brushes , repented after you went to bed , and went to make it up , when he concluded you were playing ghosts , and nearly throttled you as a welcome ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 9]: Betty laughed , undecided between amusement and vexation .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 6]: `` It 's too bad !
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 10]: He seems to have given me away all round .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 15]: If he was going to tell tales , he might have told flattering ones .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 19]: I am sure I was often very nice , or I was always sorry if I was n't .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 23]: I used to roast chestnuts and muffins , and eat oranges and peppermints with the door wide open to lure him back .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 6]: They were dear old days !
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 16]: I am glad he remembered them , but it must have been boring for you .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 14]: Did he -- did he tell you -- more things about me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 5]: `` Many more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 5]: `` Principally about me ?
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 7]: More than about the others ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 7]: `` You were his special chum .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 12]: It was natural that he should speak most of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 8]: `` And -- er -- my letters !
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 7]: Did he read those aloud ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 5]: `` Parts of them .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 16]: I never saw them , of course , except -- '' `` Except when ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 6]: `` When he was ill .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 14]: He could not read himself , and was anxious to hear the news .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 9]: Three letters from you arrived during that time .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 7]: He said it did not matter .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 19]: That there would be no secrets in them -- nothing you would not wish me to know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 33]: Betty flushed , cast an agonised thought back through the years , to try to remember the gist of those three missives , failed completely , and nervously twisted her fingers together .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 21]: `` There was one thing they would show you pretty plainly , which I 'd rather have kept secret . ''
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 4]: `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 4]: `` Myself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 18]: She looked across the room with a flickering glance , and met Will Gerard 's steady gaze .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' he said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 7]: `` They showed me yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 4]: That was all .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 10]: Not another word , either of praise or blame .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 39]: Did he hate her then -- think her altogether flighty and contemptible , or had the letters been by chance good specimens of their number , and did he like them , and think her `` nice '' ?
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 10]: The face told her nothing in its grave impenetrability .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 44]: She felt herself blushing more deeply than ever , rallied all her powers with the determination that she would _ not _ be stupid , and cried gaily -- `` Well , after all , the confidence was not all on one side !
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 6]: We heard enough about you .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 16]: ` My chum Gerard ' has been a household word among us for years past .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 18]: You were such a paragon that we were quite bored with the list of your perfections . ''
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 20]: She raised her hands and began checking off his characteristics on the different fingers in charming , mischievous fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 34]: `` My chum Gerard is so clever , -- so industrious , -- so far-seeing , -- so thoughtful , -- so generous , -- so kind , -- so helpful -- no !
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 13]: I am not going to stop ; I 've not half-finished yet .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 33]: -- All that he does is wise ; all that he tries , succeeds ; all that he has , he shares ; and when he speaks , let no dog bark !
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 33]: When we read about impossible heroes in books we called them ` Gerard ' ; when we wanted to express the acme of perfection , we called a thing ` Gerardy . '
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 27]: Jill read aloud the _ Swiss Family Robinson _ to Pam , and called the good proper papa ` Mr Gerard ' all the way through .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 4]: So now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 6]: `` Now , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 8]: echoed the real Mr Gerard , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 9]: `` You are certainly revenged , Miss Trevor .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 17]: I do n't know anything more trying than to be preceded by an impossibly exaggerated character !
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 9]: The reality is bound to be a disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 38]: Miles has credited me with his own virtues , for in reality I am a very faulty person ; not in the least like that paragon , Robinson Papa , of whom I have a vivid remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 15]: He would have been a useful person out in Mexico , all the same .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 28]: That convenient habit of discovering every necessity for the table or the toilet on the nearest bush would have helped us out of many a dilemma . ''
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 65]: They laughed together over the old-time memory , and then , suddenly sobering , Mr Gerard continued -- `` At any rate , Miss Trevor , the fact remains , that by ` good report or ill , ' even by sight , so far as photographs can reproduce us , we have been intimately acquainted with each other for the last six years .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 7]: Six years is a long time .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 14]: It ought to enable us to meet as friends rather than acquaintances ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 20]: The last sentence was uttered more as a question than a fact , and Betty answered with eager acquiescence .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 11]: `` Oh yes , as friends , quite old friends .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 21]: It is far better so -- '' `` Yet there are times when you treat me like the veriest stranger !
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 7]: It must be my own fault .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 15]: Have I done or said anything since my arrival which has displeased you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 4]: `` Oh no !
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 6]: Please do n't think so .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 55]: It was nothing at all , not a thing , except only that -- '' She could not say , `` Except that you seemed to prefer Jill 's society to mine , '' and so complete the sentence ; so she subsided into blushing silence , and Mr Gerard tactfully forbore to question .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 18]: `` Do n't let there be any more ` excepts ' or ` buts , ' please !
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 19]: Take me on trust as Miles ' friend and -- if you will allow me -- your own .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 7]: That is all I request . ''
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 25]: At this interesting moment the sound of a latchkey was heard in the front door , followed by voices and footsteps in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 8]: Mr Gerard muttered something under his breath .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 19]: What the exact words were Betty did not know , but they were certainly not indicative of pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 34]: Then the door opened , and Miles entered , followed by Jill , who had met her brother soon after starting for her walk , and had escorted him back to the house .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 11]: She raised her eyebrows at the sight of Mr Gerard .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 23]: Had he not refused to go out with her a few minutes before , on the score of letters to be written ?
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 21]: Yet here he was , talking to Betty , with never a pretence of paper or ink in the room .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 38]: Jill came down to dinner an hour or two later , attired in her prettiest dress , with the little curl , which Jack naughtily termed the `` War Cry , '' artlessly displayed on her forehead .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 96]: She did not care two pins about her brother 's partner , but it was her nature to wish to reign supreme with any man with whom she was brought into contact , so she was her most captivating self all the evening , and Will Gerard laid his hand on his heart and bowed before her , laughed at her sallies , and applauded her songs , as he had done every evening since his arrival , and Betty laughed and applauded in her turn , without a trace of the old rankling jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 12]: `` He talks to her , but he looks at me .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 11]: He wants _ me _ to be his friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 8]: she told herself with a proud content .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 24]: For the first time for many a long year her dreams that night were in the present , instead of in the past .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY SIX .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 4]: A MOONLIGHT WALK .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 42]: Cynthia wrote to beg that Betty would soon come down to see her , and bring her old pupil to be reintroduced to his mentor , but time passed by , and one day after another was vetoed by Miles himself .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 4]: Betty was nonplussed .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 11]: It seemed as if he did not want to go .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 48]: Yet she could hardly believe that such could be the case , when she recalled to memory the tone of his voice , the look on his face when , for the first and last time since his return , Miles had voluntarily mentioned Cynthia 's name .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 8]: `` It is quite an easy journey .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 29]: We can get there in less than two hours by an express train , stay for lunch and tea , and get home again in time for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 33]: I 've been down twice this spring , and it is quite easily managed , '' she protested ; but Miles would do nothing but grunt , and refuse a definite answer .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 45]: To spend three or four hours in Franton , a large proportion of which would be taken up in eating meals , and talking to other people -- this was not his idea of a first visit to Cynthia after six years of absence .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 39]: He continued to grunt and make objections for the next few weeks , and then one night at dinner he announced airily -- `` I 've taken rooms at the Grand at Franton for a week from Friday .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 28]: I thought , as we were going down in any case , we might as well do the thing comfortably , and have a breath of sea-air .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 8]: Awfully stuffy in town this last week !
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 17]: They say the Grand is the best hotel , and we shall be fairly comfortable there .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 20]: Four bedrooms , and a private sitting-room for you , mater , in case you want to be quiet .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 23]: Gerard 's coming along ; and you 'll come too -- over Sunday , at least -- I hope , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 6]: `` Over Sunday , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 20]: I can manage that very well ; and perhaps Horton can take on my work for a few days .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 19]: There are no very serious cases on at present , and a rest would be very delightful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 8]: said the tired doctor with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 19]: His wife brightened instantly at the thought of his pleasure , while Betty and Jill flushed with excitement .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 5]: Rooms at the Grand !
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 13]: The best hotel , where perchance they might be `` comfortable '' !
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 30]: They had never before stayed in an hotel ; lodgings , and cheap lodgings into the bargain , had been their portion on the occasion of their rare holiday-makings .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 30]: The grandeur of the prospect drove out every other thought , and , to his own immense relief , Miles escaped embarrassing comments on his sadden change of front .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 18]: `` I hope we sha n't have meals in the private room , '' Jill said anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 28]: `` The great fun of staying in an hotel is to see the people , and -- er -- '' `` Be seen by the people ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 3]: `` Exactly !
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 4]: Especially the latter .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 22]: Do n't ask me to do a single thing before Friday , for I sha n't have a second to spare .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 23]: I 'm off remnant - hunting this morning , and shall be glued to the sewing-machine for the rest of the time .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 28]: Two new blouses at least I _ must _ have , if I am to pose before the public eye -- '' `` Oh , bother remnants !
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 18]: We 'll go to Regent Street this morning , and buy half a dozen blouses between you .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 14]: I am not going to take you to an hotel in remnants ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 6]: cried Miles with masculine scorn .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 30]: Since his return from abroad the eldest son of the family displayed a disregard of money which seemed next door to criminal in the eyes of his careful relations .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 20]: Why worry to make up a blouse for three-and-sixpence when you can buy a better one for three guineas ?
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 37]: That was his present attitude of mind ; and when the girls hesitated , -- fascinated yet fearful , -- the reply was always the same -- `` I 've slaved hard enough all these years !
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 5]: This is my holiday .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 26]: I 've come home to enjoy myself , and see you enjoy yourselves , and I 'm not going to worry my head about shillings .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 16]: For pity 's sake take what you can get , and do n't fuss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 38]: It is the attitude of all men who come back to civilisation after a long absence , and in Miles ' case it could truthfully be said that his extravagances benefited other people infinitely more than himself .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 31]: It was a very merry party which travelled down to Franton a few days later , and the comfort and grandeur of the hotel exceeded even the girls ' expectation .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 29]: All the bedrooms secured were situated on the front , and were provided with dear little balconies , on which they could sit and gaze over the sea .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 19]: The drawing-room was a gorgeous apartment -- all yellow satin and white archways , and banks of flowers .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 24]: The dining - hall was dotted over with little tables , a larger one in a bay-window being reserved for the Trevor party .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 44]: The lounge was provided with innumerable couches and wicker chairs , in which one could loll at ease , scrutinising the other visitors , or submitting to scrutiny on one 's own account , with a delightful consciousness of a Regent Street blouse .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 36]: The gardens and shrubberies would have been quite irresistible , had it not been that just beyond their bounds stretched the firm golden sands , on which the white-crested waves broke with a siren sound .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 44]: `` Go to bed without a walk on the shore by moonlight -- I ca n't and _ wo n't _ , not if ten fathers , and fifty thousand mothers went down on their knees and implored me to be prudent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 48]: asserted audacious Jill , as she finished her after-dinner coffee ; whereupon Dr Trevor laughed good - naturedly , and said -- `` There 's only one father present , and the only knees he possesses are much too stiff to exert themselves in a hopeless cause !
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 16]: Run along , my dear ; I should have felt the same at your age .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 5]: Put on a shawl .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 24]: Miles , you will see that your sisters do n't run wild , and that they come in by a sensible hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 49]: So the four young people wandered along the sands , and watched the moonlight play upon the waters ; but there was no need of the last part of the doctor 's warning , for even Jill grew quiet and subdued , and forgot to tease and banter .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 43]: Coming fresh from the noisy , crowded city , there was something inexpressibly impressive in the long stretch of sand , the dark , mysterious waters , the loneliness , the silence , broken only by the rhythmic break of the waves .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 31]: Miles walked alone , his face lifted now and again to the top of the cliff on which stood the villa which the Alliots had hired for the summer months .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 15]: Betty looked across the waste of waters , and felt a pang of compunction .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 16]: How long was it since she had last thought of her friend across the sea ?
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 29]: Fainter and more faint had his image been growing , until from forming a constant background to her thoughts , it had become a positive effort to remember .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 20]: She turned aside from Will Gerard 's whispered words , and passed her hand through her brother 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 12]: To be beside Miles was in itself an incentive to loyalty .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 46]: Next morning at eleven o'clock , Betty and Miles started to walk up to the Alliots ' villa , leaving Jill and Will Gerard seated on the shore throwing pebbles into the sea , with every appearance of satisfaction with themselves , and their occupation .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 28]: The path was steep but not very long , and at the entrance to the garden Mrs Alliot was strolling about , as if awaiting their arrival .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 11]: She kissed Betty and patted her affectionately on the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 7]: `` Cynthia is waiting for you .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 7]: Run along to her , dear !
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 54]: I will follow with your brother , and hear some of his news , '' she said in a light tone which yet held a hint of command , and , when Betty disappeared , she turned in an opposite direction , so as to take the least direct path to the house .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 13]: `` I am sure your mother is delighted to have you back !
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 13]: It is delightful that you have been so successful in your work .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 10]: We have been so interested in your adventures . ''
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 42]: The short conventional sentences were the only references made to Miles ' own affairs , and then , as if in a hurry to get to the subject most on her mind , Mrs Alliot began to speak of her daughter .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 12]: `` You will be surprised to find Cynthia looking so well .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 20]: She has put on flesh during the last few months , and the sea-air has given her a colour .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 7]: Last winter she was painfully thin .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 19]: It has been a long uphill struggle , but now at last we begin to see definite improvement .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 24]: The doctors are confident that it will be a complete cure if we are very careful during the next two or three years .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 19]: The great thing is to live in pure bracing air , and to keep her happy and cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 16]: Anything that caused agitation or worry of any kind , would have a deleterious effect .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 22]: She has a very sensitive nature , and things go deeply with her , -- more deeply than with most girls .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 16]: Her father and I hide all worries from her , even our anxiety about herself .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 26]: We , and all the friends who love her , must unite in doing everything in our power to spare her during these all-important years .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 9]: I know you will understand the position . ''
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 14]: `` Yes , '' said Miles quietly , `` I perfectly understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 24]: He had grown very white beneath his tan , and Mrs Alliot , glancing swiftly at him , felt a pang of compunction .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 15]: Poor young fellow , it was hard on him , if he really cared !
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 26]: Yet she had done no more than her duty in warning him that he could not be allowed to disturb Cynthia 's peace of mind .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 45]: So far , the girl was fancy free , but her interest in the return of her boy-friend was so strong that a word , a look , a hint of his own feeling might be sufficient to fan it into a stronger flame .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 20]: `` But now that I have spoken he knows how things are , and he is a good fellow !
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 21]: He will think of her before himself , '' said Cynthia 's mother to herself with a sigh of relief .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 65]: For the rest of the way to the house Mrs Alliot talked on impersonal subjects , and Miles answered with colourless politeness ; then , at last , across a wide green lawn , a sun shelter came into view , in which Betty could be discerned , and someone else in a white dress lying on a couch banked up with blue cushions .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 6]: `` There are the girls !
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 6]: Do n't wait for me !
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 11]: Go across the lawn , '' said Mrs Alliot kindly .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 59]: When one has dealt the one great blow , it is easy enough to make trifling concessions , reflected Miles bitterly , as he strode forward ; but the next moment all bitterness died away as he grasped a thin white hand , and looked down into a face which was at once strange , and exquisitely familiar .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 45]: Cynthia , but Cynthia as a woman , no longer a schoolgirl ; Cynthia with her golden mane wound smoothly round her head , with blue shadows under the sweet eyes , and hollows where the dimples used to dip in the rounded cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 29]: At the first glance the air of delicacy was painfully pronounced , but as she smiled and flushed , the old merry Cynthia looked at him once more .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 3]: `` Miles !
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 5]: Is it really you ?
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 6]: I can hardly believe it !
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 7]: Such a great , big man !
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 7]: Oh , but I 'm glad !
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 8]: I 'm glad to see you again !
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 6]: Sit down , sit down .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 6]: Let me see you properly .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 10]: I may n't get up from this horrid couch .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 6]: Yes , it 's you !
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 20]: I 'd know your eyes anywhere , and the moustache is nice -- a very fine moustache , Miles !
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 8]: I 'm glad the beard is off .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 6]: I like your square chin .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 23]: It is lovely to have you all here , and to know you have not to run away in a few hours .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 10]: I 'm looking forward immensely to the next week .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 3]: Old Miles !
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 10]: It _ is _ good to see you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 49]: She laughed and coughed , and lent back against the cushions , pushing them into place with an impatient hand ; while Miles stared at her in an intent silence which printed every detail so deeply in his memory that no passage of time could wear them away .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 47]: The loose ends of hair which escaped from the coils and curled on her white neck , the long transparent hands against the blue cushions , the slight figure in the white dress -- how often that vision arose before him in the years to come !
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 31]: As of old , Cynthia 's friendliness showed no hint of embarrassment , and she chatted away as easily as if the separation had lasted for weeks instead of years .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 21]: Betty had tactfully rejoined Mrs Alliot , and for the next half-hour Miles was allowed an uninterrupted _ tete-a-tete _ .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 8]: `` Tell me all about everything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 44]: cried Cynthia , just as years before she had demanded an account of Miles ' engineering studies ; and when he protested , `` Oh , it 's quite easy , '' she maintained , `` Tell me the history of a day .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 16]: You wake in the morning , and get up , and then -- what next ?
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 16]: Go through the whole programme until it is time to go to bed again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 25]: Then Miles spoke , and she listened eagerly , the flush dying out of her cheeks and a wistful expression deepening in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 44]: `` It 's just as I said long ago , '' she sighed plaintively when he had finished ; `` you have gone out into the world and done things , and I have stayed at home and done -- _ nothing _ !
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 13]: Oh , Miles , it was hard being taken ill just then !
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 26]: Father had come home , and we were looking forward to travelling about , and having a good time together , and being so happy .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 43]: I had finished classes , and was old enough to come out , and I meant to be such a good daughter , and to take care of the parents for a change , after being taken care of all my life .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 47]: I was going to my first ball -- my dress was in the house -- when I caught influenza , and since then '' -- she threw out her arms with an expressive gesture -- `` it 's been this sort of thing all the time !
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 42]: Lying still -- eating -- sleeping -- being waited on hand and foot ; an anxiety instead of a help ; a care instead of a joy -- oh , and I _ did _ want to be a joy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 19]: She paused a moment to press her lips together , and to give her head an impatient shake .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 7]: `` I must n't be silly !
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 20]: Father and mother do n't guess that I feel like this , and it is n't always so bad .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 50]: Some days I feel quite bright and happy , especially lately , since I 've been getting better , but seeing you brought back the dear old days , and oh , I _ want _ to be well again , and run about with you on the sands .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 14]: I sha n't be able to go about with you at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 31]: `` I will come and sit with you as often as I may -- as long as I may , '' said Miles huskily whereupon Cynthia smiled on him again .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 6]: `` How nice of you !
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 7]: Ah yes , you must come .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 22]: I 'll keep quite quiet for the rest of the day , and then I can talk while you are here .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 14]: There 's so much I want to tell , and to hear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 19]: She coughed again , and brushed her hair from her brow , evidently fatigued by her own emotion .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 47]: The dainty finish and grace of her appearance , which had been the greatest charm in Miles ' eyes long ago , was accentuated by her illness into a fragility which made her seem more like a spirit than a flesh-and-blood woman to his unaccustomed eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 36]: His thoughts raced back for a moment to the scene of his Mexican home , and he realised the folly of the dream which had for so long made the half-conscious background of his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 39]: Even if she were willing , even if she loved him , as he loved and would always love her , it would be a madman who could dream of transplanting this fragile flower to those rude surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 6]: Cynthia was not for him !
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 13]: Their lives , for the present at least , lay far apart .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 26]: As for the future , that was in God 's hands ; it would be selfish and cowardly to try to ensure it for himself .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 22]: Miles ' heart was wrung with the agony of renunciation , but his set face showed no signs of his suffering .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 34]: He cheered Cynthia with renewed promises of daily visits , chatted with her of old friends and old times , and had the reward of hearing her laugh with the old merry ring .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 39]: When he took her hand in farewell , she looked at him with frank eyes , and said sweetly -- `` I 'm sorry I grumbled -- it was wrong of me when I 'm so well off .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 27]: I do try to be good , but I was always impatient -- you used to laugh when I said so , but it was true .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 51]: This illness may be just what I need -- ` They also serve , who only stand and wait ' -- I think so often of that line , and try to wait in patience , but it is hard -- the hardest thing in the world , sometimes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 14]: `` Yes , '' said Miles quietly , `` the very hardest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 2]: EXPLANATIONS .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 7]: It was a very happy week .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 24]: The weather was all that could be desired for a seaside holiday , -- bright yet not glaring , warm but not hot .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 39]: The hotel was everything that was luxurious and comfortable , and , last and best of all , Cynthia kept bright and happy , and was better -- not worse -- for the visits of her old friends .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 36]: Every morning Betty accompanied Miles up to the villa , leaving Mr Gerard and Jill busy playing tennis , roving about on the shore , or engaged in that other engrossing occupation of throwing stones .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 45]: For the first day or two she made excuses , and strolled away to join Mrs Alliot , but it soon became apparent to her quick senses that neither that lady nor , strangely enough , Miles himself encouraged these well - meant excursions .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 24]: So for the rest of the time she sat in the shelter by Cynthia 's couch , and joined frankly in the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 63]: Sometimes Miles would be silent for almost the whole morning , listening while the two friends talked together as girls will -- a pretty , innocent , sweet - hearted chatter of home and friends and books and dresses , and `` Do you remember , '' and `` Oh , just suppose , '' which unconsciously revealed the character of both .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 54]: Absorbed as he was in Cynthia and all that belonged to her , Miles was more than once arrested by Betty herself , and asked himself if it could be true or only imagination that she had gained immensely in beauty , softness , and general charm since his return five weeks ago .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 26]: There was an expression on her face in these last days which transfigured the old Betty into something a hundred times sweeter and more attractive .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 22]: Happiness enveloped her as an atmosphere , -- an almost tremulous happiness , as of one fearful of her own joy .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 44]: Miles felt assured that Cynthia noticed this new development as he did himself , as he saw the grey eyes rest on her friend 's face with a tender wistfulness of gaze , and heard the fluttering sigh with which she turned aside .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 14]: Never again had Cynthia breathed a word of complaint for her own limitations .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 28]: After that first involuntary outburst she had carefully steered clear of the subject of self , and thrown herself heart and soul into her companion 's interest .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 22]: It was only when the last day of the short visit had been reached that she alluded to her own plans .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 8]: `` We are ordered to leave Franton .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 26]: It is very hot and oppressive in July and August , and the doctors want us to go to some high mountain resort in Switzerland .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 16]: We shall move on by easy stages as soon as possible -- possibly next week .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 23]: It is quite uncertain what we shall do for the autumn and winter ; we may possibly move on to the Engadine .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 16]: In any case I 'm afraid it is unlikely that we shall return to England .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 17]: Will there be any chance of seeing you when we return in spring , Miles ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 23]: And then Betty received a shock , for Miles replied quietly -- `` I shall be back in Mexico long before then .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 16]: I do n't think I shall take more than three months ' holiday this time .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 10]: One gets tired of loafing after a busy life .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 10]: I shall want to get back to work . ''
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 8]: `` Miles , how can you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 5]: cried his sister shrilly .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 4]: `` Three months !
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 9]: In another seven weeks -- it 's impossible !
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 12]: We have hardly had time to realise that you are home .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 15]: We made sure that you would be with us till after Christmas at least .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 9]: Three months ' holiday after all these years !
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 11]: Oh , Miles , you ca n't mean it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 32]: `` I came home to see you all , Betty , and to satisfy myself that you were well ; when that 's done there 's no more excuse for lazying .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 51]: I am entitled to a year 's rest , if I like to take it ; but if I go back now I shall be nine months nearer my next visit ; and if the mine does all that we expect , I shall be back sooner than you imagine .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 29]: Three years -- even two -- may see me home again , and then -- things may be changed -- it may be easier to stay -- ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 13]: He kept his eyes lowered as he spoke , but Betty understood .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 20]: Perhaps Cynthia did too , for her pale cheeks flushed , and she made not a word of comment .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 33]: When Miles rose a few minutes later , she said `` Good-bye '' to him in exactly the same words which she had used six years before -- `` Good-bye , Miles .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 6]: I wo n't forget ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 14]: And Miles crushed her little hands in his , and walked silently away .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 18]: At the gate Mrs Alliot was awaiting him , as on the morning of his first visit .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 37]: She looked wistfully at the stern , white face , then laid her hand on his arm , and said in a tremulous voice -- `` Mr Trevor -- I -- I want to thank you !
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 8]: You have been very brave and kind .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 24]: Do n't think I have not understood -- mothers always understand -- but for Cynthia 's sake I was obliged to be selfish .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 18]: It might have undone all she has gained , to have had any great excitement or agitation .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 21]: She is very young yet -- only twenty-two -- and she looks upon you as a friend of her school-days .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 14]: It was better for every reason that your relations should remain unchanged . ''
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 22]: Then Miles faced her , a tall imposing figure drawn to his full height , with shoulders squared and flashing eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 7]: `` For the present , yes !
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 15]: I have respected your wishes , and put my own hopes on one side .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 14]: Now I am going back to work like ten men rather than one .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 44]: If things go as we expect -- as we have a right to expect -- in a few years ' time I shall be able to live where I please , to choose my home where it best suits myself -- and others .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 41]: If I live , Mrs Alliot , I shall be home again in a few years ' time , and then I warn you that nothing and nobody shall keep me apart from Cynthia if she will be my wife .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 7]: If she has recovered -- well !
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 12]: If she is ill -- I will take care of her !
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 9]: I have served for her six years already .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 19]: I will serve six more if needs be , but I shall claim her in the end ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 23]: `` And if it is God 's will that she lives and loves you , I will give her to you gladly .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 8]: You are a good man , Miles .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 4]: God bless you !
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 7]: All good go with you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 5]: said Mrs Alliot warmly .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 7]: Then they shook hands and parted .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 4]: For how long ?
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 6]: It was impossible to say .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 47]: Before Miles lay the far country , danger by land and sea , a hard , adventurous life ; before Cynthia years of what at the best must be a slow , difficult convalescence , with the ever-present danger of a relapse into her old condition .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 11]: Only God knew , Who holds the issue of time .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 10]: Their greatest stronghold lay in their confidence in Him .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 25]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ That evening Betty sat beside Will Gerard on the sloping beach , and watched the sun set in a silence tinged with melancholy .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 52]: Miles ' announcement of a speedy return to America had planted a dart in her heart which was not solely on his own account ; for if he went , would not his partner go too , leaving her to a life of such blank emptiness as was terrifying to contemplate ?
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 44]: All day long the thought had haunted her ; she had longed yet dreaded to speak on the subject , and now that evening was here , she felt it impossible to face the long hours of the night without some certain knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 34]: A few minutes before , Miles had taken Jill for a walk along the sands ; in a short time they would return , and the opportunity for quiet conversation would be over .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 17]: Betty turned slowly , to meet her companion 's deep-set eyes fixed intently on her face .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 27]: He had fallen into a habit of watching her in this earnest manner , and was often able to divine her thoughts even before she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 4]: he asked gently .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 6]: `` Something is troubling you .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 10]: Wo n't you tell me what it is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 5]: `` It 's Miles !
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 28]: He said this morning that he intended to take only three months ' holiday -- that means to leave England in six or seven weeks from now .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 6]: I ca n't believe it .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 14]: We counted on six months or more , -- possibly even a year .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 10]: Do you think he seriously means to go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 14]: `` I am sure he does , and I think he is right .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 20]: If you want to be really kind , Miss Trevor , you wo n't ask him to stay . ''
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 5]: Betty 's lips trembled .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 46]: `` Oh , perhaps not , but it is hardest of all to feel that he _ wants _ to go ; that with all our love and care we are so much outside his life that we ca n't make him happy or satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 3]: Poor mother !
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 64]: It must be dreadful to bring up a child all those years , and to long and long for his return , and then see him in a hurry to rush away again , just because -- oh , I know that you know the real reason -- because of a girl of whom , after all , he has seen very little !
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 6]: It 's very hard ! ''
