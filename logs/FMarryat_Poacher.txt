Parsing [sent. 1 len. 7]: The Poacher , by Captain Marryat .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 15]: Captain Frederick Marryat was born July 10 1792 , and died August 8 1848 .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 16]: He retired from the British navy in 1828 in order to devote himself to writing .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 31]: In the following 20 years he wrote 26 books , many of which are among the very best of English literature , and some of which are still in print .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 14]: Marryat had an extraordinary gift for the invention of episodes in his stories .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 24]: He says somewhere that when he sat down for the day 's work , he never knew what he was going to write .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 7]: He certainly was a literary genius .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 19]: `` The Poacher '' was published in 1841 , the eighteenth book to flow from Marryat 's pen .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 21]: This e-text was transcribed in 1998 by Nick Hodson , and was reformatted in 2003 , and again in 2005 .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 8]: THE POACHER , BY CAPTAIN FREDERICK MARRYAT .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 3]: CHAPTER ONE .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 9]: IN WHICH THERE IS MORE ALE THAN ARGUMENT .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 38]: It was on a blusterous windy night in the early part of November , 1812 , that three men were on the high road near to the little village of Grassford , in the south of Devonshire .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 84]: The moon was nearly at the full , but the wild scud , and occasionally the more opaque clouds , passed over in such rapid succession , that it was rarely , and but for a moment or two , that the landscape was thrown into light and shadow ; and the wind , which was keen and piercing , bent and waved the leafless branches of the trees which were ranged along the hedgerows , between which the road had been formed .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 43]: The three individuals to whom we have referred appeared all of them to have been indulging too freely in the ale which was sold at the public-house about half a mile from the village , and from which they had just departed .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 38]: Two of them , however , comparatively speaking , sober , were assisting home , by their _ joint _ efforts , the third , who , supported between them , could with difficulty use his legs .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 38]: Thus did they continue on ; the two swayed first on the one side of the road , and then on the other , by the weight of the third , whom they almost carried between them .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 64]: At last they arrived at a bridge built over one of those impetuous streams so common in the county , when , as if by mutual understanding , for it was without speaking , the two more sober deposited the body of the third against the parapet of the bridge , and then for some time were silently occupied in recovering their breath .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 81]: One of the two who remained leaning on the parapet by the side of their almost lifeless companion was a man of about forty years of age , tall and slender , dressed in a worn-out black coat , and a pair of trousers much too short for him , the original colour of which it would have been difficult to have surmised ; a sort of clerical hat , equally the worse for wear , was on his head .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 37]: Although his habiliments were mean , still there was something about his appearance which told of better days , and of having moved in a different sphere in society ; and such had been the case .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 61]: Some years before he had been the head of a grammar-school , with a comfortable income ; but a habit of drinking had been his ruin , and he was now the preceptor of the village of Grassford , and gained his livelihood by instructing the children of the cottagers for the small modicum of twopence a head per week .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 41]: This unfortunate propensity to liquor remained with him and he no sooner received his weekly stipend than he hastened to drown his cares , and the recollection of his former position , at the ale-house which they had just quitted .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 57]: The second personage whom we shall introduce was not of a corresponding height with the other : he was broad , square-chested , and short-dressed in knee-breeches , leggings , and laced boots -- his coat being of a thick fustian , and cut short like a shooting-jacket : his profession was that of a pedlar .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 56]: `` It 's odd to me , '' said the pedlar , at last breaking silence , as he looked down upon the drunken man who lay at his feet , `` why ale should take a man off his legs ; they say that liquor gets into the head , not the feet . ''
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 83]: `` Well , '' replied the schoolmaster , who was much more inebriated than the pedlar , `` there 's argument even in that and , you see , the perpendicular deviation must arise from the head being too heavy , that 's clear ; and then , you see , the feet , from the centre of gravity being destroyed , become too light ; and if you put that and that together , why , a man ca n't stand .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 6]: You understand my demonstration ? ''
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 71]: `` It was heavy wet , that ale , and so I suppose it 's all right , '' replied the pedlar ; `` but still ale a 'n' t poured into the head or into the feet of a man , but into the internals , which are right in the middle of a man ; so , how do you make out your case , Mr Furness ? ''
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 12]: `` Why , Byres , you talk of the residuum . ''
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 23]: `` Never said a word about it ; and , as I stand here , never even heard the word before . ''
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 18]: `` Perhaps not : the residuum is , you see , Byres , what is left . ''
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 29]: `` If that 's residgium , I did n't mean to say a word about it ; there was none left , for you drained the pot . ''
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 16]: `` Good , Byres ; you have never been to college , that 's clear .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 35]: Now , observe , when a man pours down into his stomach a certain quantity of liquor , the spirituous or lighter part ascends to his head , and that makes his head heavy .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 5]: Do you understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 13]: `` No ; what 's light ca n't make things heavy . ''
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 5]: `` Ca n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 8]: -- you know nothing about the matter .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 9]: Have you not a proof before you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 29]: replied the schoolmaster , reeling , and catching hold of the parapet for support ; `` look at that unfortunate man , who has yielded to excess . ''
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 25]: `` Very true ; I see that he 's drunk , but I want to know how it is that he got drunk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 5]: `` By drinking . ''
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 7]: `` That I knew before . ''
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 8]: `` Then why ask any more questions ?
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 17]: Had we not better proceed , and take him home to his expectant and unhappy wife ?
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 27]: 'T is a sad , sad thing , that a man should ` put an enemy into his mouth to steal away his brains . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 45]: `` Half a pint will do that with Rushbrook , '' replied the pedlar ; `` they say that he was wounded on his head , and that half his brains are gone already , and that 's why he has a pension . ''
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 42]: `` Yes , seventeen pounds a year ; paid quarterly , without deduction , and only to walk four miles to get it , '' replied Furness ; `` yet how misplaced is the liberality on the part of the government .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 4]: Does he work ?
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 33]: No ; he does nothing but drink and lie in bed all day , while I must be up early and remain late , teaching the young idea at twopence per week .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 14]: Friend Byres , ` mercy is not itself which oft looks so . '
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 44]: Now , it is my opinion that it would be a kindness to this poor wretch if we were to toss him , as he now is , over the bridge into the rushing stream ; it would end all his troubles . ''
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 24]: `` And save us the trouble of getting him home , '' replied Byres , who determined to humour his more inebriated companion .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 11]: `` Well , Mr Furness , I 've no objection .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 5]: Why should he live ?
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 27]: Is he not a sinecurist -- one of the locusts who fatten on the sweat and blood of the people , as the Sunday paper says ?
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 11]: Do n't you remember my reading it this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 8]: `` Very true , Master Byres . ''
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 7]: `` What d'ye say , then ?
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 8]: -- shall we over with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 30]: `` We must think a little , '' replied the schoolmaster , who put his hand up to his chin , and remained silent for a minute or two .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 20]: `` No , '' resumed he , at last ; `` on second thoughts I can not do it .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 7]: He halves his beer with me .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 14]: No pension -- no beer ; that 's a self-evident proposition and conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 40]: It were ingratitude on my part , and I can not consent to your proposal , '' continued the schoolmaster ; `` nay , more , I will defend him against your murderous intentions to the very last . ''
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 31]: `` Why , Master Furness , you must be somewhat the worse for liquor yourself : it was your proposal to throw him over the bridge , not mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 26]: `` Take care what you say , '' replied the schoolmaster ; `` would you accuse me of murder , or intent to murder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 23]: `` No , not by no means -- only you proposed heaving him over the bridge : I will say that . ''
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 25]: `` Friend Byres , it 's my opinion you 'll say anything but your prayers ; but in your present state I overlook it .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 18]: Let us go on , or I shall have two men to carry home instead of one .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 21]: Come , now , take one of his arms , while I take the other , and raise him up .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 13]: It is but a quarter of a mile to the cottage . ''
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 31]: Byres , who , as we observed , was by far the more sober of the two , did not think it worth his while to reply to the pedagogue .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 22]: After a few staggers on the part of the latter , their comrade was raised up and led away between them .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 49]: The drunken man appeared to be so far aware of what was going on that he moved his legs mechanically , and in a short time they arrived at the cottage-door , which the pedagogue struck with his fist so as to make it rattle on its hinges .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 18]: The door was opened by a tall , handsome woman , holding a candle in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 13]: `` I thought so , '' said she , shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 21]: `` The old story : now he will be ill all night , and not get up till noon . ''
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 12]: `` What a weary life it is with a drunken husband .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 11]: Bring him and thank you kindly for your trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 31]: `` It has been hard work and hot work , '' observed the schoolmaster , sitting down in a chair , after they had placed their comrade on the bed .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 13]: `` Indeed , and it must be , '' replied the wife .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 14]: `` Will you have a drop of small beer , Mr Furness ? ''
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 15]: `` Yes , if you please , and so will Mr Byres , too .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 16]: What a pity it is your good man will not keep to small beer . ''
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 27]: `` Yes , indeed , '' replied the wife , who went into the back premises , and soon returned with a quart mug of beer .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 15]: The schoolmaster emptied half the mug , and then handed it to the pedlar .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 15]: `` And my little friend Joey , fast asleep , I 'll warrant ! ''
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 23]: `` Yes , poor child , and so should I have been by this time ; the clock has gone twelve . ''
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 13]: `` Well , Mrs Rushbrook , I wish you a good night .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 15]: Come , Mr Byres , Mrs Rushbrook must want to be in bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 18]: `` Good night , Mr Furness , and good night , sir , and many thanks . ''
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 8]: The schoolmaster and pedlar quitted the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 16]: Mrs Rushbrook , after having watched them for a minute , carefully closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 17]: `` They 're gone now , '' said she , as she turned to her husband .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 51]: What would have created much astonishment could anybody else have witnessed it , as soon as his wife had spoken , Rushbrook immediately sprang upon his feet , a fine-looking man , six feet in height , very erect in his bearing , -- and proved to be perfectly sober .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 29]: `` Jane , my dear , '' said he , `` there never was such a night : but I must be quick , and lose no time .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 6]: Is my gun ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 26]: `` Everything 's ready ; Joey is lying down on his bed , but all ready dressed , and he awakes in a minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 14]: `` Call him , then , for there is no time to lose .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 13]: That drunken fool , Furness , proposed throwing me over the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 30]: It was lucky for them that they did not try it , or I should have been obliged to settle them both , that they might tell no tales .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 5]: Where 's Mum ? ''
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 5]: `` In the wash-house .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 9]: I 'll bring him and Joey directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 22]: The wife left the room , while Rushbrook took down his gun and ammunition , and prepared himself for his expedition .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 76]: In a minute or two a shepherd 's dog , which had been released from the wash-house , made his appearance , and quietly lay down close to his master 's feet ; it was soon followed by Mrs Rushbrook , accompanied by Joey , a thin , meagre-looking boy , of about twelve years old , very small for his age , but apparently as active as a cat , and with energy corresponding .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 79]: No one would have thought he had been roused from his sleep ; there was no yawning or weariness of motion -- on the contrary , his large eye was as bright as an eagle 's , as he quietly , although quickly , provided himself with a sack , which he threw over his shoulders , and a coil of line , which he held in his hand , waiting until his father was ready to start .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 45]: The wife put out the lights , softly opened the cottage-door , looked well round , and then returned to her husband , who , giving a low whistle , as a summons to Joey and the dog , walked out of the door .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 20]: Not a word was spoken ; the door was softly shut to ; and the trio crept stealthily away .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWO .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 11]: IN WHICH THE HERO OF THE TALE IS FORMALLY INTRODUCED .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 23]: Before we proceed with our narrative , perhaps it will be better to explain what may appear very strange to the reader .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 28]: Joseph Rushbrook , who has just left the cottage with his son and his dog , was born in the village in which he was then residing .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 43]: During his younger days , some forty years previous to his present introduction to the reader , the law was not so severe , or the measures taken against poachers so strong as they were at the period of which we write .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 69]: In his youth he had been very fond of carrying a gun -- as his father had been before him -- but he never was discovered ; and after having poached for many years , and gained a perfect knowledge of the country for miles round , he was persuaded , in a fit of semi-intoxication , at a neighbouring fair , to enlist in a marching regiment .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 29]: He had not been more than three months at the depot when he was ordered out to India , where he remained eleven years before he was recalled .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 50]: He had scarcely been six months in England , when the exigency of the war demanded the services of the regiment in the Mediterranean , where he remained for twelve years , and having received a severe wound in the head , he was then pensioned off and discharged .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 28]: He resolved to return to his native village , and settle down quietly , hoping by moderate labour and his pension , to gain a comfortable living .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 59]: On his return he was hardly known ; many had emigrated to a foreign clime ; many had been transported for offences against the laws , particularly for the offence of poaching : and as most of his former allies had been so employed , he found himself almost a stranger where he expected to meet with friends .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 10]: The property also about the village had changed hands .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 22]: People recollected Squire So-and-So , and the Baronet , but now their lands were held by wealthy manufacturers or retired merchants .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 16]: All was new to Joe Rushbrook , and he felt himself anywhere but at home .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 103]: Jane Ashley , a very beautiful young woman , who was in service at the Hall , the mansion appertaining to the adjacent property , and the daughter of one of his earliest friends , who had been transported for poaching , was almost the only one who could talk to him after his absence of twenty-four years ; not that she knew the people at the time , for she was then an infant , but she had grown up with them after Joe had left , and could narrate anecdotes of them , and what had been their eventual destinies .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 34]: Jane having been the daughter of a man who had been transported for poaching , was to Joe a sort of recommendation , and it ended in his taking her for his wife .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 60]: They had not been long settled in their cottage before Joe 's former propensities returned ; in fact , he could not be idle , he had carried a musket too long , and had lived such a life of excitement in the service of his country , that he found it impossible to exist without shooting at something .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 27]: All his former love of poaching came strong upon him , and his wife , so far from checking him , encouraged him in his feelings .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 22]: The consequence was , that two years after his marriage , Joe Rushbrook was the most determined poacher in the county .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 45]: Although often suspected , he had never been detected ; one great cause of this was his appearing to be such a drunkard , a plan hit upon by his wife , who had observed that drunken men were not suspected of being poachers .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 44]: This scheme had therefore been hit upon , and very successfully ; for proving before a magistrate that a man was carried home dead drunk and speechless at midnight , was quite as good an _ alibi _ as could be brought forward .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 52]: Joe Rushbrook had , therefore , the credit of being a worthless drunken fellow , who lived upon his pension and what his wife could earn ; but no one had an idea that he was not only earning his livelihood , but laying by money from his successful night labours .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 67]: Not that Joe did not like a drop occasionally -- on the contrary , he would sometimes drink freely ; but , generally speaking , the wounds in his head were complained of ; and he would , if the wind was fresh and set in the right quarter , contrive to be carried home on the night in which he had most work to do .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 14]: Such was the case , as we have represented in the first chapter .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 31]: Little Joey , who , as the reader may anticipate , will be our future hero , was born the first year after marriage , and was their only child .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 54]: He was a quiet , thoughtful , reflective boy for his years , and had imbibed his father 's love of walking out on a dark night to an extraordinary degree : it was strange to see how much prudence there was , mingled with the love of adventure , in this lad .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 42]: True it is , his father had trained him early , first to examine the snares and conceal the game , which a little shrimp like Joey could do , without being suspected to be otherwise employed than in picking blackberries .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 34]: Before he was seven years old , Joey could set a springe as well as his father , and was well versed in all the mystery and art of unlawful taking of game .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 25]: Indeed , he was very valuable to his father , and could do what his father could not have ventured upon without exciting suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 39]: It was , perhaps , from his constant vigils , that the little boy was so small in size ; at all events , his diminutive size was the cause of there being no suspicion attached to him .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 35]: Joey went very regularly to the day-school of Mr Furness ; and although often up the best part of the night , he was one of the best and most diligent of the scholars .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 48]: No one could have supposed that the little fair-haired , quiet-looking boy , who was so busy with his books or his writing , could have been out half the night on a perilous excursion , for such it was at the time we are speaking of .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 42]: It need hardly be observed that Joey had learned one important lesson , which was to be _ silent _ ; not even _ Mum _ , the dog , who could not speak , was more secret or more faithful .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 19]: It is astonishing how much the nature and disposition of a child may be altered by early tuition .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 43]: Let a child be always with its nurse , even under the guidance of a mother , regularly brought up as children usually are , and it will continue to be a child , and even childish , after childhood is gone .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 69]: But take the same child , put it by degrees in situations of peril , requiring thought and observation beyond its years , accustom it to nightly vigils , and to watching , and to hold its tongue , and it is astonishing how the mind of that child , however much its body may suffer , will develop itself so as to meet the demand upon it .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 20]: Thus it is with lads that are sent early to sea , and thus it was with little Joey .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 14]: He was a man in some points , although a child in others .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 30]: He would play with his companions , laugh as loudly as the others , but still he would never breathe a hint of what was his father 's employment .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 53]: He went to church every Sunday , as did his father and mother ; for they considered that poaching was no crime , although punished as such by the laws ; and he , of course , considered it no crime , as he only did what his father and mother wished .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 30]: Let it not be thought , therefore , that the morals of our little hero were affected by his father 's profession , for such was not the case .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 12]: Having entered into this necessary explanation , we will now proceed .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 20]: No band of North American Indians could have observed a better trail than that kept by our little party .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 13]: Rushbrook walked first , followed by our hero and the dog Mum .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 52]: Not a word was spoken ; they continued their route over grass-lands and ploughed fields , keeping in the shade of the hedgerows : if Rushbrook stopped for a while to reconnoitre , so did Joey , and so did Mum at their relative distances , until the march was resumed .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 19]: For three miles and a half did they thus continue , until they arrived at a thick cover .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 63]: The wind whistled through the branches of the bare trees , chiefly oak and ash ; the cold , damp fog was now stationary , and shrouded them as they proceeded cautiously by the beaten track in the cover , until they had passed through it , and arrived on the other side , where the cottage of a gamekeeper was situated .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 13]: A feeble light was burning , and shone through the diamond-paned windows .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 22]: Rushbrook walked out clear of the cover , and held up his hand to ascertain precisely the direction of the wind .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 40]: Having satisfied himself ; he retreated into the cover , in a direction so as to be exactly to leeward of the keeper 's house , that the noise of the report of his gun might not be heard .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 44]: Having cleared the hedge , he lowered his gun , so as to bring the barrel within two or three inches of the ground , and walked slowly and cautiously through the brushwood , followed , as before , by Joey and Mum .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 48]: After about a quarter of a mile 's walk , a rattling of metal was heard , and they stopped short ; it was the barrel of the fowling-piece which had brushed one of the wires attached to a spring-gun , set for the benefit of poachers .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 73]: Rushbrook lifted up his left hand , as a sign to Joey not to move ; and following the wire , by continually rattling his barrel against it , he eventually arrived at the gun itself ; opened the pan , threw out all the priming , leaving it with the pan open , so that it could not go off ; in case they fell in with another of the wires .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 135]: Rushbrook then proceeded to business , for he well knew that the gun would be set where the pheasants were most accustomed to roost ; he put a small charge of powder in his fowling-piece , that , being so near , he might not shatter the birds , and because the noise of the report would be much less ; walking under an oak-tree he soon discovered the round black masses which the bodies of the roosting pheasants presented between him and the sky , and raising his piece , he fired ; a heavy bound on the earth near his feet followed the discharge ; Joey then slipped forward and put the pheasant into his bag ; another and another shot , and every shot brought an increase to Joey 's load .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 12]: Seventeen were already in it when Mum gave a low growl .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 9]: This was the signal for people being near .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 23]: Rushbrook snapped his finger ; the dog came forward to his side , and stood motionless , with ears and tail erect .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 21]: In a minute 's time was heard the rustling of branches as the party forced their way through the underwood .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 69]: Rushbrook stood still , waiting the signal from Mum , for the dog had been taught , if the parties advancing had another dog with them , always to raise his fore-feet up to Rushbrook 's knees , but not otherwise ; Mum made no such sign , and then Rushbrook lay down in the brushwood , his motions being closely followed by his son and his dog .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 28]: Voices in whispers were now heard , and the forms of two men with guns were to be seen not four yards from where they were lying .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 13]: `` Somewhere about here , I 'll swear , '' said one .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 23]: `` Yes , I think so ; but it may be further on -- the wind has brought down the sound . ''
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 19]: `` Very true , let 's follow them , and they may fall back upon the spring-gun . ''
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 60]: The parties then advanced into the cover , and were soon out of sight ; after a time Rushbrook held his ear to the wind , and , satisfied that all was safe , moved homewards , and arrived without further adventure , having relieved Joey of the heavy sack as soon as they were in the open fields .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 17]: At three o'clock in the morning , he tapped at the back door of the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 29]: Jane opened it , and the spoils of the night having been put away in a secret place , they were all soon in bed and fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 3]: CHAPTER THREE .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 18]: TRAIN A CHILD IN THE WAY HE SHOULD GO , AND HE WILL NOT DEPART FROM IT .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 47]: It is an old saying , that `` if there were no receivers there would be no thieves , '' and it would have been of very little use for Rushbrook to take the game if he had not had the means of disposing of it .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 14]: In this point , Byres , the pedlar , was a valuable accessory .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 13]: Byres was a radical knave , who did not admire hard work .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 26]: At first he took up the profession of bricklayer 's labourer , one that is of a nature only affording occasional work and moderate wages .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 24]: He did this that he might apply to the parish for relief ; and do nothing for the major portion of the year .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 38]: But even a few months ' work would not suit him , and subsequently he gained his sustenance by carrying on his head a large basket of crockery , and disposing of his wares among the cottagers .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 42]: At last he took out a pedlar 's license -- perhaps one of the most dangerous permits ever allowed by a government , and which has been the cause of much of the ill-will and discontent fomented among the lower classes .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 88]: Latterly , the cheapness of printing and easiness of circulation have rendered the profession of less consequence : twenty years ago the village ale-houses were not provided with newspapers ; it was an expense never thought of ; the men went to drink their beer and talk over the news of the vicinity , and if there was a disturbance in any other portion of the United Kingdom , the fact was only gained by rumour , and that vaguely and long after it had taken place .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 110]: But when the pedlar Byres made his appearance , which he at last did , weekly or oftener , as it might happen , there was a great change ; he was the party who supplied information , and , in consequence , he was always welcome , and looked upon as an oracle ; the best seat near the fire was reserved for him , and having deposited his pack upon the table or in a corner , he would then produce the _ Propeller _ , or some other publication full of treason and blasphemy , and read it aloud for the benefit of the labourers assembled .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 77]: A few months were more than sufficient to produce the most serious effects : men who had worked cheerfully through the day , and retired to bed satisfied with their lot , and thankful that work was to be obtained , now remained at the public-house , canvassing the conduct of government , and , leaving their resort , satisfied in their own minds that they were ill-used , harshly treated , and in bitter bondage .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 38]: If they met their superiors , those very parties to whom they were indebted for employment , there was no respect shown to them as formerly or , if so , it was sullen and forced acknowledgement .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 106]: The church was gradually deserted -- the appearance of the pastor was no longer a signal for every hat to be lifted from the head ; on the contrary , boys of sixteen or seventeen years of age would lean against the church , or the walls of the churchyard , with their hands in both pockets , and a sort of leer upon their faces , as though they defied the pastor on his appearance -- and there would they remain outside during the service , meeting , unquailed and without blushing , his eyes , cast upon them as he came out again .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 60]: Such was the state of things in the village of Grassford in one year after the pedlar had added it to his continual rounds -- and Byres was a great favourite , for he procured for the women what they commissioned him to obtain , supplied the girls with ribbons and gewgaws , and trusted to a considerable extent .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 44]: His reappearance was always anxiously looked for ; he lived scot-free at the public-house , for he brought so much custom , and was the occasion of the drinking of so much ale , that the landlord considered his coming as a godsend .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 57]: His box of ware was well supplied in the sunnier months , for the fine weather was the time for the wearing of gay ribbons ; but in the winter he travelled more to receive orders , or to carry away the game supplied to him by the poachers , with whom he was in league .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 25]: Had his box been examined during the shooting season , it would have been found loaded with pheasants , not with trinkets and ribbons .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 86]: It need hardly be observed after this that Byres was the party who took off the hands of Rushbrook all the game which he procured , and which he had notice to call for before daylight , generally the _ second _ morning after it had been obtained ; for Rushbrook was too cautious to trust Byres with his secret , that of never going out of a night without having previously pretended intoxication , and having suffered himself to be led or carried home .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 94]: Our readers will acknowledge that little Joey was placed in a very dangerous position ; it is true that he was not aware that he was doing wrong in assisting his father ; nevertheless , being a reflective boy , it did sometimes occur to him that it was odd that what was right should be done so secretly ; and he attempted to make out how it was that the birds that flew about everywhere , and appeared to belong to every one , might not be shot in the open day .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 19]: He knew that the laws forbade it ; but he inquired of himself why such laws should be .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 15]: Joey had heard but one side of the question , and was therefore puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 39]: It was fortunate for him that the pastor of the parish , although he did not reside in it , did at least once a week call in at Mr F 's school , and examine the boys .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 32]: Mr Furness , who was always sober during the school hours , was very proud of these visits , and used to point out little Joey as his most promising scholar .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 71]: This induced the pastor to take more immediate notice of our hero , and the commendation which he received , and the advice that was bestowed upon him , was probably the great cause why Joey did attend assiduously to his lessons , which his otherwise vagrant life would have disinclined him to do ; and also kept a character for honesty and good principle , which he really deserved .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 65]: Indeed , his father and mother , setting aside poaching , and the secrecy resorted to in consequence , were by no means bad examples in the ordinary course of life ; they did to their neighbours as they would be done by , were fair and honest in their dealings , and invariably inculcated probity and a regard to truth on their son .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 20]: This may appear anomalous to many of our readers , but there are many strange anomalies in this world .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 41]: It may therefore be stated in a very few words , that although our little hero had every chance of eventually following the road to ruin , yet , up to the present time , he had not entered it .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 73]: Such was the life led by little Joey for three years subsequent to our introduction of him to the reader ; every day he became more useful to his father ; latterly he had not attended school but in the forenoon , for , as we have before observed , Joey could , from his diminutive size and unsuspicious appearance , do much that his father would not have ventured to attempt .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 45]: He was as well versed in the art of snaring as his father , and sauntering like a child about the fields and hedge-rows , would examine his nooses , take out the game , and hide it till he could bring it home .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 62]: Sometimes he would go out at night attended only by Mum , and the dog would invariably give him mute notice , by simply standing with his ears and tail erect , when the keepers had discovered the snares , and were lying in wait for the poacher , to lay hold of him when he came to ascertain his success .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 69]: Even in such a case , Joey very often would not retreat , but , crawling on his stomach , would arrive at the snare , and take out the animal without the keepers perceiving him ; for their eyes were invariably directed to the horizon , watching the appearance of some stout figure of a man , while Joey crawled along , bearing away the prize unseen .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 22]: At other times , Joey would reap a rich harvest in the broad day , by means of his favourite game-cock .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 112]: Having put on the animal his steel spurs , he would plunge into the thickest of the cover , and , selecting some small spot of cleared ground for the combat , he would throw down his gallant bird , and conceal himself in the brushwood ; the game-cock would immediately crow , and his challenge was immediately answered by the pugnacious male pheasant , who flew down to meet him : the combat was short , for the pheasant was soon pierced by the sharp steel of his adversary ; and as one antagonist fell dead , again would the game-cock crow , and his challenge be accepted by another .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 40]: In an hour or two the small arena was a field of blood Joey would creep forward , put his victorious cock into his bag together with many dead adversaries , and watch an opportunity for a safe retreat .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 51]: Such was the employment of our hero ; and although suspicion had often been attached to his father , none had an idea that there had been a violation of the laws on the part of the son , when an event took place which changed our hero 's destiny .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 21]: IN WHICH THE AUTHOR HAS ENDEAVOURED , WITH ALL HIS POWER , TO SUIT THE PRESENT TASTE OF THE PUBLIC .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 15]: We have said that Byres was the receiver of the game obtained by Rushbrook .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 46]: It so happened , that in these accounts Byres had not adhered to his duty towards his neighbour ; in fact , he attempted to over-reach , but without success , and from that time Byres became Rushbrook 's determined , but secret , enemy .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 46]: Some months had passed since their disagreement , and there was a mutual mistrust -LRB- as both men were equally revengeful in their tempers -RRB- , when they happened to meet late on a Saturday night at the ale-house , which was their usual resort .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 22]: Furness the schoolmaster was there ; he and many others had already drunk too much ; all were boisterous and noisy .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 57]: A few of the wives of those drinking were waiting patiently and sorrowfully outside , their arms folded in their aprons as a defence against the cold , watching for their husbands to come out , that they might coax them home before the major part of the week 's earnings had been spent in liquor .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 49]: Byres had the paper in his hand -- he had taken it from the schoolmaster , who was too far gone to read it , and was declaiming loudly against all governments , monarchy , and laws when a stranger entered the tap-room where they were all assembled .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 92]: Rushbrook was at the time sitting down , intending quietly to take a pint and walk home , as he had too much respect for the Sabbath to follow his profession of poacher on the morning of that day : he did not intend , therefore , to resort to his usual custom of pretending to be intoxicated ; but when the stranger came in , to his great surprise he observed a glance of recognition between him and Byres , after which they appeared as if they were perfect strangers .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 30]: Rushbrook watched them carefully , but so as not to let them perceive he was so doing , when a beckon from the stranger to Byres was again made .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 25]: Byres continued to read the paper and to harangue , but at the same time took an opportunity of making a signal in reply .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 35]: There was something in the stranger 's appearance which told Rushbrook that he was employed as a keeper , or something in that way , for we often single out our enemies by instinct .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 31]: That there was mischief in the wind Rushbrook felt sure , and his heart misgave him the more so , as occasionally the eyes of both were turned towards him .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 62]: After a little reflection , Rushbrook determined to feign intoxication , as he had so often done before : he called for another pint , for some time talked very loud , and at last laid his head on the table ; after a time he lifted it up again , drank more , and then fell back on the bench .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 23]: By degrees the company thinned , until there was no one left but the schoolmaster , the pedlar , and the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 51]: The schoolmaster , as usual , offered to assist the pedlar in helping Rushbrook to his cottage ; but Byres replied that he was busy , and that he need not wait for Rushbrook ; the friend he had with him would assist him in taking home the drunken man .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 10]: The schoolmaster reeled home , leaving the two together .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 25]: They sat down on the bench , not far from Rushbrook , who appeared to them to be in the last stage of inebriety .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 6]: Their conversation was easily overheard .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 53]: The pedlar stated that he had watched several nights , but never could find when Rushbrook left his cottage , but he had traced the boy more than once ; that R had promised to have game ready for him on Tuesday , and would go out on Monday night for it .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 41]: In short , Rushbrook discovered that Byres was about to betray him to the man , whom , in the course of their conversation , he found out to be a game-keeper newly hired by the lord of the manor .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 27]: After a while they broke up , Byres having promised to join the keeper in his expedition , and to assist in securing his former ally .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 45]: Having made these arrangements , they then took hold of Rushbrook by the arms , and , shaking him to rouse him as much as they could , they led him home to the cottage , and left him in charge of his wife .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 49]: As soon as the door was closed , Rushbrook 's long-repressed anger could no longer be restrained : he started on his feet , and striking his fist on the table so as to terrify his wife , swore that the pedlar should pay dear for his peaching .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 20]: Upon his wife 's demanding an explanation , Rushbrook , in a few hurried sentences , explained the whole .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 24]: Jane , however she might agree with him in his indignation , like all women , shuddered at the thought of shedding blood .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 9]: She persuaded her husband to go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 21]: He consented ; but he slept not : he had but one feeling , which was vengeance towards the traitor .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 36]: When revenge enters into the breast of a man who has lived peaceably at home , fiercely as he may be impelled by the passion , he stops short at the idea of shedding blood .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 61]: But when a man who had , like Rushbrook , served so long in the army , witnessed such scenes of carnage , and so often passed his bayonet through his adversary 's body , is roused up by this fatal passion , the death of a fellow-creature becomes a matter of indifference , provided he can gratify his feelings .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 66]: Thus it was with Rushbrook , who , before he rose on the morning of that Sabbath in which , had he gone to church , he could have so often requested his trespasses might be forgiven , as he `` forgave them who trespassed against him , '' had made up his mind that nothing short of the pedlar 's death would satisfy him .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 60]: At breakfast he appeared to listen to his wife 's entreaties , and promised to do the pedlar no harm ; and told her that , instead of going out on the Monday night , as he had promised , he should go out on that very night , and by that means evade the snare laid for him .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 18]: Jane persuaded him not to go out at all ; but this Rushbrook would not consent to .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 39]: He told her that he was determined to show them that he was not to be driven off his beat , and would make Byres believe on Tuesday night that he had been out on the Monday night .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 30]: Rushbrook 's object was to have a meeting with Byres , if possible , alone , to tax him with his treachery , and then to take summary vengeance .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 81]: Aware that Byres slept at the ale-house , he went down there a little before dark , and told him that he intended going out on that night ; that it would be better if , instead of coming on Tuesday , he were to meet him at the corner of one of the covers , which he described , at an hour agreed upon , when he would make over to him the game which he might have procured .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 30]: Byres , who saw in this an excellent method of trapping Rushbrook , consented to it , intending to inform the keeper , so that he should meet Rushbrook .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 13]: The time of meeting was arranged for two o'clock in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 32]: Rushbrook was certain that Byres would leave the ale-house an hour or two before the time proposed , which would be more than sufficient for his giving information to the keeper .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 25]: He therefore remained quietly at home till twelve o'clock , when he loaded his gun , and went out without Joey or the dog .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 27]: His wife perceiving this , was convinced that he had not gone out with the intention to poach , but was pursuing his scheme of revenge .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 60]: She watched him after he left the cottage , and observed that he had gone down in the direction of the ale-house ; and she was afraid that there would be mischief between him and Byres , and she wakened Joey , desiring him to follow and watch his father , and do all he could to prevent it .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 38]: Her communication was made in such a hurried manner , that it was difficult for Joey to know what he was to do , except to watch his father 's motions , and see what took place .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 28]: This Joey perfectly understood ; and he was off in an instant , followed , as usual , by Mum , and taking with him his sack .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 15]: Our hero crept softly down the pathway , in the direction of the ale-house .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 57]: The night was dark , for the moon did not rise till two or three hours before the morning broke , and it was bitterly cold : but to darkness and cold Joey had been accustomed , and although not seen himself ; there was no object could move without being scanned by his clear vision .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 9]: He gained a hedge close to the ale-house .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 36]: Mum wanted to go on , by which Joey knew that his father must be lurking somewhere near to him : he pressed the dog down with his hand , crouched himself ; and watched .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 52]: In a few minutes a dark figure was perceived by Joey to emerge from the ale-house , and walk hastily over a turnip-field behind the premises : it had gained about half over , when another form , which Joey recognised as his father 's , stealthily followed after the first .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 79]: Joey waited a little time , and was then , with Mum , on the steps of both ; for a mile and a half each party kept at their relative distances , until they came near a furze bottom , which was about six hundred yards from the cover ; then the steps of Rushbrook were quickened , and those of Joey in proportion ; the consequence was , that the three parties rapidly neared each other .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 23]: Byres for it was he who had quitted the ale-house -- walked along leisurely , having no suspicion that he was followed .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 36]: Rushbrook was now within fifteen yards of the pedlar , and Joey at even less distance from his father , when he heard the lock of his father 's gun click as he cocked it .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 22]: `` Father , '' said Joey , not over loud , `` do n't -- '' `` Who 's there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 7]: cried the pedlar , turning round .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 20]: The only reply was the flash and report of the gun ; and the pedlar dropped among the furze .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 6]: `` Oh father -- father !
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 7]: -- what have you done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 8]: exclaimed Joey , coming up to him .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 7]: `` You here , Joey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 3]: said Rushbrook .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 7]: `` Why are you here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 9]: `` Mother sent me , '' replied Joey .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 15]: `` To be evidence against me , '' replied his father , in wrath .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 4]: `` Oh no !
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 5]: -- to stop you .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 8]: What have you done , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 33]: `` What I almost wish I had not done now , '' replied he , mournfully ; `` but it is done , and -- '' `` And what , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 13]: `` I am a murderer , I suppose , '' replied Rushbrook .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 31]: `` He would have peached , Joey -- have had me transported , to work in chains for the rest of my days , merely for taking a few pheasants .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 18]: Let us go home ; '' but Rushbrook did not move , although he proposed so doing .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 18]: He leant upon his gun , with his eyes fixed in the direction where Byres had fallen .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 15]: Joey stood by him -- for nearly ten minutes not a word was spoken .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 39]: At last Rushbrook said -- `` Joey , my boy , I 've killed many a man in my time , and I have thought nothing of it ; I slept as sound as ever the next night .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 44]: But then , you see , I was a soldier , and it was my trade , and I could look on the man I had killed without feeling sorrow or shame ; but I ca n't look upon this man , Joey .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 17]: He was my enemy ; but -- I 've murdered him -- I feel it now .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 23]: Go up to him , boy -- you are not afraid to meet him -- and see if he be dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 47]: Joey , although generally speaking fear was a stranger to him , did , however , feel afraid ; his hands had often been dyed with the blood of a hare or of a bird , but he had not yet seen death in his fellow-creatures .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 61]: He advanced slowly and tremulously through the dark towards the furze-bush in which the body laid ; Mum followed , raising first one paw and pausing , then the other , and as they came to the body , the dog raised his head and gave such a mournful howl , that it induced our hero to start back again .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 14]: After a time Joey recovered himself ; and again advanced to the body .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 54]: He leant over it , he could distinguish but the form ; he listened , and not the slightest breathing was to be heard ; he whispered the pedlar 's name , but there was no reply ; he put his hand upon his breast , and removed it reeking with warm blood .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 19]: `` Father , he must be dead , quite dead , '' whispered Joey , who returned trembling .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 7]: `` What shall we do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 43]: `` We must go home , '' replied Rushbrook ; `` this is a bad night 's work ; '' and , without exchanging another word until their arrival , Rushbrook and Joey proceeded back to the cottage , followed by Mum .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 11]: THE SINS OF THE FATHER ARE VISITED UPON THE CHILD .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 42]: Jane had remained in a state of great anxiety during her husband 's absence , watching and listening to every sound ; every five minutes raising the latch of the door , and looking out , hoping to see him return .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 42]: As the time went on , her alarm increased ; she laid her head down on the table and wept ; she could find no consolation , no alleviation of her anxiety ; she dropped down on her knees and prayed .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 21]: She was still appealing to the Most High , when a blow on the door announced her husband 's return .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 44]: There was a sulken gloom over his countenance as he entered : he threw his gun carelessly on one side , so that it fell , and rattled against the paved floor ; and this one act was to her ominous of evil .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 36]: He sat down without speaking ; falling back in the chair , and lifting his eyes up to the rafters above , he appeared to be in deep thought , and unconscious of her presence .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 6]: `` What has happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 14]: inquired his wife , trembling as she laid her hand on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 13]: `` Do n't speak to me now , '' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 19]: `` Joey , '' said the frightened woman in a whisper , `` what has he done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 20]: Joey answered not , but raised his hand , red with the blood which was now dried upon it .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 36]: Jane uttered a faint cry , dropped on her knees , and covered her face , while Joey walked into the back kitchen , and busied himself in removing the traces of the dark deed .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 29]: A quarter of an hour had elapsed -- Joey had returned , and taken his seat upon his low stool , and not a word had been exchanged .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 30]: There certainly is a foretaste of the future punishment which awaits crime ; for how dreadful were the feelings of those who were now sitting down in the cottage !
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 37]: Rushbrook was evidently stupefied from excess of feeling ; first , the strong excitement which had urged him to the deed ; and now from the reaction the prostration of mental power which had succeeded it .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 49]: Jane dreaded the present and the future -- whichever way she turned her eyes the gibbet was before her -- the clanking of chains in her ears ; in her vision of the future , scorn , misery , and remorse -- she felt only for her husband .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 10]: Joey , poor boy , he felt for both .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 26]: Even the dog showed , as he looked up into Joey 's face , that he was aware that a foul deed had been done .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 26]: The silence which it appeared none would venture to break , was at last dissolved by the clock of the village church solemnly striking two .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 70]: They all started up -- it was a warning -- it reminded them of the bell tolling for the dead -- of time and of eternity ; but time present quickly effaced for the moment other ideas ; yes , it was time to act ; in four hours more it would be daylight , and the blood of the murdered man would appeal to his fellow-men for vengeance .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 31]: The sun would light them to the deed of darkness -- the body would be brought home -- the magistrates would assemble -- and who would be the party suspected ?
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 5]: `` Merciful Heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 10]: exclaimed Jane , `` what can be done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 10]: `` There is no proof ; '' muttered Rushbrook .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 28]: `` Yes , there is , '' observed Joey , `` I left my bag there , when I stooped down to -- '' `` Silence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 3]: cried Rushbrook .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 45]: `` Yes , '' continued he , bitterly , to his wife , `` this is your doing ; you must send the boy after me , and now there will be evidence against me ; I shall owe my death to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 7]: `` Oh , say not so !
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 5]: say not so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 44]: replied Jane , falling down on her knees , and weeping bitterly as she buried her face in his lap ; `` but there is yet time , '' cried she , starting up ; `` Joey can go and fetch the bag .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 11]: You will , Joey : wo n't you , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 10]: you are not afraid -- you are innocent . ''
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 16]: `` Better leave it where it is , mother , '' replied Joey , calmly .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 65]: Rushbrook looked up at his son with surprise ; Jane caught him by the arm ; she felt convinced the boy had some reason for what he said -- probably some plan that would ward off suspicion -- yet how could that be , it was evidence against them , and after looking earnestly at the boy 's face , she dropped his arm .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 7]: `` Why so , Joey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 7]: said she , with apparent calmness .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 34]: `` Because , '' replied Joey , `` I have been thinking about it all this time ; I am innocent , and therefore I do not mind if they suppose me guilty .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 20]: The bag is known to be mine -- the gun I must throw into a ditch two fields off .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 30]: You must give me some money , if you have any ; if not , I must go without it ; but there is no time to be lost .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 37]: I must be off and away from here in ten minutes ; to-morrow ask every one if they have seen or heard of me , because I have left the house some time during the night .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 102]: I shall have a good start before that ; besides , they may not find the pedlar for a day or two , perhaps ; at all events , not till some time after I am gone ; and then , you see , mother , the bag which is found by him , and the gun in the ditch , will make them think it is me who killed him ; but they will not be able to make out whether I killed him by accident , and ran away from fear , or whether I did it on purpose .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 17]: So now , mother , that 's my plan , for it will save father . ''
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 13]: `` And I shall never see you again , my child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 4]: replied his mother .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 7]: `` That 's as may be .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 19]: You may go away from here after a time , mother , when the thing has blown over .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 12]: Come , mother , there is no time to lose . ''
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 12]: `` Rushbrook , what say you -- what think you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 6]: said Jane to her husband .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 49]: `` Why , Jane , at all events , the boy must have left us , for , you see , I told Byres , and I 've no doubt but he told the keeper , if he met him , that I should bring Joey with me .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 29]: I did it to deceive him ; and , as sure as I sit here , they will have that boy up as evidence against his father . ''
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 18]: `` To be sure they will , '' cried Joey ; `` and what could I do ?
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 25]: I dare not -- I do n't think I could tell a lie ; and yet I would not peach upon father , neither .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 13]: What can I do -- but be out of the way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 37]: `` That 's the truth -- away with you , then , my boy , and take a father 's blessing with you -- a guilty father 's , it is true ; God forgive me .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 21]: Jane give him all the money you have ; lose not a moment : quick , woman , quick . ''
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 8]: And Rushbrook appeared to be in agony .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 21]: Jane hastened to the cupboard , opened a small box , and poured the contents into the hands of Joey .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 17]: `` Farewell , my boy , '' said Rushbrook ; `` your father thanks you . ''
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 9]: `` Heaven preserve you , my child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 14]: cried Jane , embracing him , as the tears rained down her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 7]: `` You will write -- no !
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 6]: you must not -- mercy !
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 3]: -- mercy !
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 9]: -- I shall never see him again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 9]: -- and the mother fainted on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 18]: The tears rose in our hero 's eyes as he beheld the condition of his poor mother .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 50]: Once more he grasped his father 's hand ; and then , catching up the gun , he went out at the back door , and driving back the dog , who would have followed him , made over the fields as fast as his legs would carry him .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIX .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 11]: `` THE WORLD BEFORE HIM , WHERE TO CHOOSE . ''
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 53]: We have no doubt but many of our readers have occasionally , when on a journey , come to where the road divides into two , forking out in different directions , and the road being new to them , have not known which of the two branches they ought to take .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 18]: This happens , as it often does in a novel , to be our case just now .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 12]: Shall we follow little Joey , or his father and mother ?
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 6]: -- that is the question .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 32]: We believe that when a road does thus divide , the wider of the two branches is generally selected , as being supposed to be the continuation of the high road .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 34]: We shall ourselves act upon that principle ; and , as the hero of the tale is of more consequence than characters accessory , we shall follow up the fortunes of little Joey .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 61]: As soon as our hero had deposited the gun so that it might be easily discovered by any one passing by , he darted into the high road , and went off with all the speed that he was capable of , and it was not yet light when he found himself at least ten miles from his native village .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 53]: As the day dawned , he quitted the high road , and took to the fields , keeping a parallel course , so as to still increase the distance ; it was not until he had made fifteen miles , that , finding himself exhausted , he sat down to recover himself .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 67]: From the time that he had left the cottage until the present , Joey had had but one overwhelming idea in his head , which was , to escape from pursuit , and by his absence to save his father from suspicion ; but now that he had effected that purpose , and was in a state of quiescence , other thoughts rushed upon his mind .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 98]: First , the scenes of the last few hours presented themselves in rapid array before him -- he thought of the dead man , and he looked at his hand to ascertain if the bloody marks had been effaced ; and then he thought of his poor mother 's state when he quitted the cottage , and the remembrance made him weep bitterly : his own position came next upon him , -- a boy , twelve years of age , adrift upon the world -- how was he to live -- what was he to do ?
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 29]: This reminded him that his mother had given him money ; he put his hand into his pocket , and pulled it out to ascertain what he possessed .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 21]: He had 1 pound , 16 shillings ; to him a large sum , and it was all in silver .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 24]: As he had become more composed , he began to reflect upon what he had better do ; where should he go to ?
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 3]: -- London .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 21]: It was a long way , he knew , but the farther he was away from home , the better .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 17]: Besides , he had heard much of London , and that every one got employment there .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 35]: Joey resolved that he would go to London ; he knew that he had taken the right road so far , and having made up his mind , he rose up , and proceeded .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 58]: He knew that , if possible , he must not allow himself to be seen on the road for a day or two , and he was puzzled how he was to get food , which he already felt would be very acceptable ; and then , what account was he to give of himself if questioned ?
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 47]: Such were the cogitations of our little hero as he wended his way till he came to a river , which was too deep and rapid for him to attempt to ford -- he was obliged to return to the high road to cross the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 46]: He looked around him before he climbed over the low stone wall , and perceiving nobody , he jumped on the footpath , and proceeded to the bridge , where he suddenly faced an old woman with a basket of brown cakes something like ginger-bread .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 21]: Taken by surprise , and hardly knowing what to say , he inquired if a cart had passed that way .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 33]: `` Yes , child , but it must be a good mile ahead of you , '' said the old woman , `` and you must walk fast to overtake it . ''
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 20]: `` I have had no breakfast yet , and I am hungry ; do you sell your cakes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 13]: `` Yes , child , what else do I make them for ?
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 9]: three a penny , and cheap too . ''
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 46]: Joey felt in his pocket until he had selected a sixpence , and pulling it out , desired the old woman to give him cakes for it , and , taking the pile in his hand , he set off as fast as he could .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 25]: As soon as he was out of sight , he again made his way into the fields , and breakfasted upon half his store .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 52]: He then continued his journey until nearly one o'clock , when , tired out with his exertions , as soon as he had finished the remainder of his cakes , he laid down under a rick of corn , and fell fast asleep , having made twenty miles since he started .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 46]: In his hurry to escape pursuit , and the many thoughts which occupied his brain , Joey had made no observation on the weather ; if he had , he probably would have looked after some more secure shelter than the lee-side of a haystack .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 66]: He slept soundly , and he had not been asleep more than an hour , when the wind changed , and the snow fell fast ; nevertheless , Joey slept on , and probably never would have awakened more , had it not been that a shepherd and his dog were returning home in the evening , and happened to pass close to the haystack .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 115]: By this time Joey had been covered with a layer of snow , half an inch deep , and had it not been for the dog , who went up to where he laid , and commenced pawing the snow off of him , he would have been passed by undiscovered by the shepherd , who , after some trouble , succeeded in rousing our hero from his torpor , and half dragging , half lifting him , contrived to lead him across one or two fields , until they arrived at a blacksmith 's shop , in a small village , before Joey could have been said to have recovered his scattered senses .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 20]: Two hours ' more sleep and there would have been no further history to give of our little hero .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 35]: He was dragged to the forge , the fire of which glowed under the force of the bellows , and by degrees , as the warmth reached him , he was restored to self-possession .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 28]: To the inquiries made as to who he was , and from where he came , he now answered as he had before arranged in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 54]: His father and mother were a long way before him ; he was going to London , but having been tired , he had fallen asleep under the haystack , and he was afraid that if he went not on to London directly , he never might find his father and mother again .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 20]: `` Oh , then , '' replied the shepherd , `` they have gone on before , have they ?
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 11]: Well , you 'll catch them , no doubt . ''
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 50]: The blacksmith 's wife , who had been a party to what was going on , now brought up a little warm ale , which quite re-established Joey ; and at the same time a waggon drove up to the door , and stopped at the blacksmith 's shop .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 20]: `` I must have a shoe tacked on the old mare , my friend , '' said the driver .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 8]: `` You wo n't be long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 10]: `` Not five minutes , '' replied the smith .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 8]: `` You 're going to London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 6]: `` Yes , sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 28]: `` Here 's a poor boy that has been left behind by his father and mother somehow -- you would n't mind giving him a lift ? ''
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 23]: `` Well , I do n't know ; I suppose I must be paid for it in the world to come . ''
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 16]: `` And good pay too , if you earn it , '' observed the blacksmith .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 48]: `` Well , it wo n't make much difference to my eight horses , I expect , '' said the driver , looking at Joey ; `` so come along , youngster : you may perch yourself on top of the straw , above the goods . ''
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 47]: `` First come in with me , child , '' said the wife of the blacksmith ; `` you must have some good victuals to take with you -- so , while you shoe the horse , John , I 'll see to the boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 28]: The woman put before Joey a dish in which were the remains of more than one small joint , and our hero commenced his attack without delay .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 9]: `` Have you any money , child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 4]: inquired the woman .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 38]: Joey , who thought she might expect payment , replied , `` Yes ma'am , I 've got a shilling ; '' and he pulled one out of his pocket and laid it out on the table .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 5]: `` Bless the child !
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 16]: what do you take me for , to think that I would touch your money ?
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 20]: You are a long way from London yet , although you have got such a chance to get there .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 12]: Do you know where to go when you get there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 22]: `` Yes , ma'am , '' replied Joey ; `` I shall get work in the stables , I believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 37]: `` Well , I dare say that you will ; but in the meantime you had better save your shilling -- so we 'll find something to put this meat and bread up for your journey .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 7]: Are you quite warm now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 10]: `` Yes , thank ` ee , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 73]: Joey , who had ceased eating , had another warm at the fire , and in a few minutes , having bade adieu , and giving his thanks to the humane people , he was buried in the straw below the tilt of the waggon , with his provisions deposited beside him , and the waggon went on his slow and steady pace , to the tune of its own jingling bells .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 30]: Joey , who had quite recovered from his chill , nestled among the straw , congratulating himself that he should now arrive safely in London , without more questioning .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 43]: And such was the case : in three days and three nights , without any further adventure , he found himself , although he was not aware of it , in Oxford-street , somewhat about eight or nine o'clock in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 11]: `` Do you know your way now , boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 4]: said the carman .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 25]: `` I can ask it , '' replied Joey , `` as soon as I can go to the light and read the address .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 22]: Good-bye , and thank you , '' continued he , glad at last to be clear of any more evasive replies .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 31]: The carman shook him by the hand as they passed the Boar and Castle , and bade him farewell , and our hero found himself alone in the vast metropolis .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 6]: What was he to do ?
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 23]: He hardly knew -- but one thought struck him , which was , that he must find a bed for the night .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 52]: He wandered up and down Oxford Street for some time , but every one walked so quick that he was afraid to speak to them : at last a little girl , of seven or eight years of age , passed by him , and looked him earnestly in the face .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 16]: `` Can you tell me where I can get a bed for the night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 3]: said Joey .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 7]: `` Have you any brads ? ''
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 4]: was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 6]: `` What are those ? ''
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 3]: said Joey .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 17]: `` Any money , to be sure ; why , you 're green -- quite . ''
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 9]: `` Yes , I have a shilling . ''
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 16]: `` That will do -- come along , and you shall sleep with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 16]: Joey followed her very innocently , and very glad that he had been so fortunate .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 30]: She led him to a street out of Tottenham-court-road , in which there were no lamps -- the houses , however , were large , and many stories high .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 18]: `` Take my hand , '' said the girl , `` and mind how you tread . ''
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 38]: Guided by his new companion , Joey arrived at a door that was wide open : they entered , and , assisted by the girl , he went up a dark staircase , to the second storey .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 27]: She opened a room-door , when Joey found himself in company with about twenty other children , of about the same age , of both sexes .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 15]: Here were several beds on the floor of the room , which was spacious .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 51]: In the centre were huddled together on the floor , round a tallow candle , eight or ten of the inmates , two of them playing with a filthy pack of cards , while the others looked over them : others were lying down or asleep on the several beds .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 23]: `` This is my bed , '' said the girl ; `` if you are tired you can turn in at once .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 9]: I sha n't go to bed yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 26]: Joey was tired , and he went to bed ; it was not very clean , but he had been used to worse lodgings lately .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 51]: It need hardly be observed that Joey had got into very bad company , the whole of the inmates of the room consisting of juvenile thieves and pickpockets , who in the course of time obtain promotion in their profession , until they are ultimately sent off to Botany Bay .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 68]: Attempts have been made to check these nurseries of vice : but pseudo-philanthropists have resisted such barbarous innovation : and upon the Mosaic principle , that you must not seethe the kid in the mother 's milk , they are protected and allowed to arrive at full maturity , and beyond the chance of being reclaimed , until they are ripe for the penalties of the law .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 20]: Joey slept soundly , and when he awoke next morning found that his little friend was not with him .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 26]: He dressed himself ; and then made another discovery , which was , that every farthing of his money had been abstracted from his pockets .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 62]: Of this unpleasant fact he ventured to complain to one or two boys , who were lying on other beds with their clothes on ; they laughed at him , called him a greenhorn , and made use of other language , which at once let Joey know the nature of the company with whom he had been passing the night .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 37]: After some altercation , three or four of them bundled him out of the room , and Joey found himself in the street without a farthing , and very much inclined to eat a good breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 95]: There is no portion of the world , small as it is in comparison with the whole , in which there is more to be found to eat and to drink , more comfortable lodgings , or accommodation and convenience of every kind , than in the metropolis of England , provided you have the means to obtain it ; but notwithstanding this abundance , there is no place , probably , where you will find it more difficult to obtain a portion of it , if you happen to have an empty pocket .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 19]: Joey went into a shop here and there to ask for employment -- he was turned away everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 32]: He spent the first day in this manner , and at night , tired and hungry , he laid down on the stone steps of a portico , and fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 14]: The next morning he awoke shivering with the cold , faint with hunger .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 18]: He asked at the areas for something to eat , but no one would give him anything .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 22]: At a pump he obtained a drink of water -- that was all he could obtain , for it cost nothing .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 25]: Another day passed without food , and the poor boy again sheltered himself for the night at a rich man 's door in Berkeley-square .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 8]: IF YOU WANT EMPLOYMENT GO TO LONDON .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 18]: The exhausted lad awoke again , and pursued his useless task of appeals for food and employment .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 43]: It was a bright day , and there was some little warmth to be collected by basking in the rays of the sun , when our hero wended his way through Saint James 's Park , faint , hungry , and disconsolate .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 29]: There were several people seated on the benches ; and Joey , weak as he was , did not venture to go near them , but crawled along .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 50]: At last , after wandering up and down , looking for pity in everybody 's face as they passed , and receiving none , he felt that he could not stand much longer , and emboldened by desperation , he approached a bench that was occupied by one person .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 35]: At first he only rested on the arm of the bench , but , as the person sitting down appeared not to observe him , he timidly took a seat at the farther end .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 27]: The personage who occupied the other part of the bench was a man dressed in a morning suit _ a la militaire _ and black stock .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 29]: He had clean gloves and a small cane in his hand , with which he was describing circles on the gravel before him , evidently in deep thought .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 16]: In height he was full six feet , and his proportions combined strength with symmetry .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 37]: His features were remarkably handsome , his dark hair had a natural curl , and his whiskers and mustachios -LRB- for he wore those military appendages -RRB- were evidently the objects of much attention and solicitude .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 44]: We may as well here observe , that although so favoured by nature , still there would have been considered something wanting in him by those who had been accustomed to move in the first circles , to make him the refined gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 18]: His movements and carriage were not inelegant , but there was a certain _ retinue _ wanting .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 16]: He bowed well , but still it was not exactly the bow of a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 18]: The nursery-maids as they passed by said , `` Dear me , what a handsome gentleman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 24]: but had the remark been made by a higher class , it would have been qualified into `` What a handsome man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 14]: His age was apparently about five-and-thirty -- it might have been something more .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 23]: After a short time he left off his mechanical amusements , and turning round , perceived little Joey at the farther end .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 50]: Whether from the mere inclination to talk , or that he thought it presuming in our hero to seat himself upon the same bench , he said to him -- `` I hope you are comfortable , my little man ; but perhaps you 've forgot your message . ''
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 34]: `` I have no message , sir , for I know no one : and I am not comfortable , for I am starving , '' replied Joey , in a tremulous voice .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 24]: `` Are you in earnest now , when you say that , boy ; or is it that you 're humbugging me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 5]: Joey shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 25]: `` I have eaten nothing since the day before yesterday morning , and I feel faint and sick , '' replied he at last .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 21]: His new companion looked earnestly in our hero 's face , and was satisfied that what he said was true .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 32]: `` As I hope to be saved , '' exclaimed he , `` it 's my opinion that a little bread and butter would not be a bad thing for you .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 30]: Here , '' continued he , putting his hand into his coat-pocket , `` take these coppers , and go and get some thing into your little vitals . ''
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 11]: `` Thank you , sir , thank you , kindly .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 20]: But I do n't know where to go : I only came up to London two days ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 19]: `` Then follow me as fast as your little pins can carry you , '' said the other .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 35]: They had not far to go , for a man was standing close to Spring-garden-gate with hot tea and bread and butter , and in a few moments Joey 's hunger was considerably appeased .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 12]: `` Do you feel better now , my little cock ? ''
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 9]: `` Yes , sir , thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 32]: `` That 's right , and now we will go back to the bench , and then you shall tell me all about yourself ; just to pass away the time .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 40]: Now , '' said he , as he took his seat , `` in the first place , who is your father , if you have any ; and if you have n't any , what was he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 16]: `` Father and mother are both alive , but they are a long way off .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 13]: Father was a soldier , and he has a pension now . ''
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 4]: `` A soldier !
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 8]: Do you know in what regiment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 12]: `` Yes , it was the 53rd , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 9]: `` By the powers , my own regiment !
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 12]: And what is your name , then , and his ? ''
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 7]: `` Rushbrook , '' replied Joey .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 11]: `` My pivot man , by all that 's holy .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 11]: Now have n't you nicely dropped on your feet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 13]: `` I do n't know , sir , '' replied our hero .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 36]: `` But I do ; your father was the best fellow I had in my company -- the best forager , and always took care of his officer , as a good man should do .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 39]: If there was a turkey , or a goose , or a duck , or a fowl , or a pig within ten miles of us , he would have it : he was the boy for poaching .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 28]: And now tell me -LRB- and mind you tell the truth when you meet with a friend -RRB- what made you leave your father and mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 62]: `` I was afraid of being taken up -- '' and here Joey stopped , for he hardly knew what to say ; trust his new acquaintance with his father 's secret he dare not , neither did he like to tell what was directly false ; as the reader will perceive by his reply , he partly told the truth .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 7]: `` Afraid of being taken up !
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 14]: Why , what could they take up a spalpeen like you for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 28]: `` Poaching , '' replied Joey ; `` father poached too : they had proof against me , so I came away with father 's consent . ''
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 3]: `` Poaching !
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 27]: well , I 'm not surprised at that , for if ever it was in the blood , it is in yours -- that 's truth .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 10]: And what do you mean to do now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 10]: `` Anything I can to earn my bread . ''
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 12]: `` What can you do -- besides poaching , of course ?
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 7]: Can you read and write ? ''
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 6]: `` Oh , yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 32]: `` Would you like to be a servant -- clean boots , brush clothes , stand behind a cab , run messages , carry notes , and hold your tongue ? ''
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 17]: `` I could do all that , I think -- I am twelve years old . ''
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 6]: `` The devil you are !
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 25]: Well then , for your father 's sake , I 'll see what I can do for you , till you can do better .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 27]: I 'll fit you out as a tiger , and what 's more , unless I am devilish hard up , I wo n't sell you .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 4]: So come along .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 6]: What 's your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 4]: `` Joey . ''
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 48]: `` Sure that was your father 's name before you , I now recollect and should any one take the trouble to ask you what may be the name of your master , you may reply , with a safe conscience , that it 's Captain O'Donahue .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 4]: Now come along .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 27]: Not close after me -- you may as well keep open file just now , till I 've made you look a little more decent . ''
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 5]: A DISSERTATION UPON PEDIGREE .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 38]: Our readers will not perhaps be displeased if we introduce Captain O'Donahue more particularly to their notice : we shall therefore devote this chapter to giving some account of his birth , parentage , and subsequent career .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 29]: If the father of Captain O'Donahue was to be believed , the race of the O'Donahues were kings in Ireland long before the O'Connors were ever heard of .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 37]: How far this may be correct we can not pretend to offer an opinion , further than that no man can be supposed to know so much of a family 's history as the descendant himself .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 72]: The documents were never laid before us , and we have only the positive assertion of the Squireen O'Donahue , who asserted not only that they were kings in Ireland before the O'Connors , whose pretensions to ancestry he treated with contempt , but further , that they were renowned for their strength , and were famous for using the longest bows in battle that were ever known or heard of .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 10]: Here we have circumstantial evidence , although not proof .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 49]: If strong , they might have been kings in Ireland , for there `` might has been right '' for many centuries ; and certainly their acquirements were handed down to posterity , as no one was more famous for drawing the long bow than the Squireen O'Donahue .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 17]: Upon these points , however , we must leave our readers to form their own opinions .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 33]: Perhaps some one more acquainted with the archives of the country may be able to set us right if we are wrong , or to corroborate our testimony if we are right .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 46]: In his preface to `` Anne of Geierstein , '' Sir Walter Scott observes , that `` errors , however trivial , ought , in his opinion , never to be pointed out to the author without meeting with a candid and respectful acknowledgement . ''
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 66]: Following the example of so great a man , we can only say , that if any gentleman can prove or disprove the assertion of the Squireen O'Donahue , to wit , that the O'Donahues were kings of Ireland long before the O'Connors were heard of ; we shall be most happy to acknowledge the favour , and insert his remarks in the next edition .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 75]: We should be further obliged to the same party , or indeed , any other , it they would favour us with an idea of what was implied by a king of Ireland in those days ; that is to say , whether he held a court , taxed his subjects , collected revenue , kept up a standing army , sent ambassadors to foreign countries , and did all which kings do nowadays ?
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 28]: or whether his shillelagh was his sceptre , and his domain some furze-crowned hills and a bog , the intricacies of which were known only to himself ?
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 18]: whether he was arrayed in jewelled robes , with a crown of gold weighing on his temples ?
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 20]: or whether he went bare-legged and bare-armed , with his bare locks flowing in luxurious wildness to the breeze ?
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 10]: We request an answer to this in full simplicity .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 90]: We observe that even in Ireland now , a fellow six feet high , and stout in proportion , is called a `` prince of a fellow , '' although he has not wherewithal to buy a paper of tobacco to supply his dhudeen : and , arguing from this fact , we are inclined to think that a few more inches in stature , and commensurate muscular increase of power , would in former times have raised the `` heir-apparent '' to the dignity of the Irish throne .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 17]: But these abstruse speculations have led us from our history , which we must now resume .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 131]: Whatever may once have been the importance of the house of O'Donahue , one thing is certain , that there are many ups and downs in this world ; every family in it has its wheel of fortune , which revolves faster or slower as the fates decree , and the descendant of kings before the O'Connor 's time was now descended into a species of Viceroy , Squireen O'Donahue being the steward of certain wild estates in the county of Galway , belonging to a family who for many years had shown a decided aversion to the natural beauties of the country , and had thought proper to migrate to where , if people were not so much attached to them , they were at all events more civilised .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 9]: These estates were extensive , but not lucrative .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 83]: They abounded in rocks , brushwood , and woodcocks during the season ; and although the Squireen O'Donahue did his best , if not for his employer , at least for himself ; it was with some difficulty that he contrived to support , with anything like respectability -LRB- which in that part of the country means `` dacent clothes to wear '' -RRB- , a very numerous family , lineally descended from the most ancient of all the kings of Ireland .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 29]: Before the squireen had obtained his employment , he had sunk his rank and travelled much -- as a courier -- thereby gaining much knowledge of the world .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 33]: If , therefore , he had no wealth to leave his children , at all events he could impart to them that knowledge which is said to be better than worldly possessions .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 38]: Having three sons and eight daughters , all of them growing up healthy and strong , with commensurate appetites , he soon found that it was necessary to get rid of them as fast as he could .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 61]: His eldest , who , strange to say , for an O'Donahue , was a quiet lad , he had as a favour lent to his brother , who kept a small tobacconist and grocer 's shop in Dublin , and his brother was so fond of him , that eventually O'Carroll O'Donahue was bound to him as an apprentice .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 78]: It certainly was a degradation for the descendant of such ancient kings to be weighing out pennyworths of sugar , and supplying halfpenny papers of tobacco to the old apple and fish women ; but still there we must leave the heir-apparent while we turn to the second son , Mr Patrick O'Donahue , whose history we are now relating , having already made the reader acquainted with him by an introduction in Saint James 's Park .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINE .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 11]: IN WHICH THE ADVICE OF A FATHER DESERVES PECULIAR ATTENTION .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 37]: It may be supposed that , as steward of the estates , Squireen O'Donahue had some influence over the numerous tenants on the property , and this influence he took care to make the most of .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 38]: His assistance in a political contest was rewarded by the offer of an ensigncy for one of his sons , in a regiment then raising in Ireland , and this offer was too good to be refused .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 42]: So , one fine day , Squireen O'Donahue came home from Dublin , well bespattered with mud , and found his son Patrick also well bespattered with mud , having just returned home from a very successful expedition against the woodcocks .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 36]: `` Patrick , my jewel , '' said the Squireen , taking a seat and wiping his face , for he was rather warm with his ride , `` you 're a made man . ''
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 20]: `` And well made too , father , if the girls are anything of judges , '' replied Patrick .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 24]: `` You put me out , '' replied the Squireen ; `` you 've more to be vain of than your figure . ''
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 14]: `` And what may that be that you 're discoursing about father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 31]: `` Nothing more nor less , nor better nor worse , but you 're an ensign in his Majesty 's new regiment -- the number has escaped my memory . ''
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 16]: `` I 'd rather be a colonel , father , '' replied Patrick , musing .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 15]: `` The colonel 's to come , you spalpeen , '' said the Squireen .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 14]: `` And the fortune to make , I expect , '' replied Patrick .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 21]: `` You 've just hit it but have n't you the whole world before you to pick and choose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 18]: `` Well , '' replied Patrick , after a pause ; `` I 've no objection . ''
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 4]: `` No objection !
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 12]: Why do n't you jump out of your skin with delight ?
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 16]: At all events , you might jump high enough to break in the caling . ''
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 18]: `` There 's no ceiling to break , '' replied Patrick , looking up at the rafters .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 25]: `` That 's true enough ; but still you might go out of your seven senses in a rational sort of a way . ''
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 12]: `` I really ca n't see for why , father dear .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 81]: You tell me I 'm to leave my poor old mother , who doats upon me ; my sisters , who are fond of me ; my friends here , '' patting the dogs , `` who follow me ; the hills , that I love ; and the woodcocks , which I shoot ; to go to be shot at myself , and buried like a dead dog , without being skinned , on the field of battle . ''
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 34]: `` I tell you to go forth into the world as an officer , and make your fortune ; to come back a general , and be the greatest man of your family .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 11]: And do n't be too unhappy about not being skinned .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 23]: Before you are older or wiser , dead or alive , you 'll be skinned , I 'll answer for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 30]: `` Well , father , I 'll go ; but I expect there 'll be a good deal of ground to march over before I 'm a general . ''
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 11]: `` And you 've a good pair of legs . ''
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 11]: `` So I 'm told every day of my life .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 30]: I 'll make the best use of them when I start ; but it 's the starting I do n't like , and that 's the real truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 33]: The reader may be surprised at the indifference shown by Patrick at the intelligence communicated by his father ; but the fact was , Mr Patrick O'Donahue was very deep in love .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 28]: This cooled his national ardour ; and it must be confessed that there was every excuse , for a more lovely creature than Judith McCrae never existed .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 26]: To part with her was the only difficulty , and all his family feelings were but a cloak to the real cause of his unwillingness .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 16]: `` Nevertheless , you must start to-morrow , my boy , '' said his father .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 21]: `` What must be , must , '' replied Patrick , `` so there 's an end of the matter .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 19]: I 'll just go out for a bit of a walk , just to stretch my legs . ''
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 32]: `` They require a deal of stretching , Pat , considering you 've been twenty miles , at least , this morning , over the mountains , '' replied the Squireen .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 42]: But Patrick was out of hearing ; he had leapt over a stone wall which separated his father 's potato ground from Cornelius McCrae 's , and had hastened to Judith , whom he found very busy getting the dinner ready .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 26]: `` Judith , my dear , '' said Patrick , `` my heart 's quite broke with the bad news I have to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 11]: Sure I 'm going to leave you to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 12]: `` Now , Patrick , you 're joking , surely . ''
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 7]: `` Devil a joke in it .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 9]: I 'm an ensign in a regiment . ''
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 9]: `` Then I 'll die , Patrick . ''
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 22]: `` More like that I will , Judith ; what with grief and a bullet to help it , perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 12]: `` Now , what d'ye mean to do , Patrick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 29]: `` Mean to go , sure ; because I ca n't help myself ; and to come back again , if ever I 've the luck of it .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 11]: My heart 's leaping out of my mouth entirely . ''
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 13]: `` And mine 's dead , '' replied Judith , in tears .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 9]: `` It 's no use crying , mavourneen .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 18]: I 'll be back to dance at my own wedding , if so be I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 32]: `` There 'll be neither wedding for you , Patrick , nor wake either , for you 'll lie on the cold ground , and be ploughed in like muck . ''
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 39]: `` That 's but cold comfort from you , Judith , but we 'll hope for a better ending ; but I must go back now , and you 'll meet me this evening beyond the shealing . ''
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 24]: `` Wo n't it be for the last time , Patrick , '' replied Judith , with her apron up to her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 14]: `` If I 've any voice in the matter , I say no .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 12]: Please the pigs , I 'll come back a colonel . ''
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 17]: `` Then you 'll be no match for Judith McCrae , '' replied the sobbing girl .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 26]: `` Shoot easy , my Judith , that 's touching my honour ; if I 'm a general it will be all the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 5]: `` Oh , Patrick !
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 3]: Patrick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 42]: Patrick folded Judith in his arms , took one kiss , and then hastened out of the house , saying -- `` Remember the shealing , Judith , dear , there we 'll talk the matter over easy and comfortable . ''
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 16]: Patrick returned to his house , where he found his mother and sisters in tears .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 34]: They had received orders to prepare his wardrobe , which , by the bye , did not give them much trouble from its extent ; they only had to mend every individual article .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 64]: His father was sitting down by the hearth , and when he saw Patrick he said to him , -- `` Now just come here , my boy , and take a stool , while you listen to me and learn a little worldly wisdom , for I may not have much time to talk to you when we are at Dublin . ''
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 10]: Patrick took a seat , and was all attention .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 48]: `` You 'll just observe , Pat , that it 's a very fine thing to be an officer in the king 's army ; nobody dares to treat you ill , although you may ill-treat others , which is no small advantage in this world . ''
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 11]: `` There 's truth in that , '' replied Patrick .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 41]: `` You see , when you get into an enemy 's country , you may help yourself ; and , if you look sharp , there 's very pretty pickings -- all in a quiet way , you understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 6]: `` That , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 62]: `` You observe , Pat , that , as one of his officers , the king expects you to appear and live like a gentleman , only he forgets to give you the means of so doing ; you must , therefore , take all you can get from his Majesty , and other people must make up the difference . ''
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 13]: `` That 's a matter o ' course , '' said Patrick .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 46]: `` You 'll soon see your way clear , and find out what you may be permitted to do , and what you may not ; for the king expects you to keep up the character of a gentleman as well as the appearance . ''
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 6]: `` O ' course . ''
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 79]: `` Mayhap you may be obliged to run in debt a little -- a gentleman may do that ; mayhap you may not be able to pay -- that 's a gentleman 's case very often : if so , never go so far as twenty pounds ; first , because the law do n't reach ; and secondly , because twenty pound is quite enough to make a man suffer for the good of his country . ''
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 10]: `` There 's sense in that , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 25]: `` And , Patrick , recollect that people judge by appearances in this world , especially when they 've nothing else to go by .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 25]: If you talk small , your credit will be small ; but if you talk large , it will be just in proportion . ''
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 7]: `` I perceive , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 61]: `` It 's not much property we possess in this said county of Galway , that 's certain ; but you must talk of this property as if I was the squire , and not the steward ; and when you talk of the quantity of woodcocks you have bagged , you must say on _ our _ property . ''
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 7]: `` I understand , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 40]: `` And you must curse your stars at being a younger brother ; it will be an excuse for your having no money , but will make them believe it 's in the family , at all events . ''
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 8]: `` I perceive , '' replied Patrick .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 30]: `` There 's one thing more , Pat ; it 's an Irish regiment , so you must get out of it as soon as possible by exchange . ''
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 5]: `` For why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 5]: `` This for why .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 27]: You will be among those born too near home , and who may doubt all you say , because your story may interfere with their own .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 26]: Get into an English regiment by all means , and there you 'll be beyond the reach of contradiction , which ai n't pleasant . ''
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 7]: `` True enough , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 118]: `` Treasure up all I have told you -- it 's worldly wisdom , and you have your fortune to make ; so now recollect , never hold back at a forlorn hope ; volunteer for everything ; volunteer to be blown from a cannon 's mouth , so that they will give you promotion for that same ; volunteer to go all over the world , into the other world , and right through that again into the one that comes after that , if there is any , and then one thing will be certain , either that you 'll be colonel or general , or else -- '' `` Else what , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 64]: `` That you wo n't require to be made either , seeing that you 'll be past all making ; but luck 's all , and lucky it is , by the bye , that I have a little of the squire 's rent in hand to fit you out with , or how we should have managed , the saints only know .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 31]: As it is , I must sink it on the next year 's account ; but that 's more easy to do than to fit you out with no money .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 27]: I must beg the tenants off , make the potato crop fail entirely , and report twenty , by name at least , dead of starvation .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 12]: Serve him right for spending his money out of Old Ireland .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 21]: It 's only out of real patriotism that I cheat him -- just to spend the money in the country .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 42]: And now , Patrick , I 've done ; now you may go and square your accounts with Judith , for I know now where the cat jumps ; but I 'll leave old Time alone for doing his work . ''
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 70]: Such was the advice of the Squireen to his son ; and , as worldly wisdom , it was not so bad ; and , certainly , when a lad is cast adrift in the world , the two best things you can bestow on him are a little worldly wisdom and a little money , for without the former , the latter and he will soon part company .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 36]: The next day they set off for Dublin , Patrick 's head being in a confused jumble of primitive good feeling , Judith McCrae , his father 's advice , and visions of future greatness .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 28]: He was fitted out , introduced to the officers , and then his father left him his blessing and his own way to make in the world .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 40]: In a fortnight the regiment was complete , and they were shipped to Liverpool , and from Liverpool to Maidstone , where , being all newly raised men , they were to remain for a time to be disciplined .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 32]: Before the year had expired , Patrick had followed his father 's advice , and exchanged , receiving a difference , with an ensign of a regiment going on foreign service .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 21]: He was sent to the West Indies : but the seasons were healthy , and he returned home an ensign .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 23]: He volunteered abroad again after five years , and gained his lieutenant 's commission , from a death vacancy , without purchase .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 48]: After a fifteen years ' hard service , the desired Captain 's commission came at last , and O'Donahue , having been so unsuccessful in his military career , retired upon half-pay , determined , if possible , to offer his handsome person in exchange for competence .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 45]: But , during the fifteen years which had passed away , a great change had come over the ingenuous and unsophisticated Patrick O'Donahue ; he had mixed so long with a selfish and heartless world , that his primitive feelings had gradually worn away .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 46]: Judith had , indeed , never been forgotten ; but she was now at rest , for , by mistake , Patrick had been returned dead of the yellow fever , and at the intelligence she had drooped like a severed snowdrop , and died .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 35]: The only tie strong enough to induce him to return to Ireland was therefore broken , his father 's worldly advice had not been forgotten , and O'Donahue considered the world as his oyster .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 27]: Expensive in his habits and ideas , longing for competence , while he vegetated on half-pay , he was now looking out for a matrimonial speculation .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 56]: His generosity and his courage remained with him -- two virtues not to be driven out of an Irishman -- but his other good qualities lay in abeyance ; and yet his better feelings were by no means extinguished ; they were dormant , but by favourable circumstances were again to be brought into action .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 66]: The world and his necessities made him what he was ; for many were the times , for years afterwards , that he would in his reveries surmise how happy he might have been in his own wild country , where half-pay would have been competence , had his Judith been spared to him , and he could have laid his head upon her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 3]: CHAPTER TEN .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 10]: IN WHICH MAJOR MCSHANE NARRATES SOME CURIOUS MATRIMONIAL SPECULATIONS .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 35]: Our hero was soon fitted out with the livery of a groom , and installed as the confidential servant of Captain O'Donahue , who had lodgings on the third floor in a fashionable street .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 43]: He soon became expert and useful , and , as the captain breakfasted at home , and always ordered sufficient for Joey to make another cold meal of during the day , he was at little or no expense to his master .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 24]: One morning , when Captain O'Donahue was sitting in his dressing-gown at breakfast , Joey opened the door , and announced Major McShane .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 8]: `` Is it yourself , O'Donahue ? ''
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 24]: said the major , extending his hand ; `` and , now , what d'ye think has brought me here this fine morning ?
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 55]: It 's to do a thing that 's rather unusual with me , -- neither more nor less than to pay you the 20 pounds which you lent me a matter of three years ago , and which , I dare say , you never expected to see anything but the ghost of . ''
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 54]: `` Why , McShane , if the truth must be told , it will be something of a resurrection when it appears before me , '' replied O'Donahue ; `` I considered it dead and buried ; and , like those who are dead and buried , it has been long forgotten . ''
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 48]: `` Nevertheless , here it is in four notes -- one , two , three , four : four times five are twenty ; there 's arithmetic for you , and your money to boot , and many thanks in the bargain , by way of interest .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 29]: And now , O'Donahue , where have you been , what have you been doing , what are you doing , and what do you intend to do ?
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 17]: That 's what I call a comprehensive inquiry , and a very close one too . ''
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 30]: `` I have been in London a month , I have done nothing , I am doing nothing , and I do n't know what I intend to do .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 10]: You may take that for a comprehensive answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 12]: `` I 'll tell you all about myself without your asking .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 25]: I have been in London for nearly two years , one of which I spent in courting , and the other in matrimony . ''
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 40]: `` Why , you do n't mean to say that you are married , McShane ; if so , as you 've been married a year , you can tell me , am I to give you joy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 66]: `` Why , yes , I believe you may ; there 's nothing so stupid , O'Donahue , as domestic happiness , that 's a fact ; but , altogether , I have been so large a portion of my life doubtful where I was to get a dinner , that I think that on the whole I have made a very good choice . ''
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 22]: `` And may I inquire who is the party to whom Major McShane has condescended to sacrifice his handsome person ? ''
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 7]: `` Is it handsome you mane ?
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 59]: As the ugly lady said to the looking-glass , I beg no reflections -- you wish to know who she is ; well , then , you must be content to listen to all my adventures from the time we parted , for she is at the end of them , and I ca n't read backwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 14]: `` I am at your service , so begin as you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 15]: `` Let me see , O'Donahue , where was it that we parted ? ''
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 21]: `` If I recollect , it was at the landing made at -- , where you were reported killed . ''
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 30]: `` Very true , but that , I gave my honour , was all a lie ; it was fat Sergeant Murphy that was killed , instead of me .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 40]: He was a terrible fellow , that Sergeant Murphy ; he got himself killed on purpose , because he never could have passed his accounts ; well , he fought like a devil , so peace be with him .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 43]: I was knocked down , as you know , with a bullet in my thigh , and as I could not stand , I sat upon the carcass of Sergeant Murphy , bound up my leg , and meditated on sublunary affairs .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 91]: I thought what a great rogue he was , that Sergeant Murphy , and how he 'd gone out of the world without absolution ; and then I thought it very likely that he might have some money about him , and how much better it would be that I should have it to comfort me in prison than any rascally Frenchman , so I put my hand in his pocket and borrowed his purse , which was , taking the difference of size , as well lined as himself .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 36]: Well , as you had all retreated and left me to be taken prisoner , I waited very patiently till they should come and carry me to the hospital , or wherever else they pleased .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 35]: They were not long coming for me : one fellow would have passed his bayonet through me , but I had my pistol cocked , so he thought it advisable to take me prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 32]: I was taken into the town , not to the hospital or the prison , but quartered at the house of an old lady of high rank and plenty of money .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 75]: Well , the surgeon came and very politely told me that he must cut off my leg , and I very politely told him to go to the devil ; and the old lady came in and took my part , when she saw what a handsome leg it was , and sent for another doctor at her own expense , who promised to set me on my pins in less than a month .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 173]: Well , the old lady fell in love with me ; and although she was not quite the vision of youthful fancy , as the saying is , for she had only one tooth in her head , and that stuck out half an inch beyond her upper lip , still she had other charms for a poor devil like me ; so I made up my mind to marry her , for she made cruel love to me as I laid in bed , and before I was fairly out of bed the thing was settled , and a week afterwards the day was fixed ; but her relatives got wind of it , for , like an old fool , she could not help blabbing , and so one day there came a file of soldiers , with a corporal at their head , informing me that I was now quite well , and therefore , if it was all the same to me , I must go to prison .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 11]: This was anything but agreeable , and contrary to rule .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 116]: As an officer , I was entitled to my parole ; and so I wrote to the commanding officer , who sent for me , and then he told me I had my choice , to give up the old lady , whose friends were powerful , and would not permit her to make a fool of herself -LRB- a personal remark , by the bye , which it was unhandsome to make to a gentleman in my circumstances -RRB- , or to be refused parole , and remain in prison , and that he would give me an hour to decide ; then he made me a very low bow , and left me .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 90]: I was twisting the affair over in my mind , one moment thinking of her purse and carriage and doubloons , and another of that awful long tooth of hers , when one of her relatives came in and said he had a proposal to make , which was , that I should be released and sent to Gibraltar , without any conditions , with a handsome sum of money to pay my expenses , if I would promise to give up the old lady now and for ever .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 41]: That suited my book ; I took the money , took my leave , and a small vessel took me to Gibraltar ; so after all , you see , O'Donahue , the thing did not turn out so bad .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 18]: I lost only an old woman with a long tooth , and I gained my liberty . ''
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 13]: `` No ; you got out of that affair with credit . ''
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 32]: `` And with money , which is quite as good ; so when I returned and proved myself alive , I was reinstated , and had all my arrears paid up .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 52]: What with Sergeant Murphy 's purse , and the foreign subsidy , and my arrears , I was quite flush ; so I resolved to be circumspect , and make hay while the sun shone : notwithstanding which , I was as nearly trapped by a cunning devil of a widow .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 18]: Two days more , and I should have made a pretty kettle of fish of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 10]: `` What , at your age , McShane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 5]: `` Ah , bother !
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 121]: but she was a knowing one -- a widow on a first floor , good-looking , buxom , a fine armful , and about thirty -- met her at a party -- pointed out to me as without encumbrance , and well off -- made up to her , escorted her home -- begged permission to call , was graciously received -- talked of her departed husband , thought me like him -- everything so comfortable -- plenty of plate -- good furniture -- followed her up -- received notes by a little boy in sky-blue and silver sugar-loaf buttons -- sent me all her messages -- one day in the week to her banker 's to cash a check .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 9]: Would you believe the cunning of the creature ?
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 42]: She used to draw out 25 pounds every week , sending me for the money , and , as I found out afterwards , paid it in again in fifties every fortnight , and she only had 50 pounds in all .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 6]: Was n't I regularly humbugged ?
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 17]: Made proposals -- was accepted -- all settled , and left off talking about her departed .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 39]: One day , and only two days before the wedding , found the street-door open , and heard a noise between her and her landlady of the top of the stairs , so I waited at the bottom .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 124]: The landlady was insisting upon her rent , and having all her plate back again -- my charming widow entreating for a little delay , as she was to be married -- landlady came downstairs , red as a turkey-cock , so I very politely begged her to walk into the parlour , and I put a few questions , when I discovered that my intended was a widow with a pension of 80 pounds a-year , and had six children , sent out of the way until she could find another protector , which I resolved , at all events , should not be Major McShane ; so I walked out of the door , and have never seen her since . ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 15]: `` By the head of Saint Patrick , but that was an escape ! ''
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 26]: `` Yes , indeed , the she-devil with six children , and 80 pounds a year ; it 's a wicked world this , O'Donahue .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 21]: Well , I kept clear of such cunning articles , and only looked after youth and innocence in the city .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 28]: At last I discovered the only daughter of a German sugar-baker in the Minories , a young thing about seventeen , but very little for her age .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 55]: She went to a dancing-school , and I contrived , by bribing the maid , to carry on the affair most successfully , and she agreed to run away with me : everything was ready , the postchaise was at the corner of the street , she came with her bundle in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 43]: I thrust it into the chaise , and was just tossing her in after it , when she cried out that she had forgotten something , and must go back for it ; and away she went , slipping through my fingers .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 27]: Well , I waited most impatiently for her appearance , and at last saw her coming ; and what d'ye think she 'd gone back for ?
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 17]: By the powers , for _ her doll _ , which she held in her hand !
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 26]: And just as she came to the chaise , who should come round the corner but her father , who had walked from Mincing Lane .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 32]: He caught my mincing Miss by the arm , with her doll and her bundle , and bundled her home , leaving me and the postchaise , looking like two fools .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 14]: I never could see her again , or her confounded doll either . ''
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 11]: `` You have been out of luck , McShane . ''
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 14]: `` I 'm not sure of that , as the affair has ended .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 14]: Now comes another adventure , in which I turned the tables , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 52]: I fell in with a very pretty girl , the daughter of a lawyer in Chancery Lane , who was said to have , and -LRB- I paid a shilling at Doctors ' Commons , and read the will -RRB- it was true enough , an independent fortune from her grandmother .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 11]: She was always laughing full of mischief and practical jokes .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 29]: She pretended to be pleased , the hussey , with my addresses , and at last she consented , as I thought , to run away with me .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 31]: I imagined that I had clinched the business at last , when one dark night I handed her into a chaise , wrapped up in a cloak , and crying .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 19]: However , I got her in , and away we went as if the devil was behind us .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 68]: I coaxed her and soothed her , and promised to make her happy ; but she still kept her handkerchief up to her eyes , and would not permit me a chaste salute -- even pushed me away when I would put my arm round her waist ; all which I ascribed to the extra shame and modesty which a woman feels when she is doing wrong .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 31]: At last , when about fifteen miles from town , there was a burst of laughter , and ` I think we have gone far enough , Major McShane . '
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 21]: By all the saints in the calendar , it was her scamp of a brother that had taken her place .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 46]: ` My young gentleman , ' said I , ` I think you have not only gone far enough , but , as I shall prove to you , perhaps a little too far , ' for I was in no fool of a passion .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 73]: So I set to , beat him to a mummy , broke his nose , blackened both his eyes , and knocked half his teeth down his throat ; and when he was half dead , I opened the chaise door as it whirled along , and kicked him out to take his chance of the wheels , or any other wheels which the wheel of fortune might turn up for him .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 20]: So he went home and told his sister what a capital joke it was , I 've no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 33]: I 'll be bound the young gentleman has never run away with an Irishman since that : however , I never heard any more about him , or his lovely sister . ''
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 13]: `` Now , then , for the wind up , McShane . ''
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 42]: `` Courting 's very expensive , especially when you order postchaises for nothing at all , and I was very nearly at the end of my rhino ; so I said to myself , ` McShane , you must retrench . '
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 95]: And I did so ; instead of dining at the coffee-house , I determined to go to an eating-house , and walked into one in Holborn , where I sat down to a plate of good beef and potatoes , and a large lump of plum-pudding , paid 1 shilling and 6 pence , and never was better pleased in my life ; so I went there again , and became a regular customer ; and the girls who waited laughed with me , and the lady who kept the house was very gracious .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 61]: Now , the lady was good-looking , but she was rather too fat ; there was an amiable look about her , even when she was carving beef ; and by degrees we became intimate , and I found her a very worthy creature , and as simple-minded as a child , although she could look sharp after her customers .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 21]: It was , and is now , a most thriving establishment -- nearly two hundred people dine there every day .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 72]: I do n't know how it was , but I suppose I first fell in love with her beef ; and then with her fair self ; and finding myself well received at all times , I one day , as she was carving a beefsteak-pie which might have tempted a king for its fragrance , put the question to her , as to how she would like to marry again .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 51]: She blushed , and fixed her eyes down upon the hole she had made in the pie , and then I observed that if there was a hole in my side as big as there was in the pie before her , she would see her image in my heart .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 36]: This pretty simile did the business for me , and in a month we were married ; and I never shall want a dinner as long as I live , either for myself or friend .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 58]: I will put you on the free list , O'Donahue , if you can condescend to a cook 's shop : and I can assure you that I think I have done a very wise thing , for I do n't want to present any wife at Court , and I have a very comfortable home . ''
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 30]: `` You have done a wise thing , in my opinion , McShane -- you have a wife who makes money , instead of one who spends it . ''
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 28]: `` And , moreover , I have found my bargain better that I anticipated , which is seldom the case in this world of treachery and deceit .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 15]: She has plenty of money , and is putting by more every year . ''
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 19]: `` Which you have the control of , at your disposition , do you mean to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 24]: `` Why , yes , I may say that now ; but , O'Donahue , that is owing to my circumspection and delicacy .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 66]: At first starting , I determined that she should not think that it was only her money that I wanted ; so , after we were married , I continued to find myself , which , paying nothing for board and lodging and washing , I could easily do upon my half-pay ; and I have done so ever since , until just now . ''
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 30]: `` I had not been married a week before I saw that she expected I would make inquiries into the state of her finances , but I would not .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 60]: At last , finding that I would not enter into the business , she did , and told me that she had 17,000 pounds Consols laid by , and that the business was worth 1,000 pounds per annum -LRB- you may fish at Cheltenham a long while , O'Donahue , before you get such a haul as that -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 35]: So I told her I was very glad she was well off , and then I pretended to go fast asleep , as I never interfered with her , and never asked for money .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 104]: At last she did n't like it , and offered it to me ; but I told her I had enough , and did not want it ; since which she has been quite annoyed at my not spending money ; and when I told her this morning that there was a brother officer of mine arrived in town , to whom I had owed some money for a long while , she insisted upon my taking money to pay it , put a pile of bank-notes in my had , and was quite mortified when she found I only wanted 20 pounds .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 13]: Now you see , O'Donahue , I have done this from principle .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 98]: She earns the money , and therefore she shall have the control of it as long as we are good friends ; and upon my honour , I really think I love her better than I ever thought I could love any woman in the world for she has the temper , the kindness , and the charity of an angel , although not precisely the figure ; but one ca n't have everything in this world ; and so now you have the whole of my story , and what do you think of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 12]: `` You must present me to your wife , McShane . ''
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 7]: `` That I will with pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 34]: She 's like her rounds of beef -- it 's cut and come again ; but her heart is a beauty , and so is her beefsteak-pie -- when you taste it . ''
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 3]: CHAPTER ELEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 9]: IN WHICH AN INTERCHANGE AND CONFIDENCE TAKE PLACE .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 58]: `` And now , O'Donahue , '' said McShane , `` if you are not yet tired of my company , I should like to hear what you have been doing since we parted : be quite as explicit , but not quite so long-winded , as myself ; for I fear that I tired you . ''
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 30]: `` I will be quite as explicit , my good fellow ; but I have no such marvellous adventures to relate , and not such a fortunate wind up .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 38]: I have been to Bath , to Cheltenham , to Harrogate , to Brighton , and everywhere else where people meet , and people are met with , who would not meet or be met with elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 49]: I have seen many nice girls ; but the nice girls were , like myself , almost penniless ; and I have seen many ill-favoured , who had money : the first I could only afford to look at -- the latter I have had some dealings with .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 60]: I have been refused by one or two , and I might have married seven or eight ; but , somehow or other , when it came near the point , the vision of a certain angel , now in heaven , has risen before me , and I have not had the heart or the heartlessness to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 62]: Indeed , I may safely say that I have seen but one person since we parted who ever made the least impression on me , or whom I could fancy in any degree to replace her whom I have lost , and she , I fear , is lost also ; so we may as well say no more about it .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 64]: I have determined to marry for money , as you well know ; but it appears to me as if there was something which invariably prevents the step being taken ; and , upon my honour , fortune seems so inclined to balk me in my wishes , that I begin to snap my fingers at her , and am becoming quite indifferent .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 35]: I suffer now under the evil of poverty ; but it is impossible to say what other evils may be in store if I were to change my condition , as the ladies say .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 77]: Come what will , in one thing I am determined -- that if I marry a girl for money , I will treat her well , and not let her find it out ; and as that may add to the difficulty of a man 's position when he is not in love with his wife , why , all I can say is , Captain O'Donahue does n't go cheap -- that 's decided . ''
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 27]: `` You 're right , my jewel ; there 's not such a broth of a boy to be picked up every day in the week .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 26]: Widows might bid for you , for without flattery , I think you a moral of a man , and an honour to Old Ireland .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 40]: But O'Donahue , begging your pardon , if it 's not a secret , who may have been this lady who appears to have bothered your brains not a little , since she could you forget somebody else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 25]: `` I met her at the Lakes of Cumberland , and being acquainted with some of the party , was invited to join them .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 18]: I was ten days in her company at Windermere , Ambleside , Derwentwater , and other places .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 9]: She was a foreigner , and titled . ''
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 5]: `` Murder and Irish !
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 7]: you do n't say so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 23]: `` Yes ; and moreover , as I was informed by those who were with her , has large property in Poland .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 34]: She was , in fact , everything that I could desire -- handsome , witty , speaking English and several other languages , and about two or three and twenty years old . ''
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 15]: `` And her name , if it 's no offence to ask it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 5]: `` Princess Czartorinski . ''
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 8]: `` And a princess in the bargain ?
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 13]: And did you really pretend to make love to a princess ? ''
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 9]: `` Am not I an Irishman , McShane ?
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 12]: and is a princess anything but a woman , after all ?
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 4]: By the powers !
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 33]: I 'd make love to , and run away with , the Pope himself ; if he were made of the same materials as Pope Joan is said to have been . ''
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 19]: `` Then , upon my faith , O'Donahue , I believe you -- so now go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 64]: `` I not only made love to her , but in making love to her , I got most terribly singed myself ; and I felt , before I quitted her , that if I had ten thousand a-year , and she was as poor as my dear Judith was , that she should have taken her place -- that 's the truth .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 34]: I thought that I never could love again , and that my heart was as flinty as a pawnbroker 's ; but I found out my mistake when it was too late . ''
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 10]: `` And did she return you the compliment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 15]: `` That I was not indifferent to her , I may without vanity believe .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 48]: I had a five minutes alone with her just before we parted , and I took that opportunity of saying how much pain it was to part with her , and for once I told the truth , for I was almost choking when I said it .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 50]: I 'm convinced that there was sincerity in my face , and that she saw that it was there ; so she replied , ` If what you say is true , we shall meet at Saint Petersburg next winter ; good-bye , I shall expect you . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 18]: `` Well , that was as much as to say , come , at all events . ''
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 38]: `` It was ; I stammered out my determination so to do , if possible ; but I felt at the time that my finances rendered it impossible -- so there was an end of that affair .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 41]: By my hopes of salvation , I 'd not only go to Saint Petersburg , but round the whole world , and to the north pole afterwards , if I had the means only to see her once more . ''
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 19]: `` You 're in a bad way , O'Donahue ; your heart 's gone and your money too .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 18]: Upon my soul , I pity you ; but it 's always the case in this world .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 26]: When I was a boy , the best and ripest fruit was always on the top of the wall , and out of my reach .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 21]: Shall I call to-morrow , and then , if you please , I 'll introduce you to Mrs McShane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 21]: `` I will be happy to see you and your good wife , McShane ; health and happiness to you .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 15]: Stop , while I ring for my little factotum to let you out . ''
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 21]: `` By the bye , a sharp boy that , O'Donahue , with an eye as bright as a hawk .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 8]: Where did you pick him up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 8]: `` In Saint James 's Park . ''
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 15]: `` Well , that 's an odd place to hire a servant in . ''
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 10]: `` Do you recollect Rushbrook in my company ? ''
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 22]: `` To be sure I do -- your best soldier , and a famous caterer he was at all times . ''
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 7]: `` It is his son . ''
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 20]: `` And , now I think of it , he 's very like him , only somewhat better-looking . ''
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 17]: O'Donahue then acquainted McShane with the circumstances attending his meeting with Joey , and they separated .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 29]: The next day , about the same time , McShane came to see his friend , and found O'Donahue dressed , and ready to go out with him .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 45]: `` Now , O'Donahue , you must n't be in such a hurry to see Mrs McShane , for I have something to tell you which will make her look more pretty in your eyes than she otherwise might have done upon first introduction .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 40]: Take your chair again , and do n't be putting on your gloves yet , while you listen to a little conversation which took place between us last night , just before we dropped into the arms of Murfy .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 132]: I 'll pass over all the questions she asked about you , and all the compliments I paid you behind your back : because , if I did n't , it would make you blush , Irishman as you are ; but this she did say , -- that it was great kindness on your part to lend me that money , and that she loved you for it ; upon which I replied , I was sorry you were not easy in your mind , and so very unhappy : upon which she , in course , like every woman , asked me why ; and then I told her merely that it was a love-affair , and a long story , as if I wished to go to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 41]: This made her more curious , so , to oblige her , I stayed awake , and told her just what you told me , and how the winter was coming on and you not able to keep your appointment .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 9]: And what d'ye think the good soul said ?
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 68]: ` Now , ' says she , ` McShane , if you love me , and have any gratitude to your friend for his former kindness , you will to-morrow take him money enough , and more than enough , to do as he wishes , and if he gains his wife he can repay you ; if not , the money is not an object . '
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 24]: ` That 's very kind of you , dearest , ' said I ; ` but then will you consent to another thing ?
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 28]: for this may prove a difficult affair , and he may want me with him ; and would you have any objection to that , dearest ? '
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 41]: for you see , O'Donahue , I took it into my head that I might be of the greatest use to you : and , moreover , I should like the trip , just by way of a little change .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 9]: ` Could n't he do without you ? '
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 5]: replied she , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 55]: ` I 'm afraid not ; and although I thought I was in barracks for life , and never to leave you again , yet still for his sake , poor fellow , who has been such a generous fellow to me -- ' ` An ' how long would you be away ? '
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 3]: said she .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 27]: ` Why , it might be two months at the most , ' replied I ; ` but who can tell it to a day ? '
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 49]: ` Well , ' said she , ` I do n't like that part of the concern at all ; but still , if it is necessary , as you say , things should n't be done by halves , ' and then she sighed , poor soul .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 35]: ` Then I wo n't go , ' says I. ` Yes , ' says she , after a pause ; ` I think it 's your duty , and therefore you must . '
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 27]: ` I 'll do just what you wish , my soul , ' replied I ; ` but let 's talk more about it to-morrow . '
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 64]: This morning she brought up the subject , and said that she had made up her mind , and that it should be as we had said last night ; and she went to the drawer and took out three hundred pounds in gold and notes , and said that if it was not enough , we had only to write for more .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 9]: Now ai n't she a jewel , O'Donahue ?
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 7]: and here 's the money . ''
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 31]: `` McShane , she is a jewel , not because she has given me money , but because her heart 's in the right place , and always will be .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 13]: But I really do not like taking you away with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 14]: `` Perhaps you do n't think I 'd be of any use ? ''
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 23]: `` Yes ; I do not doubt but that you will be , although at present I do not know how . ''
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 29]: `` But I do , for I 've thought upon it , and I shall take it very unkind if you do n't let me go with you .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 23]: I want a little divarsion ; for you see , O'Donahue , one must settle down to domestic happiness by degrees . ''
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 22]: `` Be it so , then ; all I fear is , I shall occasion pain to your excellent wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 30]: `` She has plenty to do , and that drives care away ; besides , only consider the pleasure you 'll occasion to her when I come back . ''
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 5]: `` I forgot that .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 22]: Now , if you please , I 'll call and pay my respects , and also return my grateful thanks . ''
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 7]: `` Then , come along . ''
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 12]: Captain O'Donahue found Mrs McShane very busily employed supplying her customers .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 46]: She was , as McShane had said , a very good-looking woman , although somewhat corpulent : and there was an amiability , frankness , and kindness of disposition so expressed in her countenance , that it was impossible not to feel interested with her .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 4]: They dined together .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 41]: O'Donahue completely established himself in her good graces , and it was agreed that on that day week the gentlemen should embark for Hamburg , and proceed on to Petersburg , Joey to go with them as their little valet .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWELVE .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 14]: AN EXPEDITION , AS OF YORE , ACROSS THE WATERS FOR A WIFE .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 65]: The first step taken by O'Donahue was to obtain a passport for himself and suit ; and here there was a controversy , McShane having made up his mind that he would sink the officer , and travel as O'Donahue 's servant , in which capacity he declared that he would not only be more useful , but also swell his friend 's dignity .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 23]: After a long combat on the part of O'Donahue , this was consented to , and the passport was filled up accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 7]: `` But , by Saint Patrick !
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 30]: I ought to get some letters of introduction , '' said O'Donahue ; `` and how is that to be managed -- at all events to the English ambassador ?
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 13]: Let me see -- I 'll go to the Horse Guards . ''
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 26]: O'Donahue went accordingly , and , as was always the case there , was admitted immediately to an audience with the Commander of the Forces .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 34]: O'Donahue put his case forward , stating that he was about to proceed on a secret mission to Russia , and requested his Royal Highness to give him a few letters of introduction .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 48]: His Royal Highness very properly observed , that if sent on a secret mission , he would , of course , obtain all the necessary introductions from the proper quarters , and then inquired of O'Donahue what his rank was , where he had served , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 23]: To the latter questions O'Donahue gave a very satisfactory reply , and convinced the Duke that he was an officer of merit .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 19]: Then came the question as to his secret mission , which his Royal Highness had never heard of .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 109]: `` May it please your Royal Highness , there 's a little mistake about this same secret mission ; it 's not on account of government that I 'm going , but on my own secret service ; '' and O'Donahue , finding himself fairly in for it , confessed that he was after a lady of high rank , and that if he did not obtain letters of introduction , he should not probably find the means of entering the society in which she was to be found , and that as an officer who had served faithfully , he trusted that he should not be refused .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 46]: His Royal Highness laughed at his disclosure , and , as there was no objection to giving O'Donahue a letter or two , with his usual good-nature he ordered them to be written , and having given them to him , wished him every success .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 21]: O'Donahue bowed to the ground , and quitted the Horse Guards , delighted with the success of his impudent attempt .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 58]: Being thus provided , the party set off in a vessel bound to Hamburg , where they arrived without any accident , although very sea-sick ; from Hamburg they proceeded to Lubeck , and re-embarked at Travemunde in a brig , which was bound for Riga ; the wind was fair , and their passage was short .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 69]: On their arrival they put up at an hotel , and finding themselves in a country where English was not understood , O'Donahue proceeded to the house of the English consul , informing him that he was going on a secret mission to Petersburg , and showing , as evidences of his respectability and the truth of his assertions , the letters given him by his Royal Highness .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 14]: These were quite sufficient for the consul , who immediately offered his services .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 34]: Not being able to procure at Riga a courier who could speak French or English , the consul took a great deal of trouble to assist them in their long journey to Petersburg .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 41]: He made out a list of the posts , the number of versts , and the money that was to be paid ; he changed some of O'Donahue 's gold into Russian paper-money , and gave all the necessary instructions .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 46]: The great difficulty was to find any carriage to carry them to the capital , but at last they found an old cabriolet on four wheels which might answer , and , bidding adieu to the consul , they obtained horses , and set off .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 44]: `` Now , McShane , you must take care of the money , and pay the driver , '' said O'Donahue , pulling out several pieces of thick paper , some coloured red , some blue , and others of a dirty white .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 6]: `` Is this money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 6]: said McShane , with astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 8]: `` Yes , that 's roubles . ''
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 6]: `` Roubles , are they ?
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 16]: I wonder what they 'd call them in Ireland ; they look like soup-tickets . ''
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 4]: `` Never mind .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 57]: And now , McShane , there are two words which the consul has told me to make use of : one is _ Scoro _ , and when you say that , it means ` _ Go fast _ , ' and you hold up a small bit of money at the same time . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 4]: _ Scoro _ !
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 13]: well , that 's a word I sha 'n' t forget . ''
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 16]: `` But , then , there 's another , which is _ Scorae _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 11]: `` And what may be the English of that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 25]: `` Why , that means ` _ Go faster _ , ' and with that you hold up a larger piece of money . ''
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 37]: `` Why , then , it 's no use remembering _ Scoro _ at all , for _ Scorae _ will do much better ; so we need not burden ourselves with the first at all .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 18]: Suppose we try the effect of that last word upon our bear-skin friend who is driving ! ''
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 19]: McShane held up a rouble , and called out to the driver -- '' _ Scorae _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 29]: The fellow turned his head , smiled , and lashed his horses until they were at the full speed , and then looked back at them for approval .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 13]: `` By the powers , that 's no fool of a word !
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 17]: it will take us all the way to Saint Petersburg as fast as we wish . ''
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 30]: `` We do not sleep on the road , but travel night and day , '' said O'Donahue , `` for there is no place worth sleeping at . ''
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 9]: `` And the ` ating , O'Donahue ? ''
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 16]: `` We must get that by signs , for we have no other means . ''
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 35]: On that point they soon found they had no difficulty ; and thus they proceeded , without speaking a word of the language , day and night , until they arrived at the capital .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 26]: At the entrance their passports were demanded , and the officer at the guard-house came out and told them that a Cossack would accompany them .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 41]: A Cossack , with a spear as long as a fir-tree , and a beard not quite so long , then took them in charge , and trotted before the carriage , the driver following him at a slow pace .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 7]: `` A n't we prisoners ? ''
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 3]: inquired McShane .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 17]: `` I do n't know , but it looks very like it , '' replied O'Donahue .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 9]: This , however , was not the case .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 42]: The carriage drove to a splendid street called the Neffsky Perspective , and as soon as it stopped at the entrance of an hotel , the Cossack , after speaking to the landlord , who came out , took his departure .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 81]: A journey of four hundred miles , day and night , is no joke : our travellers fell fast asleep in their spacious apartment , and it was not till the next day that they found themselves clean and comfortable , Joey being dressed in a rich livery , as a sort of page , and McShane doing duty as valet when others were present , and when sitting alone with O'Donahue , taking his fair share of the bottle .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 31]: Two days after their arrival , the landlord procured for O'Donahue a courier who could speak both English and French as well as Russian , and almost every other language .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 59]: It was resolved by O'Donahue and McShane , in council , to dress him up in a splendid uniform ; and a carriage having been hired for the month , O'Donahue felt that he was in a position to present his credentials to the English ambassador and the other parties for whom he had received letters of introduction .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 3]: CHAPTER THIRTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 14]: IN WHICH THERE IS SOME INFORMATION RELATIVE TO THE CITY OF ST. PETERSBURG .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 60]: For 300 roubles a month , O'Donahue had procured a drosky , very handsomely fitted up ; the shaft horse was a splendid trotter , and the other , a beautiful-shaped animal , capered about curving his neck , until his nose almost touched his knee , and prancing , so as to be the admiration of the passers-by .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 32]: His coachman , whose name was Athenasis , had the largest beard in Saint Petersburg ; Joey was the smallest tiger ; Dimitri , one of the tallest and handsomest yagers .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 33]: Altogether , Captain O'Donahue had laid out his money well ; and on a fine , sunny day he set off to present his letters to the English ambassador and other parties .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 29]: Although the letters were very short , it was quite sufficient that they were written by so distinguished and so universally beloved a person as his Royal Highness .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 44]: The ambassador , Lord Saint H , immediately desired O'Donahue to consider his house open to him , requesting the pleasure of his company to dinner on the following day , and offered to present him to the Emperor at the first levee .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 36]: O'Donahue took his leave , delighted with his success , and then drove to the hotel of the Princess Woronzoff , Count Nesselrode , and Prince Gallitzin , where he found himself equally well received .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 39]: After his visits were all paid , O'Donahue sported his handsome equipage on the English and Russian quays , and up and down the Neffsky Perspective for an hour or two , and then returned to the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 43]: `` I am very sorry , '' said O'Donahue , after he had narrated to McShane all that had taken place , `` that I permitted you to put yourself down on the passport as valet in the foolish way you have .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 23]: You would have enjoyed yourself as much as I probably shall , and have been in your proper position in society . ''
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 18]: `` Then I 'm not sorry at all , O'Donahue , and I 'll tell you why .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 57]: I should have enjoyed myself , I do not doubt -- but I should have enjoyed myself too much ; and , after dining with ambassadors , and princes , and counts , and all that thing -- should I ever have gone back comfortable and contented to Mrs McShane , and the cook 's shop ?
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 82]: No , no -- I 'm not exactly reconciled , as it is ; and if I were to be drinking champagne , and ` ating French kickshaws with the Russian nobility for three or four months , dancing perhaps with princesses , and whispering in the ears of duchesses , would n't my nose turn up with contempt at the beefsteak pie , and poor Mrs McShane , with all her kind smiles , look twice as corpulent as ever ?
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 23]: No , no , I 'm better here , and I 'm a wise man , although I say it myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 36]: `` Well , perhaps you are , McShane ; but still I do not like that I should be spending your money in this way without your having your share of it at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 27]: `` My share of it -- now , O'Donahue , suppose I had come over here on my own account , where should I have been ?
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 45]: I could not have mustered up the amiable impudence you did , to persuade the commander-in-chief to give me letters to the ambassador : nor could I have got up such a turn-out , nor have fitted the turn-out so well as you do .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 56]: I should have been as stupid as an owl , just doing what I have done the whole of the blessed morning for want of your company -- looking after one of the floating bridges across the river , and spitting into the stream , just to add my mite to the Baltic Sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 11]: `` I 'm sorry you were not better amused . ''
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 32]: `` I was amused ; for I was thinking of the good-humoured face of Mrs McShane , which was much better than being in high company , and forgetting her entirely .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 20]: Let me alone for amusing myself after my own fashion , O'Donahue , and that 's all I wish .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 15]: I suppose you have heard nothing in your travels about your Powlish princess ? ''
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 27]: `` Of course not ; it will require some tact to bring in her name -- I must do it as if by mere accident . ''
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 15]: `` Shall I ask the courier if she is an acquaintance of his ? ''
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 7]: `` An acquaintance , McShane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 24]: `` I do n't mean on visiting terms ; but if he knows anything about the family , or where they live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 22]: `` No , McShane , I think you had better not ; we do not know much of him at present .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 18]: I shall dine at the ambassador 's tomorrow , and there will be a large party . ''
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 18]: During the day invitations for evening parties were brought in from the Prince Gallitzin and Princess Woronzoff .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 32]: `` The plot thickens fast , as the saying is , '' observed McShane ; `` you 'll be certain to meet your fair lady at some of these places . ''
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 42]: `` That is what I trust to do , '' replied O'Donahue ; `` if not , as soon as I 'm intimate , I shall make inquiries about her ; but we must first see how the land lies . ''
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 25]: O'Donahue dined at the ambassador 's , and went to the other parties , but did not meet with the object of his search .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 21]: Being a good musician , he was much in request in so musical a society as that of Saint Petersburg .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 34]: The emperor was still at his country palace , and O'Donahue had been more than a fortnight at the capital without there being an opportunity for the ambassador to present him at court .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 50]: Dimitri , the person whom O'Donahue engaged as courier , was a very clever , intelligent fellow ; and as he found that O'Donahue had all the liberality of an Irishman , and was in every respect a most indulgent master , he soon had his interest at heart .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 70]: Perhaps the more peculiar intimacy between O'Donahue and McShane , as a valet , assisted Dimitri in forming a good opinion of the former , as the hauteur and distance generally preserved by the English towards their domestics are very displeasing to the Continental servants , who , if permitted to be familiar , will not only serve you more faithfully , but be satisfied with more moderate wages .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 15]: Dimitri spoke English and French pretty well , German and Russian of course perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 26]: He was a Russian by birth , had been brought up at the Foundling Hospital , at Moscow , and therefore was not a serf .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 38]: He soon became intimate with McShane : and as soon as the latter discovered that there was no intention on the part of Dimitri to be dishonest , he was satisfied , and treated him with cordiality .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 43]: `` Tell your master this , '' said Dimitri , `` never to give his opinion on political matters before any one while in Petersburg , or he will be reported to the government , and will be looked upon with suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 21]: All the servants and couriers here , indeed every third person you meet , is an agent of police . ''
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 18]: `` Then it 's not at all unlikely that you are one yourself , '' replied McShane .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 20]: `` I am so , '' replied Dimitri , coolly , `` and all the better for your master .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 23]: I shall be ordered to make my report in a few days , and I shall not fail to do so . ''
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 9]: `` And what will they ask you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 3]: said McShane .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 13]: `` They will ask me first who and what your master is ?
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 19]: Whether I have discovered from you , if he is of family and importance in his own country ?
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 8]: whether he has expressed any political opinions ?
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 14]: and whether I have discovered the real business which brought him here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 11]: `` And what will you reply to all this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 3]: answered McShane .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 7]: `` Why , I hardly know .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 36]: I wish I knew what he wishes me to say , for he is a gentleman whom I am very fond of , and that 's the truth ; perhaps you can tell me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 17]: `` Why , yes , I know a good deal about him , that 's certain .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 26]: As for his family , there 's not a better in Ireland or England , for he 's royal if he had his right . ''
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 3]: exclaimed Dimitri .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 25]: `` As sure as I 'm sitting in this old arm-chair , did n't he bring letters from the brother of the present king ?
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 11]: does that go for nothing in this country of yours ?
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 13]: or do you value men by the length of their beards ? ''
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 17]: `` Men are valued here not by their titles , but by their rank as officers .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 14]: A general is a greater man than a prince , '' replied Dimitri .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 16]: `` With all my heart , for then I 'm somebody , '' replied McShane .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 4]: `` You ? ''
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 4]: replied the courier .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 28]: `` I mean my master , '' returned McShane , correcting himself ; `` for he 's an officer , and a good one , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 19]: `` Yes , that may be ; but you said yourself , '' replied the courier , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 26]: `` My good friend , a valet to any one in Petersburg is no better than one of the mujiks who work in the streets .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 45]: Well , I know that our master is an officer , and of high rank ; as for his political opinions , I have never heard him express any , except his admiration of the city , and of course of the emperor . ''
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 14]: `` Most decidedly ; and of the empress also , '' replied McShane .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 14]: `` That is not at all necessary , '' continued Dimitri , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 14]: `` In fact , he has no business to admire the empress . ''
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 42]: `` But he admires the government and the laws , '' said McShane ; `` and you may add , my good fellow -- the army and the navy -- by the powers , he 's all admiration , all over !
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 10]: -- you may take my word for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 28]: `` Well , I will do so ; but then there is one other question to reply to , which is , why did he come here ?
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 6]: what is his business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 34]: `` To look about him , to be sure ; to spend his money like a gentleman ; to give his letters of introduction ; and to amuse himself , '' replied McShane .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 30]: `` But this is dry talking , so , Dimitri , order a bottle of champagne , and then we 'll wet our whistle before we go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 3]: `` Champagne !
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 7]: will your master stand that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 3]: inquired Dimitri .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 4]: `` Stand it ?
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 20]: to be sure , and he 'd be very angry if he thought I did not make myself comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 25]: Tell them to put it down in the bill for me ; if they doubt the propriety , let them ask my master . ''
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 7]: Dimitri went and ordered the champagne .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 109]: As soon as they had a glass , Dimitri observed , `` Your master is a fine liberal fellow , and I would serve him to the last day of my life ; but you see that the reasons you give for your master being here are the same as are given by everybody else , whether they come as spies or secret emissaries , or to foment insurrection ; that answer , therefore , is considered as no answer at all by the police -LRB- although very often a true one -RRB- , and they will try to find out whether it is so or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 14]: `` What other cause can a gentleman like him have for coming here ?
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 27]: He is not going to dirty his hands with speculation , information , or any other botheration , '' replied McShane , tossing off his glass .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 22]: `` I do n't say so ; but his having letters from the king 's brother will be considered suspicious . ''
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 6]: `` The devil it will .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 22]: Now in our country that would only create a suspicion that he was a real gentleman -- that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 12]: `` You do n't understand this country , '' replied Dimitri .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 21]: `` No , it beats my comprehension entirely , and that 's a fact ; so fill up your glass .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 19]: I hope it 's not treason ; but if it is , I ca n't help saying it .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 27]: My good friend Dimitri -- '' `` Stop , '' said Dimitri , rising and shutting the door , `` now , what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 32]: `` Why , just this ; I have n't seen one good-looking woman since I 've been in this good-looking town of yours ; now , that 's the truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 29]: `` There 's more truth than treason in that , '' replied the courier ; `` but still there are some beautiful women among the higher classes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 23]: `` It 's to be hoped so ; for they 've left no beauty for the lower , at all events . ''
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 14]: `` We have very beautiful women in Poland , '' said the courier .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 13]: `` Why do n't you bring a few here , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 15]: `` There are a great many Polish ladies in Petersburg at this moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 22]: `` Then go down and order another bottle , '' said McShane , `` and we 'll drink their healths . ''
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 19]: The second bottle was finished , and McShane , who had been drinking before , became less cautious .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 27]: `` You said , '' observed he , `` that you have many Polish ladies in Petersburg ; did you ever hear of a Princess Czartowinky ?
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 9]: -- I think that 's the name . ''
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 33]: `` Czartorinski , you mean , '' replied Dimitri ; `` to be sure I did ; I served in the family some years ago , when the old prince was alive .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 8]: But where did you see her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 9]: `` In England , to be sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 19]: `` Well , that 's probable , for she has just returned from travelling with her uncle . ''
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 12]: `` Is she now in Petersburg , my good fellow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 14]: `` I believe she is -- but why do wish to know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 9]: `` Merely asked -- that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 38]: `` Now , Macshanovich , '' -- for such was the familiar way in which Dimitri addressed his supposed brother-servant -- `` I suspect this Princess Czartorinski is some way connected with your master 's coming here .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 10]: Tell me the truth -- is such the case ?
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 7]: I 'm sure it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 51]: `` Then you know more than I do , '' replied McShane , correcting himself , `` for I 'm not exactly in my master 's secrets ; all that I do know is , that my master met her in England , and I thought her very handsome . ''
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 7]: `` And so did he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 35]: `` That 's as may be ; between ourselves , I 've an idea he was a little smitten in that quarter ; but that 's only my own opinion , nothing more . ''
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 13]: `` Has he ever spoken about her since you were here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 3]: said Dimitri .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 37]: `` Just once , as I handed his waistcoat to him ; he said -- ` I wonder if all the ladies are as handsome as that Polish princess that we met in Cumberland ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 42]: `` If I thought he wished it , or cared for her , I would make inquiry , and soon find out all about her ; but otherwise , it 's no use taking the trouble , '' replied the courier .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 30]: `` Well , then , will you give me your hand , and promise to serve faithfully , if I tell you all I know about the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 11]: `` By the blessed Saint Nicholas , I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 10]: replied Dimitri ; `` you may trust me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 32]: `` Well , then , it 's my opinion that my master 's over head and ears in love with her , and has come here for no other purpose . ''
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 18]: `` Well , I 'm glad you told me that ; it will satisfy the police . ''
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 9]: `` The police ; why murder and Irish !
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 13]: you 're not going to inform the police , you villain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 47]: `` Not with whom he is in love , most certainly , but that he has come here on that account ; it will satisfy them , for they have no fear of a man that 's in love , and he will not be watched .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 17]: Depend upon it , I can not do a better thing to serve our master . ''
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 10]: `` Well , then , perhaps you are right .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 15]: I do n't like this champagne -- get a bottle of Burgundy , Dimitri .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 11]: Do n't look so hard -- it 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 21]: The captain dines out every day , and has ordered me to drink for the honour of the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 23]: `` He 's a capital master , '' replied Dimitri , who had begun to feel the effects of the former bottles .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 77]: As soon as the third bottle was tapped , McShane continued -- `` Now , Dimitri , I 've given my opinion , and I can tell you , if my master has , as I suspect , come here about this young lady , and succeeds in obtaining her , it will be a blessed thing for you and me ; for he 's as generous as the day , and has plenty of money .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 8]: Do you know who she is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 31]: `` To be sure I do ; she is an only daughter of the late Prince Czartorinski , and now a sort of ward under the protection of the Emperor .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 24]: She inherits all the estates , except one which was left to found an hospital at Warsaw , and is a rich heiress .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 14]: It is supposed the emperor will bestow her upon one of his generals .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 16]: She is at the palace , and a maid of honour to the empress . ''
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 4]: `` Whew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 12]: whistled McShane ; `` wo n't there be a difficulty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 13]: `` I should think so , '' replied the courier , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 16]: `` He must run away with her , '' said McShane , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 10]: `` How will he get to see her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 33]: `` He will not see her , so as to speak with her , in the palace ; that is not the custom here ; but he might meet her elsewhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 16]: `` To be sure , at a party or a ball , '' said McShane .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 19]: `` No , that would not do ; ladies and gentlemen keep very apart here in general company .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 16]: He might say a word or two when dancing , but that is all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 29]: `` But how is he to meet her , when , in this cursed place of yours , if men and women keep at arm 's length ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 7]: `` That must depend upon her .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 9]: Tell me , does she love him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 39]: `` Well , now , that 's a home question : she never told him she did , and she never told me , that 's certain ; but still I 've an idea that she does . ''
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 24]: `` Then all I can say , Macshanovich , is , that your master had better be very careful what he is about .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 35]: Of course , he knows not that you have told me anything ; but as soon as he thinks proper to trust me , I then will do my utmost in his service . ''
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 27]: `` You speak like a very rational , sensible , intelligent courier , '' replied McShane , `` and so now let us finish the bottle .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 30]: Here 's good luck to Captain O'Donahue , alive or dead : and now -- please the fleas -- I 'll be asleep in less than ten minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOURTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 7]: GOING TO COURT , AND COURTING .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 33]: When McShane awoke the next morning he tried to recall what had passed between him and Dimitri , and did not feel quite convinced that he had not trusted him too much .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 18]: `` I think , '' said he , `` it was all upon an _ if _ .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 19]: Yes , sure ; _ if _ O'Donahue was in love , and _ if _ she was .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 14]: Yes , I 'm sure that it was all upon _ ifs _ .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 14]: However , I must go and tell O'Donahue what has taken place . ''
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 88]: McShane did so ; and O'Donahue , after a little thought , replied , `` Well , I do n't know : perhaps it 's all for the best ; for you see I must have trusted somebody , and the difficulty would have been to know whom to trust , for everybody belongs to the police here , I believe : I think , myself , the fellow is honest ; at all events , I can make it worth his while to be so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 23]: `` He would not have told me he belonged to the police if he wished to trap us , '' replied McShane .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 18]: `` That 's very true , and on the whole I think we could not do better .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 42]: But we are going on too fast ; who knows whether she meant anything by what she said to me when we parted ; or , if she did then , whether she may not have altered her mind since ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 14]: `` Such things have been -- that 's a fact , O'Donahue . ''
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 12]: `` And will be , as long as the world lasts .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 15]: However , to-morrow I am to be presented -- perhaps I may see her .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 24]: I 'm glad that I know that I may chance to meet her , as I shall now be on my guard . ''
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 10]: `` And what shall I say to Dimitri ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 30]: `` Say that you mentioned her name , and where she was , and that I had only replied , that I should like to see her again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 20]: `` Exactly ; that will leave it an open question , as the saying is , '' replied McShane .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 34]: The next day O'Donahue , in his uniform , drove to the ambassador 's hotel , to accompany him to the Annishkoff palace , where he was to be presented to the emperor .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 42]: O'Donahue was most graciously received , the emperor walking up to him , as he stood in the circle , and inquiring after the health of his Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief , what service he had been employed upon , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 29]: He then told O'Donahue that the Empress would be most glad to make his acquaintance , and hoped that he would make a long stay at Saint Petersburg .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 17]: It was with a quickened pulse that O'Donahue followed the ambassador into the empress 's apartments .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 45]: He had not waited there more than five minutes , in conversation with the ambassador when the doors opened , and the empress , attended by her chamberlain , and followed by her ladies in waiting and maids of honour , entered the room .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 20]: O'Donahue had made up his mind not to take his eyes off the empress until the presentation was over .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 52]: As soon as he had kissed hands , and answered the few questions which were graciously put to him , he retired to make room for others , and then , for the first time , did he venture to cast his eyes on the group of ladies attending the empress .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 31]: The first that met his view were unknown , but , behind all the rest , he at length perceived the Princess Czartorinski , talking and laughing with another lady .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 13]: After a short time she turned round , and their eyes met .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 31]: The princess recognised him with a start , and then turned away and put her hand up to her breast , as if the shock had taken away her breath .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 24]: Once more she turned her face to O'Donahue , and this time he was fully satisfied by her looks that he was welcome .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 15]: Ten minutes after , the ambassador summoned O'Donahue , and they quitted the palace .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 27]: `` I have seen her , McShane , '' said O'Donahue ; `` she is more beautiful , and I am more in love than ever .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 10]: And now , what am I to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 11]: `` That 's just the difficulty , '' replied McShane .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 31]: `` Shall I talk with Dimitri , or shall I hold my tongue , or shall I think about it while you go to dinner at the ambassador 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 10]: `` I can not dine out to-day , McShane .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 7]: I will write an excuse . ''
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 17]: `` Well , now , I do believe you 're in for it in good earnest .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 23]: My love never spoiled my appetite ; on the contrary , it was my appetite that made me fall in love . ''
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 20]: `` I wish she had not been a princess , '' said O'Donahue , throwing himself on the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 12]: `` That 's nothing at all here , '' replied McShane .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 10]: `` A _ princess _ is to be had .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 19]: Now , if she had been a _ general _ it would have been all up with you .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 11]: Military rank is everything here , as Dimitri says . ''
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 14]: `` She 's an angel , '' replied O'Donahue , with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 18]: `` That 's rank in heaven , but goes for nothing in Petersburg , '' replied McShane .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 36]: `` Dimitri tells me they 've _ civil _ generals here , which I conceive are improvements on our staff , for devil a civil general I 've had the pleasure of serving under . ''
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 22]: `` What shall I do , '' said O'Donahue , getting up and preparing to write his note to the ambassador .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 32]: `` Eat your dinner , drink a bottle of champagne , and then I 'll come and talk it over with you , that 's all you can do at present .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 23]: Give me the note , and I 'll send Dimitri off with it at once , and order up your dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 12]: McShane 's advice not being very bad , it was followed .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 24]: O'Donahue had finished his dinner , and was sitting by the fire with McShane , when there was a knock at the door .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 30]: McShane was summoned , and soon returned , saying , `` There 's a little fellow that wants to speak with you , and wo n't give his message .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 59]: He 's a queer little body , and not so bad-looking either , with a bolster on the top of his head , and himself not higher than a pillow ; a pigeon could sit upon his shoulder and peck up peas out of his shoes ; he struts like a grenadier , and , by the powers !
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 12]: a grenadier 's cap would serve as an extinguisher for him .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 7]: Shall I show him in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 7]: `` Certainly , '' replied O'Donahue .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 69]: The reader may not be aware that there is no part of the globe where there are so many dwarfs as at Saint Petersburg ; there is scarcely an hotel belonging to a noble family without one or two , if not more ; they are very kindly treated , and are , both in appearance and temper , very superior to the dwarfs occasionally met with elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 72]: One of this diminutive race now entered the room , dressed in a Turkish costume ; he was remarkably well made and handsome in person ; he spoke sufficient French to inquire if he addressed himself to Captain O'Donahue ; and on being replied to in the affirmative , he gave him a small billet , and then seated himself on the sofa with all the freedom of a petted menial .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 38]: O'Donahue tore open the note ; it was very short : -- `` As I know you can not communicate with me , I write to say that I was delighted at your having kept your promise .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 24]: You shall hear from me again as soon as I know where I can meet you ; in the meantime , be cautious .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 12]: The bearer is to be trusted ; he belongs to me .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 18]: `` C. '' O'Donahue pressed the paper to his lips , and then sat down to reply .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 45]: We shall not trouble the reader with what he said ; it is quite sufficient that the lady was content with the communication , and also at the report from her little messenger of the Captain 's behaviour when he had read her billet .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 35]: Two or three days afterwards , O'Donahue received a note from a German widow lady , a Countess Erhausen , particularly requesting he would call upon her in the afternoon , at three o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 92]: As he had not as yet had the pleasure of being introduced to the countess , although he had often heard her spoken of in the first society , O'Donahue did not fail in his appointment , as he considered that it was possible that the Princess Czartorinski might be connected with it ; nor was he deceived , for on his entering the saloon , he found the princess sitting on the sofa with Madame Erhausen , a young and pretty woman , not more than twenty-five years of age .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 19]: The princess rose , and greeted Captain O'Donahue , and then introduced the countess as her first cousin .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 15]: A few minutes after his introduction , the countess retired , leaving them alone .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 16]: O'Donahue did not lose this opportunity of pouring out the real feelings of his heart .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 39]: `` You have come a long way to see me , Captain O'Donahue , and I ought to be grateful , '' replied the princess : `` indeed , I have much pleasure in renewing our acquaintance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 74]: O'Donahue , however , did not appear satisfied with this mere admission : he became eloquent in his own cause , pointed out the cruelty of having brought him over to see her again if he was not to be rewarded , and after about an hour 's pleading he was sitting on the sofa by her side , with her fair hand in his , and his arm round her slender waist .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 21]: They parted , but through the instrumentality of the little dwarf , they often met again at the same rendezvous .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 48]: Occasionally they met in society , but before others they were obliged to appear constrained and formal ; there was little pleasure in such meetings , and when O'Donahue could not see the princess his chief pleasure was to call upon Madame Erhausen and talk about her .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 29]: `` You are aware , Captain O'Donahue , '' said the countess one day , `` that there will be a great difficulty to overcome in this affair .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 32]: The princess is a sort of ward of the emperor 's , and it is said that he has already , in his own mind , disposed of her hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 25]: `` I am aware of that , '' replied O'Donahue ; `` and I know no other means than running away with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 37]: `` That would never do , '' replied the countess ; `` you could not leave Petersburg without passports ; nor could she leave the palace for more than an hour or two without being missed .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 16]: You would soon be discovered , and then you would lose her for ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 11]: `` Then what can I do , my dear madame ?
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 12]: Shall I throw myself upon the indulgence of the emperor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 24]: `` No , that would not answer either ; she is too rich a prize to be permitted to go into foreign hands .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 11]: I 'll tell you what you must first do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 7]: `` I 'm all attention . ''
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 13]: `` You must make love to me , '' replied the countess .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 6]: `` Nay , understand me .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 24]: I mean that you must _ appear _ to make love to me , and the report of our marriage must be spread .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 18]: The emperor will not interfere in such a case ; you must do so to avoid suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 18]: You have been here very often , and your equipage has been constantly seen at the door .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 31]: If it is supposed you do not come on my account , it will be inquired why you do come ; and there is no keeping a secret at Petersburg .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 24]: After it is supposed that it is a settled affair between us , we then may consider what next ought to be done .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 27]: My regard for my cousin alone induces me to consent to this ; indeed , it is the only way she could avoid future misery . ''
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 12]: `` But is the emperor so despotic on these points ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 44]: `` An emperor is not to be trifled with ; a ward of the emperor is considered sacred -- at least , so far , that if a Russian were to wed one without permission , he probably would be sent to Siberia .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 29]: With an Englishman it is different , perhaps ; and , once married , you would be safe , as you could claim the protection of your ambassador .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 35]: The great point is , to let it be supposed that you are about to marry some one else ; and then , suspicion not being awakened , you may gain your wish . ''
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 31]: `` But tell me , madame , -- that I may be safe from the emperor 's displeasure is true -- but would the princess , after he discovered it ?
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 18]: Could he not take her away from me , and send her to Siberia for disobedience ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 29]: `` I hope , by the means I propose , to get you both clear of the emperor -- at least , till his displeasure is softened down .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 16]: Me he can not hurt ; he can only order me out of his dominions .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 43]: As for the princess , I should think that , if once married to you , she would be safe , for you could claim the protection of the ambassador for her , as your wife , as well as for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 7]: Do you comprehend me now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 15]: `` I do , madame ; and may blessings follow you for your kindness .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 11]: I shall in future act but by your directions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 21]: `` That is exactly what I wished you to say ; and so now , Captain O'Donahue , farewell . ''
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIFTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 7]: A RUNAWAY AND A HARD PURSUIT .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 51]: `` Well , now , '' said McShane , after he had been informed by O'Donahue of what had passed between him and the countess , -- `` this is all very pretty , and looks very well ; but tell me , are we to trust that fellow Dimitri ?
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 6]: Can we do without him ?
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 32]: I should say not when it comes to the finale ; and is it not dangerous to keep him out of our confidence , being such a sharp , keen-witted fellow ?
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 24]: Nay , more , as he has stated his wish to serve you in any way , it is only treating him fairly .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 28]: He knows the little dwarf who has been here so often ; indeed , they were fellow-servants in the Czartorinski family , for he told me so .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 6]: I would trust him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 16]: `` I think so , too ; but we must not tell him all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 19]: `` No , that we certainly need not , for he will find it out without telling . ''
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 24]: `` Well , McShane , do as you please ; but on second thoughts , I will speak to the countess to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 30]: O'Donahue did so , the countess called upon the princess at the palace , and the next morning O'Donahue received a note stating that Dimitri was to be trusted .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 26]: O'Donahue then sent for the courier , and told him that he was about to put confidence in him on a promise of his fidelity .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 31]: `` I understand you , sir , and all you intend to do ; there is no occasion to say anything more to me , until you want my assistance .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 35]: I will not , in the meantime , neglect your interest , for I hope to remain with you , and that is the only reward I ask for any services I may perform .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 38]: I have only one remark to make now , which is , that it will be necessary , a few days before you leave Petersburg , to let me know , that I may advertise it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 5]: `` Advertise it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 20]: `` Yes , sir , you must advertise your departure , that you may not run away in debt .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 27]: Such is the custom ; and without three notices being put in the _ Gazette _ , the police will not give you your passport . ''
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 9]: `` I am glad that you mentioned it .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 30]: Of course you are aware that I am paying attention to the Countess Erhausen , and shall leave Petersburg with her , I trust , as my wife ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 20]: `` I understand sir , and shall take care that your intimacy there shall be known to everybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 8]: So saying , Dimitri left the room .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 9]: The winter now set in with unusual severity .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 34]: The river was one mass of ice , the floating bridges had been removed , the Montagnes-Russes became the amusement of the day , and the sledges were galloping about in every direction .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 65]: For more than a month O'Donahue continued his pretended addresses to the fair cousin of the princess , and during that time he did not once see the real object of his attachment : indeed , the dwarf never made his appearance , and all communication , except an occasional note from her to the countess , was , from prudence , given up .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 21]: The widow was rich , and had often been pressed to renew her bonds , but had preferred her liberty .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 18]: O'Donahue , therefore , was looked upon as a fortunate man , and congratulated upon his success .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 28]: Nor did the widow deny the projected union , except in a manner so as to induce people to believe in the certainty of its being arranged .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 37]: O'Donahue 's equipage was always at her door , and it was expected that the marriage would immediately take place , when O'Donahue attended a levee given by the emperor on the Feast of Saint Nicholas .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 53]: The emperor , who had been very civil to O'Donahue , as he walked past him , said , `` Well , Captain O'Donahue , so I understand that you intend to run away with one of our fairest and prettiest ladies -- one of the greatest ornaments of my court ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 21]: `` I trust that I have your Majesty 's permission so to do , '' replied O'Donahue , bowing low .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 19]: `` Oh , certainly you have ; and , moreover , our best wishes for your happiness . ''
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 56]: `` I humbly thank your Majesty , '' replied O'Donahue ; `` still I trust your Majesty does not think that I wish to transplant her to my own country altogether , and that I shall be permitted to reside , for the major part of the year , in your Majesty 's dominions . ''
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 29]: `` Nothing will give me greater pleasure ; and it will be a satisfaction to feel that I shall gain instead of losing by the intended marriage . ''
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 5]: `` By the powers !
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 17]: but I will remind him of this , some day or another , '' thought O'Donahue .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 18]: `` Have n't I his permission to the marriage , and to remain in the country ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 11]: Everything was now ripe for the execution of the plot .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 59]: The countess gave out that she was going to her country-seat , about ten miles from Saint Petersburg ; and it was naturally supposed that she was desirous that the marriage should be private , and that she intended to retire there to have the ceremony performed ; and O'Donahue advertised his departure in the _ Gazette _ .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 104]: The Princess Czartorinski produced a letter from the countess , requesting her , as a favour , to obtain leave from the empress to pass two or three days with her in the country ; and the empress , as the countess was first-cousin to the princess , did not withhold her consent ; on the contrary , when the princess left the palace , she put a case of jewels in her hand , saying , `` These are for the bride , with the good wishes and protection of the empress , as long as she remains in this country . ''
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 20]: One hour afterwards O'Donahue was rewarded for all his long forbearance by clasping his fair one in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 27]: A priest had been provided , and was sent forward to the country chateau , and at ten in the morning all the parties were ready .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 21]: The princess and her cousin set off in the carriage , followed by O'Donahue , with McShane and his suite .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 7]: Everything was _ en regle _ .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 36]: The passports had been made out for Germany , to which country it was reported the countess would proceed a few days after the marriage , and the princess was to return to the palace .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 44]: As soon as they arrived at the chateau the ceremony was performed , and O'Donahue obtained his prize ; and to guard against any mishap , it was decided that they should leave the next morning , on their way to the frontier .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 21]: Dimitri had been of the greatest use , had prepared against every difficulty , and had fully proved his fidelity .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 11]: The parting between the countess and her cousin was tender .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 11]: `` How much do I owe , dear friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 4]: said the princess .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 9]: `` What risk do you incur for me !
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 11]: How will you brave the anger of the emperor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 8]: `` I care little for his anger .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 74]: I am a woman , and not a subject of his ; but , before you go , you must both write a letter -- your husband to the emperor , reminding him of his having given his consent to the marriage , and his wish that he should remain in his dominions ; and let him add his sincere wish , if permitted , to be employed in his Majesty 's service .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 29]: You , my dear cousin , must write to the empress , reminding her of her promise of protection , and soliciting her good offices with the emperor .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 22]: I shall play my own game ; but , depend upon it , it will all end in a laugh . ''
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 33]: O'Donahue and his wife both wrote their letters , and O'Donahue also wrote one to the English ambassador , informing him of what had taken place , and requesting his kind offices .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 60]: As soon as they were finished , the countess bade them farewell , saying , `` I shall not send these letters until you are well out of reach , depend upon it ; '' and , with many thanks for her kindness , O'Donahue and his bride bade her adieu , and set off on their long journey .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 32]: The carriage procured for their journey was what is called a German _ batarde _ , which is very similar to an English chariot with coach-box , fixed upon a sleigh .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 41]: Inside were O'Donahue and his young bride , McShane preferring to ride outside on the box with Joey , that he might not be in the way , as a third person invariably is , with a newly married couple .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 22]: The snow was many feet deep on the ground ; but the air was dry , and the sun shone bright .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 60]: The bride was handed in , enveloped in a rich mantle of sable ; O'Donahue followed , equally protected against the cold ; while McShane and Joey fixed themselves on the box , so covered up in robes of wolf-skins , and wrappers of bear-skins for their feet , that you could see but the tips of their noses .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 49]: On the front of the sleigh , below the box of the carriage , were seated the driver and the courier ; four fiery young horses were pawing with impatience ; the signal was given , and off they went at the rate of sixteen miles an hour .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 17]: `` Where 's the guns , Joey , and the pistols , and the ammunition ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 18]: inquired McShane ; `` we 're going through a wild sort of country , I expect . ''
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 51]: `` I have put them in myself , and I can lay my hands on them immediately , sir , '' replied Joey ; `` the guns are behind us , and your pistols and the ammunition are at my feet ; the captain 's are in the carriage . ''
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 21]: `` That 's all right , then ; I like to know where to lay my hands upon my tools .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 45]: Just have the goodness to look at my nose now and then , Joey ; and if you see a white spot on the tip of it , you 'll be pleased to tell me , and I 'll do the same for you .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 21]: Mrs McShane would be anything but pleased if I came home with only half a handle to my face . ''
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 50]: The journey was continued at the same rapid pace until the close of the day , when they arrived at the post-house ; there they stopped , McShane and Joey , with the assistance of the courier , preparing their supper from the stores which they brought with them .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 90]: After supper they retired , O'Donahue and his wife sleeping in the carriage , which was arranged so as to form a bed if required ; while McShane and Joey made it out how they could upon the cloaks and what little straw they could procure , on the floor of the post-house , where , as McShane said the next morning , they `` had more bed-fellows than were agreeable , although he contrived to get a few hours ' sleep in spite of the jumping vagabonds . ''
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 19]: When they rose the next morning , they found that the snow had just begun to fall fast .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 19]: As soon as they had breakfasted they set out , nevertheless , and proceeded at the same pace .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 52]: McShane telling Joey , who was , as well as himself , almost embedded in it before the day was half over , that it was `` better than rain , at all events ; '' to be sure that was cold comfort , but any comfort is better than none .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 34]: O'Donahue 's request for McShane to come inside was disregarded ; he was as tough as little Joey , at all events , and it would be a pity to interrupt the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 36]: About four o'clock they had changed their horses at a small village , and were about three miles on their last stage , for that day 's journey , when they passed through a pine-forest .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 24]: `` There 's a nice place for an ambuscade , Joey , if there were any robbers about here , '' observed McShane .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 5]: `` Murder and Irish !
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 17]: what 's those chaps running among the trees so fast , and keeping pace with us ?
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 19]: I say , Dimitri , '' continued McShane , pointing to them , `` what are those ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 47]: The courier looked in the direction pointed out , and as soon as he had done so , spoke to the driver , who , casting his eyes hastily in the direction , applied the lash to his horses , and set off with double speed .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 22]: `` Wolves , sir , '' replied the courier , who then pulled out his pistols , and commenced loading them .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 4]: `` Wolves ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 27]: said McShane , `` and hungry enough , I 'll warrant ; but they do n't hope to make a meal of us , do they ?
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 13]: At all events we will give them a little fight for it .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 28]: Come , Joey , I see that Dimitri do n't like it , so we must shake off the snow , and get our ammunition ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 34]: This was soon done ; the guns were unstrapped from the back of the coach-box , the pistols got from beneath their feet , and all were soon ready , loaded and primed .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 39]: `` It 's lucky there 's such a mist on the windows of the carriage , that the lady ca n't see what we 're after , or she 'd be frightened , perhaps , '' said Joey .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 49]: The rapid pace at which the driver had put his horses had for a time left the wolves in the rear ; but now they were seen following the carriage at about a quarter of a mile distant , having quitted the forest and taken to the road .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 8]: `` Here they come , the devils !
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 12]: one , two , three -- there are seven of them .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 13]: I suppose this is what they call a covey in these parts .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 9]: Were you ever wolf-hunting before , Joey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 22]: `` I do n't call this wolf-hunting , '' replied Joey ; `` I think the wolves are hunting us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 20]: `` It 's all the same , my little poacher -- it 's a hunt , at all events .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 16]: They are gaining on us fast ; we shall soon come to an explanation . ''
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 95]: The courier now climbed up to the coach-box to reconnoitre , and he shook his head , telling them in very plain English that he did not like it ; that he had heard that the wolves were out in consequence of the extreme severity of the weather , and that he feared that these seven were only the advance of a whole pack ; that they had many versts to go , for the stage was a long one , and it would be dark before they were at the end of it .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 11]: `` Have you ever been chased by them before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 3]: said Joey .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 27]: `` Yes , '' replied the courier , `` more than once ; it 's the horses that they are so anxious to get hold of .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 56]: Three of our horses are very good , but the fourth is not very well , the driver says , and he is fearful that he will not hold out ; however , we must keep them off as long as we can ; we must not shoot at them till the last moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 3]: inquired McShane .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 22]: `` Because the whole pack would scent the blood at miles , and redouble their efforts to come up with us .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 28]: There is an empty bottle by you , sir ; throw it on the road behind the carriage ; that will stop them for a time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 7]: `` An empty bottle stop them !
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 23]: well , that 's queer : it may stop a man drinking , because he can get no mote out of it .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 31]: However , as you please , gentlemen ; here 's to drink my health , bad manners to you , '' said McShane , throwing the bottle over the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 65]: The courier was right : at the sight of the bottle in the road , the wolves , who are of a most suspicious nature , and think that there is a trap laid for them in everything , stopped short , and gathered round it cautiously ; the carriage proceeded , and in a few minutes the animals were nearly out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 27]: `` Well , that bothers me entirely , '' said McShane ; `` an empty bottle is as good to them as a charged gun . ''
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 22]: `` But look , sir , they are coming on again , '' said Joey , `` and faster than ever .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 13]: I suppose they were satisfied that there was nothing in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 14]: The courier mounted again to the box where Joey and McShane were standing .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 30]: `` I think you had a ball of twine , '' said he to Joey , `` when you were tying down the baskets ; where is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 20]: `` It is here under the cushion , '' replied Joey , searching for the twine and producing it .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 11]: `` What shall we find to tie to it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 17]: said the courier ; `` something not too heavy -- a bottle wo n't do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 7]: `` What 's it for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 3]: inquired McShane .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 11]: `` To trail , sir , '' replied the courier .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 4]: `` To trail !
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 27]: I think they 're fast enough upon our trail already ; but if you want to help them , a red herring 's the thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 19]: `` No , sir , a piece of red cloth would do better , '' replied the courier .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 4]: `` Red cloth !
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 13]: One would think you were fishing for mackerel , '' replied McShane .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 19]: `` Will this piece of black cloth do , which was round the lock of the gun ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 3]: said Joey .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 13]: `` Yes , I think it will , '' replied the courier .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 56]: The courier made fast the cloth to the end of the twine , and throwing it clear of the carriage , let the ball run out , until he had little more than the bare end in his hand , and the cloth was about forty yards behind the carriage , dragging over the snow .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 25]: `` They will not pass the cloth , sir , '' said the courier ; `` they think that it 's a trap . ''
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 32]: Sure enough the wolves , which had been gaining fast on the carriage , now retreated again ; and although they continued the pursuit , it was at a great distance .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 50]: `` We have an hour and a half more to go before we arrive , and it will be dark , I 'm afraid , '' said the courier ; `` all depends upon the horse holding out ; I 'm sure the pack is not far behind . ''
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 11]: `` And how many are there in a pack ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 3]: inquired McShane .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 7]: The courier shrugged up his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 8]: `` Perhaps two or three hundred . ''
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 3]: the devil !
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 13]: Do n't I wish I was at home with Mrs McShane . ''
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 20]: For half an hour they continued their rapid pace , when the horse referred to showed symptoms of weakness .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 18]: Still the wolves had not advanced beyond the piece of black cloth which trailed behind the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 24]: `` I think that , considering that they are so hungry , they are amazing shy of the bait , '' said McShane .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 12]: `` By all the powers , they 've stopped again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 19]: `` The string has broke , sir , and they are examining the cloth , '' cried Joey .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 8]: `` Is there much line left ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 8]: inquired the courier , with some alarm .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 18]: `` No , it has broken off by rubbing against the edge of the carriage behind . ''
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 62]: The courier spoke to the driver , who now rose from his seat and lashed his horses furiously ; but although three of the horses were still fresh , the fourth could not keep up with them , and there was every prospect of his being dragged down on his knees , as more than once he stumbled and nearly fell .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 23]: In the meantime the wolves had left the piece of cloth behind them , and were coming up fast with the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 33]: `` We must fire on them now , sir , '' said the courier , going back to his seat , `` or they will tear the flanks of the horses . ''
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 30]: McShane and Joey seized their guns , the headmost wolf was now nearly ahead of the carriage ; Joey fired , and the animal rolled over in the snow .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 18]: `` That 's a good shot , Joey ; load again ; here 's at another . ''
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 33]: McShane fired , and missed the animal , which rushed forward ; the courier 's pistol , however , brought it down , just as he was springing on the hindmost horses .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 18]: O'Donahue , astonished at the firing , now lowered down the glass , and inquired the reason .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 24]: McShane replied , that the wolves were on them , and that he 'd better load his pistols in case they were required .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 25]: The wolves hung back a little upon the second one falling , but still continued the chase , although at a more respectable distance .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 19]: The road was now on a descent , but the sick horse could hardly hold on his legs .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 41]: `` A little half-hour more and we shall be in the town , '' said the courier , climbing up to the coach-seat , and looking up the road they had passed ; `` but Saint Nicholas preserve us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 20]: he exclaimed ; and he turned round and spoke in hurried accents to the driver in the Russian language .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 16]: Again the driver lashed furiously , but in vain ; the poor horse was dead-beat .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 8]: `` What is the matter now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 3]: inquired McShane .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 12]: `` Do you see that black mass coming down the hill ?
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 22]: it 's the main pack of wolves ; I fear we are lost ; the horse can not go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 17]: `` Then why not cut his traces , and go on with the three others ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 3]: cried Joey .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 21]: `` The boy is right , '' replied the man , `` and there is no time to lose . ''
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 22]: The courier went down on the sleigh , spoke to the driver in Russian , and the horses were pulled up .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 43]: The courier jumped out with his knife , and commenced cutting the traces of the tired horse , while the other three , who knew that the wolves were upon them , plunged furiously in their harness , that they might proceed .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 6]: It was a trying moment .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 31]: The five wolves now came up ; the first two were brought down by the guns of McShane and Joey , and O'Donahue killed a third from the carriage windows .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 19]: One of the others advanced furiously , and sprang upon the horse which the courier was cutting free .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 40]: Joey leapt down , and put his pistol to the animal 's head , and blew out his brains , while McShane , who had followed our hero , with the other pistol disabled the only wolf that remained .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 43]: But this danger which they had escaped from was nothing compared to that which threatened them ; the whole pack now came sweeping like a torrent down the hill , with a simultaneous yell which might well strike terror into the bravest .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 29]: The horse , which had fallen down when the wolf seized him , was still not clear of the sleigh , and the other three were quite unmanageable .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 40]: McShane , Joey , and the courier , at last drew him clear from the track ; they jumped into their places , and away they started again like the wind , for the horses were maddened with fear .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 29]: The whole pack of wolves was not one hundred yards from them when they recommenced their speed , and even then McShane considered that there was no hope .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 39]: But the horse that was left on the road proved their salvation ; the starved animals darted upon it , piling themselves one on the other , snarling and tearing each other in their conflict for the feast .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 81]: It was soon over ; in the course of three minutes the carcass had disappeared , and the major portion of the pack renewed their pursuit ; but the carriage had proceeded too far ahead of them , and their speed being now uninterrupted , they gained the next village , and O'Donahue had the satisfaction of leading his terrified bride into the chamber of the post-house , where she fainted as soon as she was placed in a chair .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 84]: `` I 'll tell you what , Joey , I 've had enough of wolves for all my life , '' said McShane ; `` and Joey , my boy , you 're a good shot in the first place , and a brave little fellow in the next ; here 's a handful of roubles , as they call them , for you to buy lollipops with , but I do n't think you 'll find a shop that sells them hereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 72]: Never mind , keep your sweet tooth till you get to old England again ; and after I tell Mrs McShane what you have done for us this day , she will allow you to walk into a leg of beef , or round a leg of mutton , or dive into a beefsteak pie , as long as you live , whether it be one hundred years more or less .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 39]: I 've said it , and do n't you forget it ; and now , as the wolves have not made their supper upon us , let us go and see what we can sup upon ourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIXTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 4]: RETURN TO ENGLAND .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 56]: The remainder of the journey was completed without any further adventure , and they at last found themselves out of the Russian dominions , when they were met by the uncle of the princess , who , as a Pole , was not sorry that his niece had escaped from being wedded to a Russian .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 26]: He warmly greeted O'Donahue , as his connection , and immediately exerted all the interest which he had at the court to pacify the emperor .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 123]: When the affair first became known , which it soon did , by the princess not returning to court , his Majesty was anything but pleased at being outwitted ; but the persuasions of the empress , the pleading of the English ambassador , who exerted himself strenuously for O'Donahue , with the efforts made in other quarters , and more than all , the letter of O'Donahue , proving that the emperor had given his consent -LRB- unwittingly , it is true -RRB- , coupled with his wish to enter into his service , at last produced the desired effect , and after two months a notice of their pardon and permission to return was at last despatched by the empress .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 25]: O'Donahue considered that it was best to take immediate advantage of this turn in his favour , and retrace his way to the capital .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 52]: McShane , who had been quite long enough in the situation of a domestic , now announced his intention to return home ; and O'Donahue , aware that he was separating him from his wife , did not , of course , throw any obstacle in the way of his departure .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 22]: Our little hero , who has lately become such a cipher in our narrative , was now the subject of consideration .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 13]: O'Donahue wished him to remain with him , but McShane opposed it .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 70]: `` I tell you , O'Donahue , that it 's no kindness to keep him here ; the boy is too good to be a page at a lady 's shoestring , or even a servant to so great a man as you are yourself now : besides , how will he like being buried here in a foreign country , and never go back to old England ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 13]: `` But what will he do better in England , McShane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 32]: `` Depend upon it , major , '' said the princess , for she was now aware of McShane 's rank , `` I will treat him like a son . ''
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 45]: `` Still he will be a servant , my lady , and that 's not the position -- although , begging your pardon , an emperor might be proud to be your servant ; yet that 's not the position for little Joey . ''
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 35]: `` Prove that you will do better for him , McShane , and he is yours : but without you do , I am too partial to him to like to part with him .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 37]: His conduct on the journey -- '' `` Yes , exactly , his conduct on the journey , when the wolves would have shared us out between them , is one great reason for my objection .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 14]: He is too good for a menial , and that 's the fact .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 193]: You ask me what I intend to do with him ; it is not so easy to answer that question , because you see , my lady , there 's a certain Mrs McShane in the way , who must be consulted ; but I think that when I tell her , what I consider to be as near the truth as most things which are said in this world , that if it had not been for the courage and activity of little Joey , a certain Major McShane would have been by this time eaten and digested by a pack of wolves , why , I then think , as Mrs McShane and I have no child , nor prospect of any , as I know of , that she may be well inclined to come into my way of thinking , and of adopting him as her own son ; but , of course , this can not be said without my consulting with Mrs McShane , seeing as how the money is her own , and she has a right to do as she pleases with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 39]: `` That , indeed , alters the case , '' replied O'Donahue , `` and I must not stand in the way of the boy 's interest ; still I should like to do something for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 40]: `` You have done something for him , O'Donahue ; you have prevented his starving ; and if he has been of any use to you , it is but your reward -- so you and he are quits .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 15]: Well , then , it is agreed that I take him with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' replied O'Donahue .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 14]: `` I can not refuse my consent after what you have said . ''
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 57]: Two days after this conversation the parties separated : O'Donahue , with his wife , accompanied by Dimitri , set off on their return to Saint Petersburg ; while McShane , who had provided himself with a proper passport , got into the diligence , accompanied by little Joey , on his way back to England .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVENTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 6]: THE DAY AFTER THE MURDER .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 65]: We must now return to the village of Grassford , and the cottage in which we left Rushbrook and his wife , who had been raised up from the floor , by her husband , and , having now recovered from her swoon , was crying bitterly for the loss of her son , and the dread of her husband 's crime being discovered .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 38]: For some time Rushbrook remained in silence , looking at the embers in the grate : Mum sometimes would look piteously in his master 's face , at other times he would slowly approach the weeping woman .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 12]: The intelligence of the animal told him that something was wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 30]: Finding himself unnoticed , he would then go to the door by which Joey had quitted , snuff at the crevice , and return to his master 's side .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 25]: `` I 'm glad that he 's off , '' at last muttered Rushbrook ; `` he 's a fine boy , that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 20]: `` Yes , he is , '' replied Jane ; `` but when shall I behold him again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 8]: `` By-and-bye , never fear , wife .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 15]: We must not stay in this place , provided this affair blows over . ''
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 8]: `` If it does , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 81]: `` Come , come , Jane , we have every reason to hope it will ; now , let 's go to bed ; it would not do , if any one should happen to have been near the spot , and to have found out what has taken place , for us to be discovered not to have been in bed all night , or even for a light to be seen at the cottage by any early riser .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 10]: Come , Jane , let 's to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 33]: Rushbrook and his wife retired , the light was extinguished , and all was quiet , except conscience , which still tormented and kept Rushbrook turning to the right and left continually .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 34]: Jane slept not : she listened to the wind ; the slightest noise -- the crowing of the cock -- startled her , and soon footsteps were heard of those passing the windows .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 8]: They could remain in bed no longer .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 23]: Jane arose , dressed , and lighted the fire : Rushbrook remained sitting on the side of the bed in deep thought .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 27]: `` I 've been thinking , Jane , '' said he , at last , `` it would be better to make away with Mum . ''
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 5]: `` With the dog ?
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 10]: Why , it ca n't speak , poor thing .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 12]: No -- no -- do n't kill the poor dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 21]: `` He ca n't speak , but the dog has sense ; he may lead them to the spot . ''
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 12]: `` And if he were to do so , what then ?
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 6]: it would prove nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 9]: only it would go harder against Joey . ''
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 5]: `` Against the boy !
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 38]: yes , it might convince them that Joey did the deed ; but still , the very killing of the animal would look suspicious : tie him up , Rushbrook ; that will do as well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 23]: `` Perhaps better , '' replied he ; `` tie him up in the back-kitchen , there 's a good woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 36]: Jane did so , and then commenced preparing the breakfast ; they had taken their seats , when the latch of the door was lifted up , and Furness , the schoolmaster , looked in .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 20]: This he was often in the habit of doing , to call Joey out to accompany him to school .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 18]: `` Good morning , '' said he ; `` now , where 's my friend Joey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 26]: `` Come in , come in , neighbour , and shut the door , '' said Rushbrook ; `` I wish to speak to you .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 22]: Mayhap you 'll take a cup of tea ; if so , my missus will give you a good one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 26]: `` Well , as Mrs Rushbrook does make everything so good , I do n't care if I do , although I have had breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 7]: But where 's my friend Joey ?
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 11]: the lazy little dog ; is he not up yet ?
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 9]: Why Mrs Rushbrook , what 's the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 5]: you look distressed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 17]: `` I am , indeed , '' replied Jane , putting her apron to her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 11]: `` Why , Mrs Rushbrook , what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 4]: inquired the pedagogue .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 12]: `` Just this ; we are in great trouble about Joey .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 24]: When we got up this morning we found that he was not in bed , and he has never been home since . ''
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 19]: `` Well , that is queer ; why , where can the young scamp be gone to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 32]: `` We do n't know ; but we find that he took my gun with him , and I 'm afraid -- '' and here Rushbrook paused , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 6]: `` Afraid of what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 16]: `` That he has gone poaching , and has been taken by the keepers . ''
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 10]: `` But did he ever do so before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 11]: `` Not by night , if he did by day .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 15]: I ca n't tell ; he always has had a hankering that way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 13]: `` Well , they do whisper the same of you , neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 8]: Why do you keep a gun ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 46]: `` I 've carried a gun all my life , '' replied Rushbrook , `` and I do n't choose to be without one : but that 's not to the purpose ; the question is , what would you advise us to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 23]: `` Why , you see , friend Rushbrook , '' replied the schoolmaster , `` advice in this question becomes rather difficult .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 44]: If Joey has been poaching , as you imagine , and has been taken up , as you suspect , why , then , you will soon hear of it : you , of course , have had no hand in it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 10]: `` Hand in it -- hand in what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 3]: replied Rushbrook .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 15]: `` Do you think we trust a child like him with a gun ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 22]: `` I should think not ; and therefore it is evident that he has acted without the concurrence of his parents .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 42]: That will acquit you ; but still , it will not help Joey ; neither do I think you will be able to recover the gun , which I anticipate will become a deodand to the lord of the manor . ''
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 13]: `` But , the child -- what will become of him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 3]: exclaimed Jane .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 7]: `` What will become of him ?
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 41]: -- why , as he is of tender years , they will not transport him -- at least , I should think not ; they may imprison him for a few months , and order him to be privately whipped .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 12]: I do not see what you can do but remain quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 17]: I should recommend you not to say one syllable about it until you hear more . ''
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 9]: `` But suppose we do not hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 24]: `` That is to suppose that he did not go out with the gun to poach , but upon some other expedition . ''
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 12]: `` What else could the boy have gone out for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 5]: said Rushbrook , hastily .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 22]: `` Very true ; it is not very likely that he went out to commit murder , '' replied the pedagogue .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 22]: At the word `` murder '' Rushbrook started from his chair ; but , recollecting himself , he sat down again .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 10]: `` No , no , Joey commit murder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 3]: cried he .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 17]: `` Ha , ha , ha -- no , no , Joey is no murderer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 6]: `` I should suspect not .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 20]: Well , Master Rushbrook , I will dismiss my scholars this morning , and make every inquiry for you .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 21]: Byres will be able to ascertain very soon , for he knows the new keeper at the manor house . ''
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 9]: `` Byres help you , did you say ?
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 14]: No , no , Byres never will , '' replied Rushbrook , solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 9]: `` And why not , my friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 22]: `` Why , '' replied Rushbrook , recollecting himself , `` he has not been over cordial with me lately . ''
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 28]: `` Nevertheless , depend upon it , he will if he can , '' replied Furness ; `` if not for you , he will for me .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 21]: Good morning , Mrs Rushbrook , I will hasten away now ; but will you not go with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 7]: continued Furness , appealing to Rushbrook .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 18]: `` I will go another way ; it 's no use both going the same road . ''
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 28]: `` Very true , '' replied the pedagogue , who had his reasons for not wishing the company of Rushbrook , and Furness then left the house .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 56]: Mr Furness found all his boys assembled in the school-room , very busily employed thumbing their books ; he ordered silence , and informed them that in consequence of Joey being missing , he was going to assist his father to look after him : and therefore they would have a holiday for that day .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 25]: He then ranged them all in a row , made them turn to the right face , clap their hands simultaneously , and disperse .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 94]: Although Mr Furness had advised secrecy to the Rushbrooks , he did not follow the advice he had given ; indeed , his reason for not having wished Rushbrook to be with him was , that he might have an opportunity of communicating his secret through the village , which he did by calling at every cottage , and informing the women who were left at home , that Joey Rushbrook had disappeared last night , with his father 's gun , and that he was about to go in quest of him .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 31]: Some nodded and smiled , others shook their heads , some were not at all surprised at it , others thought that things could not go on so for ever .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 22]: Mr Furness having collected all their various opinions , then set off to the ale-house , to find Byres the pedlar .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 36]: When he arrived , he found that Byres had not come home that night , and where he was nobody knew , which was more strange , as his box was up in his bed-chamber .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 31]: Mr Furness returned to the village intending to communicate this information to Rushbrook , but on calling , he found that Rushbrook had gone out in search of the boy .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 19]: Furness then resolved to go up at once to the keeper 's lodge , and solve the mystery .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 11]: He took the high road , and met Rushbrook returning .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 14]: `` Well , have you gained any tidings , '' inquired the pedagogue .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 7]: `` None , '' replied Rushbrook .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 49]: `` Then it 's my opinion , my worthy friend , that we had better at once proceed to the keeper 's cottage and make inquiry ; for , strange to say , I have been to the ale-house , and my friend Byres is also missing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 11]: exclaimed Rushbrook , who had now completely recovered his self-possession .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 16]: `` Be it so , then ; let us go to the keeper 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 20]: They soon arrived there , and found the keeper at home , for he had returned to his dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 16]: Rushbrook , who had been cogitating how to proceed , was the first to speak .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 15]: `` You have n't taken my poor Joey , have you , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 6]: said he to the keeper .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 11]: `` Not yet , '' replied the keeper , surlily .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 15]: `` You do n't mean to say that you know nothing about him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 3]: replied Rushbrook .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 21]: `` Yes , I know something about him and about you too , my chap , '' replied the keeper .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 23]: `` But , Mr Lucas , '' interrupted the pedagogue , `` allow me to put you in possession of the facts .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 60]: It appears that this boy -- a boy of great natural parts , and who has been for some time under my tuition , did last night , but at what hour is unknown to his disconsolate parents , leave the cottage , taking with him his father 's gun , and has not been heard of since . ''
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 20]: `` Well , I only hope he 's shot himself , that 's all , '' replied the keeper .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 17]: `` So you have a gun , then , have you , my honest chap ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 7]: continued he , turning to Rushbrook .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 70]: `` Which , '' replied Furness , `` as I have informed him already , will certainly be forfeited as a deodand to the lord of the manor ; but , Mr Lucas , this is not all ; our mutual friend , Byres , the pedlar , is also missing , having left the Cat and Fiddle last night , and not having been heard of since . ''
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 3]: `` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 14]: that makes out a different case , and must be inquired into immediately .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 14]: I think you were not the best of friends , were you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 48]: said the keeper , looking at Rushbrook ; and then he continued , `` Come , Mary , give me my dinner , quick , and run up as fast as you can for Dick and Martin : tell them to come down with their retrievers only .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 13]: Never fear , Mr Furness , we will soon find it out .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 19]: Never fear , my chap , we 'll find your son also , and your gun to boot .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 10]: You may hear more than you think for . ''
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 35]: `` All I want to know , '' replied Rushbrook , fiercely , for his choler was raised by the sneers of the keeper , `` is , where my boy may be . ''
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 15]: So saying , he quitted the cottage , leaving the schoolmaster with the keeper .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 33]: As Rushbrook returned home , he revolved in his mind what had passed , and decided that nothing could be more favourable for himself , however it might turn out for Joey .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 27]: This conviction quieted his fears , and when the neighbours came in to talk with him , he was very cool and collected in his replies .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 33]: In the meantime the keeper made a hasty meal , and , with his subordinates and the dogs , set off to the covers , which they beat till dark without success .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 36]: The gun , however , which Joey had thrown down in the ditch , had been picked up by one of the labourers returning from his work , and taken by him to the ale-house .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 16]: None could identify the gun , as Rushbrook had never permitted it to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 20]: Lucas , the keeper , came in about an hour after dusk , and immediately took possession of it .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 13]: Such were the events of the first day after Joey 's departure .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 25]: Notwithstanding that the snow fell fast , the Cat and Fiddle was , as it may be supposed , unusually crowded on that night .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 16]: Various were the surmises as to the disappearance of the pedlar and of little Joey .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 31]: The keeper openly expressed his opinion that there was foul play somewhere , and it was not until near midnight that the ale-house was deserted , and the doors closed .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 28]: Rushbrook and his wife went to bed ; tired with watching and excitement , they found oblivion for a few hours in a restless and unrefreshing sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 5]: A CORONER 'S INQUEST .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 16]: Day had scarcely dawned when the keeper and his satellites were again on the search .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 45]: The snow had covered the ground for three or four inches , and , as the covers had been well examined on the preceding day , they now left them and went on in the direction towards where the gun had been picked up .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 43]: This brought them direct to the furze bottom , where the dogs appeared to quicken their movements , and when the keepers came up with them again , they found them lying down by the frozen and stiffened corpse of the pedlar .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 47]: `` Murder , as I expected , '' said Lucas , as they lifted up the body , and scraped off the snow which covered it ; `` right through his heart , poor fellow ; who would have expected this from such a little varmint ?
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 15]: Look about , my lads , and see if we can find anything else .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 6]: What is Nap scratching at ?
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 10]: -- a bag -- take it up , Martin .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 29]: Dick , do you go for some people to take the body to the Cat and Fiddle , while we see if we can find anything more . ''
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 28]: In a quarter of an hour the people arrived , the body was carried away , while the keeper went off in all haste to the authorities .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 31]: Furness , the schoolmaster , as soon as he had obtained the information , hastened to Rushbrook 's cottage , that he might be the first to convey the intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 24]: Rushbrook , however , from the back of the cottage , had perceived the people carrying in the body , and was prepared .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 36]: `` My good people , I am much distressed , but it must be told ; believe me , I feel for you -- your son , my pupil , has murdered the pedlar . ''
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 4]: `` Impossible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 3]: cried Rushbrook .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 61]: `` It is but too true ; I can not imagine how a boy , brought up under my tuition -- nay , Mrs Rushbrook , do n't cry -- brought up , I may say , with such strict notions of morality , promising so fairly , blossoming so sweetly -- '' `` He never murdered the pedlar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 11]: cried Jane , whose face was buried in her apron .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 7]: `` Who then could have ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 3]: replied Furness .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 33]: `` He never shot him intentionally , I 'll swear , '' said Rushbrook ; `` if the pedlar has come to his death , it must have been by some accident .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 34]: I suppose the gun went off somehow or other ; yes , that must be it : and my poor boy , frightened at what had taken place , has run away . ''
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 61]: `` Well , '' replied the schoolmaster , `` such may have been the case ; and I do certainly feel as if it were impossible that a boy like Joey , brought up by me , grounded in every moral duty -- I may add , religiously and piously instructed -- could ever commit such a horrible crime . ''
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 24]: `` Indeed , he never did , '' replied Jane ; `` I am sure he never would do such a thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 39]: `` Well , I must wish you good-bye now , my poor people ; I will go down to the Cat and Fiddle , and hear what they say , '' cried the pedagogue , quitting the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 20]: `` Jane , be careful , '' said Rushbrook ; `` our great point now is to say nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 10]: I wish that man would not come here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 6]: `` Oh , Rushbrook ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 20]: cried Jane , `` what would I give if we could live these last three days over again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 12]: `` Then imagine , Jane , what I would give ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 17]: replied Rushbrook , striking his forehead ; `` and now say no more about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 24]: At twelve o'clock the next day the magistrates met , and the coroner 's inquest was held upon the body of the pedlar .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 64]: On examination of the body , it was ascertained that a charge of small shot had passed directly through the heart , so as to occasion immediate death ; that the murder had not been committed with the view of robbing , it was evident , as the pedlar 's purse , watch , and various other articles were found upon his person .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 22]: The first person examined was a man of the name of Green , who had found the gun in the ditch .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 40]: The gun was produced , and he deposed to its being the one which he had picked up , and given into the possession of the keeper ; but no one could say to whom the gun might belong .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 13]: The next party who gave his evidence was Lucas , the game-keeper .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 134]: He deposed that he knew the pedlar , Byres , and that being anxious to prevent poaching , he had offered him a good sum if he would assist him in convicting any poacher ; that Byres had then confessed to him that he had often received game from Rushbrook , the father of the boy , and still continued to do so , but Rushbrook had treated him ill , and he was determined to be revenged upon him , and get him sent out of the country ; that Byres had informed him on the Saturday night before the murder was committed , that Rushbrook was to be out on Monday night to procure game for him , and that if he looked out sharp he was certain to be taken .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 30]: Byres had also informed him that he had never yet found out when Rushbrook left his cottage or returned , although he had been tracking the boy , Joey .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 41]: As the boy was missing on Monday morning , and Byres did not return to the ale-house , after he went out on Saturday night , he presumed that it was on the Sunday night that the pedlar was murdered .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 57]: The keeper then farther deposed as to the finding of the body , and also of a bag by the side of it ; that the bag had evidently been used for putting game in , not only from the smell , but from the feathers of the birds which were still remaining inside of it .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 24]: The evidence as to the finding of the body and the bag was corroborated by that of Martin and Dick , the underkeepers .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 20]: Mr Furness then made his appearance to give voluntary evidence , notwithstanding his great regard expressed for the Rushbrooks .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 140]: He deposed that , calling at the cottage , on Monday morning , for his pupil , he found the father and mother in great distress at the disappearance of their son , whom they stated to have left the cottage some time during the night , and to have taken away his father 's gun with him , and that their son had not since returned ; that he pointed out to Rushbrook the impropriety of his having a gun , and that Rushbrook had replied that he had carried one all his life , and did not choose to be without one ; that they told him they supposed that he had gone out to poach , and was taken by the keepers , and had requested him to go and ascertain if such was the fact .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 64]: Mr Furness added that he really imagined that to be the case now that he saw the bag , which he recognised as having been once brought to him by little Joey with some potatoes , which his parents had made him a present of ; that he could swear to the bag , and so could several others as well as himself .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 34]: Mr Furness then commenced a long flourish about his system of instruction , in which he was stopped by the coroner , who said that it had nothing to do with the business .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 13]: It was then suggested that Rushbrook and his wife should be examined .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 33]: There was a demur at the idea of the father and mother giving evidence against their child , but it was over-ruled , and in ten minutes they both made their appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 27]: Mrs Rushbrook , who had been counselled by her husband , was the first examined ; but she would not answer any question put to her .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 35]: She did nothing but weep ; and to every question her only reply was , `` If he did kill him , it was by accident ; my boy would never commit murder . ''
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 24]: Nothing more was to be obtained from her ; and the magistrates were so moved by her distress , that she was dismissed .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 37]: Rushbrook trembled as he was brought in and saw the body laid out on the table ; but he soon recovered himself , and became nerved and resolute , as people often will do in extremity .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 15]: He had made up his mind to answer some questions , but not all .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 14]: `` Do you know at what time your son left the cottage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 6]: `` I do not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 9]: `` Does that gun belong to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 8]: `` Yes , it is mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 8]: `` Do you know that bag ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 9]: `` Yes , it belongs to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 15]: `` It has been used for putting game into -- has it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 8]: `` I shall not answer that question .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 7]: I 'm not on trial . ''
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 35]: Many other questions were put to him , but he refused to answer them ; and as they would all more or less have criminated himself as a poacher , his refusals were admitted .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 31]: Rushbrook had played his game well in admitting the gun and bag to be his property , as it was of service to him , and no harm to Joey .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 46]: After summing up the whole evidence , the coroner addressed the jury , and they returned a unanimous verdict of Wilful Murder against Joseph Rushbrook the younger ; and the magistrates directed the sum of 200 pounds to be offered for our hero 's apprehension .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINETEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 9]: A FRIEND IN NEED IS A FRIEND INDEED .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 8]: Rushbrook and Jane returned to their cottage .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 14]: Jane closed the door , and threw herself into her husband 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 17]: `` You are saved at least , '' she cried : `` thank Heaven for that !
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 4]: You are spared .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 15]: we do not know how much we love till anger comes upon us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 18]: Rushbrook was much affected : he loved his wife , and had good reason to love her .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 36]: Jane was a beautiful woman , not yet thirty ; tall in her person , her head was finely formed , yet apparently small for her height her features were full of expression and sweetness .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 20]: Had she been born to a high station , she would have been considered one of the greatest belles .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 28]: As it was , she was loved by those around her ; and there was a dignity and commanding air about her which won admiration and respect .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 43]: No one could feel more deeply than she did the enormity of the offence committed by her husband ; and yet never in any moment since her marriage did she cling so earnestly and so closely by him as she did now .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 28]: She was of that bold and daring temperament , that she could admire the courage that propelled to the crime , while the crime itself she abhorred .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 48]: It was not , therefore , anything surprising that , at such a moment , with regard to a husband to whom she was devoted , she thought more of the danger to which he was exposed than she did of the crime which had been committed .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 16]: To do Rushbrook himself justice , his person and mind were of no plebeian mould .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 44]: He was a daring , venturous fellow , ready at any emergency , cool and collected in danger , had a pleasure in the excitement created by the difficulty and risk attending his nocturnal pursuits , caring little or nothing for the profits .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 85]: He , as well as his wife , had not been neglected in point of education : he had been born in humble life , and had , by enlisting , chosen a path by which advancement became impossible ; but had Rushbrook been an officer instead of a common soldier , his talents would probably have been directed to more noble channels , and the poacher and pilferer for his captain might have exerted his dexterity so as to have gained honourable mention .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 41]: His courage had always been remarkable , and he was looked upon by his officers -- and so he was by his companions -- as the most steady and collected man under fire to be found in the whole company .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 7]: We are the creatures of circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 49]: Frederick of Prussia had no opinion of phrenology ; and one day he sent for the professor , and dressing up a highwayman and a pickpocket in uniforms and orders , he desired the phrenologist to examine their heads , and give his opinion as to their qualifications .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 45]: The _ savant _ did so , and turning to the king , said , `` Sire , this person , '' pointing to the highwayman , `` whatever he may be , would have been a great general , had he been employed .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 13]: As for the other , he is quite in a different line .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 20]: He may be , or , if he is not , he would make , an admirable financier . ''
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 43]: The king was satisfied that there was some truth in the science ; `` for , '' as he very rightly observed , `` what is a general but a highwayman , and what is a financier , but a pickpocket ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 18]: `` Calm yourself , dear Jane , '' said Rushbrook ; `` all is well now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 4]: `` All well !
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 15]: -- yes ; but my poor child -- 200 pounds offered for his apprehension !
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 8]: If they were to take him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 19]: `` I have no fear of that ; and if they did , they could not hurt him .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 19]: It is true that they have given their verdict ; but still they have no positive proof . ''
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 15]: `` But they have hanged people upon less proof before now , Rushbrook . ''
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 27]: `` Jane , '' replied Rushbrook , `` our boy shall never be hanged -- I promise you that ; so make your mind easy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 17]: `` Then you must confess , to save him ; and I shall lose you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 9]: A step at the door interrupted their colloquy .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 15]: Rushbrook opened it , and Mr Furness , the schoolmaster , made his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 49]: `` Well , my good friends , I am very sorry the verdict has been such as it is , but it can not be helped ; the evidence was too strong , and it was a sad thing for me to be obliged to give mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 4]: `` You ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 13]: exclaimed Rushbrook ; `` why , did they call you up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 10]: `` Yes , and put me on my oath .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 59]: An oath , to a moral man , is a very serious responsibility ; the nature of an oath is awful ; and when you consider my position in this place , as the inculcator of morals and piety to the younger branches of the community , you must not be surprised at my telling the truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 9]: `` And what had you to tell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 6]: inquired Rushbrook , with surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 47]: `` Had to tell -- why , I had to tell what you told me this morning ; and I had to prove the bag as belonging to you ; for you know you sent me some potatoes in it by little Joey , poor fellow .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 13]: Wilful Murder , and two hundred pounds upon apprehension and conviction ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 10]: Rushbrook looked at the pedagogue with surprise and contempt .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 34]: `` Pray , may I ask how they came to know that anything had passed between us yesterday morning , for if I recollect right , you desired me to be secret . ''
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 40]: `` Very true , and so I did ; but then they knew what good friends we always were , I suppose , and so they sent for me , and obliged me to speak upon my oath . ''
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 33]: `` I do n't understand it , '' replied Rushbrook ; `` they might have asked you questions , but how could they have guessed that I had told you anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 93]: `` My dear friend , you do n't understand it ; but in my situation , looking up to me , as every one does , as an example of moral rectitude and correctness of conduct -- as a pattern to the juvenile branches of the community , -- you see -- '' `` Yes , I do see that , under such circumstances , you should not go to the ale-house and get tipsy two days , at least , out of the week , '' replied Rushbrook , turning away .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 29]: `` And why do I go to the ale-house , my dear friend , but to look after those who indulge too freely -- yourself , for instance ?
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 9]: How often have I seen you home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 22]: `` Yes , when you were drunk and I was -- '' Jane put her hand upon her husband 's mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 9]: `` And you were what , friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 5]: inquired Furness , anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 7]: `` Worse than you , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 24]: And now , friend Furness , as you must be tired with your long evidence , I wish you a good night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 13]: `` Shall I see you down at the Cat and Fiddle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 19]: `` Not for some time , if ever , friend Furness , that you may depend upon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 9]: `` Never go to the Cat and Fiddle !
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 44]: A little wholesome drink drowns care , my friend ; and , therefore , although I should be sorry that you indulged too much , yet , with me to look after you -- '' `` And drink half my ale , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 13]: No , no , friend Furness , those days are gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 16]: `` Well , you are not in a humour for it now but another time .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 12]: Mrs Rushbrook , have you a drop of small beer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 26]: `` I have none to spare , '' replied Jane , turning away ; `` you should have applied to the magistrates for beer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 42]: `` Oh , just as you please , '' replied the pedagogue ; `` it certainly does ruffle people 's temper when there is a verdict of wilful murder , and two hundred pounds for apprehension and conviction of the offender .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 4]: Good night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 10]: Furness banged the cottage door as he went out .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 20]: Rushbrook watched till he was out of hearing , and then said , `` He 's a scoundrel . ''
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 34]: `` I think so too , '' replied Jane ; `` but never mind , we will go to bed now , thank God for his mercies , and pray for his forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 5]: Come , dearest . ''
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 18]: The next morning Mrs Rushbrook was informed by the neighbours that the schoolmaster had volunteered his evidence .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 11]: Rushbrook 's indignation was excited , and he vowed revenge .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 48]: Whatever may have been the feelings of the community at the time of the discovery of the murder , certain it is that , after all was over , there was a strong sympathy expressed for Rushbrook and his wife , and the condolence was very general .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 28]: The gamekeeper was avoided , and his friend Furness fell into great disrepute , after his voluntarily coming forward and giving evidence against old and sworn friends .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 26]: The consequence was , his school fell off , and the pedagogue , whenever he could raise the means , became more intemperate than ever .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 22]: One Saturday night , Rushbrook , who had resolved to pick a quarrel with Furness , went down to the ale-house .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 8]: Furness was half drunk , and pot-valiant .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 9]: Rushbrook taunted him so as to produce replies .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 18]: One word brought on another , till Furness challenged Rushbrook to come outside and have it out .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 31]: This was just what Rushbrook wished , and after half an hour Furness was carried home beaten to a mummy , and unable to leave his bed for many days .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 67]: As soon as this revenge had been taken , Rushbrook , who had long made up his mind so to do , packed up and quitted the village , no one knowing whither he and Jane went ; and Furness , who had lost all means of subsistence , did the same in a very few days afterwards , his place of retreat being equally unknown .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWENTY .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 11]: IN WHICH WE AGAIN FOLLOW UP OUR HERO 'S DESTINY .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 34]: After the resolution that Major McShane came to , it is not to be surprised that he made , during the journey home , every inquiry of Joey relative to his former life .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 49]: To these Joey gave him a very honest reply in everything except that portion of his history in which his father was so seriously implicated ; he had the feeling that he was bound in honour not to reveal the circumstances connected with the murder of the pedlar .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 13]: McShane was satisfied , and they arrived in London without further adventure .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 31]: As soon as McShane had been embraced by his wife , he gave a narrative of his adventures , and did not forget to praise little Joey as he deserved .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 37]: Mrs McShane was all gratitude , and then it was that McShane expressed his intentions towards our hero , and , as he expected , he found his amiable wife wholly coincide with him in opinion .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 30]: It was therefore decided that Joey should be put to a school , and be properly educated , as soon as an establishment that was eligible could be found .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 58]: Their full intentions towards him , however , were not communicated to our hero ; he was told that he was to go to school , and he willingly submitted : it was not , however , for three months that McShane would part with him : a difficulty was raised against every establishment that was named .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 18]: During this time little Joey was very idle , for there was nothing for him to do .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 20]: Books there were none , for Mrs McShane had no time to read , and Major McShane no inclination .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 27]: His only resort was to rummage over the newspapers which were taken in for the benefit of the customers , and this was his usual employment .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 30]: One day , in turning over the file , he came to the account of the murder of the pedlar , with the report of the coroner 's inquest .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 33]: He read all the evidence , particularly that of Furness , the schoolmaster , and found that the verdict was wilful murder , with a reward of 200 pounds for his apprehension .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 40]: The term , wilful murder , he did not exactly comprehend ; so , after laying down the paper , with a beating heart he went to Mrs McShane , and asked her what was the meaning of it .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 6]: `` Meaning , child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 49]: replied Mrs McShane , who was then very busy in her occupation , `` it means , child , that a person is believed to be guilty of murder , and , if taken up , he will be hanged by the neck till he is dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 17]: `` But , '' replied Joey , `` suppose he has not committed the murder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 15]: `` Well then , child , he must prove that he has not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 18]: `` And suppose , although he has not committed it , he can not prove it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 11]: `` Mercy on me , what a number of supposes !
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 16]: why , then he will be hanged all the same , to be sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 70]: A fortnight after these queries , Joey was sent to school ; the master was a very decent man , the mistress a very decent woman , the tuition was decent , the fare was decent , the scholars were children of decent families ; altogether , it was a decent establishment , and in this establishment little Joey made very decent progress , going home every half year .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 77]: How long Joey might have remained there it is impossible to say ; but having been there for a year and a half , and arrived at the age of fourteen , he had just returned from the holidays with three guineas in his pocket , for McShane and his wife were very generous and very fond of their protege , when a circumstance occurred which again ruffled the smooth current of our hero 's existence .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 44]: He was walking out as all boys do walk out in decent schools , that is , in a long line , two by two , as the animals entered Noah 's Ark , when a sort of shabby-genteel man passed their files .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 12]: He happened to cast his eyes upon Joey , and stopped .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 22]: `` Master Joseph Rushbrook , I am most happy to see you once more , '' said he extending his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 19]: Joey looked up into his face ; there was no mistake ; it was Furness , the schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 11]: `` Do n't you recollect me , my dear boy ?
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 14]: Do n't you recollect him who taught the infant idea how to shoot ?
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 9]: Do n't you recollect your old preceptor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 18]: `` Yes , '' replied Joey , colouring up , `` I recollect you very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 46]: `` I am delighted to see you ; you know you were my fairest pupil , but we are all scattered now ; your father and mother have gone no one knows where ; you went away , and I also could no longer stay .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 11]: What pleasure it is to meet you once more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 9]: Joey did not respond exactly to the pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 27]: The stoppage of the line had caused some confusion , and the usher , who had followed it , now came up to ascertain the cause .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 25]: `` This is my old pupil , or rather I should say , my young pupil ; but the best pupil I ever had .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 19]: I am most delighted to see him , sir , '' said Furness , taking off his hat .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 20]: `` May I presume to ask who has the charge of this dear child at this present moment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 43]: The usher made no difficulty in stating the name and residence of the preceptor , and , having gained this information , Furness shook Joey by the hand , bade him farewell , and , wishing him every happiness , walked away .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 29]: Joey 's mind was confused during the remainder of his walk , and it was not until their return home that he could reflect on what had passed .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 35]: That Furness had given evidence upon the inquest he knew , and he had penetration , when he read it , to feel that there was no necessity for Furness having given such evidence .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 82]: He also knew that there was a reward of two hundred pounds for his apprehension ; and when he thought of Furness 's apparent kindness , and his not reverting to a subject so important as wilful murder having been found against him , he made up his mind that Furness had behaved so with the purpose of lulling him into security , and that the next day he would certainly take him up , for the sake of the reward .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 67]: Now , although we have not stopped our narrative to introduce the subject , we must here observe that Joey 's love for his parents , particularly his father , was unbounded ; he longed to see them again ; they were constantly in his thoughts , and yet he dared not mention them , in consequence of the mystery connected with his quitting his home .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 24]: He fully perceived his danger : he would be apprehended , and being so , he must either sacrifice his father or himself .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 20]: Having weighed all this in his mind , he then reflected upon what should be his course to steer .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 9]: Should he go home to acquaint Major McShane ?
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 33]: He felt that he could trust him , and would have done so , but he had no right to intrust any one with a secret which involved his father 's life .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 31]: No , that would not do ; yet , to leave him and Mrs McShane after all their kindness , and without a word , this would be too ungrateful .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 35]: After much cogitation , he resolved that he would run away , so that all clue to him should be lost ; that he would write a letter for McShane , and leave it .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 44]: He wrote as follows : -- `` DEAR SIR , -- Do not think me ungrateful , for I love you and Mrs McShane dearly , but I have been met by a person who knows me , and will certainly betray me .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 25]: I left my father 's home , not for poaching , but a murder that was committed ; _ I was not guilty _ .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 18]: This is the only secret I have held from you , and the secret is not MINE .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 10]: I could not disprove it , and never will .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 25]: I now leave because I have been discovered by a bad man , who will certainly take advantage of having fallen in with me .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 6]: We may never meet again .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 25]: I can say no more , except that I shall always pray for you and Mrs McShane , and remember your kindness with gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 8]: `` Yours truly , JOEY MCSHANE . ''
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 48]: Since his return from Saint Petersburg , Joey had always , by their request , called himself Joey McShane , and he was not sorry when they gave him the permission , although he did not comprehend the advantages which were to accrue from taking the name .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 36]: Joey , having finished his letter , sat down and cried bitterly -- but in a school there is no retiring place for venting your feelings , and he was compelled to smother his tears .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 31]: He performed his exercise , and repeated his lessons , as if nothing had happened and nothing was about to happen , for Joey was in essence a little stoic .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 75]: At night he went to his room with the other boys ; he could only obtain a small portion of his clothes , these he put up in a handkerchief , went softly downstairs about one o'clock in the morning , put his letter , addressed to McShane , on the hall-table , opened the back door , climbed over the play-ground wall , and was again on the road to seek his fortune .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 18]: But Joey was much improved during the two years since he had quitted his father 's house .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 20]: Before that , he was a reflective boy ; now , he was more capable of action and decision .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 53]: His ideas had been much expanded from the knowledge of the world gained during his entry , as it were , into life ; he had talked much , seen much , listened much , and thought more ; and naturally quiet in his manner , he was now a gentlemanlike boy .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 32]: At the eating-house he had met with every variety of character ; and as there were some who frequented the house daily , with those Joey had become on intimate terms .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 35]: He was no longer a child , but a lad of undaunted courage and presence of mind ; he had only one fear , which was that his father 's crime should be discovered .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 24]: And now he was again adrift , with a small bundle , three guineas in his pocket , and the world before him .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 33]: At first , he had but one idea -- that of removing to a distance which should elude the vigilance of Furness , and he therefore walked on , and walked fast .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 55]: Joey was capable of great fatigue ; he had grown considerably , it is true , during the last two years ; still he was small for his age ; but every muscle in his body was a wire , and his strength , as had been proved by his school-mates , was proportionate .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 21]: He was elastic as india-rubber , and bold and determined as one who had been all his life in danger .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 11]: THE SCENE IS AGAIN SHIFTED , AND THE PLOT ADVANCES .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 21]: It will be necessary that for a short time we again follow up the fortunes of our hero 's parents .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 49]: When Rushbrook and Jane had quitted the village of Grassford , they had not come to any decision as to their future place of abode ; all that Rushbrook felt was a desire to remove as far as possible from the spot where the crime had been committed .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 38]: Such is the feeling that will ever possess the guilty , who , although they may increase their distance , attempt in vain to fly from their consciences , or that All-seeing Eye which follows them everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 16]: Jane had a similar feeling , but it arose from her anxiety for her husband .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 35]: They wandered away , for they had sold everything before their departure , until they found themselves in the West Riding of Yorkshire , and there they at length settled in a small village .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 22]: Rushbrook easily obtained employment , for the population was scanty , and some months passed away without anything occurring of interest .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 28]: Rushbrook had never taken up his employment as a poacher since the night of the murder of the pedlar ; he had abjured it from that hour .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 33]: His knowledge of woodcraft was , however , discovered , and he was appointed first as under , and eventually as head keeper to a gentleman of landed property in the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 146]: In this situation they had remained about a year , Rushbrook giving full satisfaction to his employer , and comparatively contented -LRB- for no man could have such a crime upon his conscience , and not pass occasional hours of misery and remorse -RRB- , and Jane was still mourning in secret for her only and darling child , when one day a paper was put into Rushbrook 's hands by his master , desiring him to read an advertisement which it contained , and which was as follows : -- `` If Joseph Rushbrook , who formerly lived in the village of Grassford , in the county of Devon , should be still alive , and will make his residence known to Messrs. Pearce , James , and Simpson , of 14 , Chancery-lane , he will hear of something greatly to his advantage .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 29]: Should he be dead , and this advertisement meet the eye of his heirs , they are equally requested to make the communication to the above address . ''
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 9]: `` What does it mean , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 3]: inquired Rushbrook .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 37]: `` It means that , if you are that person , in all probability there is some legacy bequeathed to you by a relative , '' replied Mr S -- ; `` is it you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 21]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied Rushbrook , changing colour ; `` I did once live at Grassford . ''
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 14]: `` Then you had better write to the parties and make yourself known .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 8]: I will leave you the newspaper . ''
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 8]: `` What think you , Jane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 11]: said Rushbrook , as soon as Mr -- had quitted .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 12]: `` I think he is quite right , '' replied Jane .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 28]: `` But , Jane , you forgot -- this may be a trap ; they may have discovered something about -- you know what I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 28]: `` Yes , I do , and I wish we could forget it ; but in this instance I do not think you have anything to fear .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 48]: There is no reward offered for your apprehension , but for my poor boy 's , who is now wandering over the wide world ; and no one would go to the expense to apprehend you , if there was nothing to be gained by it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 18]: `` True , '' replied Rushbrook , after a minute 's reflection ; `` but , alas !
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 11]: I am a coward now : I will write . ''
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 29]: Rushbrook wrote accordingly , and , in reply , received a letter inclosing a bank-bill for 20 pounds , and requesting that he would come to town immediately .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 46]: He did so , and found , to his astonishment , that he was the heir-at-law to a property of 7,000 pounds per annum -- with the only contingency , that he was , as nearest of kin , to take the name of Austin .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 47]: Having entered into all the arrangements required by the legal gentleman , he returned to Yorkshire , with 500 pounds in his pocket , to communicate the intelligence to his wife ; and when he did so , and embraced her , she burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 32]: `` Rushbrook , do not think I mean to reproach you by these tears ; but I can not help thinking that you would have been happier had this never happened .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 24]: Your life will be doubly sweet to you now , and Joey 's absence will be a source of more vexation than ever .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 10]: Do you think that you will be happier ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 5]: `` Jane , dearest !
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 23]: I have been thinking of it as well as you , and , on reflection , I think I shall be safer .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 21]: Who would know the poacher Rushbrook in the gentleman of 7,000 pounds a year , of the name of Austin ?
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 12]: Who would dare accuse him , even if there were suspicion ?
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 23]: I feel that once in another county , under another name , and in another situation , I shall be safe . ''
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 19]: `` But our poor boy , should he ever come back -- '' `` Will also be forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 31]: He will have grown up a man , and , having another name , will never be recognised : they will not even know what our former name was . ''
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 11]: `` I trust that it will be as you say .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 9]: What do you now mean to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 32]: `` I shall say that I have a property of four or five hundred pounds left me , and that I intend to go up to London , '' replied Rushbrook .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 34]: `` Yes , that will be wise ; it will be an excuse for our leaving this place , and will be no clue to where we are going , '' replied Jane .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 14]: Rushbrook gave up his situation , sold his furniture , and quitted Yorkshire .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 25]: In a few weeks afterwards he was installed into his new property , a splendid mansion , and situated in the west of Dorsetshire .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 52]: Report had gone before them ; some said that a common labourer had come into the property , others said it was a person in very moderate circumstances ; as usual , both these reports were contradicted by a third , which represented him as a half-pay lieutenant in the army .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 82]: Rushbrook had contrived to mystify even the solicitor as to his situation in life ; he stated to him that he had retired from the army , and lived upon the government allowance ; and it was in consequence of a reference to the solicitor , made by some of the best families in the neighbourhood , who wished to ascertain if the newcomers were people who could be visited , that this third report was spread , and universally believed .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 44]: We have already observed that Rushbrook was a fine , tall man ; and if there is any class of people who can be transplanted with success from low to high life , it will be those who have served in the army .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 22]: The stoop is the evidence of a low-bred , vulgar man ; the erect bearing equally so that of the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 36]: Now , the latter is gained in the army , by drilling and discipline , and being well-dressed will provide for all else that is required , as far as mere personal appearance is concerned .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 48]: When , therefore , the neighbours called upon Mr and Mrs Austin they were not surprised to find an erect , military-looking man , but they were very much surprised to find him matched with such a fine , and even elegant-looking woman , as his wife .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 48]: Timid at first , Jane had sufficient tact to watch others and copy ; and before many months were passed in their new position , it would have been difficult to suppose that Mrs Austin had not been born in the sphere in which she then moved .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 38]: Austin was _ brusque _ and abrupt in his manners as before ; but still there was always a reserve about him , which he naturally felt , and which assisted to remove the impression of vulgarity .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 19]: People who are distant are seldom considered ungentlemanlike , although they may be considered unpleasant in their manners .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 14]: It is those who are too familiar who obtain the character of vulgarity .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 55]: Austin , therefore , was respected , but not liked ; Jane , on the contrary , whose beauty had now all the assistance of dress , and whose continued inward mourning for her lost son had improved that beauty by the pensive air which she wore , was a deserved and universal favourite .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 32]: People of course said that Austin was a harsh husband , and pitied poor Mrs Austin ; but that people always do say if a woman is not inclined to mirth .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 17]: Austin found ample amusement in sporting over his extensive manor , and looking after his game .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 29]: In one point the neighbouring gentlemen were surprised , that , although so keen a sportsman himself , he never could be prevailed upon to convict a poacher .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 26]: He was appointed a magistrate , and being most liberal in all his subscriptions , was soon considered as a great acquisition to the county .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 26]: His wife was much sought after , but it was invariably observed that , when children were mentioned , the tears stood in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 54]: Before they had been a year in their new position , they had acquired all the knowledge and tact necessary ; their establishment was on a handsome scale ; they were visited and paid visits to all the aristocracy and gentry , and were as popular as they could have desired to be .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 5]: But were they happy ?
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 2]: no .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 29]: Little did those who envied Austin his property and establishment imagine what a load was on his mind -- what a corroding care was wearing out his existence .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 49]: Little did they imagine that he would gladly have resigned all , and been once more the poacher in the village of Grassford , to have removed from his conscience the deed of darkness which he had committed , and once more have his son by his side .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 19]: And poor Jane , her thoughts were day and night upon one object -- where was her child ?
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 47]: It deprived her of rest at night ; she remained meditating on her fate for hours during the day ; it would rush into her mind in the gayest scenes and the happiest moments ; it was one incessant incubus -- one continual source of misery .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 65]: Of her husband she thought less ; for she knew how sincerely contrite he was for the deed he had done -- how bitterly he had repented it ever since , and how it would , as long as he lived , be a source of misery -- a worm that would never die , but gnaw till the last hour of his existence .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 11]: But her boy -- her noble , self-sacrificed little Joey !
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 37]: -- he and his destiny were ever in her thoughts ; and gladly would she have been a pauper applying for relief , if she had but that child to have led up in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 27]: And yet all the county thought how happy and contented the Austins ought to be , to have suddenly come into possession of so much wealth .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 14]: 'T is God alone that knows the secrets of the heart of man .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 18]: A VERY LONG CHAPTER , BUT IN WHICH OUR HERO OBTAINS EMPLOYMENT IN A VERY SHORT TIME .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 19]: The preparatory establishment for young gentlemen to which our hero had been sent , was situated on Clapham-rise .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 42]: Joey did not think it prudent to walk in the direction of London ; he therefore made a cut across the country , so as to bring him , before seven o'clock in the morning , not very far from Gravesend .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 168]: The night had been calm and beautiful , for it was in the month of August ; and it had for some time been broad daylight when our hero , who had walked fifteen or sixteen miles , sat down to repose himself ; and , as he remained quietly seated on the green turf on the way side , he thought of his father and mother , of the kindness of the McShanes , and his own hard fate , until he became melancholy and wept ; and , as the tears were rolling down his cheeks , a little girl , of about ten years old , very neatly dressed , and evidently above the lower rank of life , came along the road , her footsteps so light as not to be perceived by Joey ; she looked at him as she passed , and perceived that he was in tears , and her own bright , pretty face became clouded in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 109]: Joey did not look up , and after hesitating awhile , she passed on a few steps , and then she looked round , and observing that he was still weeping , she paused , turned round , and came back to him ; for a minute or two she stood before him , but Joey was unconscious of her presence , for he was now in the full tide of his grief , and , not having forgotten the precepts which had been carefully instilled into him , he thought of the God of Refuge , and he arose , fell on his knees , and prayed .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 69]: The little girl , whose tears had already been summoned by pity and sympathy , dropped her basket , and knelt by his side -- not that she prayed , for she knew not what the prayer was for , but from an instinctive feeling of respect towards the Deity which her new companion was addressing , and a feeling of kindness towards one who was evidently suffering .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 82]: Joey lifted up his eyes , and beheld the child on her knees , the tears rolling down her cheeks ; he hastily wiped his eyes , for until that moment , he imagined that he had been alone ; he had been praying on account of his loneliness -- he looked up , and he was not alone , but there was one by his side who pitied him , without knowing wherefore ; he felt relieved by the sight .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 34]: They both regained their feet at the same time , and Joe went up to the little girl , and , taking her by the hand , said , `` Thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 7]: `` Why do you cry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 5]: said the little girl .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 15]: `` Because I am unhappy ; I have no home , '' replied Joey .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 5]: `` No home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 30]: said the little girl ; `` it is boys who are in rags and starving , who have no home , not young gentlemen dressed as you are . ''
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 12]: `` But I have left my home , '' replied Joey .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 16]: `` Then go back again -- how glad they will be to see you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 18]: `` Yes , indeed they would , '' replied Joey , `` but I must not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 11]: `` You have not done anything wrong , have you ?
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 28]: No , I 'm sure you have not -- you must have been -LSB- be -RSB- a good boy , or you would not have prayed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 19]: `` No , I have done nothing wrong , but I must not tell you any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 43]: Indeed , Joey was much more communicative with the little girl than he would have been with anybody else ; but he had been surprised into it , and , moreover , he had no fear of being betrayed by such innocence .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 10]: He now recollected himself , and changed the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 9]: `` And where are you going to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 3]: inquired he .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 9]: `` I am going to school at Gravesend .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 12]: I go there every morning , and stay till the evening .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 8]: This is my dinner in my basket .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 5]: Are you hungry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 7]: `` No , not particularly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 8]: `` Are you going to Gravesend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' replied Joey .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 7]: `` What is your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 5]: `` Emma Phillips . ''
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 9]: `` Have you a father and mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 20]: `` I have no father ; he was killed fighting , a little while after I was born . ''
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 22]: `` And your mother -- '' `` Lives with grandmother , at that house you see there through the large trees .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 10]: And what are you going to do with yourself ?
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 7]: Will you come home with me ?
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 26]: and I 'll tell my mother all you have told me , and she is very kind , and will write to your friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 20]: `` No , no ; you must not do that ; I am going to seek for employment . ''
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 9]: `` Why , what can you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 30]: `` I hardly know , '' replied Joey ; `` but I can work , and am willing to work , so I hope I shall not starve . ''
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 29]: With such conversation they continued their way , until the little girl said , `` There is my school , so now I must wish you good-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 22]: `` Good-bye ; I shall not forget you , '' replied Joey , `` although we may never meet again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 18]: Tears stood in the eyes of our hero , as they reluctantly unclasped their hands and parted .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 19]: Joey , once more left alone , now meditated what was the best course for him to pursue .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 34]: The little Emma 's words , `` Not young gentlemen dressed as you are , '' reminded him of the remarks and suspicions which must ensue if he did not alter his attire .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 73]: This he resolved to do immediately ; the only idea which had presented itself to his mind was , if possible , to find some means of getting back to Captain O'Donahue , who , he was sure , would receive him , if he satisfied him that it was not safe for him to remain in England ; but , then , must he confess to him the truth or not ?
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 21]: On this point our hero was not decided , so he put off the solution of it till another opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 59]: A slop warehouse now attracted his attention ; he looked into the door after having examined the articles outside , and seeing that a sailor-boy was bargaining for some clothes , he went in as if waiting to be served , but in fact , more to ascertain the value of the articles which he wished to purchase .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 25]: The sailor had cheapened a red frock and pair of blue trousers , and at last obtained them from the Jew for 14 shillings .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 54]: Joey argued that , as he was much smaller than the lad , he ought to pay less ; he asked for the same articles , but the Jew , who had scanned in his own mind the suit of clothes which Joey had on , argued that he ought to pay more .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 34]: Joey was , however , firm , and about to leave the shop , when the Jew called him back , and after much haggling , Joey obtained the dress for 12 shillings .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 36]: Having paid for the clothes , Joey begged permission to be permitted to retire to the back shop and put them on , to ascertain if they fitted him , to which the Jew consented .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 51]: A Jew asks no questions when a penny is to be turned ; who Joey was , he cared little ; his first object was to sell him the clothes , and having so done he hoped to make another penny by obtaining those of Joey at a moderate price .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 115]: Perceiving that our hero was putting his own clothes , which he had taken off ; into a bundle , the Jew asked him whether he would sell them , and Joey immediately agreed ; but the price offered by the Jew was so small , that they were returned to the bundle , and once more was Joey leaving the shop , when the Jew at last offered to return to him the money he had paid for the sailor 's dress , and take his own clothes in exchange , provided that Joey would also exchange his hat for one of tarpaulin , which would be more fitting to his present costume .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 26]: To this our hero consented , and thus was the bargain concluded without Joey having parted with any of his small stock of ready money .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 25]: No one who had only seen him dressed as when he quitted the school , would have easily recognised Joey in his new attire .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 27]: Joey sallied forth from the shop with his bundle under his arm , intending to look out for a breakfast , for he was very hungry .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 53]: Turning his head right and left to discover some notice of where provender might be obtained , he observed the sailor lad , who had been in the shop when he went in , with his new purchase under his arm , looking very earnestly at some prints in a shop window .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 63]: Joey ranged up alongside of him , and inquired of him where he could get something to eat ; the lad turned round , stared , and , after a little while , cried , `` Well , now , you 're the young gentleman chap that came into the shop ; I say are n't you after a rig , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 9]: Given them leg bail , I 'll swear .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 8]: No consarn of mine , old fellow .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 9]: Come along , I 'll show you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 29]: Joey walked by his new acquaintance a few yards , when the lad turned to him , `` I say , did your master whop you much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 7]: `` No , '' replied Joey .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 23]: `` Well , then , that 's more than I can say of mine , for he was at it all day .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 20]: Hold out your right hand , now your left , '' continued he , mimicking ; `` my eyes !
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 6]: how it used to sting .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 30]: I do n't think I should mind it much now , continued the lad , turning up his hand ; it 's a little harder than it was then .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 22]: Here 's the shop , come in ; if you have n't no money I 'll give you a breakfast . ''
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 40]: The lad took his seat on one side of a narrow table , Joey on the other , and his new acquaintance called for two pints of tea , a twopenny loaf , and two penny bits of cheese .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 24]: The loaf was divided between them , and with their portion of cheese and pint of tea each they made a good breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 30]: As soon as it was over , the young sailor said to Joey , `` Now , what are you going arter ; do you mean to ship ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 21]: `` I want employment , '' replied Joey ; `` and I do n't much care what it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 37]: `` Well , then , look you ; I ran away from my friends and went to sea , and do you know I 've only repented of it once , and that 's ever since .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 98]: Better do anything than go to sea -- winter coming on and all ; besides , you do n't look strong enough ; you do n't know what it is to be coasting in winter time ; thrashed up to furl the top-gallant sail when it is so dark you ca n't see your way , and so cold that you ca n't feel your fingers , holding on for your life , and feeling as if life , after all , was not worth caring for ; cold and misery aloft , kicks and thumps below .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 32]: Do n't you go to sea ; if you do , after what I 've told you , why then you 're a greater fool than you look to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 25]: `` I do n't want to be a sailor , '' replied Joey , `` but I must do something to get my living .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 14]: You are very kind : will you tell me what to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 78]: `` Why , do you know , when I saw you come up to me , when I was looking at the pictures , in your frock and trousers , you put me in mind , because you are so much like him , of a poor little boy who was drowned the other day alongside of an India ship ; that 's why I stared , for I thought you were he , at first . ''
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 10]: `` How was he drowned , poor fellow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 3]: responded Joey .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 27]: `` Why , you see , his aunt is a good old soul , who keeps a bumboat , and goes off to the shipping . ''
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 7]: `` What 's a bumboat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 43]: `` A boat full of soft tommy , soldiers , pipes , and backey , rotten apples , stale pies , needles and threads , and a hundred other things ; besides a fat old woman sitting in the stern sheets . ''
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 28]: Joey stared ; he did not know that `` soft tommy '' meant loaves of bread , or that `` soldiers '' was the term for red-herrings .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 11]: He only thought that the boat must be very full .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 21]: `` Now , you see that little Peter was her right-hand man , for she ca n't read and write .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 3]: Can you ?
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 7]: but of course you can . ''
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 10]: `` Yes , I can , '' replied Joey .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 45]: `` Well , little Peter was holding on by the painter against a hard sea , but his strength was not equal to it , and so when a swell took the boat he was pulled right overboard , and he was drowned . ''
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 8]: `` Was the painter drowned too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 3]: inquired Joey .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 3]: `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 12]: that 's capital ; why , the painter is a rope .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 29]: Now , the old woman has been dreadfully put out , and does nothing but cry about little Peter , and not being able to keep her accounts .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 64]: Now , you look very like him , and I think it very likely the old woman would take you in his place , if I went and talked her over ; that 's better than going to sea , for at all events you sleep dry and sound on shore every night , even if you do have a wet jacket sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 5]: What d'ye think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 19]: `` I think you are very kind ; and I should be glad to take the place . ''
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 38]: `` Well , she 's a good old soul , and has a warm heart , and trusts them who have no money ; too much , I 'm afraid , for she loses a great deal .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 39]: So now I 'll go and speak to her , for she 'll be alongside of us when I go on board ; and where shall I find you when I come on shore in the evening ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 10]: `` Wherever you say , I will be . ''
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 18]: `` Well , then , meet me here at nine o'clock ; that will make all certain .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 8]: Come , I must be off now .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 8]: I 'll pay for the breakfast . ''
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 13]: `` I have money , I thank you , '' replied Joey .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 21]: `` Then keep it , for it 's more than I can do ; and what 's your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 4]: `` Joey . ''
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 39]: `` Well then , Joey , my hearty , if I get you this berth , when we come in , and I am short , you must let me go on tick till I can pay . ''
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 6]: `` What 's tick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 27]: `` You 'll soon find out what tick is , after you have been a week in the bumboat , '' replied the lad , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 10]: `` Nine o'clock , my hearty ; good-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 19]: So saying , the young sailor caught up his new clothes , and hastened down to the beach .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 27]: The room was crowded with seamen and women , but they were too busy talking and laughing to pay any attention to Joey and his comrade .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 48]: Our little hero sat some little time at the table after his new acquaintance had left , and then walked out into the streets , telling the people of the house that he was coming back again , and requesting them to take care of his bundle .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 39]: `` You 'll find it here , my little fellow , all right when you ask for it , '' said the woman at the bar , who took it inside and put it away under the counter .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 10]: Joey went out with his mind more at ease .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 31]: The nature of his new employment , should he succeed in obtaining it , he could scarcely comprehend , but still it appeared to him one that he could accomplish .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 37]: He amused himself walking down the streets , watching the movements of the passers-by , the watermen in their wherries , and the people on board of the vessels which were lying off in the stream .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 8]: It was a busy and animating sight .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 84]: As he was lolling at the landing-place , a boat came on shore , which , from the description given by his young sailor friend , he was convinced was a bumboat ; it had all the articles described by him , as well as many others , such as porter in bottles , a cask probably containing beer ; leeks , onions , and many other heterogeneous matters , and , moreover , there was a fat woman seated in the stern .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 13]: The waterman shoved in with his boat-hook , and the wherry grounded .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 45]: The fat personage got out , and the waterman handed to her a basket , a long book , and several other articles , which she appeared to consider indispensable ; among others , a bundle which looked like dirty linen for the wash .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 4]: `` Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 10]: how shall I get up all these things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 26]: exclaimed the woman ; `` and , William , you ca n't leave the boat , and there 's nobody here to help me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 24]: `` I 'll help you , '' said Joey , coming down the steps : `` what shall I carry for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 21]: `` Well , you are a good kind boy , '' replied she ; `` can you carry that bundle ?
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 8]: I 'll manage all the rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 11]: Joey tossed the bundle on his shoulder in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 15]: `` Well , you are a strong little chap , '' said the waterman .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 14]: `` He is a very nice little fellow , and a kind one .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 13]: Now , come along , and I 'll not forget you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 41]: Joey followed with the bundle , until they arrived at a narrow door , not eighty yards from the landing-place , and the woman asked him if he would carry it upstairs to the first floor , which he did .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 9]: `` Do you want me any more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 8]: said Joey , setting down the bundle .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 17]: `` No , dear , no ; but I must give you something for your trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 6]: What do you expect ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 169]: `` Nothing at all , '' replied Joey ; `` and I shall not take anything ; you 're very welcome ; good-bye ; '' and so saying , Joey walked downstairs , although the woman halloed after him , and recommenced his peregrination in the streets of Gravesend ; but he was soon tired of walking on the pavement , which was none of the best , and he then thought that he would go out into the country , and enjoy the green fields ; so off he set , the same way that he came into the town , passed by the school of little Emma , and trudged away on the road , stopping every now and then to examine what attracted his notice ; watching a bird if it sang on the branch of a tree , and not moving lest he should frighten it away ; at times sitting down by the road-side , and meditating or the past and the future .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 91]: The day was closing in , and Joey was still amusing himself as every boy who has been confined to a schoolroom would do ; he sauntered on until he came to the very spot where he had been crying , and had met with little Emma Phillips ; and as he sat down again , he thought of her sweet little face , and her kindness towards him -- and there he remained some time till he was roused by some one singing as they went along the road .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 18]: He looked up , and perceived it was the little girl , who was returning from school .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 40]: Joey rose immediately , and walked towards her to meet her , but she did not appear to recognise him , and would have passed him if he had not said , `` Do n't you know me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 65]: `` Yes , I do now , '' replied she , smiling , `` but I did not at first -- you have put on another dress ; I have been thinking of you all day -- and , do you know , I 've got a black mark for not saying my lesson , '' added the little girl , with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 21]: `` And , then , it is my fault , '' replied Joey ; `` I 'm very sorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 26]: `` Oh , never mind ; it is the first that I have had for a long while , and I shall tell mamma why .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 15]: But you are dressed as a sailor-boy -- are you going to sea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 34]: `` No , I believe not -- I hope to have employment in the town here , and then I shall be able to see you sometimes , when you come from school .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 13]: May I walk with you as far as your own house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 13]: `` Yes , I suppose so , if you like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 19]: Joey walked with her until they came to the house , which was about two hundred yards farther .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 18]: `` But , '' said Joey , hesitating , `` you must make me a promise . ''
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 6]: `` What is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 7]: `` You must keep my secret .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 38]: You must not tell your mother that you saw me first in what you call gentleman 's clothes -- it might do me harm -- and indeed it 's not for my own sake I ask it .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 29]: Do n't say a word about my other clothes , or they may ask me questions which I must not answer , for it 's not my secret .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 21]: I told you more this morning than I would have told any one else -- I did , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 45]: `` Well , '' replied the little girl , after thinking a little , `` I suppose I have no right to tell a secret , if I am begged not to do it , so I will say nothing , about your clothes .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 11]: But I must tell mother that I met you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 40]: `` Oh , yes ; tell her you met me , and that I was looking for some work , and all that , and to-morrow or next day I will let you know if I get any . ''
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 8]: `` Will you come in now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 3]: said Emma .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 49]: `` No , not now ; I must see if I can get this employment promised for me , and then I shall see you again ; if I should not see you again , I shall not forget you , indeed I wo n't -- Good-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 25]: Emma bade him adieu , and they separated , and Joey remained and watched her till she disappeared under the porch of the entrance .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 41]: Our hero returned towards Gravesend in rather a melancholy mood ; there was something so unusual in his meeting with the little girl -- something so uncommon in the sympathy expressed by her -- that he felt pain at parting .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 23]: But it was getting late , and it was time that he kept his appointment with his friend , the sailor boy .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 27]: Joey remained at the door of the eating-house for about a quarter of an hour , when he perceived the sailor lad coming up the street .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 7]: He went forward to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 7]: `` Oh , here we are .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 69]: Well , young fellow , I 've seen the old woman , and had a long talk with her , and she wo n't believe there can be another in the world like her Peter , but I persuaded her to have a look at you , and she has consented ; so come along , for I must be on board again in half an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 24]: Joey followed his new friend down the street , until they came to the very door to which he had carried the bundle .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 29]: The sailor boy mounted the stairs , and turning into the room at the first landing , Joey beheld the woman whom he had assisted in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 28]: `` Here he is , Mrs Chopper , and if he wo n't suit you , I do n't know who will , '' said the boy .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 16]: `` He 's a regular scholar , and can sum up like winkin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 25]: This character , given so gratuitously by his new acquaintance , made Joey stare , and the woman looked hard into Joey 's face .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 17]: `` Well , now , '' said she , `` where have I seen you before ?
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 3]: Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 21]: and _ he is _ like poor Peter , as you said , Jim ; I vow he is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 22]: `` I saw you before to-day , '' replied Joey , `` for I carried a bundle up for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 15]: `` And so you did , and would have no money for your trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 11]: Well , Jim , he is like poor Peter . ''
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 40]: `` I told you so , old lady ; ay , and he 'll just do for you as well as Peter did ; but I 'll leave you to settle matters , for I must be a-board . ''
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 25]: So saying , the lad tipped a wink to Joey , the meaning of which our hero did not understand , and went downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 37]: `` Well , now , it 's very odd ; but do you know you are like poor Peter , and the more I look at you the more you are like him : poor Peter !
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 9]: did you hear how I lost him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 12]: `` Yes , the sailor lad told me this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 4]: `` Poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 45]: he held on too fast ; most people drown by not holding on fast enough : he was a good boy , and very smart indeed ; and so it was you who helped me this morning when I missed poor Peter so much ?
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 25]: Well , it showed you had a good heart , and I love that ; and where did you meet with Jim Paterson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 22]: `` I met him first in a slop-shop , as he calls it , when I was buying my clothes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 22]: `` Well , Jim 's a wild one , but he has a good heart , and pays when he can .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 18]: I 've been told by those who know his parents , that he will have property by-and-bye .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 8]: Well , and what can you do ?
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 12]: I am afraid you ca n't do all Peter did . ''
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 18]: `` I can keep your accounts , and I can be honest and true to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 23]: `` Well , Peter could not do more : are you sure you can keep accounts , and sum up totals ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 13]: `` Yes , to be sure I can ; try me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 17]: `` Well , then , I will : here is pen , ink , and paper .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 16]: Well , you are the very image of Peter , and that 's a fact .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 18]: Now write down beer , 8 pence ; tobacco , 4 pence ; is that down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 30]: `` Let me see : duck for trousers , 3 shillings , 6 pence ; beer again , 4 pence ; tobacco , 4 pence ; is that down ?
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 11]: Well , then , say beer again , 8 pence .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 7]: Now sum that all up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 30]: Joey was perfect master of the task , and , as he handed over the paper , announced the whole sum to amount to 5 shillings , 10 pence .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 29]: `` Well , '' says Mrs Chopper , `` it looks all right ; but just stay here a minute while I go and speak to somebody . ''
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 27]: Mrs Chopper left the room , went downstairs , and took it to the bar-girl at the next public-house to ascertain if it was all correct .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 14]: `` Yes , quite correct , Mrs Chopper , '' replied the lass .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 15]: `` And is it as good as Peter 's was , poor fellow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 9]: `` Much better , '' replied the girl .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 4]: `` Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 6]: Who would have thought it ?
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 7]: and so like Peter too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 27]: Mrs Chopper came upstairs again , and took her seat -- `` Well , '' said she , `` and now what is your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 4]: `` Joey . ''
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 5]: `` Joey what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 21]: `` Joey -- O'Donahue , '' replied our hero , for he was fearful of giving the name of McShane .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 8]: `` And who are your parents ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 19]: `` They are poor people , '' replied Joey , `` and live a long way off . ''
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 9]: `` And why did you leave them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 33]: Joey had already made up his mind to tell his former story ; `` I left there because I was accused of poaching , and they wished me to go away . ''
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 14]: `` Poaching ; yes , I understand that -- killing hares and birds .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 9]: Well , but why did you poach ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 6]: `` Because father did . ''
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 37]: `` Oh , well , I see ; then , if you only did what your father did we must not blame his child ; and so you come down here to go to sea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 9]: `` If I could not do better . ''
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 11]: `` But you shall do better , my good boy .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 31]: I will try you instead of poor Peter , and if you are an honest and good , careful boy , it will be much better than going to sea .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 3]: Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 31]: how like he is , -- but now I _ must _ call you Peter ; it will make me think I have him with me , poor fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 18]: `` If you please , '' said Joey , who was not sorry to exchange his name .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 12]: `` Well , then , where do you sleep to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 19]: `` I did intend to ask for a bed at the house where I left my bundle . ''
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 50]: `` Then , do n't do so ; go for your bundle , and you shall sleep in Peter 's bed -LRB- poor fellow , his last was a watery bed , as the papers say -RRB- , and then to-morrow morning you can go off with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 97]: Joey accepted the offer , went back for his bundle , and returned to Mrs Chopper in a quarter of an hour ; she was then preparing her supper , which Joey was not sorry to partake of ; after which she led him into a small room , in which was a small bed without curtains ; the room itself was hung round with strings of onions , papers of sweet herbs , and flitches of bacon ; the floor was strewed with empty ginger-beer bottles , oakum in bags , and many other articles .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 9]: Altogether , the smell was anything but agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 28]: `` Here is poor Peter 's bed , '' said Mrs Chopper ; `` I changed his sheets the night before he was drowned , poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 11]: Can I trust you to put the candle out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 12]: `` Oh , yes ; I 'll be very careful . ''
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 8]: `` Then , good night , boy .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 7]: Do you ever say your prayers ?
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 6]: poor Peter always did . ''
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 15]: `` Yes , I do , '' replied Joey ; `` good night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 6]: Mrs Chopper left the room .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 46]: Joey threw open the window -- for he was almost suffocated -- undressed himself , put out the light , and , when he had said his prayers , his thoughts naturally reverted to the little Emma who had knelt with him on the road-side .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 8]: IN WHICH OUR HERO GOES ON DUTY .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 37]: At five o'clock the next morning Joey was called up by Mrs Chopper ; the waterman was in attendance , and , with the aid of Joey , carried down the various articles into the boat .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 46]: When all was ready , Mrs Chopper and Joey sat down to their breakfast , which consisted of tea , bread and butter , and red herrings ; and , as soon as it was finished , they embarked , and the boat shoved off .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 23]: `` Well , Mrs Chopper , '' said the waterman , `` so I perceive you 've got a new hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 22]: `` Yes , '' replied Mrs Chopper ; `` do n't you think he 's the moral of poor Peter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 30]: `` Well , I do n't know ; but there is a something about the cut of his jib which reminds me of him , now you mention it .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 7]: Peter was a good boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 14]: `` Aye , that he was , and as sharp as a needle .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 21]: You see , '' said Mrs Chopper , turning to Joey , `` sharp 's the word in a bumboat .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 34]: There 's many who pay , and many who do n't ; some I trust , and some I do n't -- that is , those who wo n't pay me old debts .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 57]: We lose a bit of money at times , but it all comes round in the end ; but I lose more by not booking the things taken than in any other way , for sailors do pay when they have the money -- that is , if ever they come back again , poor fellows .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 5]: Now , Peter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 8]: is his name Peter , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 19]: `` Yes , I must call him Peter , William ; he is so like poor Peter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 15]: `` Well , that will suit me ; I hate learning new names . ''
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 65]: `` Well , but , Peter , '' continued Mrs Chopper , `` you must be very careful ; for , you see , I 'm often called away here and there after wash clothes and such things ; and then you must look out , and if they do take up anything , why , you must book it , at all events .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 23]: You 'll learn by-and-bye who to trust , and who not to trust ; for I know the most of my customers .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 46]: You must not trust a woman -- I mean any of the sailors ' wives -- unless I tell you ; and you must be very sharp with them , for they play all manner of tricks ; you must look two ways at once .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 32]: Now , there 's a girl on board the brig we are pulling to , called Nancy ; why , she used to weather poor Peter , sharp as he was .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 55]: She used to pretend to be very fond of him , and hug him close to her with one arm , so as to blind him , while she stole the tarts with the other ; so , do n't admit her familiarities ; if you do , I shall pay for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 10]: `` Then , who am I to trust ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 5]: `` Bless the child !
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 32]: you 'll soon find out that ; but mind one thing ; never trust a tall , lanky seaman without his name 's on the books ; those chaps never pay .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 57]: There 's the book kept by poor Peter ; and you see names upon the top of each score -- at least , I believe so ; I have no learning myself , but I 've a good memory ; I ca n't read nor write , and that 's why Peter was so useful . ''
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 50]: That Peter could read his own writing it is to be presumed ; but certain it was that Joey could not make it out until after many days examination , when he discovered that certain hieroglyphics were meant to represent certain articles ; after which it became more easy .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 33]: They had now reached the side of the vessel , and the sailors came down into the boat , and took up several articles upon credit ; Joey booked them very regularly .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 8]: `` Has Bill been down yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 8]: said a soft voice from the gangway .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 10]: `` No , Nancy , he has not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 18]: `` Then he wants two red herrings , a sixpenny loaf , and some ` baccy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 27]: Joey looked up , and beheld a very handsome , fair , blue-eyed girl with a most roguish look , who was hanging over the side .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 48]: `` Then he must come himself , Nancy , '' replied Mrs Chopper , `` for , you know , the last time you took up the things he said that you were never told to do so , and he would not pay for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 29]: `` That 's because the fool was jealous ; I lost the tobacco , Mrs Chopper , and he said I had given it to Dick Snapper . ''
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 13]: `` I ca n't help that ; he must come himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 20]: `` But he 's away in the boat , and he told me to get the things for him .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 5]: Who have you there ?
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 19]: Not Peter ; no , it 's not Peter ; but , what a dear little boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 51]: `` I told you so , '' said Mrs Chopper to our hero ; `` now , if I was n't in the boat , she would be down in it in a minute , and persuade you to let her have the things -- and she never pays . ''
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 24]: Joey looked up again , and , as he looked at Nancy , felt that it would be very unkind to refuse her .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 14]: `` Now , what a hard-hearted old woman you are , Mrs Chopper .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 20]: Bill will come on board ; and , as sure as I stand here , he 'll whack me .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 14]: He will pay you , you may take my word for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 7]: `` Your word , Nancy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 8]: replied Mrs Chopper , shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 38]: `` Stop a moment , '' said Nancy , coming down the side with very little regard as to showing her well-formed legs ; `` stop , Mrs Chopper , and I 'll explain to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 19]: `` It 's no use coming down , Nancy , I tell you , '' replied Mrs Chopper .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 46]: `` Well , we shall see , '' replied Nancy , taking her seat in the boat , and looking archly in Mrs Chopper 's face ; `` the fact is Mrs Chopper , you do n't know what a good-tempered woman you are . ''
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 15]: `` I know , Nancy , what you are , '' replied Mrs Chopper .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 20]: `` Oh , so does everybody : I 'm nobody 's enemy but my own , they say . ''
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 13]: that 's very true , child ; more 's the pity . ''
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 33]: `` Now , I did n't come down to wheedle you out of anything , Mrs Chopper , but merely to talk to you , and look at this pretty boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 15]: `` There you go , Nancy ; but ai n't he like Peter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 8]: `` Well , and so he is !
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 26]: very like Peter ; he has Peter 's eyes and his nose , and his mouth is exactly Peter 's -- how very strange ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 10]: `` I never see 'd such a likeness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 4]: exclaimed Mrs Chopper .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 59]: `` No , indeed , '' replied Nancy , who , by agreeing with Mrs Chopper in all she said , and praising Joey , and his likeness to Peter , at last quite came over the old bumboat-woman ; and Nancy quitted her boat with the two herrings , the loaf ; and the paper of tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 11]: `` Shall I put them down , Mrs Chopper ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 3]: said Joey .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 39]: `` Oh , dear , '' replied Mrs Chopper , coming to her recollection , `` I 'm afraid that it 's no use ; but put them down , anyhow ; they will do for bad debts .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 15]: Shove off , William , we must go to the large ship now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 37]: `` I do wish that that Nancy was at any other port , '' exclaimed Mrs Chopper , as they quitted the vessel 's side ; `` I do lose so much money by her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 42]: `` Well , '' said the waterman , laughing , `` you 're not the only one ; she can wheedle man or woman , or , as they say , the devil to boot , if she would try . ''
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 45]: During the whole of the day the wherry proceeded from ship to ship , supplying necessaries ; in many instances they were paid for in ready money , in others Joey 's capabilities were required , and they were booked down against the customers .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 66]: At last , about five o'clock in the evening , the beer-barrel being empty , most of the contents of the baskets nearly exhausted , and the wherry loaded with the linen for the wash , biscuits , empty bottles , and various other articles of traffic or exchange , Mrs Chopper ordered William , the waterman , to pull on shore to the landing-place .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 35]: As soon as the baskets and other articles had been carried up to the house , Mrs Chopper sent out for the dinner , which was regularly obtained from a cook 's - shop .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 46]: Joey sat down with her , and when his meal was finished , Mrs Chopper told him he might take a run and stretch his legs a little if he pleased , while she tended to the linen which was to go to the wash .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 41]: Joey was not sorry to take advantage of this considerate permission , for his legs were quite cramped from sitting so long jammed up between baskets of eggs , red herrings , and the other commodities which had encompassed him .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 14]: We must now introduce Mrs Chopper to the reader a little more ceremoniously .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 42]: She was the widow of a boatswain , who had set her up in the bumboat business with some money he had acquired a short time before his death , and she had continued it ever since on her own account .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 41]: People said that she was rich , but riches are comparative , and if a person in a seaport town , and in her situation , could show 200 or 300 pounds at her bankers , she was considered rich .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 134]: If she was rich in nothing else , she certainly was in bad and doubtful debts , having seven or eight books like that which Joey was filling up for her during the whole day , all containing accounts of long standing , and most of which probably would stand for ever ; but if the bad debts were many , the profits were in proportion ; and what with the long standing debts being occasionally paid , the ready-money she continually received , and the profitable traffic which she made in the way of exchange , etcetera , she appeared to do a thriving business , although it is certain the one-half of her goods were as much given away as were the articles obtained from her in the morning by Nancy .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 224]: It is a question whether these books of bad debts were not a source of enjoyment to her , for every night she would take one of the books down , and although she could not read , yet , by having them continually read to her , and knowing the pages so exactly , she could almost repeat every line by heart which the various bills contained ; and then there was always a story which she had to tell about each -- something relative to the party of whom the transaction reminded her ; and subsequently , when Joey was fairly domiciled with her , she would make him hand down one of the books , and talk away from it for hours ; they were the ledgers of her reminiscences ; the events of a considerable portion of her life were all entered down along with the ` baccy , porter , pipes , and red herrings ; a bill for these articles was to her time , place and circumstance ; and what with a good memory , and bad debts to assist it , many were the hours which were passed away -LRB- and pleasantly enough , too , for one liked to talk , and the other to listen -RRB- between Mrs Chopper and our little hero .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 6]: But we must not anticipate .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 37]: The permission given to Joey to stretch his legs induced him to set off as fast as he could to gain the high road before his little friend , Emma Phillips , had left her school .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 13]: He sat down in the same place , waiting for her coming .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 31]: The spot had become hallowed to the poor fellow , for he had there met with a friend -- with one who sympathised with him when he most required consolation .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 32]: He now felt happy , for he was no longer in doubt about obtaining his livelihood , and his first wish was to impart the pleasing intelligence to his little friend .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 18]: She was not long before she made her appearance in her little straw bonnet with blue ribbons .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 33]: Joey started up , and informed her that he had got a very nice place , explained to her what it was , and how he had been employed during the day .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 39]: `` And I can very often come out about this time , I think , '' added Joey , `` and then I can walk home with you , and see that you come to no harm . ''
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 37]: `` But , '' replied the little girl , `` my mother says that she would like to see you , as she will not allow me to make acquaintance with people I meet by accident .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 10]: Do n't you think that mother is right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 24]: `` Yes , I do ; she 's very right , '' replied Joey ; `` I did n't think of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 11]: `` Will you come and see her , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 11]: `` Not now , because I am not very clean .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 13]: I 'll come on Sunday , if I can get leave . ''
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 11]: They separated , and Joey returned back to the town .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 40]: As he walked on , he thought he would spend the money he had got in a suit of Sunday clothes , of a better quality than those he had on , the materials of which were very coarse .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 34]: On second thoughts , he resolved to apply to Mrs Chopper , as he did not exactly know where to go for them , and was afraid that he would be imposed upon .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 21]: `` Well , Peter , '' said his new mistress , `` do you feel better for your walk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 9]: `` Yes , thank you , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 31]: `` Peter , '' continued Mrs Chopper , `` you appear to be a very handy , good boy , and I hope we shall live together a long while .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 9]: How long have you been at sea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 31]: `` I was going to sea ; I have never been to sea yet , and I do n't want to go ; I would rather stay with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 12]: `` And so you shall , that 's a settled thing .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 9]: What clothes have you got , Peter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 55]: `` I have none but what I stand in , and a few shirts in a bundle , and they are Sunday ones ; but when I left home I had some money given me , and I wish to buy a suit of clothes for Sunday , to go to church in . ''
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 21]: `` That 's a good boy , and so you shall ; but how much money have you got ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 25]: `` Quite enough to buy a suit of clothes , '' replied Joey , handing out two sovereigns , and seventeen shillings in silver .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 32]: `` Oh , I suppose they gave you all that to fit you out with when you left home ; poor people , I dare say they worked hard for it .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 36]: Well , I do n't think the money will be of any use to you ; so you had better buy a Sunday suit , and I will take care you want for nothing afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 9]: Do n't you think I 'm right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 9]: `` Yes , I wish to do so .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 14]: To-day is Tuesday ; I may have them made by next Sunday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 31]: `` So you can ; and as soon as William comes in , which he will soon , from the washerwoman 's , we will go out and order them .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 17]: Here he comes up the stairs -- no , that foot 's too light for his .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 9]: Well , it 's Nancy , I declare !
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 24]: Why , Nancy , now , '' continued Mrs Chopper , in a deprecating tone , `` what do you want here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 25]: `` Well , I leave you to guess , '' replied Nancy , looking very demurely , and taking a seat upon a hamper .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 33]: `` Guess , I fear there 's no guess in it , Nancy ; but I will not -- now it 's no use -- I will not trust another shilling . ''
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 10]: `` But I know you will , Mrs Chopper .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 23]: Lord love you , you 're such a good-natured creature , you ca n't refuse any one , and certainly not me .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 15]: Why do n't you take me in your boat with you as your assistant ?
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 11]: then there would be something in it worth looking at .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 9]: I should bring you plenty of custom . ''
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 13]: `` You 're too wild , Nancy ; too wild , girl .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 9]: But , now , what do you want ?
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 10]: recollect you 've already had some things to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 18]: `` I know I have , and you are a good-natured old trump , that you are .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 15]: Now I 'll tell you -- gold must pass between us this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 12]: `` Mercy on me , Nancy , why you 're mad .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 11]: I 've no gold -- nothing but bad debts . ''
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 16]: `` Look you , Mrs Chopper , look at this shabby old bonnet of mine .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 9]: Do n't I want a new one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 23]: `` Then you must get somebody else to give you money , Nancy , '' replied Mrs Chopper , coolly and decidedly .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 21]: `` Do n't talk so fast , Mrs Chopper : now , I 'll let you know how it is .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 33]: When Bill came on board he asked the captain for an advance ; the captain refused him before , but this time he was in a good humour , and he consented .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 65]: So then I coaxed Bill out of a sovereign to buy a new bonnet , and he gave it me ; and then I thought what a kind soul you were , and I resolved that I would bring you the sovereign , and go without the new bonnet ; so here it is , take it quick , or I shall repent . ''
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 26]: `` Well , Nancy , '' said Mrs Chopper , `` you said right ; gold has passed between us , and I am surprised .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 8]: Now I shall trust you again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 24]: `` And so you ought ; it 's not every pretty girl , like me , who will give up a new bonnet .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 23]: Only look what a rubbishy affair this is , '' continued Nancy , giving her own a kick up in the air .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 32]: `` I wish I had a sovereign to give away , '' said Joey to Mrs Chopper ; `` I wish I had not said a word about the clothes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 18]: `` Do as you like with your own money , my dear , '' said the bumboat-woman .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 35]: `` Then , Nancy , I 'll give you a sovereign to buy yourself a new bonnet with , '' said Joey , taking one out of his pocket and putting into her hand .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 11]: Nancy looked at the sovereign , and then at Joey .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 6]: `` Bless the boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 30]: said she , at last , kissing him on the forehead ; `` he has a kind heart ; may the world use him better than it has me !
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 19]: Here , take your sovereign , child ; any bonnet 's good enough for one like me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 12]: So saying , Nancy turned hastily away , and ran downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 8]: IN WHICH MRS. CHOPPER READS HER LEDGER .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 19]: `` Ah , poor girl , '' said Mrs Chopper , with a sigh , as Nancy disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 46]: `` You are a good boy , Peter ; I like to see boys not too fond of money , and if she had taken it -LRB- and I wish she had , poor thing -RRB- I would have made it up to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 11]: `` Is the man she calls Bill her husband ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 3]: inquired Joey .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 19]: `` Oh , I know nothing about other people 's husbands , '' replied Mrs Chopper , hastily .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 32]: `` Now then , let us go and order the clothes , and then you 'll be able to go to church on Sunday ; I will do without you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 11]: `` What , wo n't you go to church ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 6]: `` Bless you , child !
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 13]: who is to give the poor men their breakfast and their beer ?
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 23]: A bumboat-woman ca n't go to church any more than a baker 's man , for people must eat on a Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 49]: Church , like everything else in this world , appears to me only to be made for the rich ; I always take my Bible in the boat with me on Sunday , but then I ca n't read it , so it 's of no great use .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 47]: No , dear , I ca n't go to church , but I can contrive , if it do n't rain in the evening , to go to meeting and hear a little of the Word ; but you can go to church , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 52]: A suit of blue cloth , made in sailor 's fashion , having been ordered by Mrs Chopper , she and Joey returned home ; and , after their tea , Mrs Chopper desired Joey to hand her one of the account-books , which she put upon her knees and opened .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 57]: `` There , '' said she , looking at the page , `` I know that account well ; it was Tom Alsop 's -- a fine fellow he was , only he made such a bad marriage : his wife was a very fiend , and the poor fellow loved her , which was worse .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 57]: One day he missed her , and found she was on board another vessel ; and he came on shore , distracted like , and got very tipsy , as sailors always do when they 're in trouble , and he went down to the wharf , and his body was picked up next day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 7]: `` Did he drown himself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 27]: `` Yes , so people think , Peter ; and he owed me 1 pound , 3 shillings , 4 pence , if I recollect right .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 9]: Are n't that the figure , Peter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 22]: `` Yes , ma'am , '' replied Joey ; `` that 's the sum total of the account , exactly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 5]: `` Poor fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 22]: continued Mrs Chopper , with a sigh , `` he went to his long account without paying me my short one .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 17]: Never mind ; I wish he was alive , and twice as much in my debt .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 96]: There 's another -- I recollect that well , Peter , for it 's a proof that sailors are honest ; and I do believe that , if they do n't pay , it 's more from thoughtlessness than anything else ; and then the women coax all their money from them , for sailors do n't care for money when they do get it -- and then those Jews are such shocking fellows ; but look you , Peter , this is almost the first bill run up after I took up the business .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 76]: He was a nice fair-haired lad from Shields ; and the boy was cast away , and he was picked up by another vessel , and brought here ; and I let him have things and lent him money to the amount of a matter of 20 pounds , and he said he would save all and pay me , and he sailed away again , and I never heard of him for nine years .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 66]: I thought that he was drowned , or that he was not an honest lad ; I did n't know which , and it was a deal of money to lose ; but I gave it up ; when one day a tall , stout fellow , with great red whiskers , called upon me , and said , ` Do you know me ? '
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 16]: ` No , ' said I , half-frightened ; ` how should I know you ?
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 8]: I never see 'd you before . '
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 49]: -- ` Yes , you did , ' says he , ` and here 's a proof of it ; ' and he put down on the table a lot of money , and said , ` Now , missus , help yourself : better late than never .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 36]: I 'm Jim Sparling , who was cast away , and who you were as good as a mother to ; but I 've never been able to get leave to come to you since .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 27]: I 'm boatswain 's mate of a man-of-war , and have just received my pay , and now I 've come to pay my debts . '
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 22]: He would make me take 5 pounds more than his bill , to buy a new silk gown for his sake .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 3]: Poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 5]: he 's dead now .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 44]: Here 's another , that was run up by one of your tall , lanky sailors , who wear their knives in a sheath , and not with a lanyard round their waists ; those fellows never pay , but they swear dreadfully .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 10]: Let me see , what can this one be ?
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 11]: Read it , Peter ; how much is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 15]: `` 4 pounds , 2 shillings , 4 pence , '' replied our hero .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 15]: `` Yes , yes , I recollect now -- it was the Dutch skipper .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 45]: There 's murder in that bill , Peter : it was things I supplied to him just before he sailed ; and an old man was passenger in the cabin : he was a very rich man , although he pretended to be poor .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 62]: He was a diamond merchant , they say ; and as soon as they were at sea , the Dutch captain murdered him in the night , and threw him overboard out of the cabin-window ; but one of the sailors saw the deed done , and the captain was taken up at Amsterdam , and had his head cut off .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 14]: The crew told us when the galliot came back with a new captain .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 22]: So the Dutch skipper paid the forfeit of his crime ; he paid my bill , too , that 's certain .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 6]: Oh , deary me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 10]: continued the old lady , turning to another page .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 10]: `` I sha n't forget this in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 10]: I never see poor Nancy now without recollecting it .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 41]: Look , Peter ; I know the sum -- 8 pounds , 4 shillings 6 pence -- exactly : it was the things taken up when Tom Freelove married Nancy , -- it was the wedding dinner and supper . ''
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 11]: `` What , Nancy who was here just now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 42]: `` Yes , that Nancy ; and a sweet , modest young creature she was then , and had been well brought up too ; she could read and write beautifully , and subscribed to a circulating library , they say .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 11]: She was the daughter of a baker in this town .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 37]: I recollect it well : such a fine day it was when they went to church , she looking so handsome in her new ribbons and smart dress , and he such a fine-looking young man .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 25]: I never seed such a handsome young couple ; but he was a bad one , and so it all ended in misery . ''
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 9]: `` Tell me how , '' said Joey .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 26]: `` I 'll tell all you ought to know , boy ; you are too young to be told all the wickedness of this world .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 80]: Her husband treated her very ill ; before he had been married a month he left her , and went about with other people , and was always drunk , and she became jealous and distracted , and he beat her cruelly , and deserted her ; and then , to comfort her , people would persuade her to keep her spirits up , and gave her something to drink , and by degrees she became fond of it .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 28]: Her husband was killed by a fall from the mast-head ; and she loved him still and took more to liquor , and that was her ruin .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 42]: She do n't drink now , because she do n't feel as she used to do ; she cares about nothing ; she is much to be pitied , poor thing , for she is still young , and very pretty .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 26]: It 's only four years ago when I saw her come out of church , and thought what a happy couple they would be . ''
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 9]: `` Where are her father and mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 4]: `` Both dead .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 10]: Do n't let 's talk about it any more .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 45]: It 's bad enough when a man drinks ; but if a woman takes to it , it is all over with her ; but some people 's feelings are so strong , that they fly to it directly to drown care and misery .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 24]: Put up the book , Peter ; I ca n't look at it any more to-night ; we 'll go to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 35]: Joey every day gave more satisfaction to his employer , and upon his own responsibility , allowed his friend the sailor lad to open an account as soon as his money was all gone .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 54]: Finding that the vessel was going up the river to load , Joey determined to write a few lines to the McShanes , to allay the uneasiness which he knew his absence must have occasioned , Jim Paterson promising to put the letter in the post as soon as he arrived at London .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 36]: Our hero simply said , `` My dear sir , I am quite well , and have found employment , so pray do not grieve about me , as I never shall forget your kindness .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 5]: -- Joey McShane . ''
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 20]: On the following Sunday Joey was dressed in his sailor 's suit , and looked very well in it .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 16]: He was not only a very good-looking , but a gentlemanlike boy in his manners .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 22]: He went to church , and after church he walked out to the abode of his little friend , Emma Phillips .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 27]: She ran out to meet him , was delighted with his new clothes , and took him by the hand to present him to her mother .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 20]: Mrs Phillips was a quiet-looking , pleasing woman , and the old lady was of a very venerable appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 47]: They made many inquiries about his friends , and Joey continued in the same story , that he and his father had been poachers , that he had been discovered and obliged to go away , and that he went with the consent of his parents .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 80]: They were satisfied with his replies , and prepossessed in his favour ; and as Joey was so patronised by her little daughter , he was desired to renew his visits , which he occasionally did on Sundays , but preferred meeting Emma on the road from school ; and the two children -LRB- if Joey could be called a child -RRB- became very intimate , and felt annoyed if they did not every day exchange a few words .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 12]: Thus passed the first six months of Joey 's new life .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 46]: The winter was cold , and the water rough , and he blew his fingers , while Mrs Chopper folded her arms up in her apron ; but he had always a good dinner and a warm bed after the day 's work was over .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 62]: He became a great favourite with Mrs Chopper , who at last admitted that he was much more useful than even Peter ; and William , the waterman , declared that such was really the case , and that he was , in his opinion , worth two of the former Peter , who had come to such an untimely end .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 7]: IN WHICH THE BITER IS BIT .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 75]: The disappearance of Joey from the school was immediately communicated to McShane by the master , who could not imagine how such an incident could have occurred in such a decent establishment as his preparatory seminary ; it was an epoch in his existence , and ever afterwards his chronology was founded upon it , and everything that occurred was so many months or weeks before or after the absconding of young Master McShane .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 30]: The letter had , of course , been produced , and as soon as the schoolmaster had taken his departure , McShane and his wife were in deep council .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 44]: `` I recollect , '' said Mrs McShane , who was crying in an easy chair -- `` I recollect , now , that one day the boy came up and asked me the meaning of wilful murder , and I told him .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 49]: And now I think of it , I do also remember the people at Number 1 table , close to the counter , some time ago , talking about a murder having been committed by a mere child , and a long report of it in the newspapers .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 21]: I am sure , however -LRB- as Joey says in his letter -RRB- , that he is not guilty . ''
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 10]: `` And so am I , '' replied McShane .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 19]: `` However , bring up the file of newspapers , dear , and let me look over them .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 10]: How long back do you think it was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 33]: `` Why , let me see ; it was about the time you went away with Captain O'Donahue , I think , or a little before -- that was in October . ''
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 26]: McShane turned over the file of newspapers , and after a quarter of an hour 's search found the report of the coroner 's inquest .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 15]: `` Here it is , my dear , sure enough , '' said McShane .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 36]: As soon as he had read it over , and came to the end , he said , `` Yes ; wilful murder against Joseph Rushbrook the younger , and 200 pounds for his apprehension .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 29]: This it was that drove the boy away from home , and not poaching , although I have no doubt that poaching was the cause of the murder .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 54]: Now , my dear , '' continued McShane , `` I think I can unravel all this ; the murder has been committed , that 's evident , by somebody , but not by Joey , I 'll be sworn ; he says that he is not guilty , and I believe him .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 14]: Nevertheless , Joey runs away , and a verdict is found against him .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 67]: My dear wife , I happen to know the father of Joey well ; he was a fine , bold soldier , but one who would stick at nothing ; and if I could venture an opinion , it is , that the murder was committed by Rushbrook , and not by the boy , and that the boy has absconded to save his father . ''
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 10]: The reader will acknowledge that McShane was very clear-sighted .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 10]: `` That 's my opinion , '' continued McShane .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 44]: `` How it has been managed to make the boy appear as the party , I can not tell ; but knowing the father , and knowing the son , I 'd stake my commission that I 've guessed at the truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 5]: `` Poor boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 23]: exclaimed Mrs McShane ; `` well , the Commandments say that the sins of the father shall be visited upon the children .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 8]: What can be done , McShane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 83]: `` Nothing at present ; it would injure Joey to raise a hue and cry after him ; for , you see , if he is apprehended , he must either be tried for his life , and convicted himself , or prove that he did not do it , which probably he could not do without convicting his father ; I will , however , make some inquiries about Rushbrook himself , and if I can I will see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 124]: The same evening the schoolmaster again called upon McShane , to say that two persons had come to the school in the afternoon and asked to see him ; that one of them , shabbily dressed , but evidently a person who was not of so low a class in life as the other , had accosted him , when he came into the parlour , with , `` I believe I have the pleasure of speaking to Mr Slappum ; if so , may I request the favour to see my little friend Joey , whom I met yesterday walking out with the other young gentlemen under your care , as I have a message to him from his father and mother ?
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 27]: The dear boy was once under my tuition , and did me much credit , as I have no doubt that he has done you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 59]: Now , the usher had told Mr Slappum that Joey had been addressed by this person the day before , and the schoolmaster presuming , of course , that it was Joey McShane , replied , -- `` I am sorry to say that he left this house last night , and has absconded we know not where .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 25]: He left a letter for Major McShane , which I have this day delivered to him , acquainting him with the unpleasant circumstance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 10]: `` Bolted , by all that 's clever ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 16]: said the second personage to the first , who looked very much surprised and confounded .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 72]: `` You really have astonished me , my dear sir , '' replied the first person , whom the reader will of course recognise to be Furness ; `` that a lad brought up by me in such strict moral principles , such correct notions of right and wrong , and , I may add , such pious feelings , should have taken such a step , is to me incomprehensible .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 13]: Major McShane , I think you said , lives at -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 15]: `` Major McShane lives at Number -- in Holborn , '' replied the schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 12]: `` And the lad has not gone home to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 35]: `` No , he has not ; he left a letter , which I took to Major McShane ; but I did not break the seal , and am ignorant of its contents . ''
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 22]: `` I really am stupefied with grief and vexation , '' replied Furness , `` and will not intrude any longer .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 5]: Bless the poor boy !
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 8]: what can have come of him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 32]: So saying , Furness took his departure with the peace-officer , whom he had intrusted with the warrant , which he had taken out to secure the person of our hero .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 58]: McShane heard the schoolmaster 's account of this visit without interruption , and then said , `` I have no doubt but that this person who has called upon you will pay me a visit ; oblige me , therefore , by describing his person particularly , so that I may know him at first sight . ''
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 16]: The schoolmaster gave a most accurate description of Furness , and then took his leave .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 83]: As the eating-house kept by Mrs McShane had a private door , Furness -LRB- who , as McShane had prophesied , came the next afternoon -RRB- , after having read the name on the private door , which was not on the eating-house , which went by the name of the Chequers , imagined that it was an establishment apart , and thought it advisable to enter into it , and ascertain a little about Major McShane before he called upon him .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 50]: Although McShane seldom made his appearance in the room appropriated for the dinners , it so happened that he was standing at the door when Furness entered and sat down in a box , calling for the bill of fare , and ordering a plate of beef and cabbage .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 56]: McShane recognised him by the description given of him immediately , and resolved to make his acquaintance incognito , and ascertain what his intentions were ; he therefore took his seat in the same box , and winking to one of the girls who attended , also called for a plate of beef and cabbage .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 23]: Furness , who was anxious to pump any one he might fall in with , immediately entered into conversation with the major .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 14]: `` A good house this , sir , and well attended apparently ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 19]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied McShane ; `` it is considered a very good house . ''
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 9]: `` Do you frequent it much yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 37]: `` Always , sir ; I feel much interested in its success , '' replied McShane ; `` for I know the lady who keeps it well , and have a high respect for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 15]: `` I saw her as I passed by -- a fine woman , sir !
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 19]: Pray may I ask who is Major McShane , who I observe lives in the rooms above ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 16]: `` He is a major in the army , sir -- now on half-pay . ''
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 7]: `` Do you know him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 17]: `` Remarkably well , '' replied McShane ; `` he 's a countryman of mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 10]: `` He 's married , sir , I think ?
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 9]: I 'll trouble you for the pepper . ''
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 14]: `` He is married , sir , to a very amiable woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 7]: `` Any family , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 29]: `` Not that I know of ; they have a young _ protege _ , I believe , now at school -- a boy they call Joey . ''
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 3]: `` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 30]: how very kind of them ; really , now , it 's quite refreshing for me to see so much goodness of heart still remaining in this bad world .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 7]: Adopted him , I presume ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 21]: `` I really can not exactly say that ; I know that they treat him as their own child . ''
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 11]: `` Have you seen Major McShane lately , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 15]: `` Saw him this morning , sir , just after he got up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 3]: `` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 17]: This is remarkably good ale , sir -- will you honour me by tasting it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 18]: `` Sir , you are very kind ; but the fact is I never drink malt liquor .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 11]: Here , girl , bring a half pint of brandy .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 28]: I trust , sir , you will not refuse to join me in a glass , although I can not venture to accept your polite offer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 35]: Furness drank off his pot of ale , and made ready for the brandy which had been offered him ; McShane filled his own glass , and then handed the decanter over to Furness .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 17]: `` I have the pleasure of drinking your good health , sir , '' said McShane .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 18]: `` You are from the country , I presume ; may I inquire from what part ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 59]: `` I am from Devonshire ; I was formerly head of the grammar school at -- ; but , sir , my principles would not allow me to retain my situation ; rectitude of conduct , sir , is absolutely necessary to the profession which inculcates morality and virtue , as well as instruction to youth , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 10]: Here 's to our better acquaintance , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 12]: `` Sir , to your 's ; I honour your sentiments .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 4]: By the powers !
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 23]: but you 're right , Mr -- , I beg your pardon -- but I do n't catch your name exactly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 9]: `` Furness , sir , at your service .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 61]: Yes , sir , the directors of the foundation which I presided over , I may say , with such credit to myself , and such advantage to the pupils under my care , wished to make a job -- yes , sir -- of a charity ; I could not consent to such deeds , and I resigned . ''
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 11]: `` And you have been in London ever since ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 59]: `` No , sir ; I repaired to the small village of Grassford , where I set up a school , but circumstances compelled me to resign , and I am now about to seek for employment in another hemisphere ; in short , I have an idea of going out to New South Wales as a preceptor .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 14]: I understand they are in great want of tuition in that quarter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 26]: `` I should think so , '' replied McShane ; `` and they have a great deal to unlearn as well as to learn . ''
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 36]: `` I speak of the junior branches -- the scions or offsets , I may say -- born in the colony , and who I trust , will prove that crime is not hereditary . ''
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 37]: `` Well , I wish you luck , sir , '' replied McShane ; `` you must oblige me by taking another glass , for I never shall be able to finish this decanter myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 15]: `` I gladly avail myself of the pleasure of your company , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 49]: As the reader is well aware that Furness was an intemperate man , it is not surprising that he accepted the offer ; and before the second glass was finished , the ale and brandy had begun to have the effect , and he had become very communicative .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 20]: `` What was the name of the village which you stated you had resided in lately , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 3]: inquired McShane .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 7]: `` The village of Grassford . ''
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 22]: `` There is something I recollect about that village ; let me see -- something that I read in the newspapers .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 13]: I remember now -- it was the murder of a pedlar . ''
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 36]: `` Very true , sir , such a circumstance did take place ; it was a dreadful affair -- and , what is more strange , committed by a mere child , who absconded . ''
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 3]: `` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 6]: What was his name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 28]: `` Rushbrook , sir ; his father was a well-known poacher -- a man who had been in the army , and had a pension for wounds .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 33]: There is an old saying , sir , of high authority -- ` Bring up a child in the way he should go , and he will not depart from it . '
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 10]: I instructed that boy , sir ; but alas !
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 18]: what avails the instruction of a preceptor when a father leads a child into evil ways ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 14]: `` That 's the truth , and no mistake , '' replied McShane .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 7]: `` So the boy ran away ?
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 6]: Yes ; I recollect now .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 8]: And what became of the father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 21]: `` The father , sir , and mother have since left the village , and gone nobody knows where . ''
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 3]: `` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 7]: are you sure of that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 25]: `` Quite sure , sir ; for I was most anxious to discover them , and took great pains , but without success . ''
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 8]: `` What did the people say thereabouts ?
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 11]: Was there no suspicion of the father being implicated ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 8]: `` I do not think there was .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 31]: He gave evidence at the inquest , and so did I , sir , as you may suppose , most unwillingly ; for the boy was a favourite of mine .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 43]: I beg your pardon , sir -- you say you are acquainted with Major McShane , and saw him this morning ; is the interesting little boy you speak of as under his protection now at home or still at school ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 19]: `` I really can not positively say , '' replied McShane ; `` but this is not holiday-time .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 16]: Come , sir , we must not part yet ; your conversation is too interesting .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 24]: You must allow me to call for some more brandy ; poor as I am , I must treat myself and you too .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 28]: I wish I knew where I could pick up a little money ; for , to tell you the truth , cash begins to run low . ''
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 8]: Furness was now more than half drunk .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 51]: `` Well , sir , '' said he ; `` I have known money picked up without any difficulty : for instance , now , suppose we should fall in with this young rascal who committed the murder ; there is 200 pounds offered for his apprehension and conviction . ''
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 15]: `` I thought as much , '' muttered McShane ; `` the infernal scoundrel !
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 26]: I suspect that you will find him where you are going to , Mr Furbish , he 's got that far by this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 12]: `` Between you and I , I think not , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 16]: My name is Furness , sir -- I beg your pardon -- not Furbish . ''
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 24]: `` Why you do not think he would be such a fool as to remain in the country after such an act ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 29]: `` The wicked are foolish , sir , as well as others , '' replied Furness , putting his finger to his nose , and looking very knowingly .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 7]: `` That 's truth , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 7]: Help yourself ; you drink nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 12]: Excuse me one minute ; I 'll be back directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 30]: McShane left the box for a few minutes to explain to his wife what he was about , and to give time for the liquor to operate upon Furness .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 28]: As he expected , he found , on his return , that Furness had finished his glass , and was more tipsy than when he left him .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 63]: The conversation was renewed , and McShane again pleading his poverty , and his wish to obtain money , brought out the proposal of Furness , who informed him that he had recognised the _ protege _ of Major McShane to be the identical Joseph Rushbrook ; that the boy had absconded from the school , and was concealed in the house .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 54]: He concluded by observing to McShane , that , as he was so intimate with the major , it would be very easy for him to ascertain the fact , and offered him 50 pounds , as his share of the reward , if he would assist him in the boy 's capture .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 24]: It was lucky for Furness that McShane was surrounded by others , or in all probability there would have been another murder committed .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 33]: The major , however , said he would think of it , and fell back in deep thought ; what he was thinking of was what he should do to punish Furness .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 38]: At last an idea came into his head ; the rascal was drunk , and he proposed that he should go to another house , where they might find the major , and he would present him .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 60]: Furness consented , and reeled out of the box ; McShane , although he would as soon have touched a viper , controlled himself sufficiently to give Furness his arm , and leading him down by two or three back courts , he took him into an ale-house where there was a rendezvous for enlisting marines for the navy .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 42]: As soon as they were seated , and had liquor before them , McShane spoke to the sergeant , tipped him a guinea , and said he had a good recruit for him , if he could be persuaded to enlist .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 21]: He then introduced the sergeant as the major , and advised Furness to pretend to agree with him in everything .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 31]: The sergeant told long stories , clapped Furness , who was now quite intoxicated , on the back , called him a jolly fellow , and asked him to enlist .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 17]: `` Say ` yes , ' to please him , '' said McShane in his ear .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 34]: Furness did so , received the shilling , and when he came to his senses next day , found his friend had disappeared , and that he was under an escort for Portsmouth .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 51]: All remonstrances were unavailing ; McShane had feed -LSB- paid a fee to -RSB- the sergeant , and had promised him a higher fee not to let Furness off ; and the latter , having but a few shillings in his pocket , was compelled to submit to his fate .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY SIX .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 12]: IN WHICH OUR HERO AGAIN FALLS IN WITH AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 18]: For nearly two years Joey had filled his situation as chancellor of the exchequer to Mrs Chopper .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 56]: He certainly did not feel himself always in the humour or the disposition for business , especially during the hard winter months , when , seated almost immovably in the boat during the best portion of the day , he would find his fingers so completely dead , that he could not hold his pen .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 20]: But there is no situation , under any of the powers that be , that has not some drawback .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 29]: People may say that a sinecure is one that has not its disadvantages ; but such is not the case -- there is the disgrace of holding it .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 26]: At all events , Joey 's place was no sinecure , for he was up early , and was employed the whole of the day .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 91]: Nancy , the young woman we have introduced to our readers , had contracted a great regard for our hero , ever since his offering her his money ; and Joey was equally partial to her , for she possessed a warm heart and much good feeling , she would very often run upstairs into Mrs Chopper 's room , to talk with the old lady and to see Joey , and would then take out her thimble and needle , examine his clothes , and make the necessary repairs .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 26]: `` I saw you walking with little Emma Phillips , Peter , '' said Nancy : `` where did you come to know her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 17]: `` I met her in the road the day that I came down to Gravesend . ''
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 7]: `` Well , I 'm sure !
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 14]: and do you speak to every young lady you chance to meet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 17]: `` No ; but I was unhappy , and she was very kind to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 25]: `` She 's a very sweet child , or rather , I can only say that she was , when I knew her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 8]: `` When did you know her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 7]: `` Four or five years ago .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 20]: I lived for a short time with Mrs Phillips ; that was when I was a good girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 16]: `` Yes , indeed , Nancy , '' said Mrs Chopper , shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 12]: `` Why ai n't you good , now , Nancy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 3]: replied Joey .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 7]: `` Because -- '' said Nancy .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 5]: `` Because why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 32]: `` Because I am not good , '' replied the girl ; `` and now , Peter , do n't ask any more questions , or you 'll make me cry .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 2]: Heigho !
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 21]: I think crying very pleasant now and then ; one 's heart feels fresher , like flowers after the rain .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 10]: Peter , where are your father and mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 13]: `` I do n't know ; I left them at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 7]: `` You left them at home !
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 8]: but do you never hear from them ?
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 6]: do you never write ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 5]: `` But why not ?
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 10]: I am sure they have brought you up well .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 12]: They must be very good people -- are they not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 21]: Joey could not answer ; how could he say that his father was a good man after what had passed ?
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 20]: `` You do n't answer me , Peter ; do n't you love your father and mother dearly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 16]: `` Yes , indeed I do ; but I must not write to them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 41]: `` Well , I must say there is something about Peter and his parents which I can not understand , and which I have often tried to make him tell , and he will not , '' said Mrs Chopper .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 14]: `` Poaching ai n't such a great crime , especially in a boy .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 32]: I ca n't see why he should not write to his father and mother , at all events , I hope , Peter , you have told me the truth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 57]: `` I have told you what is true ; but my father was a poacher , and they know it ; and if they did not punish me , they would him , and transport him , too , if I gave evidence against him , which I must do , if put to my oath .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 20]: I 've told you all I can tell ; I must not tell of father , must I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 19]: `` No , no , child ; I dare say you are right , '' replied Mrs Chopper .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 66]: `` Now , I do n't ask you to tell me , Peter , '' said Nancy , `` for I can guess what has taken place ; you and your father have been out poaching , there has been a scuffle with the keepers , and there has been blood shed ; and that 's the reason why you keep out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 6]: Ai n't I right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 24]: `` You are not far wrong , '' replied Joey ; `` but I will not say a word more upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 41]: `` And I wo n't ask you , my little Peter ; there -- that 's done -- and now I shall have a peep out of the window , for it 's very close here , Mrs Chopper . ''
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 15]: Nancy threw the window open and leaned out of it , watching the passers-by .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 5]: `` Mercy on us !
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 17]: here 's three soldiers coming up the street with a deserter handcuffed , '' cried she .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 6]: `` Who can it be ?
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 5]: he 's a sailor .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 22]: Why , I do believe it 's Sam Oxenham , that belongs to the _ Thomas and Mary _ of Sunderland .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 3]: Poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 7]: Yes , it is him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 16]: Joey went to the window , and took his stand by the side of Nancy .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 7]: `` What soldiers are those ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 3]: inquired he .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 25]: `` They 're not soldiers , after all , '' replied Nancy ; `` they are jollies -- a sergeant and two privates . ''
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 3]: `` Jollies !
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 5]: what are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 10]: `` Why , marines , to be sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 32]: Joey continued looking at them until they passed under the window , when Nancy , who had a great disgust at anything like arbitrary power , could not refrain from speaking .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 19]: `` I say , master sergeant , you 're a nice brave fellow , with your two jollies .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 22]: D'ye think the young man will kill you all three , that you must put the darbies on so tight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 26]: At this appeal , the sergeant and privates looked up at the window , and laughed when they saw such a pretty girl as Nancy .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 30]: The eyes of one of the privates were , however , soon fixed on our hero 's face , and deeply scrutinising it , when Joey looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 27]: As soon as Joey recognised him , he drew back from the window , pale as death , the private still remaining staring at the window .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 11]: `` Why , what 's the matter , Peter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 11]: said Nancy ; `` what makes you look so pale ?
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 7]: do you know that man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 22]: `` Yes , '' replied Joey , drawing his breath , `` and he knows me , I 'm afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 7]: `` Why do you fear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 3]: replied Nancy .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 11]: `` See if he 's gone , '' said Joey .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 37]: `` Yes , he has ; he has gone up the street with the sergeant ; but every now and then he looks back at this window ; but perhaps that 's to see me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 14]: `` Why , Peter , what harm can that marine do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 4]: inquired Mrs Chopper .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 28]: `` A great deal ; he will never be quiet until he has me taken up , and then what will become of my poor father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 11]: continued Joey , with the tears running down his cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 8]: `` Give me my bonnet , Peter .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 18]: I 'll soon find out what he is after , '' said Nancy , leaving the window .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 12]: She threw her bonnet on her head , and ran downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 57]: Mrs Chopper in vain endeavoured to console our hero , or make him explain -- he did nothing but sit mournfully by her side , thinking what he had best do , and expecting every minute to hear the tramp of Furness -LRB- for it was he who had recognised Joey -RRB- coming up the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 35]: `` Mrs Chopper , '' at last said Joey , `` I must leave you , I 'm afraid ; I was obliged to leave my former friends on this man 's account . ''
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 6]: `` Leave me , boy !
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 19]: no , no , you must not leave me -- how could I get on without you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 35]: `` If I do n't leave you myself , I shall be taken up , that is certain ; but indeed I have not done wrong -- do n't think that I have . ''
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 31]: `` I 'm sure of it , child ; you 've only to say so , and I 'll believe you ; but why should he care about you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 26]: `` He lived in our village , and knows all about it ; he gave evidence at -- '' `` At what , boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 25]: `` At the time that I ran away from home ; he proved that I had the gun and bag which were found . ''
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 12]: `` Well , and suppose you had ; what then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 19]: `` Mrs Chopper , there was a reward offered , and he wants to get the money . ''
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 36]: `` Oh , I see now -- a reward offered ; then it must be as Nancy said , there was blood shed , '' and Mrs Chopper put her apron up to her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 5]: Joey made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 27]: After a few minutes ' silence he rose , and went to his room where he slept , and put his clothes up in a bundle .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 24]: Having so done , he sat down on the side of his bed and reflected what was the course he ought to pursue .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 28]: Our hero was now sixteen , and much increased in stature ; he was no longer a child , although , in heart , almost as innocent .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 125]: His thoughts wandered -- he yearned to see his father and mother , and reflected whether he might not venture back to the village , and meet them by stealth ; he thought of the McShanes , and imagined that he might in the same way return to them ; then little Emma Phillips rose in his imagination , and his fear that he should never see her again ; Captain O'Donahue was at last brought to his recollection , and he longed to be once more with him in Russia ; and , lastly , he reviewed the happy and contented life he had lately led with his good friend Mrs Chopper , and how sorry he should be to part with her .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 33]: After a time he threw himself on his bed and hid his face in the pillow ; and , overcome with the excess of his feelings , he at last fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 68]: In the mean time Nancy had followed the marines up the street , and saw them enter , with their prisoner , into a small public-house , where she was well known ; she followed them , spoke a few kind words to the seaman who had been apprehended , and with whom she was acquainted , and then sat down by Furness to attract his attention .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 22]: Furness had certainly much improved in his appearance since he had -LRB- much against his will -RRB- been serving his Majesty .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 47]: Being a tall man , he had , by drilling , become perfectly erect , and the punishment awarded to drunkenness , as well as the difficulty of procuring liquor , had kept him from his former intemperance , and his health had in consequence improved .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 42]: He had been more than once brought up to the gangway upon his first embarkation , but latterly had conducted himself properly , and was in expectation of being made a corporal , for which situation his education certainly qualified him .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 20]: On the whole , he was now a fine-looking marine , although just as unprincipled a scoundrel as ever .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 21]: `` Well , my pretty lass , did n't I see you looking out of a window just now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 47]: `` To be sure you did , and you might have heard me too , '' replied Nancy ; `` and when I saw such a handsome fellow as you , did n't I put on my bonnet in a hurry , and come after you ?
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 8]: What ship do you belong to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 11]: `` The _ Mars _ , at the Nore . ''
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 14]: `` Well , I should like to go on board of a man-of-war .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 6]: Will you take me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 16]: `` To be sure I will ; come , have a drink of beer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 19]: `` Here 's to the jollies , '' said Nancy , putting the pewter pot to her lips .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 10]: `` When do you go on board again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 20]: `` Not till to-morrow ; we 've caught our bird , and now we 'll amuse ourselves a little .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 8]: Do you belong to this place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 28]: `` Yes , bred and born here ; but we hardly ever see a man-of-war ; they stay at the Nore , or go higher up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 25]: Nancy did all she could to make Furness believe she had taken a fancy to him , and knew too well how to succeed .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 27]: Before an hour had passed , Furness had , as he thought , made every arrangement with her , and congratulated himself on his good fortune .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 26]: In the mean time the beer and brandy went round ; even the unfortunate captive was persuaded to drink with them , and drown reflection .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 23]: At last , Furness said to Nancy , `` Who was that lad that was looking out of the window with you ?
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 6]: Was it your brother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 4]: `` My brother !
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 5]: bless you , no .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 18]: You mean that scamp , Peter , who goes in the bumboat with old Mother Chopper . ''
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 4]: `` Does he ?
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 17]: -- well , I have either seen him before , or some one like him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 36]: `` He 's not of our town , '' replied Nancy ; `` he came here about two years ago , nobody knows where from , and has been with Mrs Chopper ever since . ''
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 16]: `` Two years ago , '' muttered Furness , `` that 's just the time .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 10]: Come , girl , take some more beer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 11]: Nancy drank a little , and put down the pot .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 8]: `` Where does Mrs Chopper live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 3]: inquired Furness .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 15]: `` Where you saw me looking out of the window , '' replied Nancy .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 8]: `` And the boy lives with her ?
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 9]: I will call upon Mrs Chopper by-and-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 19]: `` Yes , to be sure he does ; but why are you talking so about the boy ?
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 27]: Why do n't you talk to me , and tell me what a pretty girl I am , for I like to be told that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 39]: Furness and his comrades continued the carouse , and were getting fast into a state of intoxication ; the sergeant only was prudent ; but Furness could not let pass this opportunity of indulging without fear of punishment .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 75]: He became more loving towards Nancy as he became more tipsy ; when Nancy , who cajoled him to the utmost of her power , again mentioned our hero ; and then it was that Furness , who , when inebriated , could never hold a secret , first told her there was a reward offered for his apprehension , and that if she would remain with him they would spend the money together .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 35]: To this Nancy immediately consented , and offered to assist him as much as she could , as she had the entrance into Mrs Chopper 's house , and knew where the lad slept .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 36]: But Nancy was determined to gain more from Furness , and as he was now pretty far gone , she proposed that they should take a walk out , for it was a beautiful evening .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 4]: Furness gladly consented .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 75]: Nancy again explained to him how she should manage to get Joey into her power , and appeared quite delighted at the idea of there being a reward , which they were to obtain ; and finding that Furness was completely deceived , and that the fresh air had increased his inebriety , she then persuaded him to confide to her all the circumstances connected with the reward offered for our hero 's apprehension .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 39]: She then learned what had occurred at the inquest -- Joey 's escape -- his being again discovered by Furness -- and his second escape from the school , to which he had been put by the McShanes .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 11]: `` And his father and mother , where are they ?
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 22]: When I think of them I must say that I do not much like to assist in taking up the boy .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 13]: Poor people , how they will suffer when they hear of it ?
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 24]: Really I do n't know what to say , '' continued Nancy , biting the tip of her finger , as if hesitating .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 40]: `` Do n't let them stop you , '' said Furness ; `` they will not be likely even to hear of it ; they left the village before me , and no one knows where they are gone .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 11]: I tried to find out myself , but could not .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 12]: It 's very clear that they are gone to America . ''
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 31]: said Nancy , who had put the questions because she wished to give Joey some information relative to his parents ; `` gone to America , do you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 19]: `` Yes , I am inclined to think so , for I lost all trace of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 19]: `` Well , then , '' replied Nancy , `` that scruple of mine is got over . ''
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 38]: She then pointed out to Furness the propriety of waiting an hour or two , till people were in bed , that there might be no chance of a rescue ; and they returned to the public-house .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 23]: Furness took another glass of ale , and then fell fast asleep on the bench , with his head over the table .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 34]: `` So , '' thought Nancy , as she left the public-house , `` the drunken fool makes sure of his 200 pounds ; but there is no time to be lost . ''
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 26]: Nancy hastened back to Mrs Chopper , whom she found sitting with a candle turning over the leaves of one of the old account books .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 9]: `` O , Nancy , is that you ?
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 18]: I was just sighing over you , here 's the things that were ordered for your wedding .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 3]: Poor girl !
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 12]: I fear you have not often been to church since . ''
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 8]: Nancy was silent for a short time .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 21]: `` I 'm sick of my life and sick of myself , Mrs Chopper : but what can I do ?
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 6]: -- a wretch like me !
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 29]: I wish I could run away , as poor Peter must directly , and go to where I never was known ; I should be so happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 11]: `` Peter must go , do you say , Nancy ?
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 5]: Is that certain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 46]: `` Most certain , Mrs Chopper , and he must be off directly I have been with the marines , and the fellow has told me everything ; he is only waiting now for me to go back , to come and take him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 13]: `` But tell me , Nancy , has Peter been guilty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 34]: `` I believe from my heart that he has done nothing ; but still murder was committed , and Peter will be apprehended , unless you give him the means of running away .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 6]: Where is he now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 18]: `` Asleep , fast asleep : I did n't like to wake him , poor fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 17]: `` Then he must be innocent , Mrs Chopper : they say the guilty never sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 12]: But what will he do -- he has no money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 22]: `` He has saved me a mint of money , and he shall not want it , '' replied Mrs Chopper .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 8]: `` What shall I do without him ?
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 10]: I ca n't bear to part with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 29]: `` But you must , Mrs Chopper ; and , if you love him , you will give him the means , and let him be off directly .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 15]: I wish I was going too , '' continued Nancy , bursting into tears .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 41]: `` Go with him , Nancy , and look after him , and take care of my poor Peter , '' said Mrs Chopper , whimpering ; `` go , my child , go , and lead a good life .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 23]: I should better part with him , if I thought you were with him , and away from this horrid place . ''
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 18]: `` Will you let me go with him , Mrs Chopper -- will you , indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 8]: cried Nancy , falling on her knees .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 18]: I will watch him as a mother would her son , as a sister would her brother !
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 22]: Give us but the means to quit this place , and the good and the wicked both will bless you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 44]: `` That you shall have , my poor girl , it has often pained my heart to look at you ; for I felt that you are too good for what you are , and you will be again a good honest girl .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 5]: You both shall go .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 3]: Poor Peter !
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 18]: I wish I were young enough , I would go with you ; but I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 11]: How I shall be cheated again when he is gone !
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 5]: but go he must .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 35]: Here Nancy , take the money ; take all I have in the house : '' and Mrs Chopper put upwards of 20 pounds into Nancy 's hand as she was kneeling before her .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 21]: Nancy fell forward with her face in the lap of the good old woman , suffocated with emotion and tears .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 36]: `` Come , come , Nancy , '' said Mrs Chopper , after a pause , and wiping her eyes with her apron , `` you must n't take on so , my poor girl .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 12]: Recollect poor Peter ; there 's no time to lose . ''
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 12]: `` That is true , '' replied Nancy , rising up .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 20]: `` Mrs Chopper you have done a deed this night for which you will have your reward in heaven .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 8]: May the God of mercy bless you !
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 18]: and , as soon as I dare , night and morning will I pray for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 18]: Mrs Chopper went into Joey 's room with the candle in her hand , followed by Nancy .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 9]: `` See , how sound he sleeps ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 11]: said the old woman ; `` he is not guilty .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 2]: Peter !
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 2]: Peter !
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 7]: come get up , child . ''
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 21]: Joey rose from his bed , confused at first with the light in his eyes , but soon recovered himself .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 19]: `` Peter , you must go , my poor boy , and go quickly , Nancy says . ''
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 25]: `` I was sure of it , '' replied Joey : `` I am very , very sorry to leave you , Mrs Chopper .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 17]: Pray think well of me , for , indeed , I have done nothing wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 19]: `` I am sure of it ; but Nancy knows it all , and away you must go .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 34]: I wish you were off ; I 'm getting fidgety about it , although I can not bear to lose you ; so good-bye at once , Peter , and God bless you !
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 9]: I hope we shall meet again yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 28]: `` I hope so , indeed , Mrs Chopper ; for you have been very kind to me , as kind as a mother could be . ''
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 33]: Mrs Chopper hugged him to her breast , and then said , in a hurried tone , as she dropped on the bed , -- `` There ; go , go . ''
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 21]: Nancy took up Joey 's bundle in one hand and Joey by the other , and they went down stairs .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 34]: As soon as they were in the street , Nancy turned short round , and went to the house where she usually slept , desiring Joey to wait a moment at the door .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 25]: She soon returned with her own bundle , and then , with a quick pace , walked on , desiring Joey to follow her .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 38]: They proceeded in this manner until they were clear of the town , when Joey came up to Nancy , and said , `` Thank you , Nancy ; I suppose we 'd better part now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 15]: `` No , we do n't part yet , Peter , '' replied Nancy .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 15]: `` But where are you going , and why have you that bundle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 13]: `` I am going with you , Peter , '' replied Nancy .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 48]: `` But , Nancy -- , '' replied Joey ; and then , after a pause , `` I will do all I can for you -- I will work for you -- but I have no money , and I hope we shall not starve . ''
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 6]: `` Bless you , boy !
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 7]: bless you for that kind feeling !
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 47]: but we shall not starve ; I have Mrs Chopper 's leave to go with you ; indeed , she wished me so to do , and she has given me money for you -- it is for you , although she said for both . ''
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 16]: `` She is very kind ; but why should you go with me , Nancy ?
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 7]: You have nothing to fear . ''
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 23]: `` We must not talk now , Peter ; let us walk on ; I have more to fear than you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 5]: `` How is that ?
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 22]: I fear being taken up for that of which I am not guilty , but you have nothing to fear . ''
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 37]: `` Peter , dear , '' replied Nancy , solemnly , `` I do not fear for anything the world can do to me -- but do n't talk now ; let us go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 15]: IN WHICH THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE BRINGS OUR HERO 'S NOSE TO A GRINDSTONE .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 25]: When Nancy and our hero had proceeded about three miles on their way , Nancy slackened her pace , and they entered into conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 8]: `` Which way are you going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 3]: demanded Joey .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 44]: `` I 'm cutting right across the country , Peter , or rather Joey , as I shall in future call you , for that is your real name -- the marine told me it was Joseph Rushbrook ; is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 10]: `` Yes , it is , '' replied Joey .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 54]: `` Then in future I shall call you so , for I do not want to hear even a name which would remind me of the scene of my misery ; and Joey , do you never call me Nancy again , the name is odious to me ; call me Mary . ''
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 23]: `` I will if you wish it ; but I can not imagine why you should run away from Gravesend , Mary .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 7]: What do you mean to do ?
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 11]: I ran away from fear of being taken up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 17]: `` And I , Joey , do more ; I fly from the wrath to come .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 51]: You ask me what I intend to do ; I will answer you in the words of the catechism which I used once to repeat , ` to lead a new life , have a thankful remembrance of Christ 's death , and be in charity with all men . '
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 18]: I shall seek for service ; I care not how humble -- it will be good enough .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 23]: I will sift cinders for brick-making , make bricks , do anything , as long as what I do is honest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 28]: `` I am very glad to hear you say that , Mary , '' replied Joey , `` for I was always very fond of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 42]: `` Yes , Joey , and you were the first who offered to do a kind thing for me for a long while ; I have never forgotten it , and this night I have done something to repay it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 36]: Nancy then entered into a detail of all that had passed between her and Furness , of which Joey had been ignorant , and which proved to him what a narrow escape he had had .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 27]: `` I little thought you had done all this while I slept , '' replied Joey ; `` but I am very grateful , Mary . ''
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 13]: `` I know you are , so say no more about it .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 22]: You see , Joey , he gave me all your history , and appears to believe that you committed the murder .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 28]: I do not believe it ; I do not believe you would do such a thing , although your gun might have gone off by accident . ''
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 44]: `` No , Mary , I did not do it , either on purpose or by accident ; but you must ask me no more questions , for if I were put on my trial , I should not reveal the secret . ''
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 19]: `` Then I will never speak to you any more about it , if I can help it .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 15]: I have my own thoughts on the business , but now I drop it .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 27]: It is nearly daylight , and we have walked a good many miles ; I shall not be sorry to sit down and rest myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 20]: `` Do you know how far we have to go before we come to any town , Mary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 33]: `` We are not far from Maidstone ; it is on our right , but it will be as well not to go through so large a town so near to Gravesend .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 10]: Besides , some of the soldiers may know me .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 28]: As soon as we come to a good place , where we can find a drink of water , we will sit down and rest ourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 16]: About a mile further on they came to a small rivulet which crossed the road .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 19]: `` This will do , Joey , '' said Nancy ; `` now we 'll sit down . ''
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 22]: It was then daylight ; they took their seats on their bundles as soon as they had drunk from the stream .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 27]: `` Now , Joey , '' said Mary -LRB- as we shall call her for the future -RRB- , let us see what money we have .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 19]: Mrs Chopper put all she had in my hands ; poor , good old woman , bless her !
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 3]: Count it .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 6]: Joey ; it is yours .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 14]: `` No , Mary ; she gave it for both of us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 44]: `` Never mind ; do you keep it : for you see , Joey , it might happen that you might have to run off at a moment 's warning , and it would not do for you to be without money . ''
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 55]: `` If I was to run off at a minute 's warning , I should then take it all with me , and it would not do for you to be left without any money , Mary ; so we must halve it between us , although we will always make one purse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 28]: `` Well , be it so ; for if you were robbed , or I were robbed , on the way , the other might escape . ''
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 22]: They then divided the money , Joey putting his share into his pocket , and tying it in with a string .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 15]: Mary dropped hers down into the usual deposit of women for bank-notes and billets-doux .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 62]: As soon as this matter had been arranged , Mary opened her bundle , and took out a handkerchief , which she put on her shoulders ; combed out the ringlets which she had worn , and dressed her hair flat on her temples ; removed the gay ribbons from her bonnet , and substituted some plain brown in their stead .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 20]: `` There , '' says she ; `` now , Joey , do n't I look more respectable ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 20]: `` You do look more neat and more -- '' `` More modest , you would say , Joey .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 13]: Well , and I hope in future to become what I look .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 30]: But I look more fit to be your sister , Joey , for I have been thinking we had better pass off as brother and sister to avoid questioning .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 10]: We must make out some story to agree in .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 19]: Who shall we say that we are -LRB- as we dare not say who we really are -RRB- ?
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 29]: I am looking out for service , and so are you , that 's very clear ; father and mother are both dead ; father was a baker .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 28]: That 's all true , as far as relates to me : and as you are my brother , why you must take my father and mother .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 11]: It 's no very great story , after all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 14]: `` But it wo n't do to say we came from Gravesend . ''
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 32]: `` No ; we need not say that , and yet tell no story ; the village we passed through last night was Wrotham , so we came from thence . ''
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 12]: `` But where do you think of going , Mary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 26]: `` A good way farther off yet ; at all events , before we look out for service , we will get into another county .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 36]: Now , if you are ready , we will go on Joey , and look out for some breakfast , and then I shall be able to change my gown for a quieter one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 16]: In half an hour they arrived at a village , and went into a public-house .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 49]: Mary went up stairs and changed her dress ; and now that she had completed her arrangements , she looked a very pretty , modest young woman , and none could have supposed that the day before she had been flaunting in the street of a seafaring town .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 27]: Inquiries were made , as might be supposed , and Mary replied that she was going to service , and that her brother was escorting her .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 18]: They had their breakfast , and , after resting two hours , they proceeded on their journey .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 34]: For some days they travelled more deliberately , until they found themselves in the village of Manstone , in Dorsetshire , where they , as usual , put up at an humble public-house .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 26]: Here Mary told a different story ; she had been disappointed in a situation , and they intended to go back to their native town .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 74]: The landlady of the hotel was prepossessed in favour of such a very pretty girl as Mary , as well as with the appearance of Joey , who , although in his sailor 's dress , was very superior in carriage and manners to a boy in his supposed station in life , and she said that if they would remain there a few days she would try to procure them some situation .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 42]: The third day after their arrival , she informed Mary that she had heard of a situation as under-housemaid at the squire 's , about a mile off , if she would like to take it , and Mary gladly consented .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 29]: Mrs Derborough sent up word , and received orders for Mary to make her appearance , and Mary accordingly went up to the hall , accompanied by Joey .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 27]: When she arrived there , and made known her business , she was desired to wait in the servants ' hall until she was sent for .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 50]: In about a quarter of a hour she was summoned , and , leaving Joey in the hall , she went up to see the lady of the house , who inquired whether she had ever been out at service before , and if she had a good character .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 31]: Mary replied that she had never been out at service , and that she had no character at all -LRB- which , by the bye , was very true -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 29]: The lady of the house smiled at this apparently _ naive _ answer from so very modest-looking and pretty a girl , and asked who her parents were .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 69]: To this question Mary 's answer was ready , and she further added that she had left home in search of a place , and had been disappointed ; that her father and mother were dead , but her brother was down below , and had escorted her ; and that Mrs Chopper was an old friend of her mother 's , and could answer to her character .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 84]: The lady was prepossessed by Mary 's appearance , by the report of Mrs Derborough , and by the respectability of her brother travelling with her , and agreed to try her ; but at the same time said she must have Mrs Chopper 's address , that she might write to her ; but , the place being vacant , she might come to-morrow morning : her wages were named , and immediately accepted ; and thus did Mary obtain her situation .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 87]: People say you can not be too particular when you choose servants ; and , to a certain degree , this is true ; but this extreme caution , however selfishness and prudence may dictate it , is but too often the cause of servants who have committed an error , and have in consequence been refused a character , being driven to destitution and misery , when they had a full intention , and would have , had they been permitted , redeemed their transgression .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 11]: Mary was resolved to be a good and honest girl .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 50]: Had the lady of the house been very particular , and had others to whom she might afterwards have applied been the same , all her good intentions might have been frustrated , and she might have been driven to despair , if not to her former evil courses .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 39]: It is perhaps fortunate that everybody in the world is not so particular as your very good people , and that there is an occasional loophole by which those who have erred are permitted to return to virtue .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 20]: Mary left the room delighted with her success , and went down to Joey in the servants ' hall .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 36]: The servants soon found out from Mary that she was coming to the house , and one of the men chucked her under the chin , and told her she was a very pretty girl .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 43]: Mary drew back , and Joey immediately resented the liberty , stating that he would not allow any man to insult his sister , for Joey was wise enough to see that he could not do a better thing to serve Mary .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 21]: The servant was insolent in return , and threatened to chastise Joey , and ordered him to leave the house .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 8]: The women took our hero 's part .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 72]: The housekeeper came down at the time , and hearing the cause of the dispute , was angry with the footman ; the butler took the side of the footman ; and the end of it was that the voices were at the highest pitch when the bell rang , and the men being obliged to answer it , the women were for the time left in possession of the field .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 8]: `` What is that noise below ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 7]: inquired the master of the house .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 30]: `` It is a boy , sir -- the brother , I believe of the girl who has come as under-housemaid , who has been making a disturbance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 10]: `` Desire him to leave the house instantly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 18]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied the butler , who went down to enforce the order .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 34]: Little did the master of the house imagine that in giving that order he was turning out of the house his own son ; for the squire was no other than Mr Austin .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 40]: Little did the inconsolable Mrs Austin fancy that her dear , lamented boy was at that moment under the same roof with her , and been driven out of it by her menials ; but such was the case .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 18]: So Joey and Mary quitted the hall , and bent their way back to the village inn .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 22]: `` Well , Mary , '' said Joey , `` I am very glad that you have found a situation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 45]: `` And so I am very thankful , indeed , Joey , '' replied she ; `` and only hope that you will be able to get one somewhere about here also , and then we may occasionally see something of one another . ''
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 43]: `` No , Mary , '' replied Joey , `` I shall not look for a situation about here ; the only reason I had for wishing it was that I might see you ; but that will be impossible now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 5]: `` Why so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 24]: `` Do you think that I will ever put my foot into that house again , after the manner I was treated to-day ?
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 3]: Never . ''
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 12]: `` I was afraid so , '' replied Mary , mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 51]: `` No , Mary , I am happy that you are provided for ; for I can seek my own fortune , and I will write to you , and let you know what I do ; and you will write to me , Mary , wo n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 31]: `` It will be the greatest pleasure that will be left to me , Joey ; for I love you as dearly as it you were my own brother . ''
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 22]: The next day our hero and Mary parted , with many tears on her side , and much sorrow on his .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 46]: Joey refused to take more of the money than what he had in his possession , but promised ; in case of need , to apply to Mary , who said that she would hoard up everything for him ; and she kept her word .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 29]: Joey , having escorted Mary to the hall lodge , remained at the inn till the next morning , and then set off once more on his travels .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 33]: Our hero started at break of day , and had walked , by a western road , from Manstone , about six miles , when he met two men coming towards him .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 53]: They were most miserably clad -- neither of them had shoes or stockings ; one had only a waistcoat and a pair of trousers , with a sack on his back ; the other had a pair of blue trousers torn to ribbons , a Guernsey frock , and a tarpaulin hat .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 58]: They appeared what they represented themselves to be , when they demanded charity , two wrecked seamen , who were travelling to a northern port to obtain employment ; but had these fellows been questioned by a sailor , he would soon have discovered , by their total ignorance of anything nautical , that they were impostors .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 52]: Perhaps there is no plan more successful than this , which is now carried on to an enormous extent by a set of rogues and depredators , who occasionally request charity , but too often extort it , and add to their spoils by robbing and plundering everything in their way .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 114]: It is impossible for people in this country to ascertain the truth of the assertions of these vagabonds , and it appears unfeeling to refuse assistance to a poor seaman who has lost his all : even the cottager offers his mite , and thus do they levy upon the public to an extent which is scarcely credible ; but it should be known that , in all cases of shipwreck , sailors are now invariably relieved and decently clothed , and supplied with the means of travelling to obtain employment ; and whenever a man appeals for charity in a half-naked state , he is invariably an impostor or a worthless scoundrel .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 14]: The two men were talking loud and laughing when they approached our hero .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 27]: As soon as they came near , they looked hard at him , and stopped right before him , so as to block up the footpath .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 7]: `` Hilloah , my little sailor !
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 7]: where are you bound to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 14]: said one to Joey , who had his common sailor 's dress on .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 15]: `` And , I say , what have you got in that bundle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 13]: said the other ; `` and how are you off for brads ?
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 10]: -- have n't you something to spare for brother-seamen ?
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 15]: Come , feel in your pockets ; or shall I feel for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 34]: Joey did not much like this exordium ; he replied , stepping into the road at the same time , `` I 've no money , and the bundle contains my clothes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 21]: `` Come , come , '' said the first , `` you 're not going to get off that way .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 45]: If you do n't wish your brains beaten out , you 'll just hand over that bundle for me to examine ; '' and so saying , the man stepped into the road towards Joey , who continued to retreat to the opposite side .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 34]: There was no footpath at the side of the road to which Joey retreated , but a very thick quick-set hedge , much too strong for any man to force his way through .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 38]: Joey perceived this ; and as the man came at him to seize his bundle , he contrived , by a great effort , to swing it over the hedge into the field on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 67]: The man , exasperated at this measure on the part of our hero , ran to seize him ; but Joey dodged under him , and ran away down the road for a few yards , where he picked up a heavy stone for his defence , and there remained , prepared to defend himself , and not lose his bundle if he could help it .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 53]: `` You get hold of him , Bill , while I go round for the bundle , '' said the man who had followed across the road , and he immediately set off to find the gate , or some entrance into the field , while the other man made after Joey .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 32]: Our hero retreated at full speed ; the man followed , but could not keep pace with our hero , as the road was newly-gravelled , and he had no shoes .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 43]: Joey , perceiving this , slackened his pace , and when the man was close to him , turned short round , and aiming the stone with great precision , hit him on the forehead , and the fellow fell down senseless .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 57]: In the meantime the other miscreant had taken the road in the opposite direction to look for the gate ; and Joey , now rid of his assailant , perceived that in the hedge , opposite to the part of the road where he now stood , there was a gap which he could get through .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 12]: He scrambled into the field , and ran for his bundle .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 34]: The other man , who had been delayed , the gate being locked , and fenced with thorns , had but just gained the field when Joey had his bundle in his possession .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 34]: Our hero caught it up , and ran like lightning to the gap , tossed over his bundle , and followed it , while the man was still a hundred yards from him .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 48]: Once more in the high road , Joey took to his heels , and having run about two hundred yards , he looked back to ascertain if he was pursued , and perceived the man standing over his comrade , who was lying where he had fallen .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 70]: Satisfied that he was now safe , Joey pursued his journey at a less rapid rate , although he continued to look back every minute , just by way of precaution ; but the fellows , although they would not lose an opportunity of what appeared such an easy robbery , had their own reasons for continuing their journey , and getting away from that part of the country .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 37]: Our hero pursued his way for two miles , looking out for some water by the wayside to quench his thirst , when he observed in the distance that there was something lying on the roadside .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 80]: As he came nearer , he made it out to be a man prostrate on the grass , apparently asleep , and a few yards from where the man lay was a knife-grinder 's wheel , and a few other articles in the use of a travelling tinker ; a fire , nearly extinct , was throwing up a tiny column of smoke , and a saucepan , which appeared to have been upset , was lying beside it .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 52]: There was something in the scene before him which created a suspicion in the mind of our hero that all was not right ; so , instead of passing on , he walked right up to where the man lay , and soon discovered that his face and dress were bloody .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 20]: Joey knelt down by the side of him , and found that he was senseless , but breathing heavily .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 30]: Joey untied the handkerchief which was round his neck , and which was apparently very tight , and almost immediately afterwards the man appeared relieved and opened his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 15]: After a little time he contrived to utter one word , `` Water ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 15]: and Joey , taking up the empty saucepan , proceeded in search of it .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 10]: He soon found some , and brought it back .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 22]: The tinker had greatly recovered during his absence , and as soon as he had drunk the water , sat upright .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 20]: `` Do n't leave me , boy , '' said the tinker ; `` I feel very faint . ''
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 28]: `` I will stay by you as long as I can be of any use to you , '' replied Joey ; `` what has happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 7]: `` Robbed and almost murdered ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 8]: replied the man , with a groan .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 18]: `` Was it by those two rascals without shoes and stockings who attempted to rob me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 3]: inquired Joey .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 11]: `` Yes , the same , I 've no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 25]: I must lie down for a time , my head is so bad , '' replied the man , dropping back upon the grass .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 22]: In a few minutes the exhausted man fell asleep , and Joey remained sitting by his side for nearly two hours .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 32]: At last , his new companion awoke , raised himself up , and , dipping his handkerchief into the saucepan of water , washed the blood from his head and face .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 40]: `` This might have been worse , my little fellow , '' said he to Joey , after he had wiped his face ; `` one of those rascals nearly throttled me , he pulled my handkerchief so tight .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 32]: Well , this is a wicked world , this , to take away a fellow-creature 's life for thirteenpence-halfpenny , for that was all the money they found in my pocket .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 15]: I thought an itinerant tinker was safe from highway robbery , at all events .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 16]: Did you not say that they attacked you , or did I dream it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 12]: `` I did say so ; it was no dream . ''
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 12]: `` And how did a little midge like you escape ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 11]: Joey gave the tinker a detail of what had occurred .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 22]: `` Cleverly done , boy , and kindly done now to come to my help , and to remain by me .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 28]: I was going down the road , and as you have come down , I presume we are going the same way , '' replied the tinker .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 11]: `` Do you feel strong enough to walk now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 15]: `` Yes , I think I can ; but there 's the grindstone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 11]: `` Oh , I 'll wheel that for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 26]: `` Do , that 's a good boy , for I tremble very much , and it would be too heavy for me now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 85]: Joey fixed his bundle with the saucepan , etcetera , upon the knife-grinder 's wheel , and rolled it along the road , followed by the tinker , until they came to a small hamlet , about two miles from the spot from which they had started ; they halted when they were fifty yards from the first cottage , and the tinker , having selected a dry place under the hedge , said , `` I must stop here a little while ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 61]: Joey , who had heard the tinker say that the men had robbed him of thirteenpence-halfpenny , imagined that he was destitute , and as he wished to proceed on his way , he took out two shillings , and held them out to the man , saying , `` This will keep you till you can earn some more .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 9]: Good-bye now ; I must go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 6]: The tinker looked at Joey .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 42]: `` You 're a kind-hearted lad , at all events , and a clever , bold one , if I mistake not , '' said he ; `` put up your money , nevertheless , for I do not want any .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 16]: I have plenty , if they had only known where to look for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 16]: Joey was examining his new companion during the time that he was speaking to him .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 33]: There was a free and independent bearing about the man , and a refinement of manner and speech very different from what might be expected from one in so humble a situation .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 28]: The tinker perceived this scrutiny , and , after meeting our hero 's glance , said , `` Well , what are you thinking of now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 14]: `` I was thinking that you have not always been a tinker . ''
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 35]: `` And I fancy that you have not always been a sailor , my young master ; but , however , oblige me by going into the village and getting some breakfast for us .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 19]: I will pay you the money when you return , and then we can talk a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 46]: Joey went into the village , and finding a small chandler 's shop , bought some bread and cheese , and a large mug which held a quart of beer , both of which he also purchased , and then went back to the tinker .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 32]: As soon as they had made their breakfast , Joey rose up and said -- `` I must go on now ; I hope you 'll find yourself better to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 13]: `` Are you in a very great hurry , my lad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 4]: inquired the tinker .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 24]: `` I want to find some employment , '' replied Joey ; `` and , therefore , I must look for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 8]: `` Tell me what employment you want .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 6]: What can you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 17]: `` I do n't exactly know ; I have been keeping accounts for a person . ''
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 14]: `` Then you are a scholar , and not a seafaring person ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 21]: `` I am not a sailor , if you mean that ; but I have been on the river . ''
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 29]: `` Well , if you wish to get employment , as I know this country well and a great many people , I think I may help you .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 54]: At all events , a few days can make no difference ; for you see , my boy , to-morrow I shall be able to work , and then , I 'll answer for it , I 'll find meat and drink for both of us , so , what do you say ?
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 33]: Suppose you stay with me , and we 'll travel together for a few days , and when I have found work that will suit you , then we can part ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 12]: `` I will if you wish it , '' replied Joey .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 62]: `` Then that 's agreed , '' said the tinker ; `` I should like to do you a good turn before we part , and I hope I shall be able ; at all events , if you stay with me a little while , I will teach you a trade which will serve you when all others fail . ''
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 12]: `` What , to mend kettles and to grind knives ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 38]: `` Exactly ; and , depend upon it , if you would be sure of gaining your livelihood , you will choose a profession which will not depend upon the caprice of others , or upon patronage .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 35]: Kettles , my boy , will wear out , knives will get blunt , and , therefore , for a good trade , give me ` kettles to mend , knives to grind . '
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 16]: I 've tried many trades , and there is none that suits me so well .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 41]: And now that we 've had our breakfast , we may just as well look out for lodgings for the night , for I suppose you would not like the heavens for your canopy , which I very often prefer .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 17]: Now , put yourself to the wheel , and I 'll try my old quarters . ''
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 31]: The knife-grinder walked into the village , followed by Joey , who rolled the wheel , until they stopped at a cottage , where he was immediately recognised and welcomed .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 20]: Joey was ordered to put the wheel under a shed , and then followed the tinker into the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 36]: The latter told his story , which created a good deal of surprise and indignation , and then complained of his head and retired to lie down , while Joey amused himself with the children .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 18]: They ate and slept there that night , the people refusing to take anything for their reception .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 38]: The next day the tinker was quite recovered , and having mended a kettle and ground three or four knives for his hostess , he set off again , followed by Joey , who rolled the wheel .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 12]: ON THE SCIENCE OF TINKERING AND THE ART OF WRITING DESPATCHES .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 46]: They had proceeded about two miles when the tinker said -- `` Come , my lad , let us sit down now , and rest ourselves a bit , for it is past noon , and you must be tired with shoving that wheel along .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 36]: I would have taken it from you before this , but the fact is , I 'm rather stiff yet about the head and shoulders ; I feel it more than I thought I should .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 53]: Here 's a nice spot ; I like to sit down under a tree , not too well covered with leaves , like this ash ; I like to see the sunshine playing here and there upon the green grass , shifting its spots as the leaves are rustled by the wind .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 17]: Now , let us lie down here , and not care a fig for the world .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 11]: I am a philosopher ; do you know that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 22]: `` I do n't exactly know what it means ; a very clever , good man -- is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 23]: `` Well , not exactly ; a man may be a philosopher without being very good , or without being very clever .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 43]: A philosopher is a man who never frets about anything , cares about nothing , is contented with a little , and does n't envy any one who appears better off than himself , at least that is my school of philosophy .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 47]: You stare , boy , to hear a tinker talk in this way -- I perceive that ; but you must know that I am a tinker by choice ; and I have tried many other professions before , all of which have disgusted me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 9]: `` What other professions have you been ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 21]: `` I have been -- let me see -- I almost forget ; but I 'll begin at the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 163]: My father was a gentleman , and until I was fourteen years old I was a gentleman , or the son of one ; then he died , and that profession was over , for he left nothing ; my mother married again , and left me ; she left me at school , and the master kept me there for a year , in hopes of being paid ; but , hearing nothing of my mother , and not knowing what to do with me , he at last -LRB- for he was a kind man -RRB- installed me as under usher of the school ; for , you see , my education had been good , and I was well qualified for the situation , as far as capability went : it was rather a bathos , though , to sink from a gentleman 's son to an under usher ; but I was not a philosopher at that time .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 86]: I handed the toast to the master and mistress , the head ushers and parlour boarders , but was not allowed any myself ; I taught Latin and Greek , and English Grammar , to the little boys , who made faces at me , and put crooked pins on the bottom of my chair ; I walked at the head of the string when they went out for an airing , and walked upstairs the last when it was time to go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 151]: I had all the drudgery , and none of the comforts I was up first , and held answerable for all deficiencies ; I had to examine all their nasty little trowsers , and hold weekly conversation with the botcher , as to the possibility of repairs ; to run out if a hen cackled , that the boys should not get the egg ; to wipe the noses of my mistress 's children , and carry them if they roared ; to pay for all broken glass , if I could not discover the culprit to account for all bad smells , for all noise , and for all ink spilled ; to make all the pens , and to keep one hundred boys silent and attentive at church ; for all which , with deductions , I received 40 pounds a year , and found my own washing .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 48]: I stayed two years , during which time I contrived to save about 6 pounds ; and with that , one fine morning , I set off on my travels , fully satisfied that , come what would , I could not change for the worse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 20]: `` Then you were about in the position that I 'm in now , '' said Joey , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 14]: `` Yes , thereabouts ; only a little older , I should imagine .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 22]: I set off with good hopes , but soon found that nobody wanted educated people -- they were a complete drug .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 51]: At last I obtained a situation as waiter , at a posting-house on the road , where I ran along all day long to the tinkling of bells , with hot brandy-and-water ever under my nose ; I answered all the bells , but the head-waiter took all the money .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 53]: However , I made acquaintances there ; and at last obtained a situation as clerk to a corn-chandler , where I kept the books ; but he failed , and then I was handed over to the miller , and covered with flour for the whole time I was in his service .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 31]: I stayed there till I had an offer from a coal-merchant -LRB- that was going from white to black -RRB- ; but , however , it was a better place .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 67]: Then , by mere chance , I obtained the situation of clerk on board of a fourteen-gun brig , and cruised in the Channel for six months ; but , as I found that there was no chance of being a purser , and as I hated the confinement and discipline of a man-of-war , I cut and run as soon as I obtained my pay .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 66]: Then I was shopman at a draper 's , which was abominable , for if the customers would not buy the goods , I got all the blame ; besides , I had to clean my master 's boots and my mistress 's shoes , and dine in the kitchen on scraps , with a slipshod , squinting girl , who made love to me .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 31]: Then I was a warehouseman ; but they soon tacked on to it the office of light porter , and I had to carry weights enough to break my back .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 86]: At last I obtained a situation as foreman in a tinman and cutler 's shop , and by being constantly sent into the workshop I learnt something of the trade ; I had made up my mind not to remain much longer , and I paid attention , receiving now and then a lesson from the workmen , till I found that I could do very well ; for , you see , it 's a very simple sort of business , after all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 26]: `` But still a travelling tinker is not so respectable as being in any of the situations you were in before , '' replied Joey .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 39]: `` There I must beg your pardon , my good lad ; I had often serious thoughts upon the subject , and I argued as follows : -- What is the best profession in this world of ours ?
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 33]: -- That of a gentleman ; for a gentleman does not work , he has liberty to go where he pleases , he is not controlled , and is his own master .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 18]: Many a man considers himself a gentleman who has not the indispensables that must complete the profession .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 58]: A clerk in the Treasury , or public offices , considers himself a gentleman ; and so he is by birth , but not by profession ; for he is not his own master , but is as much tied down to his desk as the clerk in a banker 's counting-house , or in a shop .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 26]: A gentleman by profession must be his own master , and independent ; and how few there are in this world who can say so !
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 32]: Soldiers and sailors are obliged to obey orders , and therefore I do not put them down as perfect gentlemen , according to my ideas of what a gentleman should be .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 20]: I doubt whether the prime minister can be considered a gentleman until after he is turned out of office .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 8]: Do you understand me , boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 54]: `` O yes , I understand what you mean by a gentleman ; I recollect reading a story of a negro who came to this country , and who said that the pig was the only gentleman in the country , for he was the only living being who did not work . ''
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 13]: `` The negro was not far wrong , '' resumed the tinker .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 52]: `` Well , after thinking a long while , I came to the decision that , as I could not be a perfect gentleman , I would be the nearest thing to it that was possible ; and I considered that the most enviable situation was that of a travelling tinker .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 30]: I learned enough of the trade , saved money to purchase a knife-grinder 's wheel , and here I have been in this capacity for nearly ten years . ''
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 13]: `` And do you hold to the opinion that you formed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 33]: `` I do ; for , look you , work I must ; therefore , the only question was , to take up the work that was lightest , and paid best .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 19]: I know no trade where you can gain so much with so little capital and so little labour .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 53]: Then , I am not controlled by any living being ; I have my liberty and independence : I go where I please , stop where I please , work when I please , and idle when I please ; and never know what it is to want a night 's lodging .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 11]: Show me any other profession which can say the same !
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 40]: I might be better clothed -- I might be considered more respectable ; but I am a philosopher , and despise all that ; I earn as much as I want , and do very little work for it .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 38]: I can grind knives and scissors and mend kettles enough in one day to provide for a whole week ; for instance , I can grind a knife in two minutes , for which I receive twopence .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 40]: Now , allowing that I work twelve hours in the day , at the rate of one penny per minute , I should earn 3 pounds per day , which , deducting Sundays , is 939 pounds a year .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 40]: Put that against 40 pounds a year , as a drudge to a school , or confined to a desk , in a shop , or any other profession , and you see how lucrative mine is in proportion .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 76]: Then I am under no control ; not ordered here or there , like a general or admiral ; not attacked in the House of Commons or Lords , like a prime minister ; on the contrary , half a day 's work out of the seven is all I require ; and I therefore assert , that my profession is nearer to that of a gentleman than any other that I know of . ''
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 24]: `` It may be as you style it , but you do n't look much like one , '' replied Joey , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 24]: `` That 's prejudice ; my clothes keep me as warm as if they were of the best materials , and quite new .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 42]: I enjoy my victuals quite as much as a well-dressed gentleman does -- perhaps more ; I can indulge in my own thoughts ; I have leisure to read all my favourite authors , and can afford to purchase new books .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 30]: Besides , as I must work a little , it is pleasant to feel that I am always in request , and respected by those who employ me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 3]: `` Respected !
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 5]: on what account ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 12]: `` Because I am always wanted , and therefore always welcome .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 103]: It is the little things of this life which annoy , not the great and a kettle that wo n't hold water , or a knife that wo n't cut , are always objects of execration ; and as people heap their anathemas upon the kettle and the knife , so do they long for my return ; and when I come , they are glad to see me , glad to pay me , and glad to find that their knives are sharp , and their kettles , thrown on one side , are useful again , at a trifling charge .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 28]: I add to people 's comforts ; I become necessary to every poor person in the cottages ; and therefore , they like me and respect me .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 73]: And , indeed , if it is only considered how many oaths and execrations are used when a person is hacking and sawing away with a knife which will not cut , and how by my wheel I do away with the cause of crime , I think that a travelling tinker may be considered , as to his moral influence upon society , more important than any parson in his pulpit .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 18]: You observe that I have not rendered the profession degrading by marriage , as many do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 7]: `` How do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 50]: `` I hold that , whatever may be the means of a gentleman , he must be considered to lose the most precious advantages appertaining to his profession when he marries ; for he loses his liberty , and can no longer be said to be under no control .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 23]: It is very well for other professions to marry , as the world must be peopled ; but a gentleman never should .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 71]: It is true , he may contrive to leave his clog at home , but then he pays dear for a useless and galling appendage but , in my situation as a travelling tinker , I could not have done so ; I must have dragged my clog after me through the mud and mire , and have had a very different reception than what I have at present . ''
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 5]: `` Why so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 42]: `` Why , a man may stroll about the country by himself -- find lodging and entertainment for himself ; but not so , if he had a wife in rags , and two or three dirty children at his heels .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 63]: A single man , in every stage of society , if he pays his own way , more easily finds admission than a married one -- that is , because the women regulate it and , although they will receive him as a tinker , they invariably object to his wife , who is considered and stigmatised as the tinker 's trull .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 24]: No , that would not do -- a wife would detract from my respectability , and add very much to my cares . ''
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 12]: `` But have you no home , then , anywhere ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 45]: `` Why , yes , I have , like all single men on the _ pave _ , as the French say -- just a sort of ` chambers ' to keep my property in , which will accumulate in spite of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 6]: `` Where are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 12]: `` In Dudstone , to which place I am now going .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 24]: I have a room for six pounds a year ; and the woman in the house takes charge of everything during my absence .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 12]: And now , my boy , what is your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 26]: `` Joey Atherton , '' replied our hero , who had made up his mind to take the surname of his adopted sister , Nancy .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 26]: `` Well , Joey , do you agree with me that my profession is a good one , and are you willing to learn it ?
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 9]: If so , I will teach you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 32]: `` I shall be very glad to learn it , because it may one day be useful ; but I am not sure that I should like to follow it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 18]: `` You will probably change your opinion ; at all events , give it a fair trial .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 25]: In a month or so you will have the theory of it by heart , and then we will come to the practice . ''
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 7]: `` How do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 30]: `` It 's of no use your attempting anything till you 're well grounded in the theory of the art , which you will gain by using your eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 75]: All you have to do at first is to look on ; watch me when I grind a knife or a pair of scissors ; be attentive when you see me soldering a pot , or putting a patch upon a kettle ; see how I turn my hand when I 'm grinding , how I beat out the iron when I mend ; and learn how to heat the tools when I solder .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 25]: In a month you will know how things are to be done in theory , and after that we shall come to the practice .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 66]: One only thing , in the way of practice , must you enter upon at once , and that is turning the wheel with your foot ; for you must learn to do it so mechanically , that you are not aware that you are doing it , otherwise you can not devote your whole attention to the scissors or knife in your hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 20]: `` And do you really like your present life , then , wandering about from place to place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 7]: `` To be sure I do .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 22]: I am my own master ; go where I like ; stop where I like ; pay no taxes or rates .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 18]: I still retain all the gentleman except the dress , which I can resume when I please .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 28]: Besides , mine is a philanthropic profession ; I go about doing good , and I 've the means of resenting an affront like a despot . ''
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 5]: `` As how ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 68]: `` Why , you see , we travellers never interfere in each other 's beats ; mine is a circuit of many miles of country , and at the rate I travel it is somewhat about three months until I am at the same place again ; they must wait for me if they want their jobs done , for they can not get any one else .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 51]: In one village they played me a trick one Saturday night , when all the men were at the ale-house , and the consequence was , I cut the village for a year ; and there never was such a village full of old kettles and blunt knives in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 22]: However , they sent me a deputation , hoping I would forget what had passed , and I pardoned them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 7]: `` What is your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 3]: inquired Joey .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 4]: `` Augustus Spikeman .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 31]: My father was Augustus Spikeman , Esquire ; I was Master Augustus Spikeman , and now I 'm Spikeman , the tinker ; so now we 'll go on again .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 40]: I have nearly come to the end of my beat ; in two days we shall be at Dudstone where I have my room , and where we shall probably remain for some days before we start again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 16]: In the afternoon they arrived at a small hamlet , where they supped and slept .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 75]: Spikeman was very busy till noon grinding and repairing ; they then continued their journey , and on the second day , having waited outside the town till it was dusk Spikeman left his wheel in the charge of the landlord of a small ale-house , to whom he appeared well known , then walked with Joey to the house in which he had a room , and led him upstairs to his apartments .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 29]: When our hero entered the chamber of Spikeman , he was very much surprised to find it was spacious , light , and airy , and very clean .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 43]: A large bed was in one corner ; a sofa , mahogany table , chest of drawers , and chairs , composed the furniture ; there was a good-sized looking-glass over the chimney-piece , and several shelves of books round the room .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 47]: Desiring Joey to sit down and take a book , Spikeman rang for water , shaved off his beard , which had grown nearly half an inch long , washed himself , and then put on clean linen , and a very neat suit of clothes .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 17]: When he was completely dressed , Joey could hardly believe that it was the same person .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 31]: Upon Joey expressing his astonishment , Spikeman replied , `` You see , my lad , there is no one in this town who knows what my real profession is .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 37]: I always go out and return at dusk , and the travelling tinker is not recognised ; not that I care for it so much , only other people do , and I respect their prejudices .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 49]: They know that I am in the ironmongery line , and that is all ; so I always make it a rule to enjoy myself after my circuit , and live like a gentleman till part of my money is gone , and then I set out again .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 30]: I am acquainted with a good many highly respectable people in this town , and that is the reason why I said I could be of service to you .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 7]: Have you any better clothes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 7]: `` Yes ; much better . ''
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 17]: `` Then dress yourself in them , and keep those you wear for our travels . ''
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 32]: Joey did as he was requested , and Spikeman then proposed that they should make a call at a friend 's , where he would introduce our hero as his nephew .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 23]: They set off , and soon came to the front of a neat-looking house , at the door of which Spikeman rapped .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 33]: The door was opened by one of the daughters of the house , who , on seeing him , cried out , `` Dear me , Mr Spikeman , is this you ?
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 11]: Why , where have you been all this while ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 22]: `` About the country for orders , Miss Amelia , '' replied Spikeman ; `` business must be attended to . ''
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 34]: `` Well , come in ; mother will be glad to see you , '' replied the girl , at the same time opening the door of the sitting-room for them to enter .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 8]: `` Mr Spikeman as I live ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 12]: exclaimed another girl , jumping up , and seizing his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 56]: `` Well , Mr Spikeman , it 's an age since we have seen you , '' said the mother , `` so now sit down and tell us all the news ; and Ophelia , my love , get tea ready ; and who is it you have with you , Mr Spikeman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 21]: `` My little nephew , madam ; he is about to enter into the mysteries of the cutlery trade . ''
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 3]: `` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 30]: well , I suppose , as you are looking out for a successor , you soon intend to retire from business and take a wife , Mr Spikeman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 31]: `` Why , I suppose it will be my fate one of these days , '' replied Spikeman ; `` but that 's an affair that requires some consideration . ''
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 53]: `` Very true , Mr Spikeman , it is a serious affair , '' replied the old lady ; `` and I can assure you that neither my Ophelia nor Amelia should marry a man , with my consent , without I was convinced the gentleman considered it a very serious affair .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 13]: It makes or mars a man , as the saying is . ''
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 23]: `` Well , Miss Ophelia , have you read all the books I lent you the last time I was here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 26]: `` Yes , that they have , both of them , '' replied the old lady ; `` they are so fond of poetry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 36]: `` But we 've often wished that you were here to read to us , '' replied Miss Amelia , `` you do read so beautifully ; will you read to us after tea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 8]: `` Certainly , with much pleasure . ''
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 40]: Miss Ophelia now entered with the tea-tray ; she and her sister then went into the kitchen to make some toast , and to see to the kettle boiling , while Mr Spikeman continued in conversation with the mother .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 92]: Mrs James was the widow of a draper in the town , who had , at his death left her sufficient to live quietly and respectably with her daughters , who were both very good , amiable girls ; and it must be acknowledged , neither of them unwilling to listen to the addresses of Mr Spikeman had he been so inclined ; but they began to think that Mr Spikeman was not a marrying man , which , as the reader must know by this time , was the fact .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 6]: The evening passed very pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 45]: Mr Spikeman took a volume of poetry , and , as Miss Ophelia had said , he did read very beautifully : so much so , that Joey was in admiration , for he had never yet known the power produced by good reading .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 15]: At ten o'clock they took their leave , and returned to Spikeman 's domicile .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 18]: As soon as they were upstairs , and candles lighted , Spikeman sat down on the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 33]: `` You see , Joey , '' said he , `` that it is necessary not to mention the knife-grinder 's wheel , as it would make a difference in my reception .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 23]: All gentlemen do not gain their livelihood as honestly as I do ; but , still prejudices are not to be overcome .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 42]: You did me a kind act , and I wished to return it ; I could not do so without letting you into this little secret , but I have seen enough of you to think you can be trusted . ''
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 22]: `` I should hope so , '' replied Joey : `` I have learnt caution , young as I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 17]: `` That I have perceived already , and therefore I have said enough on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 21]: I have but one bed , and you must sleep with me , as you did on our travels . ''
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 14]: The next morning the old woman of the house brought up their breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 56]: Spikeman lived in a very comfortable way , very different to what he did as a travelling tinker ; and he really appeared to Joey to be , with the exception of his conversation , which was always superior , a very different person from what he was when Joey first fell in with him .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 19]: For many days they remained at Dudstone , visiting the different houses , and were always well received .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 42]: `` You appear so well known , and so well liked in this town , '' observed Joey , `` I wonder you do not set up a business , particularly as you say you have money in the bank . ''
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 65]: `` If I did , Joey , I should no longer be happy , no longer be my own master , and do as I please ; in fact , I should no longer be the gentleman , that is , the gentleman by profession , as near as I can be one -- the man who has his liberty , and enjoys it .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 20]: No , no , boy ; I have tried almost everything , and have come to my own conclusions .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 11]: Have you been reading the book I gave you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 10]: `` Yes ; I have nearly finished it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 11]: `` I am glad to see that you like reading .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 9]: Nothing so much improves or enlarges the mind .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 41]: You must never let a day pass without reading two or three hours , and when we travel again , and are alone by the way-side , we will read together : I will choose some books on purpose . ''
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 17]: `` I should like very much to write to my sister Mary , '' said Joey .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 19]: `` Do so , and tell her that you have employment ; but do not say exactly how .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 9]: There are pens and paper in the drawer .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 10]: Stop , I will find them for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 22]: Spikeman went to the drawer , and when taking out the pens and paper , laid hold of some manuscript writing .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 65]: `` By the bye , '' said he laughing , `` I told you , Joey , that I had been a captain 's clerk on board the _ Weasel _ , a fourteen-gun brig ; I wrote the captain 's despatches for him ; and here are two of them of which I kept copies , that I might laugh over them occasionally .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 29]: I wrote all his letters ; for he was no great penman in the first place , and had a very great confusion of ideas in the second .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 22]: He certainly was indebted to me , as you will acknowledge , when you hear what I read and tell you .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 27]: I served under him , cruising in the Channel ; and I flatter myself that it was entirely through my writings that he got his promotion .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 13]: He is now Captain Alcibiades Ajax Boggs , and all through me .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 56]: We were cruising off the coast of France , close in to Ushant , where we perceived a fleet of small vessels , called chasse-marees -LRB- coasting luggers -RRB- , laden with wine , coming round ; and as we did not know of any batteries thereabouts , we ran in to attempt a capture .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 125]: We cut off three of them , but just as we had compelled them , by firing broadsides into them , to lower their sails , a battery , which our commander did not know anything of , opened fire upon us , and before we could get out of range , which we did as soon as we could , one shot came in on deck , and cut the top-sail halyard 's fall , at the very time that the men were hoisting the sail -LRB- for we had been shaking another reef out -RRB- , and the rope being divided , as the men were hauling upon it , of course they all tumbled on the deck , one over another .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 27]: The other shot struck our foremast , and chipped off a large slice , besides cutting away one of the shrouds , and the signal halyards .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 53]: Now , you do not know enough about ships to understand that there was very little harm done , or that the coasting vessels were very small , with only three or four men on board of each of them ; it therefore required some little management to make a flaming despatch .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 30]: But I did it -- only listen , now -- I have begun in the true Nelson style : -- '' ` TO THE SECRETARY OF THE ADMIRALTY . ''
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 35]: ` Sir , -- It has pleased the Great Disposer to grant a decided victory to his Majesty 's arms , through the efforts of the vessel which I have the honour to command .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 55]: On the 23rd day of August last , Ushant then bearing South West three quarters West , wind West , distant from three to four leagues , perceived an enemy 's fleet , of three-masted vessels , rounding the point , with the hopes , I presume , of gaining the port of Cherbourg .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 74]: Convinced that I should have every support from the gallant officers and true British tars under my command , I immediately bore down to the attack ; the movements of the enemy fully proved that they were astounded at the boldness of the manoeuvre , and instead of keeping their line , they soon separated , and sheered off in different directions , so as to receive the support of their batteries . '
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 30]: `` You see , Joey , I have said three-masted vessels , which implies ships , although as in this case , they were only small coasting luggers . ''
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 38]: ` In half an hour we were sufficiently close to the main body to open our fire , and broadside after broadside were poured in , answered by the batteries on the coast , with unerring aim .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 77]: Notwithstanding the unequal contest , I have the pleasure of informing you , that in less than half an hour we succeeded in capturing three of the vessels -LRB- named as per margin -RRB- , and finding nothing more could be done for the honour of his Majesty 's arms , as soon we could take possession , I considered it my duty to haul off from the incessant and galling fire of the batteries . ''
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 19]: ` In this well-fought and successful contest , I trust that the British flag has not been tarnished .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 28]: What the enemy 's loss may have been it is impossible to say ; they acknowledge themselves , however , that it has been severe . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 10]: `` But did the enemy lose any men ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 3]: demanded Joey .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 31]: `` Not one ; but you observe I do not say loss of life , although the Admiralty may think I refer to it -- that 's not my fault .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 47]: But I was perfectly correct in saying the enemy 's loss was great ; for the poor devils who were in the chasse-marees , when they were brought on board , wrung their hands , and said , that they had _ lost their all _ .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 13]: Now , what loss can be greater than _ all _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 89]: ` His Majesty 's vessel is much injured in her spars and rigging from the precision of the enemy 's fire ; her lower rigging -- running rigging being cut away , her foremast severely wounded , and , I regret to add , severely injured in the hull ; but such was the activity of the officers and men , that with the exception of the foremast , which will require the services of the dockyard , in twenty-four hours we were ready to resume the contest .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 47]: I am happy to say , that although we have many men hurt , we have none killed ; and I trust that , under the care of the surgeon they will , most of them , be soon able to resume their duty . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 9]: `` But you had no men wounded ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 3]: interrupted Joey .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 4]: `` None wounded !
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 11]: I do n't say wounded , I only say hurt .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 27]: Did n't a dozen of the men , who were hoisting the main-topsail when the fall was cut away , all tumble backwards on the deck ?
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 12]: And do you think they were not hurt by the fall ?
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 34]: -- of course they were ; besides , one man nearly had his finger jammed off , and another burnt his hand by putting too much powder to the touch-hole of his carronade .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 69]: So I continue : -- '' ` It now becomes my duty to point out to their Lordships the very meritorious conduct of Mr John Smith , an old and deserving officer , Mr James Hammond , Mr Cross , and Mr Byfleet ; indeed , I may say that all the officers under my command vied in their exertions for the honour of the British flag . '
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 22]: `` You see the commander had quarrelled with some of his officers at that time , and would not mention them .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 15]: I tried all I could to persuade him , but he was obstinate . ''
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 38]: ` I have the honour to return a list of casualties , and the names of the vessels taken , and have the honour to be , Sir , your obedient servant , ALCIBIADES AJAX BOGGS . ''
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 67]: ` Report of killed and wounded on board of his Majesty 's brig _ Weasel _ , in the action of the 23rd of August : -- Killed , none ; wounds and contusions , John Potts , William Smith , Thomas Snaggs , William Walker , and Peter Potter , able seamen ; John Hobbs , Timothy Stout , and Walter Pye , marines . ''
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 46]: ` Return of vessels captured in the action of the 23rd of August , by his Majesty 's brig _ Weasel _ : -- Notre Dame de Misericorde , de Rochelle ; La Vengeur , de Bourdeaux ; L'Etoile du Matin , de Charent . ''
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 10]: ` Signed ALCIBIADES AJAX BOGGS , Commander . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 28]: `` Well , I 'm sure , if you had not told me otherwise , I should have thought it had been a very hard fight . ''
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 43]: `` That 's what they did at the Admiralty , and just what we wanted ; but now I come to my other despatch , which obtained the rank for my captain ; and upon which I plume myself not a little .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 32]: You must know , that when cruising in the Channel , in a thick fog , and not keeping a very sharp look-out , we ran foul of a French privateer .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 33]: It was about nine o'clock in the evening , and we had very few hands on deck , and those on deck were most of them , if not all , asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 55]: We came bang against one another , and carried away both spars and yards ; and the privateer , who was by far the most alert after the accident happened , cut away a good deal of our rigging , and got clear of us before our men could be got up from below .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 43]: Had they been on the look out , they might have boarded us to a certainty , for all was confusion and amazement ; but they cleared themselves and got off before our men could get up and run to their guns .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 38]: She was out of sight immediately , from the thickness of the fog ; however , we fired several broadsides in the direction we supposed she might be ; and there was an end to the matter .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 15]: Altogether , as you perceive , it was not a very creditable affair . ''
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 24]: `` Why , no , '' replied Joey ; `` I do n't see how you could make much out of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 25]: `` Well , if you ca n't see , now you shall hear : -- '' ` TO THE SECRETARY OF THE ADMIRALTY . ''
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 50]: ` Sir , -- I have the honour to acquaint you that , on the night of the 10th of November , cruising in the Channel , with the wind from South East , and foggy , a large vessel hove in sight , on our weather bow . '
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 22]: `` You see , I did n't say we perceived a vessel , for that would not have been correct . ''
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 43]: ` As she evidently did not perceive us , we continued our course towards her ; the men were summoned to their quarters , and , in a very short time , were ready to uphold the honour of the English flag .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 27]: The first collision between the two vessels was dreadful ; but she contrived to disengage herself , and we were therefore prevented carrying her by boarding .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 108]: After repeated broadsides , to which , in her disabled and confused state , she could make no return , she gradually increased her distance ; still , she had remained in our hands , a proud trophy -- I say , still she had been a proud trophy -- had not the unequal collision ' -- -LSB- it was a very unequal collision , for she was a much smaller vessel than we were -RSB- -- ` carried away our foreyard , cat-head , fore-top-gallant mast , jibboom , and dolphin-striker , and rendered us , from the state of our rigging , a mere wreck .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 46]: Favoured by the thick fog and darkness of the night , I regret that , after all our efforts , she contrived to escape , and the spoils of victory were wrested from us after all our strenuous exertions in our country 's cause . ''
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 89]: ` When all performed their duty in so exemplary a manner , it would be unfair , and , indeed , invidious , to particularise , still , I can not refrain from mentioning the good conduct of Mr Smith , my first lieutenant ; Mr Bowles , my second lieutenant ; Mr Chabb , my worthy master ; Mr Jones and Mr James , master 's mates ; Messrs. Hall , Small , Ball , and Pall , midshipmen ; and Messrs. Sweet and Sharp , volunteers .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 30]: I also received every assistance from Mr Grulf , the purser , who offered his services , and I can not omit the conduct of Mr Spikeman , clerk .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 35]: I am also highly indebted to the attention and care shown by Mr Thorn , surgeon , who is so well supported in his duties by Mr Green , assistant-surgeon , of this ship .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 45]: The activity of Mr Bruce , the boatswain , was deserving of the highest encomiums ; and it would be an act of injustice not to notice the zeal of Mr Bile , the carpenter , and Mr Sponge , gunner of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 34]: James Anderson , quarter-master , received a severe contusion , but is now doing well ; I trust I shall not be considered presumptuous in recommending him to a boatswain 's warrant . ''
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 23]: ` I am happy to say that our casualties , owing to the extreme panic of the enemy , are very few .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 21]: I have the honour to be , Sir , your very obedient and humble servant , ALCIBIADES AJAX BOGGS . ''
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 11]: ` Wounded -- Very severely , James Anderson , quarter-master .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 21]: Contusions -- John Peters , able seaman ; James Morrison , marine ; Thomas Snowball , captain 's cook . '
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 29]: `` There , now ; that I consider a very capital letter ; no Frenchman , not even an American , could have made out a better case .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 40]: The Admiralty were satisfied that something very gallant had been done , although the fog made it appear not quite so clear as it might have been ; and the consequence was , that my commander received his promotion .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 46]: There , now , write your letter , and tell your sister that she must answer it as soon as possible , as you are going out with me for orders in three or four days , and shall be absent for three months . ''
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 79]: Joey wrote a long letter to Mary ; he stated the adventure with the two scoundrels who would have robbed him , his afterwards falling in with a gentleman who dealt in cutlery , and his being taken into his service ; and , as Spikeman had told him , requested her to answer directly , as he was about to set off on a circuit with his master , which would occasion his absence for three months .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 9]: Mary 's reply came before Joey 's departure .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 41]: She stated that she was comfortable and happy , that her mistress was very kind to her , but that she felt that the work was rather too much ; however , she would do her duty to her employers .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 77]: There was much good advice to Joey , much affectionate feeling , occasional recurrence to past scenes , and thankfulness that she was no longer a disgrace to her parents and her sex ; it was a humble , grateful , contrite , and affectionate effusion , which did honour to poor Mary , and proved that she was sincere in her assertions of continuing in the right path , and dotingly attached to our hero .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 22]: Joey read it over and over again , and shed tears of pleasure as he recalled the scenes which had passed .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 61]: Poor Joey had lost his father and mother , as he supposed , for ever ; and it was soothing to the boy 's feelings to know that there were some people in the world who loved him ; and he remained for hours thinking of Mary , Mrs Chopper , and his good and kind friends , the McShanes .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 37]: Two days after the receipt of Mary 's letter , Spikeman and Joey went to the houses of their various acquaintances , and bade them adieu , announcing their intention to set off on the circuit .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 21]: Spikeman paid up everything , and put away many articles in his room which had been taken out for use .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 38]: Joey and he then put on their travelling garments , and , waiting till it was dusk , locked the chambers and set off to the little public-house , where the knife-grinder 's wheel had been deposited .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 24]: Spikeman had taken the precaution to smudge and dirty his face , and Joey , at his request , had done the same .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 21]: When they entered the public-house , the landlord greeted Spikeman warmly , and asked him what he had been about .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 26]: Spikeman replied that , as usual , he had been to see his old mother , and now he must roll his grindstone a bit .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 32]: After drinking a pot of beer at the kitchen fire , they retired to bed ; and the next morning , at daylight , they once more proceeded on their travels .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY NINE .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 14]: IN WHICH THE TINKER FALLS IN LOVE WITH A LADY OF HIGH DEGREE .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 69]: For many months Spikeman and our hero travelled together , during which time Joey had learnt to grind a knife or a pair of scissors as well as Spikeman himself , and took most of the work off his hands ; they suited each other , and passed their time most pleasantly , indulging themselves every day with a few hours ' repose and reading on the wayside .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 100]: One afternoon , when it was very sultry , they had stopped and ensconced themselves in a shady copse by the side of the road , not far from an old mansion , which stood on an eminence , when Spikeman said , `` Joey , I think we are intruding here ; and , if so , may be forcibly expelled , which will not be pleasant ; so roll the wheel in , out of sight , and then we may indulge in a siesta , which , during this heat , will be very agreeable . ''
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 7]: `` What 's a siesta ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 3]: said Joey .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 60]: `` A siesta is a nap in the middle of the day , universally resorted to by the Spaniards , Italians , and , indeed , by all the inhabitants of hot climates ; with respectable people it is called a siesta , but with a travelling tinker it must be , I suppose , called a snooze . ''
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 29]: `` Well , then , a snooze let it be , '' said Joey , taking his seat on the turf by Spikeman , in a reclining position .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 21]: They had not yet composed themselves to sleep , when they heard a female voice singing at a little distance .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 15]: The voice evidently proceeded from the pleasure-grounds which were between them and the mansion .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 4]: `` Hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 16]: said Spikeman , putting up his finger , as he raised himself on his elbow .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 42]: The party evidently advanced nearer to them , and carolled in very beautiful tones , the song of Ariel : -- `` Where the bee sucks , there lurk I , In the cowslip 's bell I lie , '' etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 4]: `` Heigho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 22]: exclaimed a soft voice , after the song had been finished ; `` I wish I could creep into a cowslip-bell .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 29]: Miss Araminta , you are not coming down the walk yet ; it appears you are in no hurry , so I 'll begin my new book . ''
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 7]: After this soliloquy there was silence .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 37]: Spikeman made a sign to Joey to remain still , and then , creeping on his hands and knees , by degrees arrived as far as he could venture to the other side of the copse .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 20]: In a minute or two another footstep was heard coming down the gravel-walk , and soon afterwards another voice .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 13]: `` Well , Melissa , did you think I never would come ?
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 6]: I could not help it .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 11]: Uncle would have me rub his foot a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 15]: `` Ay , there 's the rub , '' replied the first young lady .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 15]: `` Well , it was a sacrifice of friendship at the altar of humanity .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 3]: Poor papa !
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 30]: I wish I could rub his foot for him ; but I always do it to a quadrille tune , and he always says I rub it too hard .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 7]: I only follow the music . ''
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 21]: `` Yes , and so does he ; for you sometimes set him a dancing , you giddy girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 17]: `` I am not fit for a nurse , and that 's the fact , Araminta .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 19]: I can feel for him , but I can not sit still a minute ; that you know .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 35]: Poor mamma was a great loss ; and , when she died , I do n't know what I should have done , if it had n't been for my dear cousin Araminta . ''
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 25]: `` Nay , you are very useful in your way , for you play and sing to him , and that soothes him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 30]: `` Yes , I do it with pleasure , for I can do but little else ; but , Araminta , my singing is that of the caged bird .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 9]: I must sing where they hang my cage .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 12]: Oh , how I wish I had been a man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 37]: `` I believe that there never was a woman yet who has not , at one time of her life , said the same thing , however mild and quiet she may have been in disposition .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 33]: But , as we can not , why -- '' `` Why , the next thing is to wish to be a man 's wife , Araminta -- is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 24]: `` It is natural , I suppose , to wish so , '' replied Araminta ; `` but I seldom think about it .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 16]: I must first see the man I can love before I think about marrying . ''
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 21]: `` And now tell me , Araminta , what kind of a man do you think you could fancy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 30]: `` I should like him to be steady , generous , brave , and handsome ; of unexceptionable family , with plenty of money ; that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 7]: `` Oh , that 's all !
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 9]: I admire your ` that 's all . '
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 15]: You are not very likely to meet with your match , I 'm afraid .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 45]: If he 's steady , he is not very likely to be very generous ; and if to those two qualifications you tack on birth , wealth , beauty , and bravery , I think your ` that 's all ' is very misplaced .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 8]: Now , I have other ideas . ''
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 10]: `` Pray let me have them , Melissa . ''
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 41]: `` I do not want my husband to be very handsome ; but I wish him to be full of fire and energy -- a man that -- in fact , a man that could keep me in tolerable order .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 67]: I do not care about his having money , as I have plenty in my own possession to bestow on any man I love ; but he must be of good education -- very fond of reading -- romantic , not a little ; and his extraction must be , however poor , respectable , -- that is , his parents must not have been tradespeople .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 35]: You know I prefer riding a spirited horse to a quiet one ; and , if I were to marry , I should like a husband who would give me some trouble to manage .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 8]: I think I would master him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 17]: `` So have many thought before you , Melissa ; but they have been mistaken . ''
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 20]: `` Yes , because they have attempted it by meekness and submission , thinking to disarm by that method .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 13]: It never will do , any more than getting into a passion .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 36]: When a man gives up his liberty , he does make a great sacrifice -- that I 'm sure of ; and a woman should prevent him feeling that he is chained to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 9]: `` And how would you manage that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 3]: said Araminta .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 59]: `` By being infinite in my variety , always cheerful , and instead of permitting him to stay at home , pinned to my apron-string , order him out away from me , join his amusements , and always have people in the house that he liked , so as to avoid being too much _ tete-a-tete _ .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 29]: The caged bird ever wants to escape ; open the doors , and let him take a flight , and he will come back of his own accord .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 15]: Of course , I am supposing my gentleman to be naturally good-hearted and good-tempered .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 23]: Sooner than marry what you call a steady , sober man , I 'd run away with a captain of a privateer .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 35]: And , one thing more , Araminta , I never would , passionately , distractedly fond as I might be , acknowledge to my husband the extent of my devotion and affection for him .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 55]: I would always have him to suppose that I could still love him better than what I yet did -- in short , that there was more to be gained ; for , depend upon it , when a man is assured that he has nothing more to gain , his attentions are over .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 14]: You ca n't expect a man to chase nothing , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 9]: `` You are a wild girl , Melissa .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 9]: I only hope you will marry well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 36]: `` I hope I shall ; but I can tell you this , that if I do make a mistake , at all events my husband will find that he has made a mistake also .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 32]: There 's a little lurking devil in me , which , if roused up by bad treatment , would , I expect , make me more than a match for him .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 43]: I 'm almost sorry that I 've so much money of my own , for I suspect every man who says anything pretty to me ; and there are but few in this world who would scorn to marry for money . ''
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 18]: `` I believe so , Melissa ; but your person would be quite sufficient without fortune . ''
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 15]: `` Thanks , coz ; for a woman that 's very handsome of you .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 11]: And so now we will begin our new book . ''
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 42]: Miss Melissa now commenced reading ; and Spikeman , who had not yet seen the faces of the two young ladies , crept softly nearer to the side of the copse , so as to enable him to satisfy his curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 31]: In this position he remained nearly an hour ; when the book was closed , and the young ladies returned to the house , Melissa again singing as she went .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 75]: `` Joey , '' said Spikeman , `` I did not think that there was such a woman in existence as that girl ; she is just the idea that I have formed of what a woman ought to be ; I must find out who she is ; I am in love with her , and -- '' `` Mean to make her a tinker 's bride , '' replied Joey , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 18]: `` Joey , I shall certainly knock you down , if you apply that term to her .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 16]: Come let us go to the village , -- it is close at hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 15]: As soon as they arrived at the village , Spikeman went into the alehouse .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 21]: During the remainder of the day he was in a brown study , and Joey amused himself with a book .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 21]: At nine o'clock the company had all quitted the tap-room , and then Spikeman entered into conversation with the hostess .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 133]: In the course of conversation , she informed him that the mansion belonged to Squire Mathews , who had formerly been a great manufacturer , and who had purchased the place ; that the old gentleman had long suffered from the gout , and saw no company , which was very bad for the village ; that Miss Melissa was his daughter , and he had a son , who was with his regiment in India , and , it was said , not on very good terms with his father ; that the old gentleman was violent and choleric because he was always in pain ; but that every one spoke well of Miss Melissa and Miss Araminta , her cousin , who were both very kind to the poor people .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 47]: Having obtained these particulars , Spikeman went to bed : he slept little that night , as Joey , who was his bedfellow , could vouch for ; for he allowed Joey no sleep either , turning and twisting round in the bed every two minutes .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 13]: The next morning they arose early , and proceeded on their way .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 24]: `` Joey , '' said Spikeman , after an hour 's silence , `` I was thinking a great deal last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 13]: `` So I suppose , for you certainly were not sleeping . ''
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 50]: `` No , I could not sleep ; the fact is , Joey , I am determined to have that girl , Miss Mathews , if I can ; a bold attempt for a tinker , you will say , but not for a gentleman born as I was .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 21]: I thought I never should care for a woman ; but there is a current in the affairs of men .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 30]: I shall now drift with the current , and if it leads to fortune , so much the better ; if not , he who dares greatly does greatly .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 27]: I feel convinced that I should make her a good husband , and it shall not be my fault if I do not gain her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 16]: `` Do you mean to propose in form with your foot on your wheel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 34]: `` No , saucebox , I do n't ; but I mean to turn my knife-grinder 's wheel into a wheel of fortune ; and with your help I will do so . ''
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 29]: `` You are sure of my help if you are serious , '' replied Joey ; `` but how you are to manage I can not comprehend . ''
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 42]: `` I have already made out a programme , although the interweaving of the plot is not yet decided upon ; but I must get to the next town as fast as I can , as I must make preparations . ''
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 36]: On arrival , they took up humble quarters , as usual ; and then Spikeman went to a stationer 's , and told them that he had got a commission to execute for a lady .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 93]: He bought sealing-wax , a glass seal , with `` Esperance '' as a motto , gilt-edged notepaper , and several other requisites in the stationery line , and ordered them to be packed up carefully , that he might not soil them ; he then purchased scented soap , a hair-brush , and other articles for the toilet ; and having obtained all these requisites , he added to them one or two pair of common beaver gloves , and then went to the barber 's to get his hair cut .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 29]: `` I am all ready now , Joey , '' said he , when he returned to the alehouse ; `` and to-morrow we retrace our steps . ''
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 6]: back to the village ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 14]: `` Yes ; and where we shall remain some time , perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 26]: On reaching the village next morning , Spikeman hired a bedroom , and , leaving Joey to work the grindstone , remained in his apartments .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 46]: When Joey returned in the evening , he found Spikeman had been very busy with the soap , and had restored his hands to something like their proper colour ; he had also shaved himself , and washed his hair clean and brushed it well .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 41]: `` You see , Joey , I have commenced operations already ; I shall soon be prepared to act the part of the gentleman who has turned tinker to gain the love of a fair lady of high degree . ''
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 13]: `` I wish you success : but what are your plans ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 17]: `` That you will find out to-morrow morning ; now we must go to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 3]: CHAPTER THIRTY .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 6]: PLOTTING , READING AND WRITING .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 8]: Spikeman was up early the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 20]: When they had breakfasted , he desired Joey to go for the knife-grinder 's wheel , and follow him .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 53]: As soon as they were clear of the village , Spikeman said , `` It will not do to remain at the village ; there 's a cottage half a mile down the road where they once gave me a lodging ; we must try if we can get it now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 60]: When they arrived at the cottage , Spikeman made a very satisfactory bargain for board and lodging for a few days , stating that they charged so much at the village alehouse that he could not afford to stay there , and that he expected to have a good job at Squire Mathews 's , up at the mansion-house .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 26]: As soon as this arrangement was completed , they returned back to the copse near to the mansion-house , Joey rolling the knife-grinder 's wheel .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 47]: `` You see , Joey , '' said Spikeman , `` the first thing necessary will be to stimulate curiosity ; we may have to wait a day or two before the opportunity may occur ; but , if necessary , I will wait a month .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 36]: That Miss Mathews will very often be found on the seat by the copse , either alone or with her cousin , I take to be certain , as all ladies have their favourite retreats .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 18]: I do not intend that they should see me yet ; I must make an impression first .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 19]: Now , leave the wheel on the outside , and come with me : do not speak . ''
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 38]: As soon as they were in the copse , Spikeman reconnoitred very carefully , to ascertain if either of the young ladies were on the bench , and finding no one there , he returned to Joey .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 25]: `` They can not come without our hearing their footsteps , '' said Spikeman ; `` so now we must wait here patiently . ''
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 19]: Spikeman threw himself down on the turf in front of the copse , and Joey followed his example .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 29]: `` Come , Joey , we may as well read a little to pass away the time ; I have brought two volumes of Byron with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 27]: For half an hour they were thus occupied , when they heard the voice of Miss Mathews singing as before as she came down the walk .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 8]: Spikeman rose and peeped through the foliage .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 17]: `` She is alone , '' said he , `` which is just what I wished .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 14]: Now , Joey , I am going to read to you aloud . ''
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 121]: Spikeman then began to read in the masterly style which we have before referred to : -- '' ` I loved , and was beloved again ; They tell me , Sir , you never knew Those gentle frailties ; if 't is true I shorten all my joys and pain , To you ` twould seem absurd as vain ; But all now are not born to reign , Or o'er their passions , or as you There , o'er themselves and nations too , I am , or rather was , a Prince , A chief of thousands , and could lead Them on when each would foremost bleed , But would not o'er myself The like control .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 29]: But to resume : I loved , and was beloved again ; In sooth it is a happy doom -- But yet where happiness ends in pain . '
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 42]: `` I am afraid that is but too true , my dear boy , '' said Spikeman , laying down the book ; `` Shakespeare has most truly said , ` The course of true love never did run smooth . '
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 95]: Nay , he can not be said to be original in that idea , for Horace and most of the Greek and Latin poets have said much the same thing before him ; however , let us go on again -- '' ` We met in secret , and the hour Which led me to my lady 's bower Was fiery expectation 's dower ; The days and nights were nothing -- all Except the hour which doth recall , In the long lapse from youth to age , No other like itself . '
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 12]: `` Do you observe the extreme beauty of that passage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 3]: said Spikeman .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 14]: `` Yes , '' said Joey , `` it is very beautiful . ''
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 59]: `` You would more feel the power of it , my dear boy , if you were in love , but your time is not yet come ; but I am afraid we must leave off now , for I expect letters of consequence by the post , and it is useless , I fear , waiting here .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 20]: Come , put the book by , and let us take up the wheel of my sad fortunes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 8]: Spikeman and Joey rose on their feet .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 68]: Joey went to the knife-grinder 's wheel , and Spikeman followed him without looking back ; he heard a rustling , nevertheless , among the bushes , which announced to him that his manoeuvres had succeeded ; and , as soon as he was about fifty yards from the road , he took the wheel from Joey , desiring him to look back , as if accidentally .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 14]: Joey did so , and saw Miss Mathews following them with her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 23]: `` That will do , '' observed Spikeman ; `` her curiosity is excited , and that is all I wish . ''
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 6]: What Spikeman said was correct .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 13]: Araminta joined Miss Mathews shortly after Spikeman and Joey had gone away .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 21]: `` My dear Araminta , '' said Melissa , `` such an adventure I can hardly credit my senses . ''
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 12]: `` Why , what is the matter , dear cousin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 21]: `` Do you see that man and boy , with a knife-grinder 's wheel , just in sight now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 14]: `` Yes , to be sure I do ; but what of them ?
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 6]: Have they been insolent ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 3]: `` Insolent !
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 14]: they never saw me ; they had no idea that I was here .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 44]: I heard voices as I came down the walk , so I moved softly , and when I gained the seat , there was somebody reading poetry so beautifully ; I never heard any one read with such correct emphasis and clear pronunciation .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 21]: And then he stopped , and talked to the boy about the Greek and Latin poets , and quoted Shakespeare .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 7]: There must be some mystery . ''
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 19]: `` Well , but if there is , what has that to do with the travelling tinkers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 39]: why it was the travelling tinker himself ; dearest ; but he can not be a tinker ; for I heard him say that he expected letters of consequence , and no travelling tinker could do that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 17]: `` Why , no ; I doubt if most of them can read at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 17]: `` Now , I would give my little finger to know who that person is . ''
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 8]: `` Did you see his face ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 19]: `` No ; he never turned this way ; the boy did when they were some distance off .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 6]: It 's very strange . ''
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 7]: `` What was he reading ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 11]: `` I do n't know ; it was very beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 11]: I wonder if he will ever come this way again ?
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 16]: If he does -- '' `` Well , Melissa , and if he does ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 16]: `` My scissors want grinding very badly ; they wo n't cut a bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 18]: `` Why , Melissa , you do n't mean to fall in love with a tinker ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 5]: said Araminta , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 16]: `` He is no tinker , I 'm sure ; but why is he disguised ?
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 7]: I should like to know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 16]: `` Well , but I came out to tell you that your father wants you .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 4]: Come along . ''
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 29]: The two young ladies then returned to the house , but the mystery of the morning was broached more than once , and canvassed in every possible way .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 22]: Spikeman , as soon as he had returned to the cottage , took out his writing materials to concoct an epistle .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 20]: After some time in correcting , he made out a fair copy , which he read to Joey . ''
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 46]: ` I tremble lest at the first moment you cast your eyes over the page , you throw it away without deigning to peruse it ; and yet there is nothing in it which could raise a blush on the cheek of a modest maiden .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 63]: If it be a crime to have seen you by chance , to have watched you by stealth , to consider hallowed every spot you visit -- nay , more , if it be a crime to worship at the shrine of beauty and of innocence , or , to speak more boldly , to adore you -- then am I guilty .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 12]: You will ask , why I resort to a clandestine step .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 43]: Simply , because , when I discovered your name and birth , I felt assured that an ancient feud between the two families , to which nor you nor I were parties , would bar an introduction to your father 's house .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 8]: You would ask me who I am .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 43]: A gentleman , I trust , by birth and education ; a poor one , I grant ; and you have made me poorer , for you have robbed me of more than wealth -- my peace of mind and my happiness .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 13]: I feel that I am presumptuous and bold ; but forgive me .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 43]: Your eyes tell me you are too kind , too good , to give unnecessary pain ; and if you knew how much I have already suffered , you would not oppress further a man who was happy until he saw you .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 23]: Pardon me , therefore , my boldness , and excuse the means I have taken of placing this communication before you . '
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 36]: `` That will do , I think , '' said Spikeman ; `` and now , Joey , we will go out and take a walk , and I will give you your directions . ''
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 6]: IN WHICH THE PLOT THICKENS .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 27]: The next day our hero , having received the letter with his instructions , went with the wheel down to the copse near to the mansion-house .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 44]: Here he remained quietly until he heard Miss Melissa coming down the gravel-walk ; he waited till she had time to gain her seat , and then , leaving his wheel outside , he walked round the copse until he came to her .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 12]: She raised her eyes from her book when she saw him .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 19]: `` If you please , miss , have you any scissors or knives for me to grind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 11]: said Joey , bowing with his hat in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 7]: Miss Mathews looked earnestly at Joey .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 6]: `` Who are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 25]: said she at last ; `` are you the boy who was on this road with a knife-grinder and his wheel yesterday afternoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 19]: `` Yes , madam , we came this way , '' replied Joey , bowing again very politely .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 7]: `` Is he your father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 16]: `` No , madam , he is my uncle ; he is not married . ''
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 4]: `` Your uncle .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 36]: Well , I have a pair of scissors to grind , and I will go for them : you may bring your wheel in here , as I wish to see how you grind . ''
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 11]: `` Certainly , miss , with the greatest pleasure . ''
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 50]: Joey brought in his wheel , and observing that Miss Mathews had left her book on the seat , he opened it at the marked page and slipped the letter in ; and scarcely had done so , when he perceived Miss Mathews and her cousin coming towards him .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 14]: `` Here are the scissors ; mind you make them cut well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 19]: `` I will do my best , miss , '' replied Joey , who immediately set to work .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 10]: `` Have you been long at this trade ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 4]: said Miss Mathews .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 10]: `` No , miss , not very long . ''
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 13]: `` And your uncle , has he been long at it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 5]: Joey hesitated on purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 13]: `` Why , I really do n't know exactly how long . ''
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 10]: `` Why is your uncle not with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 26]: `` He was obliged to go to town , miss -- that is , to a town at some distance from here on business . ''
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 11]: `` Why , what business can a tinker have ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 3]: inquired Araminta .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 18]: `` I suppose he wanted some soft solder , miss ; he requires a great deal . ''
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 10]: `` Can you read and write , boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 3]: inquired Melissa .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 5]: `` Me , miss !
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 11]: how should I know how to write and read ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 6]: replied Joey , looking up .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 9]: `` Have you been much about here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 23]: `` Yes , miss , a good deal ; uncle seems to like this part ; we never were so long before .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 15]: The scissors are done now , miss , and they will cut very well .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 17]: Uncle was in hopes of getting some work at the mansion-house when he came back . ''
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 9]: `` Can your uncle write and read ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 11]: `` I believe he can a little , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 11]: `` What do I owe you for the scissors ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 19]: `` Nothing , miss , if you please ; I had rather not take anything from you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 8]: `` And why not from me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 12]: `` Because I never worked for so pretty a lady before .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 20]: Wish you good morning , ladies , '' said Joey , taking up his wheel and rolling it away .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 11]: `` Well , Araminta , what do you think now ?
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 21]: That 's no knife-grinder 's boy ; he is as well-bred and polite as any lad I ever saw . ''
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 23]: `` I suspect that he is a little story-teller , saying that he could not write and read , '' Araminta replied .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 18]: `` And so do I ; what made him in such a hurry to go away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 10]: `` I suppose he did not like our questions .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 8]: I wonder whether the uncle will come .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 36]: Well , Melissa , I must not quit your father just now , so I must leave you with your book , '' and , so saying , Araminta took her way to the house .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 28]: Miss Mathews was in a reverie for some minutes ; Joey 's behaviour had puzzled her almost as much as what she had overheard the day before .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 18]: At last she opened the book , and , to her great astonishment , beheld the letter .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 13]: She started -- looked at it -- it was addressed to her .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 10]: She demurred at first whether she should open it .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 34]: It must have been put there by the tinker 's boy -- it was evidently no tinker 's letter ; it must be a love-letter , and she ought not to read it .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 48]: There was something , however , so very charming in the whole romance of the affair , if it should turn out , as she suspected , that the tinker should prove a gentleman who had fallen in love with her , and had assumed the disguise .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 11]: Melissa wanted an excuse to herself for opening the letter .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 28]: At last she said to herself , `` Who knows but what it may be a petition from some poor person or other who is in distress ?
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 11]: I ought to read it , at all events . ''
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 16]: Had it proved to be a petition , Miss Melissa would have been terribly disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 31]: `` It certainly is very respectful , '' thought Melissa , after she had read it , `` but I can not reply to it ; that would never do .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 10]: There certainly is nothing I can take offence at .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 21]: It must be the tinker himself , I am sure of that : but still he does not say so .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 20]: Well , I do n't know , but I feel very anxious as to what this will come to .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 36]: O , it can come to nothing , for I can not love a man I have never seen , and I would not admit a stranger to an interview ; that 's quite decided .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 8]: I must show the letter to Araminta .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 3]: Shall I ?
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 74]: I do n't know , she 's so particular , so steady , and would be talking of propriety and prudence ; it would vex her so , and put her quite in a fever , she would be so unhappy ; no , it would be cruel to say anything to her , she would fret so about it ; I wo n't tell her , until I think it absolutely necessary .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 28]: It is a very gentleman-like hand , and elegant language too ; but still I 'm not going to carry on a secret correspondence with a tinker .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 6]: It must be the tinker .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 6]: What an odd thing altogether !
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 6]: What can his name be ?
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 7]: An old family quarrel , too .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 16]: Why , it 's a Romeo and Juliet affair , only Romeo 's a tinker .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 10]: Well , one mask is as good as another .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 19]: He acknowledges himself poor , I like that of him , there 's something so honest in it .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 70]: Well , after all , it will be a little amusement to a poor girl like me , shut up from year 's end to year 's end , with opodeldocs always in my nose ; so I will see what the end of it may be , '' thought Melissa , rising from her seat to go into the house , and putting the letter into her pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 9]: Joey went back to Spikeman and reported progress .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 49]: `` That 's all I wish , Joey , '' said Spikeman ; `` now you must not go there to-morrow ; we must let it work a little ; if she is at all interested in the letter , she will be impatient to know more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 4]: Spikeman was right .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 22]: Melissa looked up and down the road very often during the next day , and was rather silent during the evening .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 25]: The second day after , Joey , having received his instructions , set off , with his knife-grinder 's wheel , for the mansion-house .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 17]: When he went round the copse where the bench was , he found Miss Mathews there .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 21]: `` I beg your pardon , miss , but do you think there is any work at the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 16]: `` Come here , sir , '' said Melissa , assuming a very dignified air .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 14]: `` Yes , miss , '' said Joey , walking slowly to her .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 17]: `` Now , tell me the truth , and I will reward you with half-a-crown . ''
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 6]: `` Yes , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 16]: `` Did you not put this letter in my book the day before yesterday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 5]: `` Letter , miss !
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 4]: what letter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 37]: `` Do n't you deny it , for you know you did ; and if you do n't tell me the truth , my father is a magistrate , and I 'll have you punished . ''
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 17]: `` I was told not to tell , '' replied Joey , pretending to be frightened .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 14]: `` But you must tell ; yes , and tell me immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 11]: `` I hope you are not angry , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 11]: `` No , not if you tell the truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 19]: `` I do n't exactly know , miss , but a gentleman -- '' `` What gentleman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 11]: `` A gentleman that came to uncle , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 15]: `` A gentleman that came to your uncle ; well , go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 30]: `` I suppose he wrote the letter , but I 'm not sure ; and uncle gave me the letter to put it where you might see it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 29]: `` Oh , then , a gentleman , you say , gave your uncle this letter , and your uncle gave it to you to bring to me .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 5]: Is that it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 26]: `` Uncle gave me the letter , but I dare say uncle will tell you all about it , and who the gentleman was . ''
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 8]: `` Is your uncle come back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 9]: `` He comes back to-night , madam . ''
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 13]: `` You 're sure your uncle did not write the letter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 5]: `` La , miss !
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 21]: uncle write such a letter as that -- and to a lady like you -- that would be odd . ''
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 7]: `` Very odd , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 13]: replied Miss Melissa , who remained a minute or two in thought .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 62]: `` Well , my lad , '' said she at last , `` I must and will know who has had the boldness to write this letter to me ; and as your uncle knows , you will bring him here to-morrow , that I may inquire about it ; and let him take care that he tells the truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 16]: `` Yes , miss ; I will tell him as soon as he comes home .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 33]: I hope you are not angry with me , miss ; I did not think there was any harm in putting into the book such a nice clean letter as that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 26]: `` No , I am not angry with you ; your uncle is more to blame ; I shall expect him to-morrow about this time .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 6]: You may go now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 7]: IN WHICH THE TINKER MAKES LOVE .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 29]: Joey made his obeisance , and departed as if he was frightened , Miss Melissa watched him : at last she thought , `` Tinker or no tinker ?
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 5]: that is the question .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 32]: No tinker , for a cool hundred , as my father would say ; for , no tinker 's boy , no tinker ; and that is no tinker 's boy .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 16]: How clever of him to say that the letter was given him by a gentleman !
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 42]: Now I can send to him to interrogate him , and have an interview without any offence to my feelings ; and if he is disguised , as I feel confident that he is , I shall soon discover it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 31]: Miss Melissa Mathews did not sleep that night ; and at the time appointed she was sitting on the bench , with all the assumed dignity of a newly-made magistrate .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 12]: Spikeman and Joey were not long before they made their appearance .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 53]: Spikeman was particularly clean and neat , although he took care to wear the outward appearance of a tinker ; his hands were , by continual washing in hot water , very white , and he had paid every attention to his person , except in wearing his rough and sullied clothes .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 28]: `` My boy tells me , miss , that you wish to speak to me , '' said Spikeman , assuming the air of a vulgar man .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 52]: `` I did , friend , '' said Melissa , after looking at Spikeman for a few minutes ; `` a letter has been brought here clandestinely , and your boy confesses that he received it from you ; now , I wish to know how you came by it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 36]: `` Boy , go away to a distance , '' said Spikeman , very angrily ; `` if you ca n't keep one secret , at all events you shall not hear any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 10]: Joey retreated , as had been arranged between them .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 35]: `` Well , madam , or miss -LRB- I suppose miss -RRB- , '' said Spikeman , `` that letter was written by a gentleman that loves the very ground you tread upon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 12]: `` And he requested it to be delivered to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 34]: `` He did , miss ; and if you knew , as I do , how he loves you , you would not be surprised at his taking so bold a step . ''
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 23]: `` I am surprised at your taking so bold a step , tinker , as to send it by your boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 47]: `` It was a long while before I would venture , miss ; but when he had told me what he did , I really could not help doing so ; for I pitied him , and so would you , if you knew all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 10]: `` And pray what did he tell you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 93]: `` He told me , miss , '' said Spikeman , who had gradually assumed his own manner of speaking , `` that he had ever rejected the thoughts of matrimony -- that he rose up every morning thanking Heaven that he was free and independent -- that he had scorned the idea of ever being captivated with the charms of a woman ; but that one day he had by chance passed down this road , and had heard you singing as you were coming down to repose on this bench .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 126]: Captivated by your voice , curiosity induced him to conceal himself in the copse behind us , and from thence he had a view of your person : nay , miss he told me more , that he had played the eaves-dropper , and heard all your conversation , free and unconstrained as it was from the supposition that you were alone ; he heard you express your sentiments and opinions , and finding that there was on this earth what , in his scepticism , he thought never to exist -- youth , beauty , talent , principle , and family , all united in one person -- he had bowed at the shrine , and had become a silent and unseen worshipper . ''
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 4]: Spikeman stopped speaking .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 32]: `` Then it appears that this gentleman , as you style him , has been guilty of the ungentlemanly practice of listening to private conversation -- no very great recommendation . ''
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 17]: `` Such was not his intention at first ; he was seduced to it by you .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 27]: Do not blame him for that -- now that I have seen you , I can not ; but , miss , he told me more .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 57]: He said that he felt that he was unworthy of you , and had not a competence to offer you , even if he could obtain your favour ; that he discovered that there was a cause which prevented his gaining an introduction to your family ; in fact , that he was hopeless and despairing .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 41]: He had hovered near you for a long time , for he could not leave the air you breathed ; and , at last , that he had resolved to set his life upon the die and stake the hazard .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 7]: Could I refuse him , miss ?
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 44]: He is of an old family , but not wealthy ; he is a gentleman by birth and education , and therefore I did not think I was doing so very wrong in giving him the chance , trifling as it might be .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 48]: I beg your pardon , madam , if I have offended ; and any message you may have to deliver to him , harsh as it may be -- nay , even if it should be his death -- it shall be faithfully and truly delivered . ''
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 11]: `` When shall you see him , Master Tinker ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 6]: said Melissa , very gravely .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 16]: `` In a week he will be here , he said , not before . ''
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 18]: `` Considering he is so much in love , he takes his time , '' replied Melissa .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 22]: `` Well , Master Tinker , you may tell him from me , that I 've no answer to give him .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 28]: It is quite ridiculous , as well as highly improper , that I should receive a letter or answer one from a person whom I never saw .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 19]: I admit his letter to be respectful , or I should have sent a much harsher message . ''
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 26]: `` Your commands shall be obeyed , miss ; that is , if you can not be persuaded to see him for one minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 25]: `` Most certainly not ; I see no gentleman who is not received at my father 's house , and properly presented to me .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 38]: It may be the custom among people in your station of life , Master Tinker , but not in mine ; and as for yourself , I recommend you not to attempt to bring another letter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 36]: `` I must request your pardon for my fault , miss ; may I ask , after I have seen the poor young gentleman , am I to report to you what takes place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 21]: `` Yes , if it is to assure me that I shall be no more troubled with his addresses . ''
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 39]: `` You shall be obeyed , miss , '' continued Spikeman ; then , changing his tone and air , he said , `` I beg your pardon , have you any knives or scissors to grind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 23]: `` No , '' replied Melissa , jumping up from her seat , and walking towards the house to conceal her mirth .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 26]: Shortly afterwards she turned round to look if Spikeman was gone ; he had remained near the seat , with his eyes following her footsteps .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 16]: `` I could love that man , '' thought Melissa , as she walked on .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 28]: `` What an eye he has , and what eloquence ; I shall run away with a tinker I do believe ; but it is my destiny .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 11]: Why does he say a week -- a whole week ?
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 9]: But how easy to see through his disguise !
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 10]: He had the stamp of a gentleman upon him .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 11]: Dear me , I wonder how this is to end !
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 16]: I must not tell Araminta yet ; she would be fidgeted out of her wits !
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 5]: How foolish of me !
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 13]: I quite forgot to ask the name of this _ gentleman _ .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 9]: I 'll not forget it next time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 4]: WELL DONE TINKER .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 84]: `` It is beyond my hopes , Joey , '' said Spikeman , as they went back to the cottage ; `` she knows well enough that I was pleading for myself , and not for another , and she has said quite as much as my most sanguine wishes could desire ; in fact , she has given me permission to come again , and report the result of her message to the non-existent gentleman , which is equal to an assignation .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 67]: I have no doubt now I shall ultimately succeed , and I must make my preparations ; I told her that I should not be able to deliver her message for a week , and she did not like the delay , that was clear ; it will all work in my favour ; a week 's expectation will ripen the fruit more than daily meetings .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 25]: I must leave this to-night ; but you may as well stay here , for you can be of no use to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 9]: `` Where are you going , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 38]: `` First to Dudstone , to take my money out of the bank ; I have a good sum , sufficient to carry me on for many months after her marriage , if I do marry her .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 65]: I shall change my dress at Dudstone , of course , and then start for London , by mail , and fit myself out with a most fashionable wardrobe and etceteras , come down again to Cobhurst , the town we were in the other day , with my portmanteau , and from thence return here in my tinker 's clothes to resume operations .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 11]: You must not go near her during my absence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 12]: `` Certainly not ; shall I go out at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 26]: `` No , not with the wheel ; you might meet her on the road , and she would be putting questions to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 24]: That evening Spikeman set off ; and was absent for five days , when he again made his appearance early in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 17]: Joey had remained almost altogether indoors , and had taken that opportunity of writing to Mary .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 32]: He wrote on the day after Spikeman 's departure , as it would give ample time for an answer before his return ; but Joey received no reply to his letter .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 38]: `` I am all prepared now , my boy , '' said Spikeman , whose appearance was considerably improved by the various little personal arrangements which he had gone through during the time he was in London .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 41]: `` I have my money in my pockets , my portmanteau at Cobhurst , and now it depends upon the rapidity of my success when the day is to come that I make the knife-grinder 's wheel over to you .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 13]: I will go down now , but without you this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 83]: Spikeman set off with his wheel , and soon arrived at the usual place of meeting ; Miss Mathews , from the window , had perceived him coming down the road ; she waited a quarter of an hour before she made her appearance ; had not she had her eyes on the hands of the time-piece , and knew that it was only a quarter of an hour , she could have sworn that it had been two hours at least .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 3]: Poor girl !
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 49]: she had , during this week , run over every circumstance connected with the meeting at least a thousand times ; every word that had been exchanged had been engraven on her memory , and , without her knowledge almost , her heart had imperceptibly received the impression .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 17]: She walked down , reading her book very attentively , until she arrived at the bench .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 11]: `` Any knives or scissors to grind , ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 7]: asked Spikeman , respectfully coming forward .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 8]: `` You here again , Master Tinker !
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 11]: Why , I had quite forgot all about you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 5]: -LRB- Heaven preserve us !
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 12]: how innocent girls will sometimes tell fibs out of modesty . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 21]: `` It were well for others , Miss Mathews , if their memory were equally treacherous , '' rejoined Spikeman .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 8]: `` And why so , pray ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 14]: `` I speak of the gentleman to whom you sent the message . ''
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 10]: `` And what was his reply to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 34]: `` He acknowledged , Miss Mathews , the madness of his communication to you , of the impossibility of your giving him an answer , and of your admitting him to your presence .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 19]: He admired the prudence of your conduct , but , unfortunately , his admiration only increased his love .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 13]: He requested me to say that he will write no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 12]: `` He has done wisely , and I am satisfied . ''
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 47]: `` I would I could say as much for him , Miss Mathews ; for it is my opinion , that his very existence is now so bound up with the possession of you , that if he does not succeed he can not exist . ''
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 17]: `` That 's not my fault , '' replied Melissa , with her eyes cast down .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 7]: `` No , it is not .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 50]: Still , Miss Mathews , when it is considered that this man had abjured , I may say , had almost despised women , it is no small triumph to you , or homage from him , that you have made him feel the power of your sex . ''
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 12]: `` It is his just punishment for having despised us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 24]: `` Perhaps so ; yet if we were all punished for our misdeeds , as Shakespeare says , who should escape whipping ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 15]: `` Pray , Master Tinker , where did you learn to quote Shakespeare ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 7]: `` Where I learnt much more .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 9]: I was not always a travelling tinker . ''
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 7]: `` So I presumed before this .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 10]: And pray how came you to be one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 19]: `` Miss Mathews , if the truth must be told , it arose from an unfortunate attachment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 35]: `` I have read in the olden poets that love would turn a god into a man ; but I never heard of its making him a tinker , '' replied Melissa , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 33]: `` The immortal Jove did not hesitate to conceal his thunderbolts when he deigned to love ; and Cupid but too often has recourse to the aid of Proteus to secure success .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 10]: We have , therefore , no mean warranty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 15]: `` And who was the lady of thy love , good Master Tinker ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 12]: `` She was , Miss Mathews , like you in everything .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 40]: She was as beautiful , as intelligent , as honest , as proud , and , unfortunately , she was , like you , as obdurate , which reminds me of the unfortunate gentleman whose emissary I now am .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 78]: In his madness he requested me -- yes , Miss Mathews , me a poor tinker -- to woo you for him -- to say to you all that he would have said had he been admitted to your presence -- to plead for him -- to kneel for him at your feet , and entreat you to have some compassion for one whose only misfortune was to love -- whose only fault was to be poor .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 21]: What could I say , Miss Mathews -- what could I reply to a person in his state of desperation ?
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 34]: To reason with him , to argue with him , had been useless ; I could only soothe him by making such a promise , provided that I was permitted to do it .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 16]: Tell me , Miss Mathews , have I your permission to make the attempt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 18]: `` First , Mr Tinker , I should wish to know the name of this gentleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 18]: `` I promised not to mention it , Miss Mathews ; but I can evade the promise .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 33]: I have a book which belongs to him in my pocket , on the inside of which are the arms of his family , with his father 's name underneath them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 5]: Spikeman presented the book .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 18]: Melissa read the name , and then laid it on the bench , without saying a word .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 49]: `` And now , Miss Mathews , as I have shown you that the gentleman has no wish to conceal who he is , may I venture to hope that you will permit me to plead occasionally , when I may see you , in his behalf . ''
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 11]: `` I know not what to say , Master Tinker .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 18]: I consider it a measure fraught with some danger , both to the gentleman and to myself .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 41]: You have quoted Shakespeare -- allow me now to do the same : -- '' ` Friendship is constant in all other things Save in the affairs and offices of love , Therefore all hearts use your own tongues . '
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 44]: `` You observe , Master Tinker , that there is the danger of your pleading for yourself , and not for your client ; and there is also the danger of my being insensibly moved to listen to the addresses of a tinker .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 15]: Now , only reflect upon the awful consequences , '' continued Melissa , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 46]: `` I pledge you my honour , Miss Mathews , that I will only plead for the person whose name you have read in the book , and that you shall never be humiliated by the importunities of a mender of pots and pans . ''
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 16]: `` You pledge the honour of a tinker ; what may that be worth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 25]: `` A tinker that has the honour of conversing with Miss Mathews , has an honour that can not be too highly appreciated . ''
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 35]: `` Well , that is very polite for a mender of old kettles ; but the schoolmaster is abroad , which , I presume , accounts for such strange anomalies as our present conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 9]: I must now wish you good morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 19]: `` When may I have the honour of again presenting myself in behalf of the poor gentleman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 60]: `` I can really make no appointments with tinkers , '' replied Melissa ; `` if you personate that young man , you must be content to wait for days or months to catch a glimpse of the hem of my garment ; to bay the moon and bless the stars , and I do not know what else .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 49]: It is , in short , catch me when you can ; and now farewell , good Master Tinker , '' replied Melissa , leaving her own book , and taking the one Spikeman had put into her hand , which she carried with her to the house .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 13]: It was all up with Miss Melissa Mathews , that was clear .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 44]: We shall pass over a fortnight , during which Spikeman , at first every other day , and subsequently every day or evening , had a meeting with Melissa , in every one of which he pleaded his cause in the third person .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 56]: Joey began to be very tired of this affair , as he remained idle during the whole time , when one morning Spikeman told him that he must go down to the meeting-place without the wheel , and tell Miss Mathews his uncle the tinker was ill , and not able to come that evening .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 10]: Joey received his instructions , and went down immediately .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 25]: Miss Mathews was not to be seen , and Joey , to avoid observation , hid himself in the copse , awaiting her arrival .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 12]: At last she came , accompanied by Araminta , her cousin .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 80]: As soon as they had taken their seats on the bench , Araminta commenced : `` My dear Melissa , I could not speak to you in the house , on account of your father ; but Simpson has told me this morning that she thought it her duty to state to me that you have been seen , not only in the day time , but late in the evening , walking and talking with a strange-looking man .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 34]: I have thought it very odd that you should not have mentioned this mysterious person to me lately ; but I do think it most strange that you should have been so imprudent .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 21]: Now , tell me everything that has happened , or I must really make it known to your father . ''
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 23]: `` And have me locked up for months , -- that 's very kind of you , Araminta , '' replied Melissa .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 11]: `` But consider what you have been doing , Melissa .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 6]: Who is this man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 28]: `` A travelling tinker , who brought me a letter from a gentleman , who has been so silly as to fall in love with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 11]: `` And what steps have you taken , cousin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 15]: `` Positively refused to receive a letter , or to see the gentleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 10]: `` Then why does the man come again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 14]: `` To know if we have any knives or scissors to grind . ''
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 11]: `` Come , come , Melissa , this is ridiculous .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 15]: All the servants are talking about it ; and you know how servants talk .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 10]: Why do you continue to see this fellow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 15]: `` Because he amuses me , and it is so stupid of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 25]: `` If that is your only reason , you can have no objection to see him no more , now that scandal is abroad .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 9]: Will you promise me that you will not ?
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 14]: Recollect , dear Melissa , how imprudent and how unmaidenly it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 23]: `` Why , you do n't think that I am going to elope with a tinker , do you , cousin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 20]: `` I should think not ; nevertheless , a tinker is no companion for Miss Mathews , dear cousin .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 8]: Melissa , you have been most imprudent .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 40]: How far you have told me the truth I know not ; but this I must tell you , if you do not promise me to give up this disgraceful acquaintance , I will immediately acquaint my uncle . ''
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 18]: `` I will not be forced into any promise , Araminta , '' replied Melissa , indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 13]: `` Well , then , I will not hurry you into it .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 40]: I will give you forty-eight hours to reply , and if by that time your own good sense does not point out your indiscretion , I certainly will make it known to your father ; that is decided . ''
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 3]: So saying .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 11]: Araminta rose from the bench and walked towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 20]: `` Eight-and-forty hours , '' said Melissa , thoughtfully ; `` it must be decided by that time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 22]: Joey , who had wit enough to perceive how matters stood , made up his mind not to deliver his message .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 24]: He knew that Spikeman was well , and presumed that his staying away was to make Miss Mathews more impatient to see him .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 17]: Melissa remained on the bench in deep thought ; at last Joey went up to her .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 7]: `` You here , my boy !
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 7]: what have you come for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 3]: said Melissa .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 10]: `` I was strolling this way , madam . ''
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 24]: `` Come here ; I want you to tell me the truth ; indeed , it is useless to attempt to deceive me .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 7]: Is that person your uncle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 10]: `` No , miss , he is not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 5]: `` I knew that .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 16]: Is he not the person who wrote the letter , and a gentleman in disguise ?
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 20]: Answer me that question , and then I have a message to him which will make him happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 9]: `` He is a gentleman , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 12]: `` And his name is Spikeman , is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 9]: `` Yes , miss , it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 8]: `` Will he be here this evening ?
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 8]: This is no time for trifling . ''
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 15]: `` If you want him , miss , I am sure he will . ''
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 22]: `` Tell him to be sure and come , and not in disguise , '' said Melissa , bursting into tears .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 19]: `` That 's no use , my die is cast , '' continued she , talking to herself .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 14]: Joey remained by her side until she removed her hands from her face .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 7]: `` Why do you wait ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 12]: `` At what hour , miss , shall he come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 3]: said Joey .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 8]: `` As soon as it is dusk .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 11]: Leave me , boy , and do not forget . ''
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 20]: Joey hastened to Spikeman , and narrated what he had seen and heard , with the message of Melissa .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 16]: `` My dear boy , you have helped me to happiness , '' said Spikeman .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 8]: `` She shed tears , did she ?
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 3]: Poor thing !
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 11]: I trust they will be the last she shall shed .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 9]: I must be off to Cobhurst at once .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 18]: Meet me at dark at the copse , for I shall want to speak to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 19]: Spikeman set off for the town as fast as he could , with his bundle on his head .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 33]: When half way he went into a field and changed his clothes , discarding his tinker 's dress for ever , throwing it into a ditch for the benefit of the finder .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 46]: He then went into the town to his rooms , dressed himself in a fashionable suit , arranged his portmanteau , and ordered a chaise to be ready at the door at a certain time , so as to arrive at the village before dusk .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 36]: After he had passed through the village , he ordered the postboy to stop about fifty yards on the other side of the copse , and getting out desired him to remain till he returned .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 29]: Joey was already there , and soon afterwards Miss M made her appearance , coming down the walk in a hurried manner , in her shawl and bonnet .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 74]: As soon as she gained the bench , Spikeman was at her feet ; he told her he knew what had passed between her and her cousin ; that he could not , would not part with her -- he now came without disguise to repeat what he had so often said to her , that he loved and adored her , and that his life should be devoted to make her happy .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 40]: Melissa wept , entreated , refused , and half consented ; Spikeman led her away from the bench towards the road , she still refusing , yet still advancing , until they came to the door of the chaise .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 29]: Joey let down the steps ; Melissa , half fainting and half resisting , was put in ; Spikeman followed , and the door was closed by Joey .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 11]: `` Stop a moment , boy , '' said Spikeman .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 9]: `` Here , Joey , take this . ''
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 23]: As Spikeman put a packet into our hero 's hand , Melissa clasped her hands and cried , `` Yes -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 21]: stop , do stop , and let me out ; I can not go , indeed I can not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 21]: `` There 's lights coming down the gravel walk , '' said Joey ; `` they are running fast . ''
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 16]: `` Drive on , boy , as fast as you can , '' said Spikeman .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 14]: drive on , '' cried Melissa , sinking into her lover 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 68]: Off went the chaise , leaving Joey on the road with the packet in his hand ; our hero turned round and perceived the lights close to him , and , not exactly wishing to be interrogated , he set off as fast as he could , and never checked his speed until he arrived at the cottage where he and Spikeman had taken up their quarters .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 15]: A VERY LONG CHAPTER , NECESSARY TO FETCH UP THE REMAINDER OF THE CONVOY .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 52]: As it was late that night , Joey did not open the packet delivered to him from Spikeman until he arose the next morning , which he did very early , as he thought it very likely that he might be apprehended , if he was not off in good time .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 96]: The packet contained a key , 20 pounds in money , and a paper , with the following letter : -- `` My dear boy , -- As we must now part , at least for some time , I have left you money sufficient to set you up for the present ; I have inclosed a memorandum , by which I make over to you the knife-grinder 's wheel , and all the furniture , books , etcetera , that are in my rooms at Dudstone , the key of which is also inclosed .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 56]: I should recommend you going there and taking immediate possession , and as soon as I have time , I shall write to the woman of the house , to inform her of the contents of the memorandum ; and I will also write to you , and let you know how I get on .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 31]: Of course you will now do as you please ; at all events , I have taught you a profession , and have given you the means of following it .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 26]: I only hope , if you do , that some day you may be able to retire from business as successfully as I have done .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 18]: You will , of course , write to me occasionally , after you know where I am .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 22]: Depend upon it , there is no profession so near to that of a gentleman as that of a travelling tinker .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 8]: `` Yours ever truly , AUGUSTUS SPIKEMAN .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 3]: `` NB .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 17]: There is some money in the old place to pay the bill at the cottage . ''
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 16]: Our hero considered that he could not do better than follow the advice of Spikeman .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 47]: He first wrote a few lines to Mary , requesting that she would send her answer to Dudstone ; and then , having settled with the hostess , he set off with his knife-grinder 's wheel on his return home to what were now his apartments .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 43]: As he was not anxious to make money , he did not delay on his road , and on the fifth day he found himself at the door of the alehouse near to Dudstone , where he had before left the wheel .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 51]: Joey thought it advisable to do so now , telling the landlord that Spikeman had requested him so to do ; and as soon as it was dusk , our hero proceeded to the town , and knocked at the door of the house in which were Spikeman 's apartments .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 26]: He informed the landlady that Spikeman would not in all probability return , and had sent him to take possession , showing her the key .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 10]: The dame was satisfied , and Joey went upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 27]: As soon as he had lighted the candle , and fairly installed himself , our hero threw himself down on the sofa and began to reflect .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 44]: It is pleasant to have property of our own , and Joey never had had any before ; it was satisfactory to look at the furniture , bed , and books , and say , `` All this is _ mine _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 31]: Joey felt this , as it is to be presumed everybody would in the same position , and for some time he continued looking round and round at his property .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 24]: Having satisfied himself with a review of it externally , he next proceeded to open all the drawers , the chests , etcetera .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 67]: There were many articles in them which Joey did not expect to find , such as a store of sheets , table linen , and all Spikeman 's clothes , which he had discarded when he went up to London , some silver spoons , and a variety of little odds and ends ; in short , Spikeman had left our hero everything as it stood .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 25]: Joey put his money away , and then went to bed , and slept as serenely as the largest landed proprietor in the kingdom .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 17]: When he awoke next morning , our hero began to reflect upon what he should do .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 69]: He was not of Spikeman 's opinion that a travelling tinker was the next thing to a gentleman , nor did he much like the idea of rolling the wheel about all his life ; nevertheless , he agreed with Spikeman that it was a trade by which he could earn his livelihood , and if he could do no better , it would always be a resource .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 38]: As soon as he had taken his breakfast , he sat down and wrote to Mary , acquainting her with all that had taken place , and stating what his own feelings were upon his future prospects .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 20]: Having finished his letter , he dressed himself neatly , and went out to call upon the widow James .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 10]: Miss Ophelia and Miss Amelia were both at home .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 11]: `` Well , Master Atherton , how do you do ?
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 8]: and pray where is Mr Spikeman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 8]: said both the girls in a breath .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 10]: `` He is a long way from this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 3]: replied Joey .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 7]: `` A long way from this !
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 11]: Why , has he not come back with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 11]: and I believe he will not come back any more .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 16]: I am come , as his agent , to take possession of his property . ''
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 8]: `` Why , what has happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 24]: `` A very sad accident , '' replied our hero , shaking his head ; `` he fell -- '' `` Fell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 8]: exclaimed the two girls in a breath .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 12]: `` Yes , fell in love , and is married . ''
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 5]: `` Well now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 10]: exclaimed Miss Ophelia , `` only to think ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 5]: Miss Amelia said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 9]: `` And so he is really married ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 11]: `` Yes ; and he has given up business . ''
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 18]: `` He did seem in a great hurry when he last came here , '' observed Amelia .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 10]: `` And what are you going to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 16]: `` I am not going to follow his example just yet , '' replied Joey .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 14]: `` I suppose not ; but what are you going to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 3]: replied Ophelia .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 16]: `` I shall wait here for his orders ; I expect to hear from him .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 54]: Whether I am to remain in this part of the country , or sell off and join him , or look out for some other business , I hardly know ; I think myself I shall look out for something else ; I do n't like the cutlery line and travelling for orders .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 9]: How is your mamma , Miss Ophelia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 12]: `` She is very well , and has gone to market .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 14]: Well , I never did expect to hear of Mr Spikeman being married !
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 9]: Who is he married to , Joseph ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 19]: `` To a very beautiful young lady , daughter of Squire Mathews , with a large fortune . ''
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 14]: `` Yes ; men always look for money nowadays , '' said Amelia .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 24]: `` I must go now , '' said Joey , getting up ; `` I have some calls and some inquiries to make .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 7]: Good morning , young ladies . ''
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 38]: It must be acknowledged that the two Misses James were not quite so cordial towards Joey as they were formerly ; but unmarried girls do not like to hear of their old acquaintances marrying anybody save themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 34]: There is not only a flirt the less , but a chance the less in consequence ; and it should be remarked , that there were very few _ beaux _ at Dudstone .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 227]: Our hero was some days at Dudstone before he received a letter from Spikeman , who informed him that he had arrived safely at Gretna -LRB- indeed , there was no male relation of the family to pursue him -RRB- , and the silken bands of Hymen had been made more secure by the iron rivets of the blacksmith ; that three days after he had written a letter to his wife 's father , informing him that he had _ done him the honour _ of marrying his daughter ; that he could not exactly say when he could find time to come to the mansion and pay him a visit , but that he would as soon as he conveniently could ; that he begged that the room prepared for them upon their arrival might have a _ large _ dressing-room attached to it , as he could not dispense with that convenience ; that he was not aware whether Mr Mathews was inclined to part with the mansion and property , but , as his wife had declared that she would prefer living there to anywhere else , he had not any objection to purchase it of Mr Mathews , if they could come to terms ; hoped his gout was better , and was his `` very faithfully , AUGUSTUS SPIKEMAN . ''
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 45]: Melissa wrote a few lines to Araminta , begging her , as a favour , not to attempt to palliate her conduct , but to rail against her incessantly , as it would be the surest method of bringing affairs to an amicable settlement .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 28]: To her father she wrote only these few words : -- `` My dear Papa , -- You will be glad to hear that I am married .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 17]: Augustus says that , if I behave well , he will come and see you soon .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 11]: Dear papa , your dutiful child , MELISSA SPIKEMAN . ''
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 36]: That the letters of Spikeman and Melissa put the old gentleman in no small degree of rage , may be conceived ; but nothing could be more judicious than the plan Spikeman had acted upon .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 24]: It is useless to plead to a man who is irritated with constant gout ; he only becomes more despotic and more unyielding .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 35]: Had Araminta attempted to soften his indignation , it would have been equally fruitless ; but the compliance with the request of her cousin of continually railing against her , had the effect intended .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 85]: The vituperation of Araminta left him nothing to say ; there was no opposition to direct his anathemas against ; there was no coaxing or wheedling on the part of the offenders for him to repulse ; and when Araminta pressed the old gentleman to vow that Melissa should never enter the doors again , he accused her of being influenced by interested motives , threw a basin at her head , and wrote an epistle requesting Melissa to come and take his blessing .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 38]: Araminta refused to attend her uncle after this insult , and the old gentleman became still more anxious for the return of his daughter , as he was now left entirely to the caprice of his servants .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 18]: Araminta gave Melissa an account of what had passed , and entreated her to come at once .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 11]: She did so , and a general reconciliation took place .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 40]: Mr Mathews , finding his new son-in-law very indifferent to pecuniary matters , insisted upon making over to his wife an estate in Herefordshire , which , with Melissa 's own fortune , rendered them in most affluent circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 43]: Spikeman requested Joey to write to him now and then , and that , if he required assistance , he would apply for it ; but still advised him to follow up the profession of travelling tinker as being the most independent .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 41]: Our hero had hardly time to digest the contents of Spikeman 's letter when he received a large packet from Mary , accounting for her not having replied to him before , in consequence of her absence from the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 74]: She had , three weeks before , received a letter written for Mrs Chopper , acquainting her that Mrs Chopper was so very ill that it was not thought possible that she could recover , having an abscess in the liver which threatened to break internally , and requesting Mary to obtain leave to come to Gravesend , if she possibly could , as Mrs Chopper wished to see her before she died .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 70]: Great as was Mary 's repugnance to revisit Gravesend , she felt that the obligations she was under to Mrs Chopper were too great for her to hesitate ; and showing the letter to Mrs Austin , and stating at the same time that she considered Mrs Chopper as more than a mother to her , she obtained the leave which she requested , and set off for Gravesend .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 34]: It was with feelings of deep shame and humiliation that poor Mary walked down the main street of the town , casting her eyes up fearfully to the scenes of her former life .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 72]: She was very plainly attired , and had a thick veil over her face , so that nobody recognised her ; she arrived at the door of Mrs Chopper 's abode , ascended the stairs , and was once more in the room out of which she had quitted Gravesend to lead a new life ; and most conscientiously had she fulfilled her resolution , as the reader must be aware .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 57]: Mrs Chopper was in bed and slumbering when Mary softly opened the door ; the signs of approaching death were on her countenance -- her large , round form had wasted away -- her fingers were now taper and bloodless ; Mary would not have recognised her had she fallen in with her under other circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 28]: An old woman was in attendance ; she rose up when Mary entered , imagining that it was some kind lady come to visit the sick woman .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 35]: Mary sat down by the side of the bed , and motioned to the old woman that she might go out , and then she raised her veil and waited till the sufferer roused .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 29]: Mary had snuffed the candle twice that she might see sufficiently to read the Prayer Book which she had taken up , when Mrs Chopper opened her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 10]: `` How very kind of you , ma'am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 11]: said Mrs Chopper ; `` and where is Miss -- ?
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 8]: My eyes are dimmer every day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 12]: `` It is me , Mary -- Nancy that was ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 6]: `` And so it is !
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 11]: O , Nancy , now I shall die in peace !
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 21]: I thought at first it was the kind lady who comes every day to read and to pray with me .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 11]: Dear Nancy , how glad I am to see you !
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 6]: And how do you do ?
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 7]: And how is poor Peter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 16]: `` Quite well when I heard from him last , my dear Mrs Chopper . ''
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 72]: `` You do n't know , Nancy , what a comfort it is to me to see you looking as you do , so good and so innocent ; and when I think it was by my humble means that you were put in the way of becoming so , I feel as if I had done one good act , and that perhaps my sins may be forgiven me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 63]: `` God will reward you , Mrs Chopper ; I said so at the time , and I feel it now , '' replied Mary , the tears rolling down her cheeks ; `` I trust by your means , and with strength from above , I shall continue in the same path , so that one sinner may be saved . ''
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 6]: `` Bless you , Nancy !
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 15]: -- You never were a bad girl in heart ; I always said so .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 7]: And where is Peter now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 15]: `` Going about the country earning his bread ; poor , but happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 48]: `` Well , Nancy , it will soon be over with me ; I may die in a second , they tell me , or I may live for three or four days ; but I sent for you that I might put my house in order .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 31]: There are only two people that I care for upon earth -- that is you and my poor Peter ; and all I have I mean to leave between you .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 39]: I have signed a paper already , in case you could not come , but now that you are come , I will tell you all I wish ; but give me some of that drink first . ''
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 43]: Mary having read the directions on the label , poured out a wine-glass of the mixture , and gave it to Mrs Chopper , who swallowed it , and then proceeded , taking a paper from under her pillow -- `` Nancy !
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 9]: this is the paper I told you of .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 27]: I have about 700 pounds in the bank , which is all that I have saved in twenty-two years ; but it has been honestly made .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 21]: I have , perhaps , much more owing to me , but I do not want it to be collected .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 14]: Poor sailors have no money to spare , and I release them all .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 36]: You will see me buried , Nancy , and tell poor Peter how I loved him , and I have left my account books , with my bad debts and good debts , to him .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 30]: I am sure he would like to have them , for he knows the history of every sum-total , and he will look over them and think of me .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 30]: You can sell this furniture ; but the wherry you must give to William ; he is not very honest , but he has a large family to keep .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 29]: Do what you like , dearest , about what is here ; perhaps my clothes would be useful to his wife ; they are not fit for you .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 22]: There 's a good deal of money in the upper drawer ; it will pay for my funeral and the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 17]: I believe that is all now ; but do tell poor Peter how I loved him .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 18]: Poor fellow , I have been cheated ever since he left ; but that 's no matter .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 12]: Now , Nancy , dear , read to me a little .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 20]: I have so longed to have you by my bedside to read to me , and pray for me !
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 10]: I want to hear you pray before I die .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 29]: It will make me happy to hear you pray , and see that kind face looking up to heaven , as it was always meant to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 6]: Poor Mary burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 66]: After a few minutes she became more composed , and , dropping down on her knees by the side of the bed , she opened the Prayer Book , and complied with the request of Mrs Chopper ; and as she fervently poured forth her supplication , occasionally her voice faltered , and she would stop to brush away the tears which dimmed her sight .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 34]: She was still so occupied when the door of the room was gently opened , and a lady , with a girl about fourteen or fifteen years old , quietly entered the room .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 12]: Mary did not perceive them until they also had knelt down .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 22]: She finished the prayer , rose , and , with a short curtsey , retired from the side of the bed .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 36]: Although not recognised herself by the lady , Mary , immediately remembered Mrs Phillips and her daughter Emma , having as we have before observed , been at one time in Mrs Phillips 's service .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 21]: `` This is the young woman whom you so wished to see , Mrs Chopper , is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 4]: said Mrs Phillips .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 28]: `` I am not surprised at your longing for her , for she appears well suited for a companion in such an hour ; and , alas !
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 6]: how , few there are !
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 15]: Sit down , I request , '' continued Mrs Phillips , turning to Mary .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 12]: `` How do you find yourself to-day , Mrs Chopper ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 35]: `` Sinking fast , dear madam , but not unwilling to go , since I have seen Nancy , and heard of my poor Peter ; he wrote to Nancy a short time ago .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 11]: Nancy , do n't forget my love to Peter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 50]: Emma Phillips , who had now grown tall and thin , immediately went up to Mary , and said , `` Peter was the little boy who was with Mrs Chopper ; I met him on the road when he first came to Gravesend , did I not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 11]: `` Yes , miss you did , '' replied Mary .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 23]: `` He used to come to our house sometimes , and very often to meet me as I walked home from school .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 20]: I never could imagine what became of him , for he disappeared all at once without saying good-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 10]: `` He was obliged to go away , miss .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 19]: It was not his fault ; he was a very good boy , and is so still . ''
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 19]: `` Then pray remember me to him , and tell him that I often think of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 22]: `` I will , Miss Phillips , and he will be very happy to hear that you have said so . ''
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 11]: `` How did you know that my name was Phillips ?
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 14]: O , I suppose poor Mrs Chopper told you before we came . ''
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 25]: Mrs Phillips had now read some time to Mrs Chopper , and this put an end to the conversation between Mary and Emma Phillips .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 5]: It was not resumed .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 17]: As soon as the reading was over , Mrs Phillips and her daughter took their leave .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 15]: Mary made up a bed for herself by the side of Mrs Chopper 's .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 31]: About the middle of the night , she was roused by a gurgling kind of noise ; she hastened to the bedside , and found that Mrs Chopper was suffocating .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 54]: Mary called in the old woman to her aid , but it was useless , the abscess had burst , and in a few seconds all was over ; and Mary , struggling with emotion , closed the eyes of her old friend , and offered up a prayer for her departed spirit .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 63]: The remainder of the night was passed in solemn meditation and a renewal of those vows which the poor girl had hitherto so scrupulously adhered to , and which the death-bed scene was so well fitted to encourage ; but Mary felt that she had her duties towards others to discharge , and did not give way to useless and unavailing sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 28]: It was her duty to return as soon as possible to her indulgent mistress , and the next morning she was busy in making the necessary arrangements .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 63]: On the third day Mary attended the funeral of her old friend , the bills were all paid , and having selected some articles which she wished to retain as a remembrance , she resolved to make over to William , the waterman , not only the wherry , but all the stock in hand , furniture and clothes of Mrs Chopper .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 19]: This would enable him and his wife to set up in business themselves and provide for their family .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 92]: Mary knew that she had no right to do so without Joey 's consent , but of this she felt she was sure ; having so done , she had nothing more to do but to see the lawyer who had drawn up the will , and having gone through the necessary forms , she received an order on the county bank nearest to the Hall for the money , which , with what was left in the drawers , after paying every demand , amounted to more than 700 pounds .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 43]: She thought it was her duty to call upon Mrs Phillips , before she went away , out of gratitude for her kindness to Mrs Chopper ; and as she had not been recognised , she had no scruple in so doing .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 14]: She was kindly received , and blushed at the praise bestowed upon her .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 40]: As she was going away , Emma Phillips followed her out , and putting into her hand a silver pencil-case , requested she would `` give it to Peter as a remembrance of his little friend , Emma . ''
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 94]: The next day Mary arrived at the Hall , first communicated to Mrs Austin what had occurred , and then , having received our hero 's two last epistles , sat down to write the packet containing all the intelligence we have made known , and ended by requesting Joey to set off with his knife-grinder 's wheel , and come to the village near to the Hall , that he might receive his share of Mrs Chopper 's money , the silver pencil-case , and the warm greeting of his adopted sister .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 7]: Joey was not long in deciding .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 33]: He resolved that he would go to Mary ; and , having locked up his apartments , he once more resumed his wheel , and was soon on his way to Hampshire .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 11]: A RETROSPECT THAT THE PARTIES MAY ALL START FAIR AGAIN .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 29]: We must now leave our hero on his way to the Hall , while we acquaint our readers with the movements of other parties connected with our history .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 11]: A correspondence had been kept up between O'Donahue and McShane .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 30]: O'Donahue had succeeded in obtaining the pardon of the emperor , and employment in the Russian army , in which he had rapidly risen to the rank of general .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 52]: Five or six years had elapsed since he had married , and both O'Donahue and his wife were anxious to visit England ; a letter at last came , announcing that he had obtained leave of absence from the emperor , and would in all probability arrive in the ensuing spring .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 75]: During this period McShane had continued at his old quarters , Mrs McShane still carrying on the business , which every year became more lucrative ; so much so , indeed , that her husband had for some time thought very seriously of retiring altogether , as they had already amassed a large sum , when McShane received the letter from O'Donahue , announcing that in a few months he would arrive in England .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 44]: Major McShane , who was very far from being satisfied with his negative position in society , pressed the matter more earnestly to his wife , who , although she was perfectly content with her own position , did not oppose his entreaties .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 42]: McShane found that after disposing of the goodwill of the business , and of the house , they would have a clear 30,000 pounds , which he considered more than enough for their wants , uncumbered as they were with children .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 47]: Let it not be supposed that McShane had ceased in his inquiries after our hero ; on the contrary , he had resorted to all that his invention could suggest to trace him out , but , as the reader must be aware , without success .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 40]: Both McShane and his wife mourned his loss , as if they had been bereaved of their own child ; they still indulged the idea that some day he would reappear , but when , they could not surmise .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 63]: McShane had not only searched for our hero , but had traced his father with as little success , and he had now made up his mind that he should see no more of Joey , if he ever did see him again , until after the death of his father , when there would no longer be any occasion for secrecy .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 41]: Our hero and his fate were a continual source of conversation between McShane and his wife ; but latterly , after not having heard of him for more than five years , the subject had not been so often renewed .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 47]: As soon as McShane had wound up his affairs , and taken his leave of the eating-house , he looked out for an estate in the country , resolving to lay out two-thirds of his money in land , and leave the remainder in the funds .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 32]: After about three months ' search he found a property which suited him , and , as it so happened , about six miles from the domains held by Mr Austin .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 8]: He had taken possession and furnished it .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 51]: As a retired officer in the army he was well received ; and if Mrs McShane was sometimes laughed at for her housekeeper-like appearance , still her sweetness of temper and unassuming behaviour soon won her friends , and McShane found himself in a very short time comfortable and happy .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 38]: The O'Donahues were expected to arrive very shortly , and McShane had now a domicile fit for the reception of his old friend , who had promised to pay him a visit as soon as he arrived .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 15]: Of the Austins little more can be said that has not been said already .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 66]: Austin was a miserable , unhappy man ; his cup of bliss -- for he had every means of procuring all that this world considers as bliss , being in possession of station , wealth , and respect -- was poisoned by the one heavy crime which passion had urged him to commit , and which was now a source of hourly and unavailing repentance .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 26]: His son , who should have inherited his wealth , was lost to him , and he dared not mention that he was in existence .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 37]: Every day Austin became more nervous and irritable , more exclusive and averse to society ; he trembled at shadows , and his strong constitution was rapidly giving way to the heavy weight on his conscience .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 24]: He could not sleep without opiates , and he dreaded to sleep lest he should reveal everything of the past in his slumbers .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 24]: Each year added to the irascibility of his temper , and the harshness with which he treated his servants and his unhappy wife .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 27]: His chief amusement was hunting , and he rode in so reckless a manner that people often thought that he was anxious to break his neck .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 4]: Perhaps he was .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 91]: Mrs Austin was much to be pitied ; she knew how much her husband suffered ; how the worm gnawed within ; and , having that knowledge , she submitted to all his harshness , pitying him instead of condemning him ; but her life was still more embittered by the loss of her child , and many were the bitter tears which she would shed when alone , for she dared not in her husband 's presence , as he would have taken them as a reproof to himself .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 39]: Her whole soul yearned after our hero , and that one feeling rendered her indifferent , not only to all the worldly advantages by which she was surrounded , but to the unkindness and hard-heartedness of her husband .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 49]: Mary , who had entered her service as kitchen-maid , was very soon a favourite , and had been advanced to the situation of Mrs Austin 's own attendant Mrs Austin considered her a treasure , and she daily became more partial to and more confidential with her .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 49]: Such was the state of affairs , when one morning , as Austin was riding to cover , a gentleman of the neighbourhood said to him , in the course of conversation -- `` By-the-bye , Austin , have you heard that you have a new neighbour ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 18]: -- on the Frampton estate , I suppose ; I heard that it had been sold . ''
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 8]: `` Yes ; I have seen him .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 20]: He is one of your profession -- a lively , amusing sort of Irish major ; gentlemanlike , nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 23]: The wife not very high-bred , but very fat , and very good-humoured , and amusing from her downright simpleness of heart .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 10]: You will call upon them , I presume ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 10]: `` Oh , of course , '' replied Austin .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 10]: `` What is his name did you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 14]: `` Major McShane , formerly of the 53rd Regiment , I believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 36]: Had a bullet passed through the heart of Austin , he could not have received a more sudden shock , and the start which he made from his saddle attracted the notice of his companion .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 18]: `` What 's the matter , Austin , you look pale ; you are not well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 29]: `` No , '' replied Austin , recollecting himself ; `` I am not ; one of those twinges from an old wound in the breast came on .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 7]: I shall be better directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 13]: Austin stopped his horse , and put his hand to his heart .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 10]: His companion rode up , and remained near him .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 25]: `` It is worse than usual ; I thought it was coming on last night ; I fear that I must go home . ''
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 8]: `` Shall I go with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 12]: `` O , no ; I must not spoil your sport .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 14]: I am better now a great deal ; it is going off fast .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 16]: Come , let us proceed , or we shall be too late at cover . ''
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 8]: Austin had resolved to conquer his feelings .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 22]: His friend had no suspicion , it is true ; but when we are guilty we imagine that everybody suspects us .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 8]: They rode a few minutes in silence .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 49]: `` Well I am glad that you did not go home , '' observed his friend ; `` for you will meet your new neighbour ; he has subscribed to the pack , and they say he is well mounted ; we shall see how he rides . ''
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 35]: Austin made no reply ; but , after riding on a few yards farther , he pulled up , saying that the pain was coming on again , and that he could not proceed .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 14]: His companion expressed his sorrow at Austin 's indisposition , and they separated .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 16]: Austin immediately returned home , dismounted his horse , and hastened to his private sitting-room .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 22]: Mrs Austin , who had seen him return , and could not imagine the cause , went in to her husband .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 10]: `` What is the matter , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 4]: said Mrs Austin .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 4]: `` Matter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 21]: replied Austin , bitterly , pacing up and down the room ; `` heaven and hell conspire against us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 11]: `` Dear Austin , do n't talk in that way .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 5]: What has happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 25]: `` Something which will compel me , I expect , to remain a prisoner in my own house , or lead to something unpleasant .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 7]: We must not stay here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 13]: Austin then threw himself down on the sofa , and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 13]: At last the persuasions and endearments of his wife overcame his humour .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 73]: He told her that McShane was the major of his regiment when he was a private ; that he would inevitably recognise him ; and that , if nothing else occurred from McShane 's knowledge of his former name , at all events , the general supposition of his having been an officer in the army would be contradicted , and it would lower him in the estimation of the county gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 38]: `` It is indeed a very annoying circumstance , my dear Austin ; but are you sure that he would , after so long a period , recognise the private soldier in the gentleman of fortune ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 22]: `` As sure as I sit here , '' replied Austin , gloomily ; `` I wish I were dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 15]: `` Do n't say so , dear Austin , it makes me miserable . ''
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 14]: `` I never am otherwise , '' replied Austin , clasping his hands .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 5]: `` God forgive me !
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 12]: I have sinned , but have I not been punished ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 24]: `` You have , indeed ; and as repentance is availing , my dear husband , you will receive God 's mercy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 26]: `` The greatest boon , the greatest mercy , would be death , '' replied the unhappy man ; `` I envy the pedlar . ''
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 4]: Mrs Austin wept .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 24]: Her husband , irritated at tears which , to him , seemed to imply reproach , sternly ordered her to leave the room .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 29]: That Austin repented bitterly of the crime which he had committed is not to be doubted ; but it was not with the subdued soul of a Christian .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 40]: His pride was continually struggling within him , and was not yet conquered ; this it was that made him alternately self-condemning and irascible , and it was the continual warfare in his soul which was undermining his constitution .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 10]: Austin sent for medical advice for his supposed complaint .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 19]: The country practitioner , who could discover nothing , pronounced it to be an affection of the heart .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 15]: He was not far wrong ; and Mr Austin 's illness was generally promulgated .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 21]: Cards and calls were the consequence , and Austin kept himself a close but impatient prisoner in his own house .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 32]: His hunters remained in the stables , his dogs in the kennel , and every one intimated that Mr Austin was labouring under a disease from which he would not recover .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 30]: At first this was extremely irksome to Austin , and he was very impatient ; but gradually he became reconciled , and even preferred his sedentary and solitary existence .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 25]: Books were his chief amusement , but nothing could minister to a mind diseased , or drive out the rooted memory of the brain .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 27]: Austin became more morose and misanthropic every day , and at last would permit no one to come near him but his valet and his wife .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 16]: Such was the position of his parents , when Joey was proceeding to their abode .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY SIX .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 16]: OUR HERO FALLS IN WITH AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE , AND IS NOT VERY MUCH DELIGHTED .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 15]: We left our hero rolling his knife-grinder 's wheel towards his father 's house .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 11]: It must be confessed that he did it very unwillingly .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 47]: He was never very fond of it at any time ; but , since he had taken possession of Spikeman 's property , and had received from Mary the intelligence that he was worth 350 pounds more , he had taken a positive aversion to it .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 21]: It retarded his movements , and it was hard work when he had not to get his livelihood by it .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 60]: More than once he thought of rolling it into a horsepond , and leaving it below low-water mark ; but then he thought it a sort of protection against inquiry , and against assault , for it told of poverty and honest employment ; so Joey rolled on , but not with any feelings of regard towards his companion .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 14]: How many castles did our hero build as he went along the road !
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 12]: The sum of money left to him appeared to be enormous .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 29]: He planned and planned again ; and , like most people , at the close of the day , he was just as undetermined as at the commencement .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 29]: Nevertheless , he was very happy , as people always are , in anticipation ; unfortunately , more so than when they grasp what they have been seeking .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 36]: Time rolled on , as well as the grindstone , and at last Joey found himself at the ale-house where he and Mary had put up previously to her obtaining a situation at the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 14]: He immediately wrote a letter to her , acquainting her with his arrival .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 37]: He would have taken the letter himself , only he recollected the treatment he had received , and found another messenger in the butcher 's boy , who was going up to the Hall for orders .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 20]: The answer returned by the same party was , that Mary would come down and see him that evening .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 14]: When Mary came down Joey was astonished at the improvement in her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 40]: She looked much younger than she did when they had parted , and her dress was so very different that our hero could with difficulty imagine that it was the same person who had been his companion from Gravesend .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 46]: The careless air and manner had disappeared ; there was a _ retenue _ -- a dignity about her which astonished him and he felt a sort of respect , mingled with his regard , for her , of which he could not divest himself .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 53]: But , if she looked younger -LRB- as may well be imagined -RRB- from her change of life , she also looked more sedate , except when she smiled , or when occasionally , but very rarely , her merry laughter reminded him of the careless , good-tempered Nancy of former times .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 10]: That the greeting was warm need hardly be said .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 16]: It was the greeting of a sister and younger brother who loved each other dearly .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 13]: `` You are very much grown , Joey , '' said Mary .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 13]: `` Dear boy , how happy I am to see you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 19]: `` And you , Mary , you 're younger in the face , but older in your manners .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 17]: Are you as happy in your situation as you have told me in your letters ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 31]: `` Quite happy ; more happy than ever I deserve to be , my dear boy ; and now tell me , Joey , what do you think of doing ?
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 10]: You have now the means of establishing yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 20]: `` Yes , I have been thinking of it ; but I do n't know what to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 18]: `` Well , you must look out , and do not be in too great a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 31]: Recollect , Joey , that if anything offers which you have any reason to believe will suit you , you shall have my money as well as your own . ''
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 12]: `` Nay , Mary , why should I take that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 46]: `` Because , as it is of no use to me , it must be idle ; besides , you know , if you succeed , you will be able to pay me interest for it ; so I shall gain as well as you .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 12]: You must not refuse your sister , my dear boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 16]: `` Dear Mary , how I wish we could live in the same house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 28]: `` That can not be now , Joey ; you are above my situation at the Hall , even allowing that you would ever enter it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 27]: `` That I never will , if I can help it ; not that I feel angry now , but I like to be independent . ''
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 7]: `` Of course you do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 29]: `` And as for that grindstone , I hate the sight of it ; it has made Spikeman 's fortune , but it never shall make mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 35]: `` You do n't agree then with your former companion , '' rejoined Mary , `` that a tinker 's is the nearest profession to that of a gentleman which you know of . ''
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 40]: `` I certainly do not , '' replied our hero ; `` and as soon as I can get rid of it I will ; I have rolled it here , but I will not roll it much farther .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 10]: I only wish I knew where to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 28]: `` I have something in my pocket which puts me in mind of a piece of news which I received the other day , since my return .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 27]: First let me give you what I have in my pocket , '' -- and Mary pulled out the pencil-case sent to Joey by Emma Phillips .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 11]: `` There you know already who that is from . ''
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 35]: `` Yes , and I shall value it very much , for she was a dear , kind little creature ; and when I was very , very miserable , she comforted me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 30]: `` Well , Joey , Miss Phillips requested me to write when I came back , as she wished to hear that I had arrived safe at the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 15]: It was very kind of her , and I did so , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 42]: Since that I have received a letter from her , stating that her grandmother is dead , and that her mother is going to quit Gravesend for Portsmouth , to reside with her brother , who is now a widower . ''
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 12]: `` I will go to Portsmouth , '' replied our hero .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 28]: `` I was thinking that , as her brother is a navy agent , and Mrs Phillips is interested about you , you could not do better .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 24]: If anything turns up , then you will have good advice , and your money is not so likely to be thrown away .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 18]: I think , therefore , you had better go to Portsmouth , and try your fortune . ''
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 42]: `` I am very glad you have mentioned this , Mary , for , till now , one place was as indifferent to me as another ; but now it is otherwise , and to Portsmouth I will certainly go . ''
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 37]: Our hero remained two or three days longer at the village , during which time Mary was with him every evening , and once she obtained leave to go to the banker 's about her money .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 33]: She then turned over to Joey 's account the sum due to him , and arrangements were made with the bank so that Joey could draw his capital out whenever he pleased .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 41]: After which our hero took leave of Mary , promising to correspond more freely than before ; and once more putting the strap of his knife-grinder 's wheel over his shoulders , he set off on his journey to Portsmouth .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 26]: Joey had not gained two miles from the village when he asked himself the question , `` What shall I do with my grindstone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 23]: He did not like to leave it on the road ; he did not know to whom he could give it away .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 38]: He rolled it on for about six miles farther , and then , quite tired , he resolved to follow the plan formerly adopted by Spikeman , and repose a little upon the turf on the road-side .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 86]: The sun was very warm , and after a time Joey retreated to the other side of the hedge , which was shaded ; and having taken his bundle from the side of the wheel where it hung , he first made his dinner of the provender he had brought with him , and then , laying his head on the bundle , was soon in a sound sleep , from which he was awakened by hearing voices on the other side of the hedge .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 22]: He turned round , and perceived two men on the side of the road , close to his knife-grinder 's wheel .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 15]: They were in their shirts and trousers only and sitting down on the turf .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 24]: `` It would be a very good plan , '' observed one of them ; `` we should then travel without suspicion . ''
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 14]: `` Yes ; if we could get off with it without being discovered .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 9]: Where can the owner of it be . ''
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 26]: `` Well , I dare say he is away upon some business or another , and has left the wheel here till he comes back .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 15]: Now , suppose we were to take it -- how should we manage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 13]: `` Why , we can not go along this road with it .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 32]: We must get over the gates and hedges till we get across the country into another road ; and then by travelling all night , we might be quite clear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 38]: `` Yes , and then we should do well ; for even if our description as deserters was sent out from Portsmouth , we should be considered as travelling tinkers and there would be no suspicion . ''
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 9]: `` Well , I 'm ready for it .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 23]: If we can only get it off the road , and conceal it till night , we may then easily manage it .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 19]: But first let 's see if the fellow it belongs to may not be somewhere about here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 36]: As the man said this , he rose up and turned his face towards the hedge , and our hero immediately perceived that it was his old acquaintance , Furness , the schoolmaster and marine .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 7]: What to do he hardly knew .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 45]: At last he perceived Furness advancing towards the gate of the field , which was close to where he was lying , and , as escape was impossible , our hero covered his face with his arms , and pretended to be fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 8]: He soon heard a `` Hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 21]: given , as a signal to the other man , and , after a while , footsteps close to him .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 13]: Joey pretended to snore loudly , and a whispering then took place .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 21]: At last he heard Furness say -- `` Do you watch by him while I wheel away the grindstone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 12]: `` But if he wakes , what shall I do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 8]: `` Brain him with that big stone .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 18]: If he does not wake up when I am past the second field , follow me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 69]: That our hero had no inclination to wake after this notice may be easily imagined ; he heard the gate opened , and the wheel trundled away , much to his delight , as Furness was the party who had it in charge ; and Joey continued to snore hard , until at last he heard the departing footsteps of Furness 's comrade , who had watched him .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 80]: He thought it prudent to continue motionless for some time longer , to give them time to be well away from him , and then he gradually turned round and looked in the direction in which they had gone ; he could see nothing of them , and it was not until he had risen up , and climbed up on the gate , that he perceived them two or three fields off running away at a rapid pace .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 76]: Thanking heaven that he had escaped the danger that he was in , and delighted with the loss of his property , our hero recommenced his journey with his bundle over his shoulder , and before night he was safe outside one of the stages which took him to a town , from which there was another which would carry him to Portsmouth , at which sea-port he arrived the next evening without further adventure .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 28]: As our hero sat on the outside of the coach and reflected upon his last adventure , the more he felt he had reason to congratulate himself .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 33]: That Furness had deserted from the Marine Barracks at Portsmouth was evident ; and if he had not , that he would have recognised Joey some time or other was almost certain .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 75]: Now , he felt sure that he was safe at Portsmouth , as it would be the last place at which Furness would make his appearance ; and he also felt that his knife-grinder 's wheel , in supplying Furness with the ostensible means of livelihood , and thereby preventing his being taken up as a deserter , had proved the best friend to him , and could not have been disposed of better .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 34]: Another piece of good fortune was his having secured his bundle and money ; for had he left it with the wheel , it would have , of course , shared its fate .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 48]: `` Besides , '' thought Joey , `` if I should chance to fall , in with Furness again , and he attempts to approach me , I can threaten to have him taken as a deserter , and this may deter him from so doing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 29]: It was with a grateful heart that our hero laid his head upon his pillow , in the humble inn at which he had taken up his quarters .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 18]: IN WHICH OUR HERO RETURNS TO HIS FORMER EMPLOYMENT , BUT ON A GRANDER SCALE OF OPERATION .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 29]: Our hero had received from Mary the name and address of Mrs Phillips 's brother , and , on inquiry , found that he was known by everybody .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 62]: Joey dressed himself in his best suit , and presented himself at the door about ten o'clock in the morning , as Joseph O'Donahue , the name which he had taken when he went to Gravesend , and by which name he had been known to Mrs Phillips and her daughter Emma , when he made occasional visits to their house .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 25]: He was admitted , and found himself once more in company with his friend Emma , who was now fast growing up into womanhood .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 24]: After the first congratulations and inquiries , he stated his intentions in coming down to Portsmouth , and their assistance was immediately promised .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 63]: They then requested a detail of his adventures since he quitted Gravesend , of which Joey told everything that he safely could ; passing over his meeting with Furness , by simply stating that , while he was asleep , his knife-grinder 's wheel had been stolen by two men , and that when he awoke he dared not offer an opposition .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 98]: Mrs Phillips and her daughter both knew that there was some mystery about our hero , which had induced him to come to , and also to leave Gravesend ; but , being assured by Mary and himself ; that he was not to blame , they did not press him to say more than he wished ; and , as soon as he finished his history , they proposed introducing him to Mr Small , the brother of Mrs Phillips , in whose house they were then residing , and who was then in his office .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 36]: `` But , perhaps , mamma , it will be better to wait till tomorrow , and in the meantime you will be able to tell my uncle all about Joey , '' observed Emma .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 63]: `` I think it will be better , my dear , '' replied Mrs Phillips ; `` but there is Marianne 's tap at the door , for the second time ; she wants me downstairs , so I must leave you for a little while ; but you need not go away , O'Donahue ; I will be back soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 15]: Mrs Phillips left the room , and our hero found himself alone with Emma .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 26]: `` You have grown very much , Joey , '' said Emma ; `` and so have I , too , they tell me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 28]: `` Yes , you have indeed , '' replied Joey ; `` you are no longer the little girl who comforted me when I was so unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 7]: Do you recollect that day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 14]: `` Yes , indeed I do , as if it were but yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 21]: But you have never told me why you lead so wandering a life ; you wo n't trust me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 67]: `` I would trust you with anything but that which is not mine to trust , as I told you four years ago ; it is not my secret ; as soon as I can I will tell you everything ; but I hope not to lead a wandering life any longer , for I have come down here to settle , if I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 11]: `` What made you think of coming down here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 3]: asked Emma .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 11]: `` Because you were here ; Mary told me so .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 71]: I have not yet thanked you for your present , but I have not forgotten your kindness in thinking of a poor boy like me , when he was far away ; here it is , '' continued Joey , taking out the pencil-case , `` and I have loved it dearly , '' added he , kissing it , `` ever since I have had it in my possession .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 13]: I very often have taken it out and thought of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 41]: `` Now you are so rich a man , you should give me something to keep for your sake , '' replied Emma ; `` and I will be very careful of it , for old acquaintance ' sake . ''
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 8]: `` What can I offer to you ?
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 45]: you are a young lady ; I would give you all I had in the world , if I dared , but -- '' `` When I first saw you , '' rejoined Emma , `` you were dressed as a young gentleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 47]: `` Yes , I was , '' replied Joey , with a sigh ; and as the observation of Emma recalled to his mind the kindness of the McShanes , he passed his hand across his eyes to brush away a tear or two that started .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 20]: `` I did not mean to make you unhappy , '' said Emma , taking our hero 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 14]: `` I am sure you did not , '' replied Joey , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 21]: `` Yes , I was then as you say ; but recollect that lately I have been a knife-grinder . ''
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 33]: `` Well , you know , your friend said , that it was the nearest thing to a gentleman ; and now I hope you will be quite a gentleman again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 19]: `` Not a gentleman , for I must turn to some business or another , '' replied Joey .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 19]: `` I did not mean an idle gentleman ; I meant a respectable profession , '' said Emma .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 22]: `` My uncle is a very odd man , but very good-hearted ; you must not mind his way towards you .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 30]: He is very fond of mamma and me , and I have no doubt will interest himself about you , and see that your money is not thrown away .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 15]: Perhaps you would like to set up a bumboat on your own account ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 5]: added Emma , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 13]: `` No , I thank you ; I had enough of that .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 4]: Poor Mrs Chopper !
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 7]: what a kind creature she was !
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 20]: I 'm sure I ought to be very grateful to her for thinking of me as she did . ''
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 22]: `` I believe , '' said Emma , `` that she was a very good woman , and so does mamma .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 17]: Recollect Joey , when you speak to my uncle , you must not contradict him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 30]: `` I am sure I shall not , '' replied Joey ; `` why should I contradict a person so far my superior in years and everything else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 40]: `` Certainly not ; and as he is fond of argument , you had better give up to him at once ; and , indeed , '' continued Emma , laughing , `` everybody else does in the end .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 21]: I hope you will find a nice situation , and that we shall see a great deal of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 25]: `` I am sure I do , '' replied Joey , `` for I have no friends that I may see , except you .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 10]: How I wish that you did know everything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 54]: A silence ensued between the young people , which was not interrupted until by the appearance of Mrs Phillips , who had seen Mr Small , and had made an engagement for our hero to present himself at nine o'clock on the following morning , after which communication our hero took his leave .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 155]: He amused himself during the remainder of that day in walking over the town , which at that time presented a most bustling appearance , as an expedition was fitting out ; the streets were crowded with officers of the army , navy , and marines , in their uniforms ; soldiers and sailors , more or less tipsy ; flaunting ribbons and gaudy colours , and every variety of noise was to be heard that could be well imagined , from the quacking of a duck , with its head out of the basket in which it was confined to be taken on board , to the martial music , the rolling of the drums , and the occasional salutes of artillery , to let the world know that some great man had put his foot on board of a ship , or had again deigned to tread upon _ terra firma _ .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 41]: All was bustle and excitement , hurrying , jostling , cursing , and swearing ; and Joey found himself , by the manner in which he was shoved about right and left , to be in the way of everybody .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 40]: At the time appointed our hero made his appearance at the door , and , having given his name , was asked into the counting-house of the establishment , where sat Mr Small and his factotum , Mr Sleek .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 17]: It may be as well here to describe the persons and peculiarities of these two gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 78]: Mr Small certainly did not accord with his name , for he was a man full six feet high , and stout in proportion ; he was in face extremely plain , with a turned-up nose ; but , at the same time , there was a lurking good-humour in his countenance , and a twinkle in his eye , which immediately prepossessed you , and in a few minutes you forgot that he was not well-favoured .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 50]: Mr Small was very fond of an argument and a joke , and he had such a forcible way of maintaining his argument when he happened to be near you , that , as Emma had told our hero , few people after a time ventured to contradict him .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 47]: This mode of argument was nothing more than digging the hard knuckles of his large hand into the ribs of his opponent -- we should rather say gradually gimleting , as it were , a hole in your side -- as he heated in his illustrations .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 63]: He was the last person in the world in his disposition to inflict pain , even upon an insect -- and yet , from this habit , no one perhaps gave more , or appeared to do so with more malice , as his countenance was radiant with good-humour , at the very time when his knuckles were taking away your breath .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 70]: What made it worse , was , that he had a knack of seizing the coat lappet with the other hand , so that escape was difficult ; and when he had exhausted all his reasoning , he would follow it up with a pressure of his knuckles under the fifth rib , saying , `` Now you feel the force of my argument , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 16]: Everybody did , and no one would oppose him unless the table was between them .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 40]: It was much the same with his jokes : he would utter them , and then with a loud laugh , and the insidious insertion of his knuckles , say , `` Do you take that , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 37]: Mr Sleek had also his peculiarity , and was not an agreeable person to argue with , for he had learnt to argue from his many years ' constant companionship with the head of the firm .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 49]: Mr Sleek was a spare man , deeply pock-marked in the face , and with a very large mouth ; and , when speaking , he sputtered to such a degree , that a quarter of an hour 's conversation with him was as good as a shower-bath .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 30]: At long range Mr Sleek could heat his superior out of the field ; but if Mr Small approached once to close quarters , Mr Sleek gave in immediately .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 90]: The captains of the navy used to assert that this fibbing enforcement of his _ truths _ , on the part of Small , was quite contrary to all the rules of modern warfare , and never would stand it , unless they required an advance of money ; and then , by submitting to a certain quantity of digs in the ribs in proportion to the unreasonableness of their demand , they usually obtained their object ; as they said he `` knuckled down '' in the end .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 40]: As for Mr Sleek , although the best man in the world , he was their abhorrence ; he was nothing but a watering-pot , and they were not plants which required his aid to add to their vigour .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 20]: Mr Sleek , even in the largest company , invariably found himself alone , and could never imagine why .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 34]: Still he was an important personage ; and when stock is to be got on board in a hurry , officers in his Majesty 's service do not care about a little spray .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 34]: Mr Small was , as we have observed , a navy agent -- that is to say , he was a general provider of the officers and captains of his Majesty 's service .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 50]: He obtained their agency on any captures which they might send in , or he cashed their bills , advanced them money , supplied them with their wine , and every variety of stock which might be required ; and in consequence was reported to be accumulating a fortune .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 56]: As is usually the case , he kept open house for the captains who were his clients , and occasionally invited the junior officers to the hospitalities of his table , so that Mrs Phillips and Emma were of great use to him , and had quite sufficient to do in superintending such an establishment .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 16]: Having thus made our readers better acquainted with our new characters , we shall proceed .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 16]: `` Well , young man , I 've heard all about you from my sister .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 12]: So you wish to leave off vagabondising , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 9]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied Joey .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 6]: `` How old are you ?
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 6]: can you keep books ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 31]: `` I am seventeen , and have kept books , '' replied our hero , in innocence ; for he considered Mrs Chopper 's day-books to come under that denomination .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 11]: `` And you have some money -- how much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 20]: Joey replied that he had so much of his own , and that his sister had so much more .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 9]: `` Seven hundred pounds ; eh , youngster ?
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 13]: I began business with 100 pounds less ; and here I am .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 10]: Money breeds money ; do you understand that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 35]: and here Joey received a knuckle in his ribs , which almost took his breath away , but which he bore without flinching , as he presumed it was a mark of good will .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 12]: `` What can we do with this lad , Sleek ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 15]: said Mr Small ; `` and what can we do with his money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 65]: `` Let him stay in the counting-house here for a week , '' replied Mr Sleek , `` and we shall see what he can do ; and , as for his money , it will be as safe here as in a country bank , until we know how to employ it , and we can allow five per cent for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 21]: All this was said in a shower of spray , which induced Joey to wipe his face with his pocket-handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 53]: `` Yes , I think that will do for the present , '' rejoined Mr Small ; `` but you observe , Sleek , that this young lad has very powerful interest , and we shall be expected to do something for him , or we shall have the worst of it .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 5]: You understand that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 9]: continued he , giving Joey a knuckle again .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 4]: `` The ladies !
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 6]: no standing against them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 17]: Joey thought there was no standing such digs in the ribs , but he said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 9]: `` I leave him to you , Sleek .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 10]: I must be off to call upon Captain James .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 9]: See to the lad 's food and lodging .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 14]: There 's an order from the gun-room of the _ Hecate _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 7]: So saying , Mr Small departed .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 49]: Mr Sleek asked our hero where he was stopping ; recommended him another lodging close to the house , with directions how to proceed , and what arrangements to make ; told him to haste as much as he could , and then come back to the counting-house .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 11]: In a couple of hours our hero was back again .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 12]: `` Look on this list ; do you understand it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 23]: said Mr Sleek to Joey ; `` it is sea-stock for the _ Hecate _ which sails in a day or two .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 30]: If I send a porter with you to the people we deal with , would you be able to get all these things which are marked with a cross ?
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 10]: the wine and the others we have here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 20]: Joey looked over it , and was quite at home ; it was only bumboating on a large scale .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 33]: `` O , yes ; and I know the prices of all these things , '' replied he ; `` I have been used to the supplying of ships at Gravesend . ''
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 31]: `` Why then , '' said Mr Sleek , `` you are the very person I want ; for I have no time to attend to out-door work now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 31]: The porter was sent for , and our hero soon executed his task , not only with a precision but with a rapidity that was highly satisfactory to Mr Sleek .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 42]: As soon as the articles were all collected , Joey asked whether he should take them on board -- `` I understand the work , Mr Sleek , and not even an egg shall be broke , I promise you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 33]: The second part of the commission was executed with the same precision by our hero , who returned with a receipt of every article having been delivered safe and in good condition .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 20]: Mr Sleek was delighted with our hero , and told Mr Small so when they met in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 28]: Mr Sleek 's opinion was given in the presence of Mrs Phillips and Emma , who exchanged glances of satisfaction at Joey 's fortunate _ debut _ .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 17]: IN WHICH THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE TURNS A SPOKE OR TWO IN FAVOUR OF OUR HERO .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 47]: If we were to analyse the feelings of our hero towards Emma Phillips , we should hardly be warranted in saying that he was in love with her , although at seventeen years young men are very apt to be , or so to fancy themselves .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 146]: The difference in their positions was so great , that , although our hero would , in his dreams , often fancy himself on most intimate terms with his kind little patroness , in his waking thoughts she was more an object of adoration and respect , -- a being to whom he was most ardently and devotedly attached , -- one whose friendship and kindness had so wrought upon his best feelings , that he would have thought it no sacrifice to die for her ; but the idea of ever being closer allied to her than he now was had not yet entered into his imagination ; all he ever thought was that , if ever he united himself to any female for life , the party selected must be like Emma Phillips ; or , if not , he would remain single .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 25]: All his endeavours were to prove himself worthy of her patronage , and to be rewarded by her smiles of encouragement when they met .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 99]: She was the lodestar which guided him on to his path of duty , and , stimulated by his wishes to find favour in her sight , Joey never relaxed in his exertions ; naturally active and methodical , he was indefatigable , and gave the greatest satisfaction to Mr Sleek , who found more than half the labour taken off his hands ; and , further , that if Joey once said a thing should be done , it was not only well done , but done to the very time that was stipulated for its completion .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 19]: Joey cared not for meals , or anything of that kind , and often went without his dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 19]: `` Sleek , '' said Small , one day , `` that poor boy will be starved . ''
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 47]: `` It 's not my fault , sir ; he wo n't go to his dinner if there is anything to do ; and , as there is always something to do , it 's as clear as the day that he can get no dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 35]: I wish he was living in the house altogether , and came to his meals with us after the work was done ; it would be very advantageous , and much time saved . ''
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 7]: `` Time is money , Sleek .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 15]: Time saved is money saved ; and therefore he is worthy of his food .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 5]: It shall be so .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 7]: Do you see to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 58]: Thus , in about two months after his arrival , Joey found himself installed in a nice little bedroom , and living at the table of his patron , not only constantly in company with the naval officers , but , what was of more value to him , in the company of Mrs Phillips and Emma .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 22]: We must pass over more than a year , during which time our hero had become a person of some importance .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 52]: He was a great favourite with the naval captains , as his punctuality and rapidity corresponded with their ideas of doing business ; and it was constantly said to Mr Sleek or to Mr Small , `` Let O'Donahue and I settle the matter , and all will go right . ''
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 30]: Mr Small had already established him at a salary of 150 pounds per annum , besides his living in the house , and our hero was comfortable and happy .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 69]: He was well known to all the officers , from his being constantly on board of their ships , and was a great favourite : Joey soon discovered that Emma had a fancy for natural curiosities ; and as he boarded almost every man-of-war which came into the port , he soon filled her room with a variety of shells and of birds , which he procured her .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 33]: These were presents which he could make , and which she could accept , and not a week passed without our hero adding something to her museum of live and dead objects .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 77]: Indeed , Emma was now grown up , and was paid such attention to by the officers who frequented her uncle 's house -LRB- not only on account of her beauty , but on account of the expectation that her uncle , who was without children , would give her a handsome fortune -RRB- , that some emotions of jealousy , of which he was hardly conscious , would occasionally give severe pain to our hero .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 22]: Perhaps as his fortunes rose , so did his hopes ; certain it is , that sometimes he was very grave .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 49]: Emma was too clear-sighted not to perceive the cause , and hastened , by her little attentions , to remove the feeling : not that she had any definite ideas upon the subject any more than Joey ; but she could not bear to see him look unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 43]: Such was the state of things , when one day Mr Small said to Joey , as he was busy copying an order into the books , `` O'Donahue , I have been laying out some of your money for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 5]: `` Indeed , sir !
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 9]: I 'm very much obliged to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 23]: `` Yes ; there was a large stock of claret sold at auction to-day : it was good , and went cheap .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 13]: I have purchased to the amount of 600 pounds on your account .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 15]: You may bottle and bin it here , and sell it as you can .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 17]: If you do n't like the bargain , I 'll take it off your hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 73]: `` I am very grateful to you , sir , '' replied Joey , who knew the kindness of the act , which in two months more than doubled his capital ; and , as he was permitted to continue the business on his own account , he was very soon in a position amounting to independence , the French wine business being ever afterwards considered as exclusively belonging to our hero .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 27]: One morning , as Joey happened to be in the counting-house by himself -- which was rather an unusual occurrence , -- a midshipman came in .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 14]: Joey remembered him very well , as he had been often there before .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 19]: `` Good morning , Mr O'Donahue , '' said the midshipman ; `` is Mr Small within ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 15]: `` No , he is not ; can I do anything for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 33]: `` Yes , if you can tell me how I am to persuade Mr Small to advance me a little money upon my pay , you can do something for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 16]: `` I never heard of such an application before , '' replied Joey , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 60]: `` No , that I venture you did not , and it requires all the impudence of a midshipman to make such a one ; but the fact is , Mr O'Donahue , I am a mate with 40 pounds a year , and upon that I have continued to assist my poor old mother up to the present .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 17]: She now requires 10 pounds in consequence of illness , and I have not a farthing .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 41]: I will repay it if I live , that is certain ; but I have little hopes of obtaining it , and nothing but my affection for the old lady would induce me to risk the mortification of a refusal .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 15]: It 's true enough that ` he who goes a-borrowing goes a-sorrowing . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 24]: `` I fear it is ; but I will so far assist you as to let you know what your only chance is .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 50]: State your case to Mr Small as you have to me to-day , and then stand close to him while he answers ; if he puts his knuckles into your ribs to enforce his arguments , do n't shrink , and then wait the result without interrupting him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 27]: `` Well , I 'd do more than that for the old lady , '' replied the poor midshipman , as Mr Small made his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 18]: The midshipman told his story in very few words , and Mr Small heard him without interruption .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 44]: When he had finished , Mr Small commenced , `` You see my man , you ask me to do what no navy-agent ever did before -- to lend upon a promise to pay , and that promise to pay from a midshipman .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 23]: In the first place , I have only the promise without the security ; that 's one point , do you observe ?
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 8]: -LRB- A punch with the knuckles . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 16]: And then the promise to pay depends whether you are in the country or not .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 22]: Again , if you have the money , you may not have the inclination to pay ; that 's another point .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 14]: -LRB- Then came another sharp impression into the ribs of the middy . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 57]: Then , again , it is not even personal security , as you may be drowned , shot , blown up , or taken out of the world before any pay is due to you ; and by your death you would be unable to pay , if so inclined ; there 's a third point .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 17]: -LRB- And there was a third dig , which the middy stood boldly up against . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 71]: Insure your life you can not , for you have no money ; you therefore require me to lend my money upon no security whatever ; for even allowing that you would pay if you could , yet your death might prevent it ; there 's another point , -LRB- and the knuckles again penetrated into the midshipman 's side who felt the torture increasing as hope was departing . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 87]: But , '' continued Mr Small , who was evidently much pleased with his own ratiocination , `` there is another point not yet touched upon , which is , that as good Christians , we must sometimes lend money upon no security , or even give it away , for so are we commanded ; and therefore , Mr O'Donahue , you will tell Mr Sleek to let him have the money ; there 's the last and best point of all , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 23]: wound up Mr Small , with a thumping blow upon the ribs of the middy , that almost took away his breath .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 18]: We give this as a specimen of Mr Small 's style of practical and theoretical logic combined .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 28]: `` The admiral , sir , is coming down the street , '' said Sleek , entering , `` and I think he is coming here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 33]: Mr Small , who did not venture to chop logic with admirals , but was excessively polite to such great people , went out to receive the admiral , hat in hand .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 21]: `` Now , Mr Small , '' said the admiral , `` the counting-house for business , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 9]: I have very unexpected orders to leave Portsmouth .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 10]: I must save the next tide , if possible .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 32]: The ships will be ready , for you know what our navy can do when required : but as you know , I have not one atom of stock on board .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 29]: The flood-tide has made almost an hour , and we must sail at the first of the ebb , as twelve hours ' delay may be most serious .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 39]: Now , tell me -- here is the list of what is required ; boats will be ready and men in plenty to get it on board ; -- can you get it ready by that time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 9]: `` By that time , Sir William ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 9]: replied Small , looking over the tremendous catalogue .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 26]: `` It is now eleven o'clock ; can it all be down by four o'clock -- that is the latest I can give you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 7]: `` Impossible , Sir William . ''
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 37]: `` It is of the greatest importance that we sail at five o'clock ; the fact is , I must and will ; but it 's hard that I must starve for a whole cruise . ''
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 42]: `` Indeed , Sir William , '' said Mr Small , `` if it were possible ; but two cows , so many sheep , hay , and everything to be got from the country ; we never could manage it .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 6]: To-morrow morning , perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 30]: `` Well , Mr Small , I have appointed no prize-agent yet ; had you obliged me -- '' Our hero now stepped forward and ran over the list .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 31]: `` Can you inform me , sir , '' said he to the flag-captain , `` whether the _ Zenobia _ or _ Orestes _ sail with the squadron ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 12]: `` No , they do not , '' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 28]: `` I beg your pardon , Mr Small , '' said Joey , `` but I do think we can accomplish this with a little arrangement . ''
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 4]: cried Sir William .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 36]: `` Yes , Sir William ; if you would immediately make the signals for two boats to come on shore , with steady crews to assist me , I promise it shall be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 7]: `` Well said , O'Donahue ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 27]: cried the captain ; `` we are all right now , admiral ; if he says it shall be done , it will be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 11]: `` May I depend upon you , Mr O'Donahue . ''
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 14]: `` Yes , Sir William ; everything shall be as you wish . ''
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 20]: `` Well , Mr Small , if your young man keeps his word , you shall be my prize-agent .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 6]: Good morning to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 7]: `` How could you promise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 17]: cried Small , addressing our hero , when the admiral and suite had left the counting-house .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 62]: `` Because I can perform , sir , '' replied Joey ; `` I have the cows and sheep for the _ Zenobia _ and _ Orestes _ , as well as the fodder , all ready in the town ; we can get others for them to-morrow , and I know where to lay my hands on everything else . ''
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 7]: `` Well , that 's lucky !
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 10]: but there is no time to be lost . ''
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 43]: Our hero , with his usual promptitude and activity , kept his promise ; and , as Mr Small said , it was lucky , for the prize-agency , in a few months afterwards , proved worth to him nearly 5,000 pounds .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 27]: It is not to be supposed that Joey neglected his correspondence either with Mary or Spikeman , although with the latter it was not so frequent .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 30]: Mary wrote to him every month ; she had not many subjects to enter upon , chiefly replying to Joey 's communications , and congratulating him upon his success .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 28]: Indeed , now that our hero had been nearly four years with Mr Small , he might be said to be a very rising and independent person .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 53]: His capital , which had increased very considerably , had been thrown into the business , and he was now a junior partner , instead of a clerk , and had long enjoyed the full confidence both of his superior and of Mr Sleek , who now entrusted him with almost everything .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 14]: In short , Joey was in the fair way to competence and distinction .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 4]: CHAPTER THIRTY NINE .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 17]: CHAPTER OF INFINITE VARIETY , CONTAINING AGONY , LAW , LOVE , QUARRELLING , AND SUICIDE .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 62]: It may be a subject of interest on the part of the reader to inquire what were the relative positions of Emma Phillips and our hero , now that four years had passed , during which time he had been continually in her company , and gradually , as he rose in importance , removing the distance that was between them .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 16]: We have only to reply that the consequences natural to such a case did ensue .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 106]: Every year their intimacy increased -- every year added to the hopes of our hero , who now no longer looked upon an alliance with Emma as impossible ; yet he still never felt sufficient confidence in himself or his fortunes to intimate such a thought to her ; indeed , from a long habit of veneration and respect , he was in the position of a subject before a queen who feels a partiality towards him ; he dared not give vent to his thoughts , and it remained for her to have the unfeminine task of intimating to him that he might venture .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 35]: But , although to outward appearance there was nothing but respect and feelings of gratitude on his part , and condescension and amiability on hers , there was a rapid adhesion going on within .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 100]: Their interviews were more restrained , their words more selected ; for both parties felt how strong were the feelings which they would repress ; they were both pensive , silent , and distant -- would talk unconnectedly , running from one subject to another , attempting to be lively and unconcerned when they were most inclined to be otherwise , and not daring to scrutinise too minutely their own feelings when they found themselves alone ; but what they would fain conceal from themselves their very attempts to conceal made known to other people who were standing by .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 73]: Both Mrs Phillips and Mr Small perceived how matters stood , and , had they any objections , would have immediately no longer permitted them to be in contact ; but they had no objections , for our hero had long won the hearts of both mother and uncle , and they awaited quietly the time which should arrive when the young parties should no longer conceal their feelings for each other .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 33]: It was when affairs were between our hero and Emma Phillips as we have just stated , that a circumstance took place which for a time embittered all our hero 's happiness .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 34]: He was walking down High Street , when he perceived a file of marines marching towards him , with two men between them , handcuffed , evidently deserters who had been taken up .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 53]: A feeling of alarm pervaded our hero ; he had a presentiment which induced him to go into a perfumer 's shop , and to remain there , so as to have a view of the faces of the deserters as they passed along , without their being able to see him .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 20]: His forebodings were correct : one of them was his old enemy and persecutor , Furness , the schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 35]: Had a dagger been plunged into Joey 's bosom , the sensation could not have been more painful than what he felt when he once more found himself so near to his dreaded denouncer .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 29]: For a short time he remained so transfixed , that the woman who was attending in the shop asked whether she should bring him a glass of water .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 61]: This inquiry made him recollect himself , and , complaining of a sudden pain in the side , he sat down , and took the water when it was brought ; but he went home in despair , quite forgetting the business which brought him out , and retired to his own room , that he might collect his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 6]: What was he to do ?
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 24]: This man had been brought back to the barracks ; he would be tried and punished , and afterwards be set at liberty .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 16]: How was it possible that he could always avoid him , or escape being recognised ?
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 14]: and how little chance had he of escape from Furness 's searching eye !
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 5]: Could he bribe him ?
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 39]: Yes , he could now ; he was rich enough ; but , if he did , one bribe would only be followed up by a demand for another , and a threat of denouncement if he refused .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 21]: Flight appeared his only chance ; but to leave his present position -- to leave Emma -- it was impossible .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 31]: Our hero did not leave his room for the remainder of the day , but retired early to bed , that he might cogitate , for sleep he could not .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 71]: After a night of misery , the effects of which were too visibly marked in his countenance on the ensuing morning , Joey determined to make some inquiries relative to what the fate of Furness might be ; and , having made up his mind , he accosted a sergeant of marines , with whom he had a slight acquaintance , and whom he fell in with in the streets .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 28]: He observed to him that he perceived they had deserters brought in yesterday , and inquired from what ship they had deserted , or from the barracks .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 65]: The sergeant replied that they had deserted from the _ Niobe _ frigate , and had committed theft previous to desertion ; that they would remain in confinement at the barracks till the _ Niobe _ arrived ; and that then they would be tried by a court-martial , and , without doubt , for the double offence , would go through the fleet .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 15]: Joey wished the sergeant good morning , and passed on in his way home .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 27]: His altered appearance had attracted the notice of not only his partners , but of Mrs Phillips , and had caused much distress to the latter .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 29]: Our hero remained the whole day in the counting-house , apparently unconcerned , but in reality thinking and rethinking , over and over again , his former thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 32]: At last he made up his mind that he would wait the issue of the court-martial before he took any decided steps ; indeed , what to do he knew not .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 32]: We leave the reader to guess the state of mind in which Joey remained for a fortnight previous to the return of the _ Niobe _ frigate from a Channel cruise .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 14]: Two days after her arrival , the signal was made for a court-martial .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 25]: The sentence was well known before night ; it was , that the culprits were to go through the fleet on the ensuing day .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 44]: This was , however , no consolation to our hero ; he did not feel animosity against Furness so much as he did dread of him ; he did not want his punishment , but his absence , and security against future annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 27]: It was about nine o'clock on the next morning , when the punishment was to take place , that Joey came down from his own room .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 58]: He had been thinking all night , and had decided that he had no other resource but to quit Portsmouth , Emma , and his fair prospects for ever ; he had resolved so to do , to make this sacrifice ; it was a bitter conclusion to arrive at , but it had been come to .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 24]: His haggard countenance when he made his appearance at the breakfast-table , shocked Mrs Phillips and Emma ; but they made no remarks .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 43]: The breakfast was passed over in silence , and soon afterwards our hero found himself alone with Emma , who immediately went to him , and , with tears in her eyes , said , `` What is the matter with you ?
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 19]: -- you look so ill , you alarm us all , and you make me quite miserable . ''
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 14]: `` I am afraid , Miss Phillips -- '' `` Miss Phillips ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 3]: replied Emma .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 20]: `` I beg your pardon ; but , Emma , I am afraid that I must leave you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 5]: `` Leave us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 13]: `` Yes , leave you and Portsmouth for ever , perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 8]: `` Why , what has occurred ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 9]: `` I can not , dare not tell .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 27]: Will you so far oblige me to say nothing at present ; but you recollect that I was obliged to leave Gravesend on a sudden . ''
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 23]: `` I recollect you did , but why I know not ; only Mary said that it was not your fault . ''
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 14]: `` I trust it was not so ; but it was my misfortune .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 51]: Emma , I am almost distracted ; I have not slept for weeks ; but pray believe me , when I say that I have done no wrong ; indeed -- '' `` We are interrupted , '' said Emma , hurriedly ; `` there is somebody coming upstairs . ''
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 28]: She had hardly time to remove a few feet from our hero , when Captain B -- , of the _ Niobe _ , entered the room .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 48]: `` Good morning , Miss Phillips , I hope you are well ; I just looked in for a moment before I go to the Admiral 's office ; we have had a catastrophe on board the _ Niobe _ , which I must report immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 16]: `` Indeed , '' replied Emma ; `` nothing very serious , I hope . ''
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 53]: `` Why , no , only rid of a blackguard not worth hanging ; one of the marines , who was to have gone round the fleet this morning , when he went to the forepart of the ship under the sentry 's charge , leaped overboard , and drowned himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 11]: `` What was his name , Captain B -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 9]: inquired Joey , seizing him by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 14]: `` His name -- why , how can that interest you , O'Donahue ?
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 13]: Well , if you wish to know , it was Furness . ''
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 53]: `` I am very sorry for him , '' replied our hero ; `` I knew him once when he was in better circumstances , that is all ; '' and Joey , no longer daring to trust himself with others , quitted the room , and went to his own apartment .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 35]: As soon as he was there , he knelt down and returned thanks , not for the death of Furness , but for the removal of the load which had so oppressed his mind .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 33]: In an hour his relief was so great that he felt himself sufficiently composed to go downstairs ; he went into the drawing-room to find Emma , but she was not there .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 23]: He longed to have some explanation with her , but it was not until the next day that he had an opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 26]: `` I hardly know what to say to you , '' said our hero , `` or how to explain my conduct of yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 24]: `` It certainly appeared very strange , especially to Captain B -- , who told me that he thought you were mad . ''
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 38]: `` I care little what he thinks , but I care much what you think , Emma ; and I must now tell you what , perhaps , this man 's death may permit me to do .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 87]: That he has been most strangely connected with my life is most true ; he it was who knew me , and who would , if he could , have put me in a situation in which I must either have suffered myself to be thought guilty of a crime which I am incapable of ; or , let it suffice to say , have done , to exculpate myself , what , I trust , I never would have done , or ever will do .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 31]: I can say no more than that , without betraying a secret which I am bound to keep , and the keeping of which may still prove my own destruction .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 50]: When you first saw me on the wayside , Emma , it was this man who forced me from a happy home to wander about the world ; it was the reappearance of this man , and his recognition of me that induced me to quit Gravesend so suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 38]: I again met him , and avoided him when he was deserting ; and I trusted that , as he had deserted , I could be certain of living safely in this town without meeting with him .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 75]: It was his reappearance here , as a deserter taken up , which put me in that state of agony which you have seen me in for these last three weeks ; and it was the knowledge that , after his punishment , he would be again free , and likely to meet with me when walking about here , which resolved me to quit Portsmouth , as I said to you yesterday morning .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 35]: Can you , therefore , be surprised at my emotion when I heard that he was removed , and that there was now no necessity for my quitting my kind patrons and you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 65]: `` Certainly , after this explanation , I can not be surprised at your emotion ; but what does surprise me , Mr O'Donahue , is that you should have a secret of such importance that it can not be revealed , and which has made you tremble at the recognition of that man , when at the same time you declare your innocence .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 11]: Did innocence and mystery ever walk hand in hand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 31]: `` Your addressing me as Mr O'Donahue , Miss Phillips , has pointed out to me the impropriety I have been guilty of in making use of your Christian name .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 43]: I thought that that confidence which you placed in me when , as a mere boy , I told you exactly what I now repeat , that the secret was not my own , would not have been now so cruelly withdrawn .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 85]: I have never varied in my tale , and I can honestly say that I have never felt degraded when I have admitted that I have a mystery connected with me ; nay , if it should please Heaven that I have the option given me to suffer in my own person , or reveal the secret in question , I trust that I shall submit to my fate with constancy , and be supported in my misfortune by the conviction of my innocence .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 24]: I feel that I was not wrong in the communication that I made to you yesterday morning that I must leave this place .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 90]: I came here because you were living here -- you to whom I felt so devoted for your kindness and sympathy when I was poor and friendless ; now that I am otherwise , you are pleased to withdraw not only your good will , but your confidence in me ; and as the spell is broken which has drawn me to this spot , I repeat , that as soon as I can , with justice to my patrons , I shall withdraw myself from your presence . ''
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 26]: Our hero 's voice faltered before he had finished speaking ; and then turning away slowly , without looking up , he quitted the room .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 3]: CHAPTER FORTY .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 9]: IN WHICH OUR HERO TRIES CHANGE OF AIR .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 19]: The reader will observe that there has been a little altercation at the end of the last chapter .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 21]: Emma Phillips was guilty of letting drop a received truism , or rather a metaphor , which offended our hero .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 12]: `` Did innocence and mystery ever walk hand in hand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 34]: If Emma had put that question to us , we , from our knowledge of the world , should have replied , `` Yes , very often , my dear Miss Phillips . ''
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 20]: But Emma was wrong , not only in her metaphor , but in the time of her making it .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 6]: Why did she do so ?
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 60]: that is a puzzling question to answer ; we can only say , at our imminent risk , when this narrative shall be perused by the other sex , that we have made the discovery that women are not perfect ; that the very best of the sex are full of contradiction , and that Emma was a woman .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 44]: That women very often are more endowed than the generality of men we are ready to admit ; and their cause has been taken up by Lady Morgan , Mrs Jamieson , and many others who can write much better than we can .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 24]: When we say their cause , we mean the right of equality they would claim with our sex and not subjection to it .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 60]: Reading my Lady Morgan the other day , which , next to conversing with her , is one of the greatest treats we know of we began to speculate upon what were the causes which had subjected woman to man ; in other words , how was it that man had got the upper hand , and kept it ?
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 31]: That women 's minds were not inferior to men 's we were forced to admit ; that their aptitude for cultivation is often greater , was not to be denied .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 66]: As to the assertion that man makes laws , or that his frame is of more robust material , it is no argument , as a revolt on the part of the other sex would soon do away with such advantage ; and men , brought up as nursery-maids , would soon succumb to women who were accustomed to athletic sports from their youth upwards .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 44]: After a great deal of cogitation we came to the conclusion , that there is a great difference between the action in the minds of men and women ; the machinery of the latter being more complex than that of our own sex .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 31]: A man 's mind is his despot : it works but by one single action ; it has one ruling principle -- one propelling power to which all is subservient .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 54]: This power or passion -LRB- disguised and dormant as it may be in feeble minds -RRB- is the only one which propels him on ; this _ primum mobile _ , as it may be termed , is ambition , or , in other words , self-love ; everything is sacrificed to it .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 114]: Now , as in proportion as a machine is simple so is it strong in its action -- so in proportion that a machine is complex , it becomes weak ; and if we analyse a woman 's mind , we shall find that her inferiority arises from the simple fact , that there are so many wheels within wheels working in it , so many compensating balances -LRB- if we may use the term , and we use it to her honour -RRB- , that although usually more right-minded than man , her strength of action is lost , and has become feeble by the time that her decision has been made .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 16]: What will a man allow to stand in the way of his ambition -- love ?
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 4]: no -- friendship ?
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 28]: no -- he will sacrifice the best qualities , and , which is more difficult , make the worst that are in his disposition subservient to it .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 23]: He moves only one great principle , one propelling power -- and the action being single , it is strong in proportion .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 11]: But will a woman 's mind decide in this way ?
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 15]: Will she sacrifice to ambition , love , or friendship , or natural ties ?
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 35]: No ; in her mind the claims of each are , generally speaking , fairly balanced -- and the quotient , after the calculation has been worked out , although correct , is small .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 104]: Our argument , after all , only goes to prove that women , abstractedly taken , have more principle , more conscience , and better regulated minds than men -- which is true if -- if they could always go correct as timekeepers ; but the more complex the machine , the more difficult it is to keep it in order , the more likely it is to be out of repair , and its movements to be disarranged by a trifling shock , which would have no effect upon one of such simple and powerful construction as that in our own sex .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 33]: Not only do they often go wrong , but sometimes the serious shocks which they are liable to in this world will put them in a state which is past all repair .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 27]: We have no doubt that by this time the reader will say , `` Never mind women 's minds , but mind your own business . ''
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 42]: We left Emma in the drawing-room , rather astonished at our hero 's long speech , and still more by his -LRB- for the first time during their acquaintance -RRB- venturing to breathe a contrary opinion to her own sweet self .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 30]: Emma Phillips , although she pouted a little , and the colour had mounted to her temples , nevertheless looked very lovely as she pensively reclined on the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 58]: Rebuked by him who had always been so attentive , so submissive -- her creature as it were -- she was mortified , as every pretty woman is , at any loss of power -- any symptoms of rebellion on the part of a liege vassal ; and then she taxed herself ; had she done wrong ?
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 16]: She had said , `` Innocence and mystery did not walk hand in hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 5]: Was not that true ?
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 37]: She felt that it was true , and her own opinion was corroborated by others , for she had read it in some book , either in Burke , or Rochefoucault , or some great author .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 12]: Miss Phillips bit the tip of her nail and thought again .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 74]: Yes , she saw how it was ; our hero had risen in the world , was independent , and was well received in society ; he was no longer the little Joey of Gravesend ; he was now a person of some consequence , and he was a very ungrateful fellow ; but the world was full of ingratitude ; still she did think better of our hero ; she certainly did .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 14]: Well ; at all events she could prove to him that -- what ?
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 7]: -- she did not exactly know .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 12]: Thus ended cogitation the second , after which came another series .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 13]: What had our hero said -- what had he accused her of ?
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 16]: That she no longer bestowed on him her confidence placed in him for many years .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 17]: This was true ; but were not the relative positions , was not the case different ?
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 9]: Should he now retain any secret from her ?
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 9]: -- there should be no secrets between them .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 13]: There again there was a full stop before the sentence was complete .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 52]: After a little more reflection , her own generous mind pointed out to her that she had been in the wrong ; and that our hero had cause to be offended with her ; and she made up her mind to make reparation the first time that they should be alone .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 45]: Having come to this resolution , she dismissed the previous question , and began to think about the secret itself , and what it possibly could be , and how she wished she knew what it was ; all of which was very natural .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 21]: In the meantime our hero had made up his mind to leave Portsmouth , for a time at all events .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 31]: This quarrel with Emma , if such it might be considered , had made him very miserable , and the anxiety he had lately suffered had seriously affected his health .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 69]: We believe that there never was anybody in this world who had grown to man 's or woman 's estate and had mixed with the world , who could afterwards say that they were at any time perfectly happy ; or who , having said so , did not find that the reverse was the case a moment or two after the words were out of their mouth .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 26]: `` There is always something , '' as a good lady said to us ; and so there always is , and always will be .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 47]: The removal of Furness was naturally a great relief to the mind of our hero ; he then felt as if all his difficulties were surmounted , and that he had no longer any fear of the consequences which might ensue from his father 's crime .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 44]: He would now , he thought , be able to walk boldly through the world without recognition , and he had built castles enough to form a metropolis when his rupture with Emma broke the magic mirror through which he had scanned futurity .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 24]: When most buoyant with hope , he found the truth of the good lady 's saying -- `` There is always something . ''
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 41]: After remaining in his room for an hour , Joey went down to the counting-house , where he found Mr Small and Mr Sleek both at work , for their labours had increased since Joey had so much neglected business .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 14]: `` Well , my good friend , how do you find yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 4]: said Mr Small .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 8]: `` Very far from well , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 55]: I feel that I can not attend to business , '' replied Joey , `` and I am quite ashamed of myself ; I was thinking that , if you had no objection to allow me a couple of months ' leave of absence , change of air would be very serviceable to me .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 21]: I have something to do at Dudstone , which I have put off ever since I came to Portsmouth . ''
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 37]: `` I think change of air would be very serviceable to you , my dear fellow , '' replied Mr Small ; `` but what business you can have at Dudstone I can not imagine . ''
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 41]: `` Simply this -- I locked up my apartments , leaving my furniture , books , and linen , when I went away , more than four years ago , and have never found time to look after them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 60]: `` Well , they must want dusting by this time , O'Donahue , so look after them if you please ; but I think looking after your health is of more consequence , so you have my full consent to take a holiday , and remain away three months , if necessary , till you are perfectly re-established . ''
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 24]: `` And you have mine , '' added Mr Sleek , `` and I will do your work while you are away . ''
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 40]: Our hero thanked his senior partners for their kind compliance with his wishes , and stated his intention of starting the next morning by the early coach , and then left the counting-house to make preparations for his journey .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 12]: Joey joined the party , which was numerous , at dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 30]: It was not until they were in the drawing-room after dinner , that Mr Small had an opportunity of communicating to Mrs Phillips what were our hero 's intentions .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 33]: Mrs Phillips considered it a very advisable measure , as Joey had evidently suffered very much lately : probably over-exertion might have been the cause , and relaxation would effect the cure .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 44]: Emma , who was sitting by her mother , turned pale ; she had not imagined that our hero would have followed up his expressed intentions of the morning , and she asked Mr Small if he knew when O'Donahue would leave Portsmouth .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 34]: The reply was , that he had taken his place on the early coach of the next morning : and Emma fell back on the sofa , and did not say anything more .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 29]: When the company had all left , Mrs Phillips rose and lighted a chamber candlestick to go to bed , and Emma followed the motions of her mother .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 26]: Mrs Phillips shook hands with our hero , wishing him a great deal of pleasure , and that he would return quite restored in health .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 53]: Emma , who found that all chance of an interview with our hero was gone , mustered up courage enough to extend her hand and say , -- `` I hope your absence will be productive of health and happiness to you , Mr O'Donahue , '' and then followed her mother .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 46]: Joey , who , was in no humour for conversation , then bade farewell to Mr Small and Mr Sleek , and , before Emma had risen from not a very refreshing night 's rest , he was two stages on his way from Portsmouth .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 12]: IN WHICH OUR HERO HAS HIS HEAD TURNED THE WRONG WAY .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 112]: Although it may be very proper , when an offence has been offered us , to show that we feel the injury , it often happens that we act too much upon impulse and carry measures to extremities ; and this our hero felt as the coach wheeled him along , every second increasing his distance from Emma Phillips ; twenty times he was inclined to take a postchaise and return , but the inconsistency would have been so glaring , that shame prevented him ; so he went on until he reached the metropolis , and on arriving there , having nothing better to do , he went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 52]: The next day he booked himself for the following day 's coach to Manstone , and having so done , he thought he would reconnoitre the domicile of Major and Mrs McShane , and , now that Furness was no longer to be dreaded , make his existence known to them .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 99]: He went to Holborn accordingly , and found the shop in the same place , with the usual enticing odour sent forth from the grating which gave light and air to the kitchen ; but he perceived that there was no longer the name of McShane on the private door , and entering the coffee-room , and looking towards the spot where Mrs McShane usually stood carving the joint , he discovered a person similarly employed whose face was unknown to him ; in fact , it could not be Mrs McShane , as it was a man .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 30]: Our hero went up to him , and inquired if the McShanes still carried on the business , and was told that they had sold it some time back .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 30]: His next inquiry , as to what had become of them , produced an `` I do n't know , '' with some symptoms of impatience at being interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 25]: Under such circumstances , our hero had nothing more to do but either to sit down and eat beef or to quit the premises .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 37]: He preferred the latter , and was once more at the hotel , where he dedicated the remainder of the day to thinking of his old friends , as fate had debarred him from seeing them .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 19]: The next morning Joey set off by the coach , and arrived at Manstone a little before dusk .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 90]: He remained at the principal inn of the village , called the Austin Arms , in honour of the property in the immediate vicinity ; and , having looked at the various quarterings of arms that the signboard contained , without the slightest idea that they appertained to himself , he ordered supper , and looking out of the window of the first floor , discovered , at no great distance down the one street which composed the village , the small ale-house where he had before met Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 57]: Our hero no longer felt the pride of poverty ; he had resented the treatment he had received at the Hall when friendless , but , now that he was otherwise , he had overcome the feeling , and had resolved to go up to the Hall on the following day , and ask for Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 40]: He was now well dressed and with all the appearance and manners of a gentleman : and , moreover , he had been so accustomed to respect from servants , that he had no idea of being treated otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 52]: The next morning , therefore , he walked up to the Hall , and , knocking at the door , as soon as it was opened , he told the well-powdered domestics that he wished to speak a few words to Miss Atherton , if she still lived with Mrs Austin .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 42]: His appearance was considered by these gentlemen in waiting as sufficient to induce them to show him into a parlour , and to send for Mary , who in a few minutes came down to him , and embraced him tenderly .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 32]: `` I should hardly have known you , my dear boy , '' said she , as the tears glistened in her eyes ; `` you have grown quite a man .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 29]: I can not imagine , as you now stand before me , that you could have been the little Joey that was living at Mrs Chopper 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 16]: `` We are indebted to that good woman for our prosperity , '' replied Joey .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 34]: `` Do you know , Mary , that your money has multiplied so fast that I almost wish that you would take it away , lest by some accident it should be lost ?
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 8]: I have brought you an account . ''
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 33]: `` Let me have an account of yourself , my dear brother , '' replied Mary ; `` I have no want of money ; I am here well and happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 23]: `` So you must have been , for you look as young and handsome as when I last saw you , Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 6]: How is your mistress ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 42]: `` She is well , and would , I think , be happy , if it were not for the strange disease of Mr Austin , who secludes himself entirely , and will not even go outside of the park gates .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 24]: He has become more overbearing and haughty than ever , and several of the servants have quitted within the last few months . ''
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 21]: `` I have no wish to meet him , dear Mary , after what passed when I was here before ?
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 22]: I will not put up with insolence from any man , even in his own house , '' replied our hero .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 43]: `` Do not speak so loud , his study is next to us , and that door leads to it , '' replied Mary ; `` he would not say anything to you , but he would find fault with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 20]: `` Then you had better come to see me at the Austin Arms , where I am stopping . ''
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 11]: `` I will come this evening , '' replied Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 36]: At this moment the door which led to the study was opened , and a voice was heard -- `` Mary , I wish you would take your sweethearts to a more convenient distance . ''
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 41]: Joey heard the harsh , hollow voice , but recognised it not ; he would not turn round to look at Mr Austin , but remained with his back to him , and the door closed again with a bang .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 23]: `` Well , '' observed Joey , `` that is a pretty fair specimen of what he is , at all events .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 11]: Why did you not say I was your brother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 22]: `` Because it was better to say nothing , '' replied Mary ; `` he will not come in again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 28]: `` Well , I shall leave you now , '' said Joey , `` and wait till the evening ; you will be certain to come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 12]: `` O yes , I certainly shall , '' replied Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 3]: `` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 8]: I hear my mistress with Mr Austin .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 15]: I wish you could see her , you would like her very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 32]: The outer door of the study was closed to , and then the door of the room in which they were conversing was opened , but it was shut again immediately .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 6]: `` Who was that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 12]: said our hero , who had not turned round to ascertain .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 40]: `` Mrs Austin ; she just looked in , and seeing I was engaged , she only nodded to me to say that she wanted me , I presume , and then went away again , '' replied Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 19]: `` You had better go now , and I will be sure to come in the evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 52]: Our hero quitted the hall ; he had evidently been in the presence of his father and mother without knowing it , and all because he happened on both occasions to have his face turned in a wrong direction , and he left the house as unconscious as he went in .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 16]: As soon as our hero had left the hall , Mary repaired to her mistress .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 9]: `` Do you want me , madam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 10]: said Mary , as she went to her mistress .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 37]: `` No , Mary , not particular , but Mr Austin sent for me ; he was annoyed at your having a strange person in the house , and desired me to send him away . ''
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 12]: `` It was my brother , madam , '' replied Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 4]: `` Your brother !
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 24]: I am very sorry , Mary , but you know how nervous Mr Austin is , and there is no reasoning against nerves .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 32]: I should have liked to have seen your brother very much ; if I recollect rightly , you told me he was doing well at Portsmouth , is he not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 19]: `` Yes , madam ; he is now a partner in one of the first houses there . ''
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 51]: `` Why , Mary , he will soon have you to keep his own house , I presume , and I shall lose you ; indeed , your are more fit for such a situation than your present one , so I must not regret it if you do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 34]: `` He has no idea of taking a house , madam , '' replied Mary , `` nor have I any of quitting you ; your place is quite good enough for me .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 21]: I promised to go down and meet him this evening , with your permission , at the Austin Arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 14]: `` Certainly , '' replied Mrs Austin ; and then the conversation dropped .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 71]: Our hero remained at the inn two days , a portion of which Mary passed with him , and then he set off for Dudstone ; he did not make Mary a confident of his attachment to Emma Phillips , although he imparted to her the death of Furness , and the relief it had afforded him , promising to return to see her before he went back to Portsmouth .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 117]: Joey once more set off on his travels , and without incident arrived at the good old town of Dudstone , where he put up at the Commercial Hotel ; his only object was , to ascertain the condition of his lodgings : for the first two years he had sent the rent of the room to the old woman to whom the house belonged , but latterly no application had been made for it , although his address had been given ; and , occupied by other business more important , our hero had quite forgotten the affair , or if he did occasionally recall it to his memory , it was soon dismissed again .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 87]: His key he had brought with him , and he now proceeded to the house and knocked at the door , surmising that the old woman was possibly dead , and his property probably disposed of ; the first part of the surmise was disproved by the old woman coming to the door ; she did not recognise our hero , and it was not until he produced the key of his room that she was convinced that he was the lawful owner of its contents .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 110]: She told him she could not write herself , and that the party who had written to Portsmouth for her was dead , and that she felt sure he would come back at some time and settle with her ; and , moreover , she was afraid that the furniture would be much injured by having been shut up so long , which was not only very likely , but proved to be the case when the door was opened ; she also said that she could have made money for him , had he allowed her to let the lodgings furnished , as she had had several applications .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 17]: Our hero walked into his apartment , which certainly had a very mothy and mouldy appearance .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 127]: As soon as a fire had been lighted , he collected all that he wanted to retain for himself , the books , plate , and some other articles , which he valued for Spikeman 's sake , and as old reminiscences , and putting them up in a chest , requested that it might be sent to the inn ; and then , upon reflection , he thought he could do no better with the remainder than to make them a present to the old woman , which he did , after paying up her arrears of rent , and by so doing made one person , for the time , superlatively happy , which is something worth doing in this chequered world of ours .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 62]: Joey , as soon as he had returned to the inn , sat down to write to Spikeman , and also to Mr Small , at Portsmouth , and having posted his letters , as he did not quit Dudstone until the next morning , he resolved to pay a visit to his former acquaintances , Miss Amelia and Miss Ophelia .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 41]: His knock at the door was answered by Miss Amelia , as usual , but with only one arm unoccupied , a baby being in the other , and the squalling in the little parlour gave further evidence of matrimony .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 32]: Our hero was obliged to introduce himself , as he was stared at as an utter stranger ; he was then immediately welcomed , and requested to walk into the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 13]: In a few minutes the whole of the family history was communicated .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 26]: The old lady had been dead three years , and at her death the young ladies found themselves in possession of one thousand pounds each .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 20]: This thousand pounds proved to them that husbands were to be had , even at Dudstone and its vicinity .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 47]: Miss Amelia had been married more than two years to a master builder , who had plenty of occupation , not so much in building new houses at Dudstone as in repairing the old ones , and they were doing well , and had two children .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 33]: Her sister had married a young farmer , and she could see her money every day in the shape of bullocks and sheep upon the farm ; they also were doing well .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 57]: Joey remained an hour : Mrs Potts was very anxious that he should remain longer , and give her his opinion of her husband ; but this , Joey declined , and , desiring to be kindly remembered to her sister , took his leave , and the next morning was on his way to London .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 4]: VERY PLEASANT CORRESPONDENCE .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 24]: As soon as Joey arrived at the metropolis , he went to the correspondent of the house at Portsmouth to inquire for letters .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 125]: He found one of the greatest interest from Mr Small , who , after some preliminaries relative to the business and certain commissions for him to transact in town , proceeded as follows : -- `` Your health has been a source of great anxiety to us all , not only in the counting-house , but in the drawing-room ; the cause of your illness was ascribed to over-exertion in your duties , and it must be admitted , that until you were ill there was no relaxation on your part ; but we have reason to suppose that there have been other causes which may have occasioned your rapid change from activity and cheerfulness to such a total prostration of body and mind .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 36]: You may feel grieved when I tell you that Emma has been very unwell since you left , and the cause of her illness is beyond the skill of Mr Taylor , our medical man .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 30]: She has , however , confided so much to her mother as to let us know that you are the party who has been the chief occasion of it .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 40]: She has acknowledged that she has not behaved well to you , and has not done you justice ; and I really believe that it is this conviction which is the chief ground of her altered state of health .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 54]: I certainly have been too much in the counting-house to know what has been going on in the parlour , but I think that you ought to know us better than to suppose that we should not in every point be most anxious for your happiness , and your being constantly with us .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 26]: That Emma blames herself is certain ; that she is very amiable , is equally so ; your return would give us the greatest satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 68]: I hardly need say I love my niece , and am anxious for her happiness ; I love you , my dear friend , and am equally anxious for yours ; and I do trust that any trifling disagreement between you -LRB- for surely you must be on intimate terms to quarrel , and for her to feel the quarrel so severely -RRB- will be speedily overcome .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 67]: From what her mother says , I think that her affections are seriously engaged -LRB- I treat you with the confidence I am sure you deserve -RRB- , and I am sure that there is no one upon whom I would so willingly bestow my niece ; or as I find by questioning , no one to whom Mrs Phillips would so willingly entrust her daughter .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 34]: If ; then , I am right in my supposition , you will be received with open arms by all , not even excepting Emma -- she has no coquetry in her composition .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 61]: Like all the rest of us , she has her faults ; but if she has her faults , she is not too proud to acknowledge them , and that you will allow when you read the enclosed , which she has requested me to send to you , and at the same time desired me to read it first .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 18]: I trust this communication will accelerate your recovery , and that we shall soon see you again .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 26]: At all events , answer my letter , and if I am in error , let me know , that I may undeceive others . ''
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 57]: The enclosure from Emma was then opened by our hero ; it was in few words : -- `` My dear friend , -- On reflection , I consider that I have treated you unjustly ; I intended to tell you so , if I had had an opportunity , before you quitted us so hastily .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 50]: My fault has preyed upon my mind ever since , and I can not lose this first opportunity of requesting your forgiveness , and hoping that when we meet we shall be on the same friendly terms that we always had been previous to my unfortunate ebullition of temper .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 7]: -- Yours truly , EMMA . ''
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 18]: That this letter was a source of unqualified delight to our hero , may be easily imagined .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 30]: He was at once told by the uncle , and certainly Emma did not leave him to suppose the contrary , that he might aspire and obtain her hand .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 12]: Our hero could not reply to it by return of post .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 63]: If distress had occasioned his illness , joy now prostrated him still more ; and he was compelled to return to his bed ; but he was happy , almost too happy , and he slept at last , and he dreamt such visions as only can be conjured up by those who have in anticipation every wish of their heart gratified .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 76]: The next day he replied to Mr Small 's , acknowledging , with frankness , his feelings towards his niece , which a sense of his own humble origin and unworthiness had prevented him from venturing to disclose , and requesting him to use his influence in his favour , as he dared not speak himself ; until he had received such assurance of his unmerited good fortune as might encourage him so to do .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 108]: To Emma , his reply was in a few words ; he thanked her for her continued good opinion of him , the idea of having lost which had made him very miserable , assuring her that he was ashamed of the petulance which he had shown , and that it was for him to have asked pardon , and not one who had behaved so kindly , and protected him for so long a period ; that he felt much better already , and hoped to be able to shorten the time of absence which had been demanded by him and kindly granted by his patrons .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 20]: Having concluded and despatched these epistles , our hero determined that he would take a stroll about the metropolis .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 20]: A VERY LONG CHAPTER , WITH A VERY LONG STORY , WHICH COULD NOT WELL BE CUT IN HALF .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 78]: A man may walk a long while in the city of London without having any definite object , and yet be amused , for there are few occupations more pleasant , more instructive , or more contemplative , than looking into the shop windows ; you pay a shilling to see an exhibition , whereas in this instance you have the advantage of seeing many without paying a farthing , provided that you look after your pocket-handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 90]: Thus was our hero amused : at one shop he discovered that very gay shawls were to be purchased for one pound , Bandanas at 3 shillings 9 pence , and soiled Irish linen remarkably cheap ; at another he saw a row of watches , from humble silver at 2 pounds 10 shillings , to gold and enamelled at twelve or fourteen guineas , all warranted to go well ; at another he discovered that furs were at half price , because nobody wore them in the summer .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 37]: He proceeded further , and came to where there was a quantity of oil-paintings exposed for sale , pointing out to the passer-by that pictures of that description were those which he ought not to buy .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 52]: A print-shop gave him an idea of the merits of composition and design shown by the various masters ; and as he could not transport himself to the Vatican , it was quite as well to see what the Vatican contained ; his thoughts were on Rome and her former glories .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 20]: A tobacconist 's transported him to the State of Virginia , where many had been transported in former days .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 33]: A grocer 's wafted him still farther to the West Indies and the negroes , and from these , as if by magic , to the Spice Islands and their aromatic groves .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 83]: But an old curiosity-shop , with bronzes , china , marqueterie , point-lace , and armour , embraced at once a few centuries ; and he thought of the feudal times , the fifteenth century , the belle of former days , the amber-headed cane and snuff box of the beaux who sought her smiles , all gone , all dust ; the workmanship of the time , even portions of their dresses , still existing -- everything less perishable than man .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 65]: Our hero proceeded on , his thoughts wandering as he wandered himself , when his attention was attracted by one of those placards , the breed of which appears to have been very much improved of late , as they get larger and larger every day ; what they will end in there is no saying , unless it be in placards without end .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 25]: This placard intimated that there was a masquerade at Vauxhall on that evening , besides tire-works , water-works , and anything but good works .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 34]: Our hero had heard of Vauxhall , and his curiosity was excited , and he resolved that he would pass away the evening in what was at that time a rather fashionable resort .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 66]: It was half past six , and time to go , so he directed his steps over Westminster-bridge , and , having only lost three minutes in peeping through the balustrades at the barges and wherries proceeding up and down the river , after asking his way three times , he found himself at the entrance , and , paying his admission , walked in .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 43]: There was a goodly sprinkling of company , but not many masks ; there was a man clad in brass armour , who stood quite motionless , for the armour was so heavy that he could hardly bear the weight of it .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 44]: He must have suffered a very great inconvenience on such a warm night , but people stared at him as they passed by , and he was more than repaid by the attention which he attracted ; so he stood and suffered on .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 25]: There were about twenty-five clowns in their motley dresses , seven or eight pantaloons , three devils , and perhaps forty or fifty dominoes .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 58]: Joey soon found himself close to the orchestra , which was a blaze of light , and he listened very attentively to a lady in ostrich feathers , who was pouring out a bravura , which was quite unintelligible to the audience , while the gentlemen behind her , in their cocked hats , accompanied her voice .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 67]: He was leaning against one of the trees , and receiving , without knowing it , the drippings of a leaky lamp upon his coat , when two men came up and stopped on the other side of the trunk of the tree , and one said to the other -- `` I tell you , Joseph , she is here , and with the Christian .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 10]: Manasseh traced her by the driver of the coach .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 19]: She will never return to her father 's house if we do not discover her this night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 12]: will she become a _ Meshumed _ -- an apostate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 14]: exclaimed the other ; `` I would see her in her grave first .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 3]: Holy Father !
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 13]: the daughter of a rabbi to bring such disgrace upon her family !
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 19]: Truly our sins , and the sins of our forefathers , have brought this evil upon our house .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 15]: If I meet him here I will stab him to the heart ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 5]: _ Leemaan Hashem _ !
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 24]: for the sake of the holy name , my son , think of what you say ; you must not be so rash .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 2]: alas !
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 8]: but we are mixed with the heathens .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 35]: She must be concealed in one of the Moabitish garments , '' continued the elder of the two personages , whom our hero had of course ascertained to be of the house of Israel .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 29]: `` Manasseh tells me that he has discovered from another quarter , that the Christian had procured a domino , black , with the sleeves slashed with white .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 34]: That will be a distinguishing mark ; and if we see that dress we must then follow , and if a female is with it , it must be thy sister Miriam . ''
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 23]: `` I will search now , and meet you here in half an hour , '' replied the younger of the two .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 35]: `` Joseph , my son , we do not part ; I can not trust you in your anger , and you have weapons with you , I know ; we must go together .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 3]: Rooch Hakodesh !
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 32]: may the Holy Spirit guide us , and the daughter of our house be restored , for she is now my heart 's bitterness , and my soul 's sorrow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 14]: `` Let me but discover the _ Gaw _ -- the infidel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 25]: replied the son , following the father ; and our hero observed him put his hand into his breast and half unsheath a poniard .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 39]: Joey easily comprehended how the matter stood : a Jewish maiden had met by assignation or had been run away with by some young man , and the father and son were in pursuit to recover the daughter .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 42]: `` That is all very well , '' thought our hero ; `` but although they may very properly wish to prevent the marriage , I do not much like the cold steel which the young Israelite had in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 88]: If I do meet with the party , at all events I will give him warning ; '' and Joey , having made this resolution , turned away from the orchestra and went down the covered way , which led to what are usually termed the dark walks he had just arrived at the commencement of them , when he perceived coming towards him two dominoes , the shorter hanging on the arm of the taller so as to assure him that they were male and female .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 31]: When they came to within ten yards of the lighted walk , they turned abruptly , and then Joey perceived that the taller had white slashed sleeves to his domino .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 39]: `` There they are , '' thought our hero ; `` well , it 's not safe for them to walk here , for a murder might be committed without much chance of the party being found out .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 25]: I will give them a hint , at all events ; '' and Joey followed the couple so as to overtake them by degrees .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 42]: As he walked softly , and they were in earnest conversation , his approach was not heeded until within a few feet of them , when the taller domino turned impatiently round , as if to inquire what the intruder meant .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 37]: `` You are watched , and in danger , sir , if you are the party I think you are , '' said Joey , going up to him , and speaking in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 17]: `` Who are you , '' replied the domino , `` that gives this notice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 35]: `` A perfect stranger to you , even if your mask was removed , sir ; but I happened to overhear a conversation relative to a person in a domino such as you wear .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 22]: I may be mistaken , and if so , there is no harm done ; '' and our hero turned away .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 14]: `` Stop him , dear Henry , '' said a soft female voice .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 18]: `` I fear that there is danger : he can have told you but from kindness . ''
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 55]: The person in the domino immediately followed Joey , and accosted him , apologising for his apparent rudeness at receiving his communication , which he ascribed to the suddenness with which it was given , and requested , as a favour , that our hero would inform him why he had thought it necessary .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 36]: `` I will tell you , certainly ; not that I interfere with other people 's concerns ; but when I saw that one of them had a poniard -- '' `` A poniard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 10]: exclaimed the female , who had now joined them .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 15]: `` Yes , '' replied Joey ; `` and appeared determined to use it .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 12]: In one word , madam , is your name , Miriam ?
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 24]: If so , what I heard concerns you ; if not , it does not , and I need say no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 23]: `` Sir , it does concern her , '' replied the domino ; `` and I will thank you to proceed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 21]: Our hero then stated briefly what he had overheard , and that the parties were then in pursuit of them .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 6]: `` We are lost ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 5]: exclaimed the young woman .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 9]: `` We shall never escape from the gardens !
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 5]: What must we do ?
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 13]: My brother in his wrath is as a lion 's whelp . ''
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 12]: `` I care little for myself , '' replied the domino .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 17]: `` I could defend myself ; but , if we meet , I shall lose you .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 15]: Your father would tear you away while I was engaged with your brother . ''
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 36]: `` At all events , sir , I should recommend your not remaining in these dark walks , '' replied our hero , `` now that you are aware of what may take place . ''
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 38]: `` And yet , if we go into the lighted part of the gardens , they will soon discover us , now that they have , as it appears , gained a knowledge of my dress . ''
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 10]: `` Then put it off , '' said Joey .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 14]: `` But they know my person even better , '' rejoined the domino .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 22]: `` Your conduct , sir , has been so kind , that perhaps you would be inclined to assist us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 38]: Our hero was in love himself , and , of course , felt sympathy for others in the same predicament ; so he replied that , if he could be of service , they might command him .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 24]: `` Then , Miriam , dear , what I propose is this ; will you put yourself under the protection of this stranger ?
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 15]: I think you risk nothing , for he has proved that he is kind .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 25]: You may then , without fear of detection , pass through the gardens , and be conducted by him to a place of safety .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 54]: I will remain here for half an hour ; should your father and brother meet me , although they may recognise my dress , yet not having you with me , there will be no grounds for any attack being made , and I will , after a time , return home . ''
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 10]: `` And what is to become of me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 5]: exclaimed the terrified girl .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 21]: `` You must send this gentleman to my address to-morrow morning , and he will acquaint me where you are .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 34]: I am giving you a great deal of trouble , sir ; but at the same time I show my confidence ; I trust it will not interfere with your other engagements . ''
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 28]: `` Your confidence is , I trust , not misplaced , sir , '' replied our hero ; `` and I am just now an idle man .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 25]: I promise you , if this young lady will venture to trust herself with a perfect stranger , that I will do your request .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 17]: I have no mask on , madam ; do you think you can trust me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 42]: `` I think I can , sir ; indeed , I must do so , or there will be shedding of blood ; but Henry , they are coming ; I know them ; see -- right up the walk . ''
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 15]: Joey turned round , and perceived the two persons whose conversation he had overheard .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 29]: `` It is they , sir , '' said he to the gentleman in the domino ; `` leave us and walk back farther into the dark part .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 13]: I must take her away on my arm and pass them boldly .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 7]: Come , sir , quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 18]: Our hero immediately took the young Jewess on his arm and walked towards the father and brother .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 24]: He felt her trembling like an aspen as they came close to them , and was fearful that her legs would fail her .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 20]: As they passed , the face of our hero was severely scrutinised by the dark eyes of the Israelites .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 37]: Joey returned their stare , and proceeded on his way ; and after they had separated some paces from the father and brother , he whispered to the maiden , `` You are safe now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 27]: Joey conducted his charge through the gardens , and when he arrived at the entrance , he called a coach , and put the lady in .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 8]: `` Where shall we drive to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 4]: inquired our hero .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 18]: `` I do n't know ; say anywhere , so that we are away from this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 26]: Joey ordered the man to drive to the hotel where he had taken up his abode , for he knew not where else to go .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 24]: On his arrival he left the young lady in the coach , while he went in to prepare the landlady for her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 45]: He stated that he had rescued her from a very perilous situation , and that he would feel much obliged to his hostess if she would take charge of the young person until she could be restored to her friends on the ensuing morning .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 12]: People like to be consulted , and to appear of importance .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 48]: The fat old lady , who had bridled up at the very mention of the introduction of a lady in a domino , as soon as she heard that the party was to be placed under her protection , relaxed her compressed features , and graciously consented .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 23]: Our hero having consigned over his charge , whose face he had not yet seen , immediately retired to his own apartment .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 32]: The next morning , about nine o'clock , he sent to inquire after the health of his protegee and was answered by a request that he would pay her a visit .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 10]: When he entered the room he found her alone .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 21]: She was dressed somewhat in the Oriental style , and he was not a little surprised at her extreme beauty .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 28]: Her stature was rather above the middle size : she was exquisitely formed ; and her hands , ankles , and feet , were models of perfection .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 23]: She was indeed one of the most exquisite specimens of the Jewish nation , and that is quite sufficient for her portrait .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 14]: She rose as he entered , and coloured deeply as she saluted him .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 44]: Our hero , who perceived her confusion , hastened to assure her that he was ready to obey any order she might be pleased to give him , and trusted that she had not been too much annoyed with her very unpleasant position .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 57]: `` I am more obliged to you , sir , than I can well express , '' replied she , `` by your kind consideration in putting me into the charge of the landlady of the house : that one act assured me that I was in the hands of a gentleman and man of honour .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 34]: All I have to request of you now is , that you will call at Number -- Berkeley Square , and inform Mr S -- of what you have kindly done for me .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 23]: You will probably hear from him the cause of the strange position in which you found us and relieved us from . ''
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 59]: As our hero had nothing to reply , he wrote down the address and took his leave , immediately proceeding to the house of Mr S -- ; but , as he was walking up Berkeley Street , he was encountered by two men , whom he immediately recognised as the father and brother of the young Israelite .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 52]: The brother fixed his keen eye upon our hero , and appeared to recognise him ; at all events , as our hero passed them they turned round and followed him , and he heard the brother say , `` He was with her , '' or something to that purport .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 45]: Our hero did not , however , consider that it was advisable to wait until they were away before he knocked at the door , as he felt convinced they were on the watch , and that any delay would not obtain the end .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 8]: He knocked , and was immediately admitted .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 23]: He found Mr S -- pacing the room up and down in great anxiety , the breakfast remaining on the table untouched .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 9]: He warmly greeted the arrival of our hero .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 50]: Joey , as soon as he had informed him of what he had done , and in whose hands he had placed the young lady , stated the circumstance of the father and brother being outside on the watch , and that he thought that they had recognised him .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 59]: `` That is nothing more than what I expected , '' replied Mr S -- ; `` but I trust easily to evade them ; they are not aware that the back of this house communicates with the stables belonging to it in the mews , and we can go out by that way without their perceiving us .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 28]: I 've so many thanks to offer you , sir , for your kind interference in our behalf , that I hardly know how to express them .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 50]: To one thing you are most certainly entitled , and I should prove but little my sincerity if I did not immediately give it you ; that is my confidence , and a knowledge of the parties whom you have assisted , and the circumstances attending this strange affair .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 48]: The young lady , sir , is , as you know , a Jewess by birth , and the daughter of a rabbi , a man of great wealth and high ancestry , for certainly Jews can claim the latter higher than any other nation upon earth .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 40]: I am myself a man of fortune , as it is usually termed , -- at all events , with sufficient to indulge any woman I should take as my wife with every luxury that can be reasonably demanded .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 22]: I mention this to corroborate my assertion , that it was not her father 's wealth which has been my inducement .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 77]: I made the acquaintance of the father and daughter when I was travelling on the Continent ; he was on his way to England , when his carriage broke down , in a difficult pass on the mountains , and they would have been left on the road for the night , if I had not fortunately come up in time , and , being alone , was able to convey them to the next town .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 12]: I have always had a great respect for the Jewish nation .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 19]: I consider that every true Christian should have ; but I will not enter upon that point now .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 51]: It was probably my showing such a feeling , and my being well versed in their history , which was the occasion of an intercourse of two days ripening into a regard for one another ; and we parted with sincere wishes that we might meet again in this country .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 78]: At the time I speak of , which was about three years ago , his daughter Miriam was , comparatively speaking , a child , and certainly not at that period , or indeed for some time after our meeting again in England , did it ever come into my ideas that I should ever feel anything for her but good-will ; but circumstances , and her father 's confidence in me , threw us much together .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 5]: She has no mother .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 22]: After a time I found myself growing attached to her , and I taxed myself , and reflected on the consequences .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 24]: I was aware how very severe the Jewish laws were upon the subject of any of their family uniting themselves to a Christian .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 32]: That it was not only considered that the party concerned was dishonoured before the nation , but that the whole family became vile , and were denied the usual burial rites .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 20]: Perhaps you are aware that if a Jew embraces Christianity , the same disgrace is heaped upon the relations .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 66]: With this knowledge , I determined to conquer my feelings for Miriam , and of course I no longer went to her father 's house ; it would have been cruel to put my friend -LRB- for such he certainly was -RRB- in such a position the more so as , being a rabbi , he would have to denounce himself and his own children .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 16]: `` My absence was , however , the cause of great annoyance to the father .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 34]: He sought me , and I was so pressed by him to return , that I had no choice , unless I confessed my reasons , which I did not like to do .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 42]: I therefore visited the house as before , although not so frequently , and continually found myself in company with Miriam , and , her father being constantly summoned away to the duties of his office , but too often alone .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 40]: I therefore resolved that I would once more set off on my travels , as the only means by which I could act honourably , and get rid of the feeling which was obtaining such a mastery over me .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 45]: I went to the house to state my intention , and at the same time bid them farewell ; when , ascending the stairs , I slipped and sprained my ankle so severely , that I could not put my foot to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 33]: This decided our fate ; and I was not only domiciled for a week in the house , but , as I lay on the sofa , was continually attended by Miriam .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 24]: Her father would not hear of my removal , but declared that my accident was a judgment against me for my rash intention .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 21]: `` That Miriam showed her regard for me in every way that a modest maiden could do , is certain .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 50]: I did , however , make one last struggle ; I did not deny my feelings towards her , but I pointed out to her the consequences which would ensue , which it was my duty as a friend , and her duty as a daughter , to prevent .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 15]: She heard me in silence and in tears , and then quitted the room .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 33]: `` The next day she appeared to have recovered her composure , and entered freely into general conversation , and , after a time , referred to the rites of their Church .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 52]: By degrees she brought up the subject of Christianity ; she demanded the reasons and authority for our belief ; in short , she induced me to enter warmly into the subject , and to prove , to the best of my ability , that the true Messiah had already come .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 60]: This conversation she took a pleasure in renewing , during my stay in the house ; and as I considered that the subject was one that diverted our attention from the one I wished to avoid , I was not sorry to enter upon it , although I had not the least idea of converting her to our faith .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 64]: `` Such was the state of affairs when I quitted the house , and again seriously thought of removing myself from so much temptation , when her brother Joseph arrived from Madrid , where he had been staying with an uncle for some years , and his return was the occasion of a jubilee , at which I could not refuse to appear .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 42]: He is a fine young man , very intelligent and well informed , but of a very irascible disposition ; and his long residence in Spain has probably given him those ideas of retaliation which are almost unknown in this country .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 51]: He conceived a very strong friendship for me , and I certainly was equally pleased with him ; for he is full of talent , although he is revengeful , proud of his lineage , and holding to the tenets of his faith with all the obstinacy of a Pharisee .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 79]: Indeed , it is strange that he could ever become so partial to a Christian , respecting as he does the rabbinical doctrines held forth to the Jewish people , and which it must be admitted have been inculcated , in consequence of the unwearied and unjustifiable persecution of the tribes for centuries , by those who call themselves Christians , but whose practice has been at open variance with the precepts of the founder of their faith .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 6]: However , so it was .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 27]: Joseph conceived a great regard for me , was continually at my house , and compelled me but too often to visit at his father 's .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 42]: At last I made up my mind that I would leave the country for a time , and was actively preparing , intending to go without saying a word to them , when I found myself one morning alone with Miriam .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 40]: She walked up to me as I was sitting on the couch I motioned to her to sit by me , but she stood before me with a stately air , fixing upon me her dark gazelle-like eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 31]: ` Do you , ' said she , in a slow and solemn tone of voice , ` do you remember the conversation which we had upon our respective creeds ?
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 31]: Do you recollect how you pointed out to me your authorities and your reasons for your faith , and your sincere belief that the Messiah had already come ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 34]: ` I do , Miriam , ' replied I ; ` but not with any view to interfere with your non-belief ; it was only to uphold by argument my own . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 76]: ` I do not say nay to that ; I believe you , ' said Miriam , ` nevertheless , I have that in my vest which , if it was known to my father or brother , would cause them to dash me to the earth , and to curse me in the name of the great Jehovah ; ' and she pulled out of her vest a small copy of the New Testament .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 56]: ` This is the book of your creed ; I have searched and compared it with our own ; I have found the authorities ; I have read the words of the Jews who have narrated the history and the deeds of Jesus of Nazareth , and -- I am a _ Christian _ . '
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 80]: `` It may appear strange , but I assure you , sir , you can not imagine the pain I felt when Miriam thus acknowledged herself a convert to our faith : to say to her that I was sorry for it would have argued little for my Christian belief ; but when I reflected upon the pain and disgrace it would bring upon her family , and that I should be the cause , I was dreadfully shocked .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 18]: I could only reply , ` Miriam , I wish that we had never met ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 30]: ` I know what your feelings are but too well , ' replied she ; ` but we have met , and what is done can not be undone .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 25]: I , too , when I think of my relations , am torn with anxiety and distress ; but what is now my duty ?
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 48]: If I am , and I declare , not only by the great Jehovah , but by the crucified Messiah , that I am a sincere believer in your creed , must I shrink -- must I conceal it on account of my father and my brother ?
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 13]: Does not He say , `` Leave all and follow me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 22]: Must I not add my feeble voice in acknowledgement of the truth , if I am to consider myself a Christian ?
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 7]: Must not my avowal be public ?
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 11]: Yes , it must be , and it shall be !
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 7]: Can you blame me ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 5]: ` Oh , no !
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 60]: I dare not blame you , ' replied I ; ` I only regret that religious differences should so mar the little happiness permitted to us in this world , and that neither Jew nor Christian will admit what our Saviour has distinctly declared -- that there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek , or Gentile .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 33]: I see much misery in this , and I can not help regretting deeply that I shall be considered as the cause of it , and be upbraided with ingratitude . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 10]: ` You did your duty , ' replied Miriam .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 11]: ` I have been converted by your having so done .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 8]: Now I have my duty to do .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 33]: I am aware of the pain it will occasion my father , my relations , and the whole of our tribe ; but if they suffer , shall I not suffer more ?
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 46]: Thrust out from my father 's door ; loaded with curses and execration ; not one Jew permitted to offer me an asylum , not even to give me a morsel of bread , or a drop of water ; a wanderer and an outcast !
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 8]: Such must be my fate . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 44]: ` Not so , Miriam ; if your tribe desert you -- ' '' ` Stop one moment , ' interrupted Miriam ; ` do you recollect the conversation you had with me before we entered into the subject of our relative creeds ?
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 23]: Do you remember what you then said ; and was it true , or was it merely as an excuse ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 13]: ` It was as true , Miriam , as I stand here .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 8]: I have loved you long and devotedly .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 95]: I have tried to conquer the passion , on account of the misery your marriage with a Christian would have occasioned your relations ; but if you persist in avowing your new faith , the misery will be equally incurred ; and , therefore , I am doubly bound , not only by my love , but because I have , by converting you , put you in such a dreadful position , to offer you not only an asylum , but , if you will accept them , my heart and hand . '
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 21]: `` Miriam folded her arms across her breast , and knelt down , with her eyes fixed upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 24]: ` I can only answer in the words of Ruth , ' replied she , in a low voice and with trembling lips .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 50]: I hardly need observe , that after this interview the affair was decided , -- the great difficulty was to get her out of the house ; for you must have been inside of one of the houses of a Jew of rank to be aware of their arrangements .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 27]: It was impossible that Miriam could be absent an hour without being missed ; and to go out by herself without being seen was equally difficult .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 52]: Her cousin is married to a Jew , who keeps the masquerade paraphernalia and costumes in Tavistock Street , and she sometimes accompanies her father and brother there , and , as usual , goes up to her cousin in the women 's apartment , while her male relations remain below .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 100]: We therefore hit upon this plan : That on the first masquerade-night at Vauxhall she should persuade her father and brother to go with her to her cousin 's ; that I should be close by in a coach , and , after she had gone in , I was to drive up as the other customers do , and obtain two dominoes , and then wait while she escaped from the women 's apartment , and came down-stairs to the street door , where I was to put her in the coach , and drive off to Vauxhall .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 9]: You may inquire why we went to Vauxhall .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 36]: Because as but few minutes would elapse before she would be missed , it would have been almost impossible to have removed her without being discovered , for I was well known to the people .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 33]: You recollect that Manasseh , who was in the shop , informed them that my domino was slashed with white in my sleeves ; he knew me when I obtained the dominoes .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 67]: Had I not been aware of the violence of the brother , I should have cared little had he followed me to my house , or any other place he might have traced me to ; but his temper is such that his sister would certainly have been sacrificed to his rage and fury , as you may imagine from what you have seen and heard .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 34]: I considered , therefore , that if we once became mixed with the crowd of masks and dominoes at Vauxhall , I should elude them , and all trace of us be lost .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 28]: I believe , now , that I have made you acquainted with every circumstance , and trust that you will still afford me your valuable assistance . ''
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 16]: `` Most certainly , '' replied our hero ; `` I am in duty bound .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 21]: I can not help thinking that they have recognised me as the party conducting her out of the dark walk .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 7]: Did you meet them afterwards ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 80]: `` No , '' rejoined Mr S -- ; `` I allowed them to walk about without coming up to me for some time , and then when they were down at the farthest end , I made all haste and took a coach home , before they could possibly come up with me , allowing that they did recognise me , which I do not think they did until they perceived me hastening away at a distance . ''
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 11]: `` What , then , are your present intentions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 4]: inquired our hero .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 75]: `` I wish you to return with me to your hotel , '' replied Mr S -- ; `` I will then take a chaise , and leave for Scotland as fast as four horses can carry us , and unite myself to Miriam , and , as soon as I can , I shall leave the country , which will be the best step to allow their rage and indignation to cool . ''
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 21]: `` I think your plan is good , '' replied Joey , `` and I am at your service . ''
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 40]: In a few minutes Mr S -- and our hero went out by the back way into the mews , and , as soon as they came to a stand , took a coach and drove to the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 50]: They had not , however , been in company with Miriam more than five minutes , when the waiter entered the room in great alarm , stating that two gentlemen were forcing their way upstairs in spite of the landlord and others , who were endeavouring to prevent them .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 60]: The fact was , that our hero and Mr S -- had been perceived by Joseph and his father as they came out of the mews , and they had immediately followed them , taking a coach at the same stand , and desiring the coachman to follow the one our hero and Mr S -- had gone into .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 44]: The waiter had hardly time to make the communication before the door was forced open , and the man was so terrified , that he retreated behind our hero and Mr S -- , into whose arms Miriam had thrown herself for protection .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 52]: The father and brother did not , however , enter without resistance on the part of the landlord and waiters , who followed , remonstrating and checking them ; but Joseph broke from them with his dagger drawn : it was wrenched from him by our hero , who dashed forward .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 30]: The enraged Israelite then caught up a heavy bronze clock which was on the sideboard , and crying out , `` This for the Gaw and the Meshumed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 49]: -LRB- the infidel and the apostate -RRB- , he hurled it at them with all his strength : it missed the parties it was intended for , but striking the waiter who had retreated behind them , fractured his skull , and he fell senseless upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 46]: Upon this outrage the landlord and his assistants rushed upon Joseph and his father ; the police were sent for , and after a desperate resistance , the Israelites were taken away to the police office , leaving Mr S -- and Miriam at liberty .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 25]: Our hero was , however , requested by the police to attend at the examination , and , of course , could not refuse .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 41]: The whole party had been a quarter of an hour waiting until another case was disposed of , before the magistrate could attend to them , when the surgeon came in and acquainted them that the unfortunate waiter had expired .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 27]: The depositions were taken down , and both father and son were committed , and Joey , and some others bound over to appear as witnesses .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 89]: In about two hours our hero was enabled to return to the hotel , where he found that Mr S -- had left a note for him , stating that he considered it advisable to start immediately , lest they should require his attendance at the police-court , and he should be delayed , which would give time to the relations of Miriam to take up the question : he had , therefore , set off , and would write to him as soon as he possibly could .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 45]: This affair made some noise , and appeared in all the newspapers , and our hero therefore sat down and wrote a detailed account of the whole transaction -LRB- as communicated to him by Mr S -- -RRB- , which he despatched to Portsmouth .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 28]: He made inquiries , and found that the sessions would come on in a fortnight , and that the grand jury would sit in a few days .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 65]: He therefore made up his mind that he would not think of returning to Portsmouth until the trial was over , and in his next letter he made known his intentions , and then set off for Richmond , where he had been advised to remain for a short time , as being more favourable to an invalid than the confined atmosphere of London .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 29]: Our hero found amusement in rowing about in a wherry , up and down the river , and replying to the letters received from Mary and from Portsmouth .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 32]: He also received a letter from Mr S -- , informing him of his marriage , and requesting that as soon as the trial was over he would write to him .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 43]: Our hero 's health also was nearly re-established , when he was informed that his attendance was required at the court to give his evidence in the case of manslaughter found by the grand jury against Joseph , the brother of Miriam .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 22]: He arrived in town , and attended the court on the following day , when the trial was to take place .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 15]: A short time after the cause came on he was placed in the witness-box .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 66]: At the time that he gave his depositions before the magistrate he had not thought about his name having been changed ; but now that he was sworn , and had declared he would tell the truth , and nothing but the truth , when the counsel asked him if his name was not Joseph O'Donahue , our hero replied that it was Joseph Rushbrook .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 7]: `` Your deposition says Joseph O'Donahue .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 4]: How is this ?
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 14]: Have you an _ alias _ , like many others , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 4]: inquired the counsel .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 22]: `` My real name is Rushbrook , but I have been called O'Donahue for some time , '' replied our hero .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 57]: This reply was the occasion of the opposite counsel making some very severe remarks ; but the evidence of our hero was taken , and was indeed considered very favourable to the prisoner , as Joey stated that he was convinced the blow was never intended for the unfortunate waiter , but for Mr S -- .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 32]: After about an hour 's examination our hero was dismissed , and in case that he might be recalled , returned as directed to the room where the witnesses were assembled .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 11]: IN WHICH THE TIDE OF FORTUNE TURNS AGAINST OUR HERO .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 42]: As soon as Joey had been dismissed from the witness-box he returned to the room in which the other witnesses were assembled , with melancholy forebodings that his real name having been given in open court would lead to some disaster .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 38]: He had not been there long before a peace-officer came in , and said to him , -- `` Step this way , if you please , sir ; I have something to say to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 37]: Joey went with him outside the door , when the peace-officer , looking at him full in the face , said , `` Your name is Joseph Rushbrook ; you said so in the witness-box ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 15]: `` Yes , '' replied Joey , `` that is my true name . ''
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 8]: `` Why did you change it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 4]: demanded the officer .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 10]: `` I had reasons , '' replied our hero .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 16]: `` Yes , and I 'll tell you the reasons , '' rejoined the other .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 25]: `` You were concerned in a murder some years ago ; a reward was offered for your apprehension , and you absconded from justice .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 14]: I see that you are the person ; your face tells me so .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 5]: You are my prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 27]: Now , come away quietly , sir ; it is of no use for you to resist , and you will only be worse treated . ''
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 85]: Joey 's heart had almost ceased to beat when the constable addressed him ; he felt that denial was useless , and that the time was now come when either he or his father must suffer ; he , therefore , made no reply , but quietly followed the peace officer , who , holding him by the arm , called a coach , into which he ordered Joey to enter , and following him , directed the coachman to drive to the police-office .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 53]: As soon as the magistrate had been acquainted by the officer who the party was whom he had taken into custody , he first pointed out to our hero that he had better not say any thing which might criminate himself , and then asked him if his name was Joseph Rushbrook .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 6]: Joey replied that it was .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 19]: `` Have you anything to say that might prevent my committing you on the charge of murder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 4]: demanded the magistrate .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 14]: `` Nothing , except that I am not guilty , '' replied Joey .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 35]: `` I have had the warrant out against him these seven years , or thereabouts , but he escaped me , '' observed the peace-officer ; `` he was but a lad then . ''
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 27]: `` He must have been a child , to judge by his present appearance , '' observed the magistrate , who was making out the committal .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 9]: `` I now perfectly recollect the affair . ''
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 22]: The officer received the committal , and in half an hour our hero was locked up with felons of every description .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 35]: His blood ran cold when he found himself enclosed within the massive walls ; and as soon as the gaoler had left him alone , he shuddered and covered his face with his hands .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 75]: Our hero had , however , the greatest of all consolations to support him -- the consciousness of his innocence ; but when he called to mind how happy and prosperous he had lately been , when he thought of Emma -- and that now all his fair prospects and fondest anticipations were thrown to the ground , it is not surprising that for a short time he wept in his solitude and silence .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 9]: To whom should he make known his situation ?
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 22]: it would too soon be known ; and would not every one , even Emma , shrink from a supposed murderer ?
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 37]: there was one who would not -- one on whose truth he could depend ; Mary would not desert him , even now ; he would write to her , and acquaint her with his situation .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 40]: Our hero , having made up his mind so to do , obtained paper and ink from the gaoler when he came into his cell , which he did in about two hours after he had been locked up .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 62]: Joey wrote to Mary , stating his position in few words , and that the next morning he was to be taken down to Exeter to await his trial ; and expressed a wish , if possible , that she would come there to see him ; and giving a guinea to the turnkey , requested him to forward the letter .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 15]: `` It shall go safe enough , young master , '' replied the man .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 22]: `` Now , do you know , yours is one of the strangest cases which ever came to my knowledge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 48]: continued the man ; `` we 've been talking about it among ourselves : why the first warrant for your apprehension was out more than eight years ago ; and , to look at you now , you can not be more than seventeen or eighteen . ''
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 16]: `` Yes , I am , '' replied Joey ; `` I am twenty-two . ''
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 16]: `` Then do n't you tell anybody else that , and I will forget it .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 82]: You see youth goes a great way in court ; and they will see that you must have been quite a child when the deed was done -- for I suppose by the evidence there is no doubt of that -- and it wo n't be a hanging matter , that you may be certain of ; you 'll cross the water , that 's all : so keep up your spirits , and look as young as you can . ''
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 19]: Mary received the letter on the following day , and was in the deepest distress at its contents .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 29]: She was still weeping over it , her work had been thrown down at her feet , when Mrs Austin came into the dressing-room where she was sitting .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 9]: `` What is the matter , Mary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 4]: said Mrs Austin .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 38]: `` I have received a letter from my brother , madam , '' replied Mary ; `` he is in the greatest distress ; and I must beg you to let me go to him immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 6]: `` Your brother , Mary !
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 7]: what difficulty is he in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 4]: asked Mrs Austin .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 9]: Mary did not reply , but wept more .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 42]: `` Mary , if your brother is in distress , I certainly will not refuse your going to him ; but you should tell me what his distress is , or how shall I be able to advise or help you ?
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 6]: Is it very serious ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 9]: `` He is in prison , madam . ''
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 10]: `` In prison for debt , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 19]: `` No , madam ; on a charge of murder , which he is not guilty of . ''
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 4]: `` Murder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 9]: exclaimed Mrs Austin , `` and not guilty !
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 13]: Why -- when -- and where did this murder take place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 15]: `` Many years ago , madam , when he was quite a child . ''
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 6]: `` How very strange ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 15]: thought Mrs Austin , panting , for breath , and dropping into a chair .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 7]: `` But where , Mary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 11]: `` Down in Devonshire , madam , at Grassford . ''
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 8]: Mrs Austin fell senseless from her chair .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 28]: Mary , very much surprised , hastened to her assistance , and , after a time succeeded in restoring her , and leading her to the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 20]: For some time Mrs Austin remained with her face buried in the cushions , while Mary stood over her .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 49]: At last Mrs Austin looked up , and laying her head upon Mary 's arm , said in a solemn tone -- `` Mary , do not deceive me ; you say that that boy is _ your _ brother -- tell me , is not that false ?
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 7]: I am sure that it is .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 6]: Answer me , Mary . ''
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 21]: `` He is not my born brother , madam , but I love him as one , '' replied Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 16]: `` Again answer me truly , Mary , if you have any regard for me .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 11]: You know his real name ; what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 12]: `` Joseph Rushbrook , madam , '' replied Mary , weeping .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 8]: `` I was certain of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 13]: replied Mrs Austin , bursting into tears ; `` I knew it !
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 7]: The blow has come at last !
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 6]: God have mercy on me !
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 6]: What can be done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 10]: And again Mrs Austin abandoned herself to bitter grief .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 51]: Mary was in amazement : how Mrs Austin should know any thing of Joey 's history , and why she should be in such distress , was to her a complete mystery : she remained for some time at the side of her mistress , who gradually became more composed .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 16]: Mary at last said , -- `` May I go to him , madam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 12]: `` Yes , '' replied Mrs Austin , `` most certainly .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 15]: Mary , I must have no secrets now ; you must tell me everything .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 110]: You see that I am deeply interested about this young man as well as yourself : it is quite sufficient for you at present to know that ; before I say anything more , you must be candid with me , and tell me how you became acquainted with him , and all that you know relative to his life ; that I will assist you and him in every way in my power ; that neither money nor interest shall be spared , you may be assured ; and I think , Mary , that , after this promise , you will not conceal anything from me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 25]: `` Indeed I will not , madam , '' replied Mary , `` for I love him as much as I can love . ''
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 18]: Mary then commenced by stating that she was living at Gravesend when she first met with Joey .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 51]: There was a little hesitation at the commencement of her narrative , which Mrs Austin pretended not to observe ; she then continued , winding up with the information which she had obtained from Furness , the marine , their escape , and her admission into Mrs Austin 's family .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 15]: `` And it was Joseph Rushbrook that came with you to this house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 27]: `` Yes , madam , '' replied Mary ; `` but one of the men was quite rude to me , and Joey took it up .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 33]: Mr Austin , hearing a noise , sent down to inquire the cause ; the servants threw all the blame upon Joey , and he was ordered out of the house immediately .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 47]: He refused even to come back to the Hall , after the treatment he had received , for a long while ; but it was he who was in the parlour when you opened the door , if you recollect , a few weeks ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 33]: Mrs Austin clasped her hands , and then pressed them to her forehead ; after a while she said -- `` And what has he been doing since he came here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 15]: Mary then informed her mistress of all she knew of Joey 's subsequent career .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 18]: `` Well , Mary , '' said Mrs Austin , `` you must go to him directly .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 43]: You will want money ; but , Mary , promise me that you will not say a word to him about what has passed between us , -- that is , for the present ; by-and-bye I may trust you more . ''
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 46]: `` You may trust me , madam , '' replied Mary , looking her mistress in the face ; `` but it is too late for me to go this afternoon ; I will , if you please , now wait till to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 34]: `` Do so , Mary ; I am glad that you do not go to-night , for I wish you to stay with me ; I have many questions to ask of you .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 12]: At present I wish to be alone , my good girl .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 16]: Tell Mr Austin that I am very unwell , and do not dine below . ''
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 12]: `` Shall I bring your dinner up here , madam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 3]: asked Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 22]: `` Yes , you may _ bring _ it , Mary , '' replied Mrs Austin , with a faint smile .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 20]: Never did two people leave one another both so much wishing to be alone as Mary and Mrs Austin .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 28]: The former quitted the room , and , having first executed her commission , returned to her own apartment , that she might reflect without being disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 11]: What could be the reason of Mrs Austin 's behaviour ?
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 8]: What could she know of Joey Rushbrook ?
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 7]: and why so interested and moved ?
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 40]: She had heard among the servants that Mr and Mrs Austin were formerly in a humbler sphere of life ; that he was a half-pay officer ; but there was still no clue to such interest about Joey Rushbrook .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 54]: Mary thought and thought over and over again , revolved all that had passed in her mind , but could make nothing of it ; and she was still trying to solve the mystery when the housemaid came into the room , and informed her that Mrs Austin 's bell had rung twice .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 27]: Mrs Austin , on her part , was still more bewildered ; she could not regain sufficient calmness to enable her to decide how to act .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 19]: Her son in prison , to be tried for his life for a crime he had not committed !
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 11]: Would he divulge the truth , and sacrifice the father ?
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 4]: She thought not .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 11]: If he did not , would he not be condemned ?
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 12]: and if he were , could she remain away from him ?
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 12]: or ought she not to divulge what the boy would conceal ?
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 25]: And if he did confess the truth , would they find out that Mr Austin and Joseph Rushbrook were one and the same person ?
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 9]: Would there be any chance of his escape ?
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 11]: Would he not , sooner or later , be recognised ?
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 6]: How dreadful was her situation !
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 16]: Then , again , should she acquaint her husband with the position of his son ?
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 8]: If so , would he come forward ?
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 14]: Yes , most certainly he would never let Joey suffer for his crime .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 7]: Ought she to tell her husband ?
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 31]: And then Mary , who knew so much already , who had witnessed her distress and anguish , who was so fond of her son , could she trust her ?
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 7]: Could she do without trusting her ?
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 16]: Such were the various and conflicting ideas which passed in the mind of Mrs Austin .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 55]: At last she resolved that she would say nothing to her husband ; that she would send Mary to her son , and that she would that evening have more conversation with the girl , and decide , after she had talked with her , whether she would make her a confidant or not .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 15]: Having made up her mind so far , she rang the bell for Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 8]: `` Are you better , madam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 12]: asked Mary , who had entered the room , very quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 46]: `` Yes , I thank you , Mary ; take your work and sit down ; I wish to have some more conversation with you about this young person , Joseph Rushbrook ; you must have seen that I am much interested about him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 6]: `` Yes , madam . ''
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 18]: `` There were some portions of your story , Mary , which I do not quite understand .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 23]: You have now lived with me for five years , and I have had every reason to be satisfied with your behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 16]: You have conducted yourself as a well-behaved , modest , and attentive young woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 16]: `` I am much obliged to you , madam , for your good opinion . ''
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 40]: `` And I hope that you will admit that I have not been a hard mistress to you , Mary , but , on the contrary , have shown you that I have been pleased with your conduct . ''
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 16]: `` Certainly , madam , you have ; and I trust I am grateful . ''
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 10]: `` I believe so , '' replied Mrs Austin .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 14]: `` Now , Mary , I wish you to confide in me altogether .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 29]: What I wish to know is how did you in so short a time become acquainted with this Furness , so as to obtain this secret from him ?
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 20]: I may say , whom did you live with , and how did you live , when at Gravesend ?
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 9]: for you have not mentioned that to me .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 31]: It seems so odd to me that this man should have told to a person whom he had seen but for a few hours a secret of such moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 12]: Mary 's tears fell fast , but she made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 10]: `` Can not you answer me , Mary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 56]: `` I can , madam , '' said she , at last ; `` but if I tell the truth -- and I can not tell a lie now -- you will despise me , and perhaps order me to leave the house immediately ; and if you do what will become of me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 63]: `` Mary , if you think I intend to take advantage of a confession extorted from you , you do me wrong I ask the question because it is necessary that I should know the truth -- because I can not confide in you without you first confide in me ; tell me , Mary , and do not be afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 36]: `` Madam , I will ; but pray do not forget that I have been under your roof for five years , and that I have been during that time an honest and modest girl .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 27]: I was not so once , I confess it , '' and Mary 's cheeks were red with shame , and she hung down her head .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 26]: `` We are all sinful creatures , Mary , '' replied Mrs Austin ; `` and who is there that has not fallen into error ?
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 43]: The Scriptures say , ` Let him who is without sin cast the first stone ; ' nay more , Mary , ` There is more joy over one sinner that repenteth than over ninety and nine who need no repentance . '
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 12]: Shall I then be harsh to you , my poor girl ?
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 4]: No , no .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 25]: By trusting me you have made me your friend ; you must be mine , Mary , for I want a friend now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 21]: Poor Mary fell on her knees before Mrs Austin , and wept over her hand as she kissed it repeatedly .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 44]: Mrs Austin was much affected , and as the contrite girl recovered herself , Mrs Austin leaned on her elbow , and putting her arm round Mary 's neck , drew her head towards her , and gently kissed her on the brow .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 28]: `` You are , indeed , a kind friend , madam , '' said Mary , after a pause , `` and may the Almighty reward you !
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 17]: You are unhappy ; I know not why , but I would die to serve you .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 12]: I only wish that you would let me prove it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 26]: `` First , Mary , tell me as much of your own history as you choose to tell ; I wish to know it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 39]: Mary then entered into the details of her marriage , her husband 's conduct , her subsequent career , and her determination to lead a new life , which she had so sincerely proved by her late conduct .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 51]: Mary having concluded her narrative , Mrs Austin addressed her thus : -- `` Mary , if you imagine that you have fallen in my good opinion , after what you have confessed to me , you are much mistaken ; you have , on the contrary , been raised .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 30]: There have been few , very few , that have had the courage and fortitude that you have shown , or who could have succeeded as you have done .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 14]: I was afraid to trust you before , but now I am not .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 18]: I will not ask you not to betray me , for I am sure you will not .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 34]: On two points only my lips are sealed ; and the reason why they are sealed is that the secret is not mine alone , and I have not permission to divulge it .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 42]: That I am deeply interested in that boy is certain ; nay , that he is a near and very dear connection is also the case ; but what his exact relationship is towards me I must not at present say .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 39]: You have asserted your belief of his innocence , and I tell you that you are right ; he did not do the deed ; I know who did , but I dare not reveal the name . ''
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 37]: `` That is exactly what Joey said to me , madam , '' observed Mary , `` and , moreover , that he never would reveal it , even if he were on his trial . ''
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 21]: `` I do not think that he ever will , Mary , '' rejoined Mrs Austin , bursting into tears .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 4]: `` Poor boy !
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 17]: it is horrible that he should suffer for an offence that he has not committed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 23]: `` Surely , madam , if he is found guilty they will not hang him , he was such a child . ''
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 6]: `` I scarcely know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 29]: `` It 's very odd that his father and mother have disappeared in the manner they did ; I think it is very suspicious , '' observed Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 45]: `` You must , of course , have your own ideas from what you have already heard , '' replied Mrs Austin , in a calm tone ; `` but , as I have already said , my lips on that subject are sealed .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 33]: What I wish you to do , Mary , is not at first to let him know that I am interested about him , or even that I know anything about him .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 48]: Make all the inquiries you can as to what is likely to be the issue of the affair , and , when you have seen him , you must then come back and tell me all that he says , and all that has taken place . ''
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 7]: `` I will , madam . ''
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 26]: `` You had better go away early tomorrow ; one of the grooms shall drive you over to meet the coach which runs to Exeter .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 27]: While I think of it , take my purse , and do not spare it , Mary ; for money must not be thought of now .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 12]: I am very unwell , and must go to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 26]: `` I had better bring up the tray , madam ; a mouthful and a glass of wine will be of service to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 13]: `` Do so , dear Mary ; I feel very faint . ''
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 27]: As soon as Mrs Austin had taken some refreshment , she entered again into conversation with Mary , asking her a hundred questions about her son .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 43]: Mary , who had now nothing to conceal , answered freely ; and when Mary wished her good night , Mrs Austin was more than ever convinced that her boy 's rectitude of principle would have made him an ornament to society .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 55]: Then came the bitter feeling that he was about to sacrifice himself ; that he would be condemned as a felon , disgraced , and perhaps executed ; and as she turned on her restless pillow , she exclaimed , `` Thank God that he is innocent -- his poor father suffers more . ''
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 16]: IN WHICH MARY MAKES A DISCOVERY OF WHAT HAS BEEN LONG KNOWN TO THE READER .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 21]: It was hardly ten o'clock on the second morning when Mary arrived at Exeter , and proceeded to the gaol .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 36]: Her eyes were directed to the outside of the massive building , and her cheeks blanched when she viewed the chains and fetters over the entrance , so truly designating the purport of the structure .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 40]: There were several people at the steps and in the passage , making inquiries , and demanding permission of the turnkey to visit the prisoners ; and Mary had to wait some minutes before she could make her request .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 22]: Her appearance was so different to the usual class of applicants , that the turnkey looked at her with some surprise .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 9]: `` Whom do you wish to see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 11]: inquired the man , for Mary 's voice had faltered .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 11]: `` Joseph Rushbrook , my brother , '' repeated Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 11]: At this moment the head gaoler came to the wicket .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 16]: `` She wishes to see her brother , young Rushbrook , '' said the turnkey .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 35]: `` Yes , certainly , '' replied the gaoler ; `` walk in , and sit down in the parlour for a little while , till I can send a man with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 27]: There was a gentleness and kindness of manner shown by both the men towards Mary , for they were moved with her beauty and evident distress .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 24]: Mary took a seat in the gaoler 's room ; the gaoler 's wife was there , and she was more than kind .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 80]: The turnkey came to show her to the cell ; and when Mary rose , the gaoler 's wife said to her , `` After you have seen your brother , my dear child , you had better come back again , and sit down here a little while , and then , perhaps , I can be of some use to you , in letting you know what can be done , and what is not allowed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 21]: Mary could not speak , but she looked at the gaoler 's wife , her eyes brimming over with tears .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 6]: The kind woman understood her .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 18]: `` Go now , '' said she , `` and mind you come back to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 29]: The turnkey , without speaking , led her to the cell , fitted the key to the ponderous lock , pushed back the door , and remained outside .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 26]: Mary entered , and in a second was in the arms of our hero , kissing him , and bedewing his cheeks with her tears .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 49]: `` I was sure that you would come , Mary , '' said Joey ; `` now sit down , and I will tell you how this has happened , while you compose yourself ; you will be better able to talk to me after a while . ''
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 50]: They sat down on the stretchers upon which the bed had been laid during the night , their hands still clasped , and as Joey entered into a narrative of all that had passed , Mary 's sobs gradually diminished , and she was restored to something like composure .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 20]: `` And what do you intend to do when you are brought to trial , my dear boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 5]: said Mary at last .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 27]: `` I shall say nothing , except ` Not Guilty , ' which is the truth , Mary ; I shall make no defence whatever . ''
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 11]: `` But why will you not confess the truth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 3]: replied Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 60]: `` I have often thought of this , and have long made up my mind , Joey , that no one could act as you do if a parent 's life were not concerned ; you , or anybody else , would be mad to sacrifice himself in this way , unless it were to save a father . ''
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 16]: Joey 's eyes were cast down on the stone pavement ; he made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 40]: `` Why , then , if I am right in my supposition , '' continued Mary -- `` I do not ask you to say yes or no on that point -- why should you not tell the truth ?
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 38]: Furness told me that your father and mother had left the village , and that he had attempted to trace them , but could not ; and he expressed himself sure that they were gone to America .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 17]: Why , then , supposing I am right , should you sacrifice yourself for nothing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 32]: `` Supposing you are right , Mary , '' replied Joey , with his eyes still cast down , `` what proof is there that my parents have left the country ?
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 18]: It was only the supposition of Furness , and it is my conviction that they have not .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 37]: Where they may be , I know not ; but I feel positive that my mother would not leave the country without having first found out where I was , and have taken me with her .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 19]: No , Mary , my father and mother , if alive , are still in this country . ''
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 16]: `` Recollect again , my dear boy , that your father may be dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 50]: `` And if so , my mother would have by this time found me out ; she would have advertised for me -- done everything -- I feel that she would have -- she would have returned to Grassford , and -- '' `` And what , Joey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 56]: `` I must not say what , Mary , '' replied our hero ; `` I have thought a great deal since I have been shut up here , and I have taken my resolution , which is not to be changed ; so let us say no more upon the subject , dear Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 7]: Tell me all about yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 53]: Mary remained another hour with Joey , and then bade him farewell ; she was anxious to return to Mrs Austin , and acquaint her with the result of her interview ; with a heavy heart she walked away from the cell , and went down into the parlour of the gaoler .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 9]: `` Would you like to take anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 12]: said the gaoler 's wife , after Mary had sat down .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 9]: `` A little water , '' replied Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 8]: `` And how is your brother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 28]: `` He is innocent , '' replied Mary : `` he is indeed ; but he wo n't tell anything , and they will condemn him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 46]: `` Well , well ; but do not be afraid ; he must have been very young at the time , innocent or guilty , and he wo n't suffer , that I know ; but he will be sent out of the country . ''
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 12]: `` Then I will go with him , '' replied Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 27]: `` Perhaps he will be pardoned , dear ; keep your spirits up , and , if you have money , get a good lawyer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 16]: `` Can you tell me who would be a good lawyer to apply to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 30]: `` Yes ; Mr Trevor ; he is a very clever man , and comes the Western Circuit ; if any one can save him , he can . ''
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 16]: `` I will take his name down , if you please , '' said Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 35]: The gaoler 's wife gave Mary a piece of paper and pen and ink ; Mary wrote down the name and address of Mr Trevor , and then with many thanks took her leave .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 16]: On her return to the Hall , Mary communicated to Mrs Austin what had passed .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 27]: Mrs Austin perceived that Joey would not swerve from his resolution , and that all that could be done was to procure the best legal assistance .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 29]: `` Mary , my poor girl , '' said Mrs Austin , `` here is money , which you will find necessary for your adopted brother 's assistance .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 20]: You say that you have obtained the name of the best legal person to be employed in his behalf .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 13]: To-morrow you must go to London , and call upon that gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 11]: It may be as well not to mention my name .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 13]: As his sister , you of course seek the best legal advice .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 11]: You must manage all this as if from yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 7]: `` I will , madam . ''
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 31]: `` And , Mary , if you think it advisable , you can remain in town for two or three days ; but pray write to me every day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 7]: `` I will , madam . ''
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 25]: `` Let me know your address , as I may wish to say something to you when I know what has been done . ''
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 7]: `` I will , madam . ''
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 48]: `` And now you had better go to bed , Mary , for you must be tired ; indeed , you look very fatigued , my poor girl ; I need not caution you not to say anything to any of the servants ; good night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 22]: Mary threw herself on the bed , she was indeed worn out with anxiety and grief ; at last she slept .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 37]: The next morning she was on her way to town , having , in reply to the curiosity of the servants , stated that the cause of her journey was the dangerous illness of her brother .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 51]: As soon as she arrived in London , Mary drove to the chambers of the lawyer , whose direction she had obtained from the Exeter gaoler 's wife ; he was at home , and after waiting a short time , she was ushered by the clerk into his presence .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 12]: `` What can I do for you , young lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 28]: inquired Mr Trevor , with some surprise : `` it is not often that the den of a lawyer has such a bright vision to cheer it .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 10]: Do me the favour to take a chair . ''
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 42]: `` I am not a young lady , sir , '' replied Mary ; `` I have come to you to request that you will be so kind as to defend my brother , who is about to be tried . ''
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 4]: `` Your brother !
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 7]: what is he charged with ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 28]: `` Murder , '' replied Mary ; `` but indeed , sir , he is not guilty , '' she continued , as she burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 16]: Mr Trevor was not only a clever , but also a kind and considerate man .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 14]: He remained silent for some minutes to allow Mary time to recover herself .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 18]: When she was more composed , he said -- `` What is your brother 's name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 5]: `` Joseph Rushbrook . ''
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 3]: `` Rushbrook !
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 2]: Rushbrook !
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 21]: I well remember that name , '' remarked Mr Trevor ; `` strange , the Christian name also the same !
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 5]: it is singular certainly .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 42]: The last time I was concerned for a person of that name , I was the means of his coming into a large landed property ; now I am requested to defend one of the same name accused of murder . ''
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 16]: Mary was astonished at this observation of Mr Trevor 's , but made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 6]: `` Have you the indictment ?
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 8]: Where did the murder take place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 11]: `` In Devonshire , sir , many years ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 9]: `` And he is now in Exeter gaol ?
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 9]: Come , tell me all the particulars . ''
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 15]: Mary told all that she knew , in a very clear and concise manner .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 19]: `` Now , my good girl , '' said Mr Trevor , `` I must see your brother .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 10]: In two days I shall be down at Exeter .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 42]: If you write to him , or see him before I do , you must tell him he must trust in his lawyer , and have no reservation , or I shall not be able to do him so much service .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 13]: Allow me to ask you have you any relations in Yorkshire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 8]: `` No , sir , none . ''
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 13]: `` And yet the name and Christian name are exactly the same .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 6]: It 's an odd coincidence !
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 16]: They , however , changed their name , when they came into the property . ''
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 10]: `` Changed the name of Rushbrook , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 16]: said Mary , who now thought that she had a clue to Joey 's parents .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 14]: `` Yes , changed it to Austin ; they live now in Dorsetshire .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 25]: I mention it because , if interest is required for your brother , and he could prove any relationship , it might be valuable .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 5]: But , bless me !
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 5]: what is the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 18]: Smithers , '' cried Mr Trevor , as he ran and supported Mary , `` some water !
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 2]: quick !
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 6]: the girl has fainted ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 46]: It was surprise at this astounding intelligence , her regard for Mrs Austin , and the light now thrown upon the interest she had shown for our hero , and the conviction of what must be her suffering , which had overcome the poor girl .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 7]: In a short time she recovered .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 31]: `` I thank you , sir , but I have suffered so much anxiety about my poor brother , '' said Mary , faltering , and almost gasping for breath .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 23]: `` He can not be a very bad boy , since you are so fond of him , '' said Mr Trevor .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 17]: `` No , indeed ; I wish I was half as good , '' murmured Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 41]: `` I will do all I possibly can , and that immediately ; indeed , as soon as I have the documents , and have perused them , I will go to your brother a day sooner than I intended .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 10]: Do you feel yourself well enough to go now ?
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 12]: If you do , my clerk shall procure you a coach .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 6]: Do you stay in London ?
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 10]: If so , you must leave your address . ''
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 22]: Mary replied that she intended to set off to Exeter that evening by the mail , and would meet him there .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 27]: Mr Trevor handed her out , put her into the coach , and she ordered the man to drive to the inn where she was stopping .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 7]: Mary 's senses were quite bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 16]: It was late , and the mail was to start in an hour or two .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 18]: She secured her place , and during her long journey she hardly knew how time passed away .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 14]: On her arrival , in the morning , she hastened to the prison .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 25]: She was received kindly , as before , by the gaoler and his wife , and then attended the turnkey into Joey 's cell .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 32]: As soon as the door was closed she threw herself down on the bedstead , and wept bitterly , quite heedless of our hero 's remonstrance or attempts to soothe her .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 8]: it is horrible -- too horrible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 6]: cried the almost fainting girl .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 9]: `` What can -- what must be done !
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 7]: Either way , misery -- disgrace !
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 5]: Lord , forgive me !
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 6]: But my head is turned .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 6]: That you should be here !
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 8]: That you should be in this strait !
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 6]: Why was it not me ?
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 9]: I -- I have deserved all and more !
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 22]: prison , death , everything is not too bad for me ; but you , my dear , dear boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 10]: `` Mary , what is the reason of this ?
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 5]: I can not understand .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 9]: Are matters worse than they were before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 3]: said Joey .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 13]: `` And why should you talk in such a way about yourself ?
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 26]: If you ever did wrong , you were driven to it by the conduct of others ; but your reformation is all your own . ''
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 6]: `` Ah , Joey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 24]: replied Mary ; `` I should think little of my repentance if I held myself absolved by a few years ' good conduct .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 35]: No , no ; a whole life of repentance is not sufficient for me ; I must live on , ever repenting , and must die full of penitence , and imploring for pardon .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 9]: But why do I talk of myself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 10]: `` What has made you thus , Mary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 20]: `` Joey , I can not keep it a secret from you ; it is useless to attempt it .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 9]: I have discovered your father and mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 5]: `` Where are they ?
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 10]: and do they know anything of my position ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 13]: `` Yes ; your mother does , but not your father . ''
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 13]: `` Tell me all , Mary , and tell me quickly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 12]: `` Your father and mother are Mr and Mrs Austin . ''
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 21]: Joey 's utterance failed him from astonishment ; he stared at Mary , but he could not utter a word .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 16]: Mary again wept ; and Joey for some minutes remained by her side in silence .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 20]: `` Come , Mary , '' said Joey at last , `` you can now tell me everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 63]: Joey sat down by her side , and Mary then communicated what had passed between herself and Mrs Austin ; her acknowledgement that he was her relation ; the interest she took in him ; the money she had lavished ; her sufferings , which she had witnessed ; and then she wound up with the conversation between her and Mr Trevor .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 16]: `` You see , my dear boy , there is no doubt of the fact .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 25]: I believe I did promise Mrs Austin to say nothing to you about it ; but I forgot my promise all just this minute .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 11]: Now , Joey , what is to be done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 34]: `` Tell me something about my father , Mary , '' said Joey ; `` I wish to know how he is estimated , and how he behaves in his new position . ''
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 36]: Mary told him all she knew , which was not a great deal ; he was respected ; but he was a strange man , kept himself very much aloof from others and preferred seclusion .
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 23]: `` Mary , '' said Joey , `` you know what were my intentions before ; they are now still more fixed .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 14]: I will take my chance ; but I never will say one word .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 29]: You already know and have guessed more than I could wish ; I will not say that you are right , for it is not my secret . ''
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 28]: `` I thought as much , '' replied Mary , `` and I feel how much my arguments must be weakened by the disclosures I have made .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 14]: Before , I only felt for you ; now I feel for all .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 4]: Oh , Joey !
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 24]: why are you , so innocent , to be punished this way , and I , so guilty , to be spared ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 27]: `` It is the will of God that I should be in this strait , Mary ; and now let us not renew the subject . ''
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 41]: `` But , Joey , Mr Trevor is coming here to-morrow ; and he told me to tell you that you must have no reservation with your lawyer , if you wish him to be of service to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 21]: `` You have given your message , Mary ; and now you must leave me to deal with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 12]: `` My heart is breaking , '' said Mary , solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 16]: `` I wish I were in my grave if that wish is not wicked . ''
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 25]: `` Mary , recollect one thing ; -- recollect it supports me , and let it support you ; -- I am innocent . ''
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 20]: `` You are , I 'm sure ; would to Heaven that I could say the same for another !
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 16]: But tell me , Joey , what shall I do when I meet your mother ?
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 9]: I loved her before ; but , oh !
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 7]: how much I love her now !
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 5]: What shall I do ?
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 10]: Shall I tell her that I have discovered all ?
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 13]: I do not know how I can keep it from her . ''
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 45]: `` Mary , I see no objection to your telling her , but tell her also that I will not see her till after my trial ; whatever my fate may be , I should like to see her after that is decided . ''
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 33]: `` I will take your message the day after to-morrow , '' replied Mary ; `` now I must go and look out for lodgings , and then write to your mother .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 4]: Bless you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 28]: Mary quitted the cell ; she had suffered so much that she could hardly gain the gaoler 's parlour , where she sat down to recover herself .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 35]: She inquired of the gaoler 's wife if she could procure apartments near the prison , and the woman requested one of the turnkeys to take her to a lodging which would be suitable .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 60]: As soon as Mary was located , she wrote a letter to Mrs Austin , informing her of her having seen the lawyer , and that his services were secured ; and then , worn out with the anxiety and excitement of the three last days , she retired to bed , and in her sleep forgot her sufferings .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY SIX .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 12]: IN WHICH OUR HERO MAKES UP HIS MIND TO BE HANGED .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 23]: Our hero was not sorry to be left alone ; for the first time he felt the absence of Mary a relief .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 38]: He was almost as much bewildered as poor Mary with the strange discovery ; his father a great landed proprietor , one of the first men in the county , universally respected -- in the first society !
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 23]: his mother , as he knew by Mary 's letters written long ago , courted and sought after , loved and admired !
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 90]: If he had made a resolution -- a promise he might say -- when a mere child that he would take the onus of the deed upon his own shoulders , to protect his father , then a poacher and in humble life , how much more was it his duty , now that his father would so feel any degradation -- now that , being raised so high , his fall would be so bitter , his disgrace so deeply felt , and the stigma so doubly severe !
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 70]: `` No , no , '' thought Joey , `` were I to impeach my father now -- to accuse him of a deed which would bring him to the scaffold -- I should not only be considered his murderer , but it would be said I had done it to inherit his possessions ; I should be considered one who had sacrificed his father to obtain his property .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 38]: I should be scouted , shunned , and deservedly despised ; the disgrace of my father having been hanged would be a trifle compared with the reproach of a son having condemned a parent to the gallows .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 30]: Now I am doubly bound to keep to my resolution ; and come what may the secret shall die with me : '' and Joey slept soundly that night .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 10]: The next morning Mr Trevor came into his cell .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 32]: `` I have seen your sister , Rushbrook , '' said he , `` and at her request , have come to assist you , if it is in my power .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 82]: She has been here since , I have been informed , and if so , I have no doubt that she has told you that you must have no secrets with your lawyer : your legal friend and adviser in this case is your true friend : he is bound in honour to secrecy , and were you to declare now that you were guilty of this murder , the very confidence would only make me more earnest in your defence .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 43]: I have here all the evidence at the coroner 's inquest , and the verdict against you ; tell me honestly what did take place , and then I shall know better how to convince the jury that it did not . ''
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 30]: `` You are very kind , sir ; but I can say nothing even to you , except that , on my honour , I am not guilty . ''
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 14]: `` But , tell me , then , how did it happen . ''
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 25]: `` I have nothing more to say , and , with my thanks to you , sir , I will say nothing more . ''
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 19]: `` This is very strange : the evidence was strong against you , was the evidence correct ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 16]: `` The parties were correct in their evidence , as it appeared to them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 9]: `` And yet you are not guilty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 20]: `` I am not ; I shall plead not guilty , and leave my fate to the jury . ''
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 5]: `` Are you mad ?
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 27]: Your sister is a sweet young woman , and has interested me greatly ; but , if innocent , you are throwing away your life . ''
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 24]: `` I am doing my duty , sir ; whatever you may think of my conduct , the secret dies with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 30]: `` And for whom do you sacrifice yourself in this way , if as , you say , and as your sister declares , you are not guilty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 12]: Joey made no reply , but sat down on the bedstead .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 17]: `` If the deed was not done by you , by whom was it done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 4]: urged Mr Trevor .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 17]: `` If you make no reply to that , I must throw up my brief . ''
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 50]: `` You said just now , '' returned Joey , `` that if I declared myself guilty of the murder , you would still defend me ; now , because I say I am not , and will not say who is , you must throw up your brief .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 6]: Surely you are inconsistent . ''
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 12]: `` I must have your confidence , my good lad . ''
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 11]: `` You never will have more than you have now .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 9]: I have not requested you to defend me .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 7]: I care nothing about defence . ''
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 10]: `` Then , you wish to be hanged ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 23]: `` No , I do not ; but , rather than say anything , I will take my chance of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 61]: `` This is very strange , '' said Mr Trevor : after a pause , he continued , `` I observe that you are supposed to have killed this man , Byres , when nobody else was present ; you were known to go out with your father 's gun , and the keeper 's evidence proved that you poached .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 56]: Now , as there is no evidence of intentional murder on your part , it is not impossible that the gun went off by accident , and that , mere boy as you must have been at that age , you were so frightened at what had taken place , that you absconded from fear .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 14]: It appears to me that that should be our line of defence . ''
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 14]: `` I never fired at the man at all , '' said Joey .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 9]: `` Who fired the gun , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 4]: asked Mr Trevor .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 5]: Joey made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 43]: `` Rushbrook , '' said Mr Trevor , `` I am afraid I can be of little use to you ; indeed , were it not that your sister 's tears have interested me , I would not take up your cause .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 54]: I can not understand your conduct , which appears to me to be absurd ; your motives are inexplicable , and all I can believe is , that you have committed the crime , and will not divulge the secret to any one , not even to those who would befriend you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 61]: `` Think of me what you please , sir , '' rejoined our hero ; `` see me condemned , and , if it should be so , executed ; and , after all _ that _ has taken place , believe me , when I assert to you -- as I hope for salvation -- I am not guilty .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 62]: I thank you , sir , thank you sincerely , for the interest you have shown for me ; I feel grateful , excessively grateful , and the more so for what you have said of Mary ; but if you were to remain here for a month , you could gain no more from me than you have already . ''
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 34]: `` After such an avowal , it is useless my stopping here , '' said Mr Trevor ; `` I must make what defence I can , for your sister 's sake . ''
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 23]: `` Many , many thanks , sir , for your kindness ; I am really grateful to you , '' replied Joey .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 13]: Mr Trevor remained for a minute scanning the countenance or our hero .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 31]: There was something in it so clear and bright , so unflinching , so proclaiming innocence , and high feeling , that he sighed deeply as he left the cell .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 38]: His subsequent interview with Mary was short ; he explained to her the difficulties arising from the obstinacy of her brother ; but at the same time expressed his determination to do his best to save him .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 20]: Mary , as soon as she had seen Mr Trevor , set off on her return to the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 39]: As soon as she went to Mrs Austin , Mary apprised her of Mr Trevor 's having consented to act as counsel for our hero , and also of Joey 's resolute determination not to divulge the secret .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 47]: `` Madam , '' said Mary , after some hesitation , `` it is my duty to have no secret from you : and I hope you will not be angry when I tell you that I have discovered that which you would have concealed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 9]: `` What have you discovered , Mary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 10]: asked Mrs Austin , looking at her with alarm .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 23]: `` That Joseph Rushbrook is your own son , '' said Mary , kneeling down and kissing the hand of her mistress .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 16]: `` The secret is safe with me , depend upon it , '' she continued .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 21]: `` And how have you made the discovery , Mary ; for I will not attempt to deny it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 13]: Mary then entered into a detail of her conversation with Mr Trevor .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 40]: `` He asked me , '' said she , `` as the sister of Joey , if we had any relatives , and I replied , ` No ; ' so that he has no suspicion of the fact .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 28]: I beg your pardon , madam , but I could not keep it from Joey ; I quite forgot my promise to you at the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 10]: `` And what did my poor child say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 29]: `` That he would not see you until after his trial ; but , when his fate was decided , he should like to see you once more .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 9]: Oh , madam , what a painful sacrifice !
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 18]: and yet , now , I do not blame him ; for it is his duty . ''
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 46]: `` My dread is not for my son , Mary ; he is innocent ; and that to me is everything ; but if my husband was to hear of his being about to be tried , I know not what would be the consequence .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 10]: If it can only be kept from his knowledge !
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 8]: God knows that he has suffered enough !
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 6]: But what am I saying ?
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 6]: I was talking nonsense . ''
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 5]: `` Oh , madam !
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 16]: I know the whole ; I can not be blinded either by Joey or you .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 24]: I beg your pardon , madam ; but although Joey would not reply , I told him that his father did the deed .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 37]: But do not answer me , madam ; be silent , as your son has been : and believe me when I say that my suspicion could not be wrenched from me even by torture . ''
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 19]: `` I do trust you , Mary ; and perhaps the knowledge that you have obtained is advantageous .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 8]: When does the trial come on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 13]: `` The assizes commence to-morrow forenoon , madam , they say . ''
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 11]: how I long to have him in these arms ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 4]: exclaimed Mrs Austin .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 38]: `` It is indeed a sad trial to a mother , madam , '' replied Mary ; `` but still it must not be until after he is -- '' `` Yes ; until he is condemned !
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 22]: God have mercy on me ; Mary , you had better return to Exeter ; but write to me every day .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 24]: Stay by him and comfort him ; and may the God of comfort listen to the prayers of an unhappy and distracted mother !
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 4]: Leave me now .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 8]: God bless you , my dear girl !
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 7]: you have indeed proved a comfort .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 5]: Leave me now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 11]: IN WHICH OUR HERO PROVES GAME TO THE VERY LAST .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 5]: Mary returned to Exeter .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 15]: The trial of our hero was expected to come on on the following day .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 47]: She preferred being with Joey to witnessing the agony and distress of Mrs Austin , to whom she could offer no comfort ; indeed , her own state of suspense was so wearing , that she almost felt relief when the day of trial came on .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 55]: Mr Trevor had once more attempted to reason with Joey , but our hero continued firm in his resolution , and Mr Trevor , when he made his appearance in the court , wore upon his countenance the marks of sorrow and discontent ; he did not , nevertheless , fail in his duty .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 80]: Joey was brought to the bar , and his appearance was so different from that which was to be expected in one charged with the crime of murder , that strong interest was immediately excited ; the spectators anticipated a low-bred ruffian , and they beheld a fair , handsome young man , with an open brow and intelligent countenance , whose eye quailed not when it met their own , and whose demeanour was bold without being offensive .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 49]: True that there were traces of sorrow on his countenance , and that his cheeks were pale ; but no one who had any knowledge of human nature , or any feeling of charity in his disposition , could say that there was the least appearance of guilt .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 36]: The jury were empannelled , the counts of the indictment read over , and the trial commenced , and , as the indictment was preferred , the judge caught the date of the supposed offence .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 7]: `` What is the date ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 12]: said the judge ; `` the year , I mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 17]: Upon the reply of the clerk , his lordship observed , `` Eight years ago ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 20]: and then looking at the prisoner , added , `` Why , he must have been a child . ''
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 35]: `` As is too often the case , '' replied the prosecuting counsel ; `` a child in years , but not in guilt , as we shall soon bring evidence to substantiate . ''
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 48]: As the evidence brought forward was the same , as we have already mentioned , as given on the inquest over the body , we shall pass it over ; that of Furness , as he was not to be found , was read to the court .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 35]: As the trial proceeded , and as each fact came forth more condemning , people began to look with less compassion on the prisoner : they shook their heads , and compressed their lips .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 20]: As soon as the evidence for the Crown was closed , Mr Trevor rose in our hero 's defence .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 33]: He commenced by ridiculing the idea of trying a mere child upon so grave a charge , for a child the prisoner must have been at the time the offence was committed .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 57]: `` Look at him now , gentlemen of the jury ; eight years ago the murder of the pedlar , Byres , took place ; why , you may judge for yourselves whether he is now more than seventeen years of age ; he could scarcely have held a gun at the time referred to . ''
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 17]: `` The prisoner 's age does not appear in the indictment , '' observed the judge .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 11]: `` May we ask his age , my lord ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 6]: demanded one of the jury .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 32]: `` The prisoner may answer the question if he pleases , '' replied the judge , `` not otherwise ; perhaps he may not yet be seventeen years , of age .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 14]: Do you wish to state your age to the jury , prisoner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 32]: `` I have no objection , my lord , '' replied Joey , not regarding the shakes of the head of his counsel : `` I was twenty-two last month . ''
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 55]: Mr Trevor bit his lips at this unfortunate regard for truth in our hero , and , after a time , proceeded , observing that the very candour of the prisoner , in not taking advantage of his youthful appearance to deceive the jury , ought to be a strong argument in his favour .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 213]: Mr Trevor then continued to address the jury upon the vagueness of the evidence , and , as he proceeded , observed -- `` Now , gentlemen of the jury , if this case had been offered to me to give an opinion upon , I should , without any previous knowledge of the prisoner , have just come to the following conclusion -- I should have said -LRB- and your intelligence and good sense will , I have no doubt , bear me out in this supposition -RRB- , that , allowing that the pedlar , Byres , did receive his death by the prisoner 's hand -- I say , gentlemen , that _ allowing _ such to have been the case , for I deny that it is borne out by the evidence -- that it must have been _ that _ , at the sudden meeting with the pedlar , when the lad 's conscience told him that what he was doing was wrong , that the gun of the prisoner was discharged unintentionally , and the consequence was fatal ; I should then surmise , further , that the prisoner , frightened at the deed which he had unintentionally committed , had absconded upon the first impulse .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 45]: That , gentlemen I believe to be the real state of the case ; and what was more natural than that a child under such circumstances should have been frightened , and have attempted to evade the inquiry which must have eventually ensued ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 28]: `` You state such to be your opinion , Mr Trevor ; do you wish me to infer that the prisoner pleads such as his defence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 4]: asked the judge .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 29]: `` My lord , '' replied Mr Trevor , in a hesitating way , `` the prisoner has pleaded not guilty to the crime imputed to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 49]: `` That I am aware of , but I wish to know whether you mean to say that the prisoner 's defence is , not having anything to do with the death of the pedlar , or upon the plea of his gun going off by accident ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 18]: `` My lord , it is my duty to my client to make no admission whatever . ''
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 29]: `` I should think that you would be safe enough , all circumstances considered , if you took the latter course , '' observed the judge , humanely .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 15]: Mr Trevor was now in a dilemma ; he knew not how to move .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 58]: He was fearful , if he stated positively that our hero 's gun went off by accident , that Joey would deny it ; and yet if he was permitted to assert this to be the case , he saw , from the bearing of the judge , that the result of the trial would be satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 34]: It hardly need be observed that both judge , prosecuting counsel , jury , and everybody in court , were much astonished at this hesitation on the part of the prisoner 's counsel .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 18]: `` Do you mean to assert that the gun went off by accident , Mr Trevor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 4]: asked the judge .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 20]: `` I never fired the gun , my lord , '' replied Joey , in a calm steady voice .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 75]: `` The prisoner has answered for me , '' replied Mr Trevor , recovering himself ; `` we are perfectly aware that by making a statement of accidental murder , we could safely have left the prisoner in the hands of an intelligent jury ; but the fact is , my lord , that the prisoner never fired the gun , and therefore could not be guilty of the murder imputed to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 66]: Mr Trevor had felt , upon our hero 's assertion , that his case was hopeless ; he roused up , however , to make a strong appeal to the jury ; unfortunately , it was declamation only , not disproof of the charges , and the reply of the prosecuting counsel completely established the guilt of our hero upon what is called presumptive evidence .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 32]: The jury retired for a few minutes after the summing up of the judge , and then returned a verdict against our hero of Guilty , but recommended him to mercy .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 63]: Although the time to which we refer was one in which leniency was seldom extended , still there was the youth of our hero , and so much mystery in the transaction , that when the judge passed the sentence , he distinctly stated that the royal mercy would be so far extended , that the sentence would be commuted to transportation .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 37]: Our hero made no reply ; he bowed , and was led back to his place of confinement , and in a few minutes afterwards the arms of the weeping Mary were encircled round his neck .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 10]: `` You do n't blame me , Mary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 3]: said Joey .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 24]: `` No , no , '' sobbed Mary ; `` all that the world can do is nothing when we are innocent . ''
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 27]: `` I shall soon be far from here , Mary , '' said Joey , sitting down on the bedstead ; `` but , thank Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 5]: it is over . ''
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 23]: The form of Emma Phillips rose up in our hero 's imagination , and he covered up his face with his hands .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 9]: `` Had it not been for her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 3]: thought he .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 8]: `` What must she think of me !
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 4]: a convicted felon !
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 12]: this is the hardest of all to bear up against . ''
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 33]: `` Joey , '' said Mary , who had watched him in silence and tears , `` I must go now ; you will see her now , will you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 7]: `` She never will see me !
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 9]: she despises me already , '' replied Joey .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 8]: `` Your mother despise her noble boy ?
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 4]: Oh , never !
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 7]: How can you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 14]: `` I was thinking of somebody else , Mary , '' replied Joey .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 11]: `` Yes , I wish to see my mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 16]: `` Then I will go now ; recollect what her anxiety and impatience must be .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 14]: I will travel post to-night , and be there by to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 13]: `` Go , dear Mary , go , and God bless you !
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 21]: hasten to my poor mother , and tell her that I am quite -- yes -- quite happy and resigned .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 6]: Go now , quickly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 65]: Mary left the cell , and Joey , whose heart was breaking at the moment that he said he was happy and resigned , for he was thinking of his eternal separation from Emma , as soon as he was alone , threw himself on the bed , and gave full vent to those feelings of bitter anguish which he could no longer repress .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 13]: IN WHICH EVERYBODY APPEARS TO BE ON THE MOVE EXCEPT OUR HERO .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 13]: Mary set off with post-horses and arrived at the Hall before daylight .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 41]: She remained in her own room until the post came in , when her first object was to secure the newspapers before the butler had opened them , stating that her mistress was awake , and requested to see them .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 45]: She took the same precaution when the other papers came in late in the day , so that Mr Austin should not read the account of the trial ; this was the more easy to accomplish , as he seldom looked at a newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 25]: As soon as the usual hour had arrived , Mary presented herself to her mistress , and communicated the melancholy result of the trial .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 81]: Mrs Austin desired Mary to say to the servants that she was going to remain with a lady , a friend of hers , some miles off , who was dangerously ill ; and should in all probability , not return that night , or even the next , if her friend was not better ; and , her preparations for the journey being completed , she set off with Mary a little before dark on her way to Exeter .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 52]: But , if Mr Austin did not look at the newspapers , others did , and amongst the latter was Major McShane , who , having returned from his tour , was sitting with O'Donahue and the two ladies in the library of his own house when the post came in .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 35]: The major had hardly looked at the newspapers , when the name of Rushbrook caught his eye ; he turned to it , read a portion , and gave a loud whistle of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 10]: `` What 's the matter , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 4]: asked Mrs McShane .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 31]: `` Murder 's the matter , my jewel , '' returned the major ; `` but do n't interrupt me just now , for I 'm breathless with confusion . ''
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 28]: McShane read the whole account of the trial , and the verdict , and then without saying a word , put it into the bands of O'Donahue .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 16]: As soon as O'Donahue had finished it , McShane beckoned him out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 36]: `` I did n't like to let Mrs McShane know it , as she would take it sorely to heart , '' said McShane : `` but what 's to be done now , O'Donahue ?
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 16]: You see the boy has not peached upon his father , and has convicted himself .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 78]: It would be poor comfort to Mrs McShane , who loves the memory of that boy better than she would a dozen little McShanes , if it pleased Heaven to grant them to her , to know that the boy is found , when he is only found to be sent away over the water ; so it is better that nothing should be said about it just now : but what is to be done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 21]: `` Well , it appears to me that we had better be off to Exeter directly , '' replied O'Donahue .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 12]: `` Yes , and see him , '' rejoined the major .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 41]: `` Before I saw him , McShane , I would call upon the lawyer who defended him , and tell him what you know about the father , and what our suspicions , I may say , convictions , are .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 19]: He would then tell us how to proceed , so as to procure his pardon , perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 19]: `` That 's good advice ; and now what excuse are we to make for running away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 42]: `` As for my wife , '' replied O'Donahue , `` I may as well tell her the truth ; she will keep it secret ; and as for yours , she will believe anything you please to tell her . ''
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 69]: `` And so she will , the good creature , and that 's why I never can bear to deceive her about anything ; but , in this instance , it is all for her own sake and therefore , suppose your wife says that you must go to town immediately , and that I had better accompany you , as it is upon a serious affair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 29]: `` Be it so , '' replied O'Donahue ; `` do you order the horses to be put to while I settle the affair with the females . ''
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 42]: This was soon done , and in half an hour the two gentlemen were on their way to Exeter ; and as soon as they arrived , which was late in the evening , they established themselves at the principal hotel .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 28]: In the mean time Mrs Austin and Mary had also arrived and had taken up their quarters at another hotel where Mrs Austin would be less exposed .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 41]: It was , however , too late to visit our hero when they arrived , and the next morning they proceeded to the gaol , much about the same hour that McShane and O'Donahue paid their visit to Mr Trevor .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 41]: Perhaps it will be better to leave to the imagination of our readers the scene which occurred between our hero and his mother , as we have had too many painful ones already in this latter portion of our narrative .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 95]: The joy and grief of both at meeting again , only to part for ever -- the strong conflict between duty and love -- the lacerated feelings of the doting mother , the true and affectionate son , and the devoted servant and friend -- may be better imagined than expressed ; but their grief was raised to its climax when our hero , pressed in his mother 's arms as he narrated his adventures , confessed that another pang was added to his sufferings in parting with the object of his earliest affections .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 17]: `` My poor , poor boy , this is indeed a bitter cup to drink ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 4]: exclaimed Mrs Austin .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 18]: `` May God , in His mercy , look down upon you , and console you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 38]: `` He will , mother : and when far away -- not before , not until you can safely do so , promise me to go to Emma , and tell her that I was not guilty .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 12]: I can bear anything but that she should despise me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 20]: `` I will , my child , I will ; and I will love her dearly for your sake .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 12]: Now go on with your history , my dear boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 35]: We must leave our hero and his mother in conversation , and return to McShane and O'Donahue , who , as soon as they had breakfasted , repaired to the lodgings of Mr Trevor .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 16]: McShane , who was spokesman , soon entered upon the business which brought them there .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 38]: Mr Trevor stated to him the pertinacity of our hero , and the impossibility of saving him from condemnation , remarking , at the same time , that there was a mystery which he could not fathom .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 40]: McShane took upon himself to explain that mystery , having , as we have before observed , already been sufficiently clear-sighted to fathom it ; and referred to O'Donahue to corroborate his opinion of the elder Rushbrook 's character .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 16]: `` And this father of his is totally lost sight of ; you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 4]: observed Mr Trevor .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 16]: `` Altogether : I have never been able to trace him , '' replied McShane .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 13]: `` I was observing to his sister -- '' said Mr Trevor .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 10]: `` He has no sister , '' interrupted McShane .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 39]: `` Still there is a young woman -- and a very sweet young woman , too -- who came to me in London , to engage me for his defence , who represented herself as his sister . ''
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 11]: `` That is strange , '' rejoined McShane , musing .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 78]: `` But , however , '' continued Mr Trevor , `` as I was about to say , I was observing to this young woman how strange it was , that the first time I was legally employed for the name of Rushbrook , it should be a case which , in the opinion of the world , should produce the highest gratification , and that in the second in one which has ended in misery . ''
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 7]: `` How do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 3]: inquired McShane .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 17]: `` I put a person of the name of Rushbrook in possession of a large fortune .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 20]: I asked our young friend 's sister whether he could be any relation ; but she said no . ''
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 15]: `` Young Rushbrook had no sister , I am sure , '' interrupted McShane .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 32]: `` I now recollect , '' continued Mr Trevor , `` that this person who came into the fortune stated that he had formerly held a commission in the army . ''
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 23]: `` Then , depend on it , it 's Rushbrook himself , who has given himself brevet rank , '' replied McShane .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 7]: `` Where is he now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 10]: `` Down in Dorsetshire , '' said Mr Trevor .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 16]: `` He succeeded to the Austin estates , and has taken the name . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 18]: 'T is he -- 't is he -- I 'll swear to it , '' cried McShane .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 3]: `` Phillaloo !
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 4]: Murder and Irish !
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 6]: the murder 's out now .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 17]: No wonder this gentleman would n't return my visit , and keeps himself entirely at home .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 34]: I beg your pardon , Mr Trevor , but what sort of a looking personage may he be , for as I have said , I have never seen this Mr Austin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 40]: `` A fine , tall , soldierly man ; I should say rough , but still not vulgar ; dark hair and eyes , aquiline nose ; if I recollect right -- '' '' 'T is the man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 3]: exclaimed O'Donahue .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 11]: `` And his wife -- did you see her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 3]: asked McShane .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 11]: `` No I did not , '' replied Mr Trevor .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 25]: `` Well , I have seen her very often , '' rejoined McShane ; `` and a very nice creature she appears to be .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 11]: I have never been in their house in my life .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 47]: I called and left my card , that 's all ; but I have met her several times ; however , as you have not seen her , that proves nothing ; and now , Mr Trevor , what do you think we should do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 65]: `` I really am not prepared to advise ; it is a case of great difficulty ; I think , however , it would be advisable for you to call upon young Rushbrook , and see what you can obtain from him ; after that , if you come here to-morrow morning , I will be better prepared to give you an answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 35]: `` I will do as you wish , sir ; I will call upon my friend first , and my name 's not McShane if I do n't call upon his father afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 43]: `` Do nothing rashly , I beg , '' replied Mr Trevor ; `` recollect you have come to me for advice , and I think you are bound at least to hear what I have to propose before you act . ''
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 28]: `` That 's the truth , Mr Trevor ; so now with many thanks , we will take our leave , and call upon you to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 17]: McShane and O'Donahue then proceeded to the gaol , and demanded permission to see our hero .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 36]: `` There are two ladies with him , just now , '' said the gaoler ; `` they have been there these three hours , so I suppose they will not be much longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 11]: `` We will wait , then , '' replied O'Donahue .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 36]: In about a quarter of an hour Mrs Austin and Mary made their appearance ; the former was closely veiled when she entered the gaoler 's parlour , in which O'Donahue and McShane were waiting .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 49]: It had not been the intention of Mrs Austin to have gone into the parlour , but her agitation and distress had so overcome her that she could scarcely walk , and Mary had persuaded her as she came down to go in and take glass of water .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 43]: The gentlemen rose when she came in ; she immediately recognised McShane , and the sudden rush into her memory of what might be the issue of the meeting , was so overwhelming , that she dropped into a chair and fainted .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 23]: Mary ran for some water , and while she did so , McShane and O'Donahue went to the assistance of Mrs Austin .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 33]: The veil was removed ; and , of course , she was immediately recognised by McShane , who was now fully convinced that Austin and Rushbrook were one and the same person .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 34]: Upon the first signs of returning animation , McShane had the delicacy to withdraw , and making a sign to the gaoler , he and O'Donahue repaired to the cell of our hero .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 8]: The greeting was warm on both sides .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 37]: McShane was eager to enter upon the subject ; he pointed out to Joey that he knew who committed the murder ; indeed , plainly told him , that it was the deed of his father .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 77]: But Joey , as before , would admit nothing ; he was satisfied with their belief in his innocence , but , having made up his mind to suffer , could not be persuaded to reveal the truth , and McShane and O'Donahue quitted the cell , perceiving that , unless most decided steps were taken , without the knowledge of our hero , there was no chance of his being extricated from his melancholy fate .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 29]: Struck with admiration at his courage and self-devotion towards an unworthy parent , they bade him farewell , simply promising to use all their endeavours in his behalf .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 4]: CHAPTER FORTY NINE .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 3]: THE INTERVIEW .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 69]: According to their arrangement , on the following morning , McShane and O'Donahue called upon Mr Trevor , and after half an hour 's consultation , it was at last decided that they should make an attempt to see Austin , and bide the issue of the interview , when they would again communicate with the lawyer , who was to return to town on the following day .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 30]: They then set off as fast as four horses could convey them , and drove direct to the Hall , where they arrived about six o'clock in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 15]: It had so happened that Austin had the evening before inquired for his wife .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 43]: The servant reported to him what Mary had told them , and Austin , who was in a fidgety humour , had sent for the coachman who had driven the carriage , to inquire whether Mrs Austin 's friend was very ill .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 29]: The coachman stated that he had not driven over to the place in question , but to the nearest post-town , where Mrs Austin had taken a postchaise .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 70]: This mystery and concealment on the part of his wife was not very agreeable to a man of Mr Austin 's temper ; he was by turns indignant and alarmed ; and after having passed a sleepless night , had been all the day anxiously waiting Mrs Austin 's return , when the sound of wheels was heard , and the carriage of McShane drove up to the door .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 45]: On inquiry if Mr Austin was at home , the servants replied that they would ascertain ; and Austin , who imagined that this unusual visit might be connected with his wife 's mysterious absence , desired the butler to show in the visitors .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 27]: Austin started at the announcement of the names , but recovering himself ; he remained standing near the table , drawn up to his full height .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 55]: `` Mr Austin , '' said O'Donahue , `` we have ventured to call upon you upon an affair of some importance : as Mr Austin , we have not the pleasure of your acquaintance , but we were formerly , if I mistake not , serving his majesty in the same regiment . ''
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 48]: `` I do not pretend to deny , gentlemen , that you once knew me under different circumstances , '' replied Austin , haughtily ; `` will you please to be seated , and then probably you will favour me with the cause of this visit . ''
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 31]: `` May I inquire of you , Mr Austin , '' said McShane , `` if you may have happened to look over the newspapers within these few days ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 20]: and now I recollect -- which is unusual -- the papers have not been brought to me regularly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 20]: `` They were probably withheld from you in consequence of the intelligence they would have conveyed to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 11]: `` May I ask what that intelligence may be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 5]: inquired Austin , surprised .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 49]: `` The trial , conviction , and sentence to transportation for life of one Joseph Rushbrook , for the murder of a man of the name of Byres , '' replied McShane ; `` Mr Austin , you are of course aware that he is your son . ''
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 21]: `` You have , of course , seen the party , and he has made that statement to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 4]: replied Mr Austin .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 29]: `` We have seen the party , but he has not made that statement , '' replied O'Donahue ; `` but do you pretend to deny it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 23]: `` I am not aware upon what grounds you have thought proper to come here to interrogate me , '' replied Austin .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 30]: `` Supposing that I had a son , and that son has as you say been guilty of the deed , it certainly is no concern of yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 24]: `` First , with your leave , Mr Austin , '' said McShane , `` let me prove that he is your son .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 119]: You were living at Grassford , where the murder was committed ; your son ran away in consequence , and fell into the hands of Captain -LRB- now General -RRB- O'Donahue ; from him your son was made over to me , and I adopted him ; but having been recognised when at school , by Furness , the schoolmaster of the village , he absconded to avoid being apprehended ; and I have never seen him from that time till yesterday morning , when I called upon him , and had an interview as soon as his mother , Mrs Austin , had quitted the cell in Exeter gaol , where he is at present confined . ''
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 28]: Austin started -- here was the cause of Mrs Austin 's absence explained ; neither could he any longer refuse to admit that Joey was his son .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 41]: After a silence of a minute , he replied -- `` I have to thank you much for your kindness to my poor boy , Major McShane ; and truly sorry am I that he is in such a dilemma .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 16]: Now that I am acquainted with it , I shall do all in my power .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 29]: There are other Rushbrooks , gentlemen , and you can not be surprised at my not immediately admitting that such a disgrace had occurred to my own family .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 40]: Of Mrs Austin 's having been with him I assure you I had not any idea ; her having gone there puts it beyond a doubt , although it has been carefully concealed from me till this moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 21]: It must not be supposed that , because Austin replied so calmly to Major McShane , he was calm within .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 65]: On the contrary , from the very first of the interview he had been in a state of extreme excitement , and the struggle to command his feelings was terrible ; indeed , it was now so painfully expressed in his countenance , that O'Donahue said -- `` Perhaps , Mr Austin , you will allow me to ring for a little water ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 16]: `` No , sir , thank you , '' replied Austin , gasping for breath .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 40]: `` Since you have admitted that Joseph Rushbrook is your son , Mr Austin , '' continued McShane , `` your own flesh and blood , may I inquire of you what you intend to do in his behalf ?
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 22]: Do you intend to allow the law to take its course , and your son to be banished for life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 8]: `` What can I do , gentlemen ?
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 30]: He has been tried and condemned : of course if any exertion on my part can avail -- but I fear that there is no chance of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 31]: `` Mr Austin , if he were guilty I should not have interfered ; but , in my opinion , he is innocent ; do you not think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 28]: `` I do not believe , sir , that he ever would have done such a deed ; but that avails nothing , he is condemned . ''
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 18]: `` I grant it , unless the real murderer of the pedlar could be brought forward . ''
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 9]: `` Y-e-s , '' replied Austin , trembling .
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 10]: `` Shall I denounce him , Mr Austin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 7]: `` Do you know him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 8]: replied Austin , starting on his feet .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 27]: `` Yes , Rushbrook , '' replied McShane , in a voice of thunder , `` I do know him , -- 't is yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 20]: Austin could bear up no longer , he fell down on the floor as if he had been shot .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 77]: O'Donahue and McShane went to his assistance ; they raised him up , but he was insensible ; they then rang the bell for assistance , the servant came in , medical advice was sent for , and McShane and O'Donahue , perceiving there was no chance of prosecuting their intentions , in Mr Austin 's present state , quitted the Hall just as the chaise with Mrs Austin and Mary drove up to the door .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIFTY .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 19]: IN WHICH IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT THE STORY WINDS UP TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE READER .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 41]: It was not for some time after the arrival of the medical men that Mr Austin could be recovered from his state of insensibility , and when he was at last restored to life , it was not to reason .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 16]: He raved wildly , and it was pronounced that his attack was a brain fever .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 101]: As , in his incoherent exclamations , the name of Byres was frequently repeated , as soon as the medical assistants had withdrawn , Mrs Austin desired all the servants , with the exception of Mary , to quit the room ; they did so with reluctance , for their curiosity was excited , and there was shrugging of the shoulders , and whispering , and surmising , and repeating of the words which had escaped from their unconscious master 's lips , and hints that all was not right passed from one to another in the servants ' hall .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 102]: In the mean time , Mrs Austin and Mary remained with him ; and well it was that the servants had been sent away , if they were not to know what had taken place so long ago , for now Austin played the whole scene over again , denounced himself as a murderer , spoke of his son , and of his remorse , and then he would imagine himself in conflict with Byres -- he clenched his fists -- and he laughed and chuckled and then would change again to bitter lamentations for the deed which he had done .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 12]: `` Oh , Mary , how is this to end ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 12]: exclaimed Mrs Austin , after one of the paroxysms had subsided .
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 27]: `` As guilt always must end , madam , '' replied Mary , bursting into tears and clasping her hands , -- `` in misery . ''
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 20]: `` My dear Mary , do not distress yourself in that manner ; you are no longer guilty . ''
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 19]: `` Nor is my master then , madam ; for I am sure that he has repented . ''
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 38]: `` Yes , indeed , he has repented most sincerely ; one hasty deed has embittered his whole life -- he never has been happy since , and never will be until he is in heaven . ''
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 14]: `` Oh , what a happy relief it would be to him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 5]: replied Mary , musing .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 15]: `` I wish that I was , if such wish is not sinful . ''
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 25]: `` Mary , you must not add to my distress by talking in that manner ; I want your support and consolation now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 29]: `` You have a right to demand everything of me , madam , '' replied Mary , `` and I will do my best , I will indeed .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 22]: I have often felt this before , and I thank God for it ; it will make me more humble . ''
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 142]: The fever continued for many days , during which time Mr Austin was attended solely by his wife and Mary ; the latter had written to our hero , stating the cause of her absence from him in so trying a period , and she had received an answer , stating that he had received from very good authority the information that he was not likely to leave the country for some weeks , and requesting that Mary would remain with his mother until his father 's dangerous illness was decided one way or the other he stated that he should be perfectly satisfied if he only saw her once before his departure , to arrange with her relative to her affairs , and to give her legal authority to act for him , previously to his removal from the country .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 91]: He told her that he had perceived an advertisement in the London papers , evidently put in by his friends at Portsmouth , offering a handsome reward to any one who could give any account of him -- and that he was fearful that some of those who were at the trial would read it , and make known his position ; he begged Mary to write to him every day if possible , if it were only a few lines , and sent his devoted love to his mother .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 63]: Mary complied with all our hero 's requests , and every day a few lines were despatched ; and it was now ascertained by the other domestics , and by them made generally known , that a daily correspondence was kept up with a prisoner in Exeter gaol , which added still more mystery and interest to the state of Mr Austin .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 50]: Many were the calls and cards left at the Hall , and if we were to inquire whether curiosity or condolence was the motive of those who went there , we are afraid that the cause would , in most cases , have proved to have been the former .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 31]: Among others , O'Donahue and McShane did not fail to send every day , waiting for the time when they could persuade Austin to do justice to his own child .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 41]: The crisis , as predicted by the medical attendants , at last arrived , and Mr Austin recovered his reason ; but , at the same time , all hopes of his again rising from his bed were given over .
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 154]: This intelligence was communicated to his wife , who wept and wished , but dared not utter what she wished ; Mary , however took an opportunity , when Mrs Austin had quitted the room , to tell Mr Austin , who was in such a feeble state that he could hardly speak , that the time would soon come when he would be summoned before a higher tribunal , and conjured him , by the hopes he had of forgiveness , now that the world was fading away before his eyes , to put away all pride , and to do that justice to his son which our hero 's noble conduct towards him demanded -- to make a confession , either in writing or in presence of witnesses , before he died -- which would prove the innocence of his only child , the heir to the property and the name .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 27]: There was a straggle , and a long one , in the proud heart of Mr Austin before he could consent to this act of justice .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 64]: Mary had pointed out the propriety of it early in the morning , and it was not until late in the evening , after having remained in silence and with his eyes closed for the whole day , that Austin made a sign to his wife to bend down to him , and desired her in a half-whisper to send for a magistrate .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 26]: His request was immediately attended to ; and in an hour the summons was answered by one with whom Austin had been on good terms .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 19]: Austin made his deposition in few words , and was supported by Mary while he signed the paper .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 70]: It was done ; and when she would have removed the pen from his fingers , she found that it was still held fast , and that his head had fallen back ; the conflict between his pride and this act of duty had been too overpowering for him in his weak condition , and Mr Austin was dead before the ink of his signature had time to dry .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 34]: The gentleman who had been summoned in his capacity of magistrate , thought it advisable to remove from the scene of distress without attempting to communicate with Mrs Austin in her present sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 32]: He had been in conversation with O'Donahue and McShane at the time that he was summoned , and Mr Austin 's illness and the various reports abroad had been there canvassed .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 47]: O'Donahue and McShane had reserved the secret ; but when their friend was sent for , anticipating some such result would take place , they requested him to return to them from the Hall : he did so , and acquainted them with what had passed .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 30]: `` There 's no time to lose , then , '' said McShane ; `` I will , if you please , take a copy of this deposition . ''
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 45]: O'Donahue entered into a brief narrative of the circumstances and the behaviour of our hero ; and , as soon as the copy of the deposition had been attested by the magistrate , he and McShane ordered horses , and set off for London .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 24]: They knocked up Mr Trevor at his private house in the middle of the night , and put the document into his hands .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 65]: `` Well , Major McShane , I would gladly have risen from a sick bed to have had this paper put into my hands ; we must call upon the Secretary of State to-morrow , and I have no doubt but that the poor lad will be speedily released , take possession of his property , and be an honour to the county . ''
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 22]: `` An honour to old England , '' replied McShane ; `` but I shall now wish you good night . ''
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 46]: McShane , before he went to bed , immediately wrote a letter to Mrs Austin , acquainting her with what he had done , and the intentions of Mr Trevor , sending it by express ; he simply stated the facts , without any comments .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 8]: But we must now return to Portsmouth .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 94]: The advertisement of Mr Small did not escape the keen eye of the police-constable who had arrested our hero -- as the reader must recollect the arrest was made so quietly that no one was aware of the circumstance , and as the reward of 100 pounds would be a very handsome addition to the 200 pounds which he had already received -- the man immediately set off for Portsmouth on the outside of the coach , and went to Mr Small , where he found him in the counting-house with Mr Sleek .
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 64]: He soon introduced himself ; and his business with them ; and such was Mr Small 's impatience that he immediately signed a cheque for the amount , and handed it to the police-officer , who then bluntly told him that our hero had been tried for murder , and sentenced to transportation , his real name being Rushbrook , and not O'Donahue .
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 86]: This was a heavy blow to Mr Small : having obtained all the particulars from the police-constable , he dismissed him , and was for some time in consultation with Mr Sleek ; and as it would be impossible long to withhold the facts , it was thought advisable that Mrs Phillips and Emma should become acquainted with them immediately , the more so as Emma had acknowledged that there was a mystery about our hero , a portion of which she was acquainted with .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 19]: Mrs Phillips was the first party to whom the intelligence was communicated , and she was greatly distressed .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 49]: It was some time before she could decide upon whether Emma , in her weak state , should be made acquainted with the melancholy tidings , but as she had suffered so much from suspense , it was at last considered advisable that the communication should be made .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 24]: It was done as cautiously as possible ; Emma was not so shocked as they supposed she would have been at the intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 57]: `` I have been prepared for this , or something like this , '' replied she , weeping in her mother 's arms , `` but I can not believe that he has done the deed ; he told me that he did not , when he was a child ; he has asserted it since .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 13]: Mother , I must -- I will go and see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 7]: `` See him , my child !
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 7]: he is confined in gaol . ''
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 31]: `` Do not refuse me , mother , you know not what I feel -- you know not -- I never knew myself till now how much I loved him .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 8]: See him I must , and will .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 25]: Dearest mother , if you value my life , if you would not drive reason from its seat , do not refuse me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 56]: Mrs Phillips found that it was in vain to argue , and consulted with Mr Small , who at length -LRB- after having in vain remonstrated with Emma -RRB- decided that her request should be granted , and that very day he accompanied his niece , travelling all night , until they arrived at Exeter .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 54]: In the mean time , Mrs Austin had remained in a state of great distress ; her husband lay dead ; she believed that he had confessed his guilt , but to what extent she did not know , for neither she nor Mary had heard what passed between him and the magistrate .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 22]: She had no one but Mary to confide in or to console , no one to advise with or to consult .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 22]: She thought of sending for the magistrate , but it would appear indecorous , and she was all anxiety and doubt .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 24]: The letter from McShane , which arrived the next afternoon , relieved her at once ; she felt that her boy was safe .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 16]: `` Mary , dear , read this ; he is safe , '' exclaimed she .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 13]: `` God of heaven , accept a mother 's grateful tears . ''
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 10]: `` Can not you spare me , madam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 7]: replied Mary , returning the letter .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 4]: `` Spare you .
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 4]: Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 20]: quick , Mary , lose not a moment ; go to him , and take this letter with you .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 7]: My dear , dear child . ''
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 46]: Mary did not wait a second command ; she sent for post-horses , and in half an hour was on her way to Exeter ; travelling with as much speed as Emma and her uncle , she arrived there but a few hours after them .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 24]: Our hero had been anxiously awaiting for Mary 's daily communication ; the post time had passed , and it had not arrived .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 36]: Pale and haggard from long confinement and distress of mind , he was pacing up and down , when the bolts were turned , and Emma , supported by her uncle , entered the cell .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 27]: At the sight of her , our hero uttered a cry , and staggered against the wall ; he appeared to have lost his usual self-control .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 22]: `` Oh , '' said he , `` this might have been spared me ; I have not deserved this punishment .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 5]: Emma , hear me .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 27]: As I hope for future happiness I am innocent ; I am -- I am , indeed -- '' and he fell senseless on the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 29]: Mr Small raised him up and put him on the bed ; after a time he revived , and remained where he had been laid , sobbing convulsively .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 34]: As soon as he became more composed , Emma , who had been sitting by him , the tears coursing each other down her pale cheeks , addressed him in a calm voice .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 21]: `` I feel -- I am sure that you are innocent , or I should not have been here . ''
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 26]: `` Bless you for that , Emma , bless you ; those few words of yours have given me more consolation than you can imagine .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 40]: Is it nothing to be treated as a felon , to be disgraced , to be banished to a distant country , and that at the very time that I was full of happiness , prosperous , and anticipating ?
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 9]: -- but I can not dwell upon that .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 9]: Is it not hard to bear , Emma ?
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 37]: and what could support me , but the consciousness of my own innocence , and the assurance that she whom I love so , and whom I now lose for ever , still believes me so ?
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 22]: Yes , it is a balm ; a consolation ; and I will now submit to the will of Heaven . ''
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 14]: Emma burst into tears , leaning her face on our hero 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 15]: After a time she replied , `` And am I not to be pitied ?
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 34]: Is it nothing to love tenderly , devotedly , madly -- to have given my heart , my whole thoughts , my existence to one object -- why should I conceal it now ?
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 30]: -- to have been dwelling upon visions of futurity so pleasing , so delightful , all passing away as a dream , and leaving a sad reality like this ?
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 31]: Make me one promise ; you will not refuse Emma -- who knelt by your side when you first met her , she who is kneeling before you now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 34]: `` I dare not , Emma , for my heart tells me that you would propose a step which must not be -- you must leave me now , and for ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 4]: `` For ever !
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 4]: for ever ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 7]: cried Emma springing on her feet .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 2]: no !
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 12]: uncle , he says I am to leave him for ever ?
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 5]: Who is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 5]: continued the frantic girl .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 3]: `` Mary !
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 4]: yes 't is !
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 12]: Mary , he says I must leave him for ever ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 13]: -LRB- It was Mary who had just come into the cell . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 7]: `` Must I , Mary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 6]: `` No -- no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 7]: replied Mary , `` not so !
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 17]: he is saved , and his innocence is established ; he is yours for ever ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 15]: We shall not attempt to describe the scene we could not do justice to .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 44]: We must allow the day to pass away ; during which Emma and our hero , McShane and Mary , were sitting together ; tears of misery wiped away -- tears of joy still flowing and glistening with the radiance of intermingled smiles .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 31]: The next morning McShane and O'Donahue arrived , the Secretary of State had given immediate orders for our hero 's release , and they had brought the document with them .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 39]: The following day they were all _ en route _ , Emma and her uncle to Portsmouth , where they anxiously awaited the arrival of our hero as soon as he had performed his duty to his parents .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 48]: We must allow the reader to suppose the joy of Mrs Austin in once more holding her child in her embrace , and the smiles and happiness of Mary at his triumphant acquittal ; the wondering of the domestics , the scandal and rumour of the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 23]: Three days sufficed to make all known , and by that time Joey was looked upon as the hero of a novel .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 15]: On the fourth day he accompanied the remains of his father as chief mourner .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 21]: The funeral was quiet without being mean ; there was no attendance , no carriages of the neighbouring gentry followed .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 57]: Our hero was quite alone and unsupported ; but when the ceremony was over , the want of respect shown to the memory of his father was more than atoned for by the kindness and consideration shown towards the son , who was warmly , yet delicately , welcomed as the future proprietor of the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 23]: Three months passed away , and there was a great crowd before the house of Mr Small , navy agent at Portsmouth .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 20]: There was a large company assembled , the O'Donahues , the McShanes , the Spikemans , and many others .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 39]: Mrs Austin was there , looking ten years younger ; and Mary was attending her at the toilet , both of them half smiles , half tears , for it was the morning of our hero 's wedding-day .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 15]: Mr Small strutted about in white smalls , and Mr Sleek spluttered over everybody .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 33]: The procession went to the church , and soon after the ceremony , one couple of the party set off for the Hall ; where the others went is of no consequence .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 15]: We have now wound up the history of little Joey Rushbrook , the poacher .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 29]: We have only to add , that the character of our hero was not the worse as he grew older , and was the father of a family .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 26]: The Hall was celebrated for hospitality , for the amiability of its possessors , and the art which they possessed of making other people happy .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 56]: Mary remained with them more as a confidante than as a servant ; indeed , she had so much money , that she received several offers of marriage , which she invariably refused , observing , with the true humbleness of a contrite heart , that she was undeserving of any honest , good man .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 21]: Everybody else , even those who knew her history , thought otherwise ; but Mary continued firm in her resolution .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 32]: As for all the rest of the personages introduced into these pages , they passed through life with an average portion of happiness , which is all that can be expected .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 11]: In conclusion , we have only one remark to make .
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 56]: In this story we have shown how a young lad , who commenced his career with poaching , ultimately became a gentleman of 7,000 pounds a year ; but we must remind our youthful readers , that it does not follow that every one who commences with poaching is to have the same good fortune .
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 72]: We advise them , therefore , not to attempt it , as they may find that instead of 7,000 pounds a year , they may stand a chance of going to where our hero very narrowly escaped from being sent ; that is , to a certain portion of her Majesty 's dominions beyond the seas , latterly termed Australia , but more generally known by the appellation of Botany Bay .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 4]: CHAPTER FIFTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 3]: A RENCONTRE .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 4]: A SHORT STORY .
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 35]: One evening I was sitting alone in the _ salle a manger _ of the _ Couronne d'Or _ , at Boulogne , when Colonel G -- , an old acquaintance , came in .
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 51]: After the first greeting , he took a chair , and was soon as busily occupied as I was with a cigar , which was occasionally removed from our lips , as we asked and replied to questions as to what had been our pursuits subsequently to our last rencontre .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 38]: After about half an hour 's chit-chat , he observed , as he lighted a fresh cigar -- `` When I was last in this room , I was in company with a very strange personage . ''
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 6]: `` Male or female ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 11]: inquired I. `` Female , '' replied Colonel G -- .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 33]: `` Altogether it 's a story worth telling , and , as it will pass away the time , I will relate it to you -- unless you wish to retire . ''
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 102]: As I satisfied him that I was not anxious to go to bed , and very anxious to hear his story , he narrated it , as nearly as I can recollect , in the following words : -- `` I had taken my place in the diligence from Paris , and when I arrived at _ Notre Dame des Victoires _ it was all ready for a start ; the luggage , piled up as high as an English haystack , had been covered over and buckled down , and the _ conducteur _ was calling out for the passengers .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 96]: I took my last hasty whiff of my cigar , and unwillingly threw away more than half of a really good Havannah ; for I perceived that in the _ interieur _ , for which I had booked myself , there was one female already seated : and women and cigars are such great luxuries in their respective ways , that they are not to be indulged in at one and the same time -- the world would be too happy , and happiness , we are told , is not for us here below .
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 108]: Not that I agree with that moral , although it comes from very high authority ; there is a great deal of happiness in this world , if you knew how to extract it , -- or , rather , I should say , of pleasure ; there is a pleasure in doing good ; there is a pleasure , unfortunately , in doing wrong ; there is a pleasure in looking forward , ay , and in looking backward also ; there is pleasure in loving and being loved , in eating , and drinking , and , though last , not least , in smoking .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 68]: I do not mean to say that there are not the drawbacks of pain , regret , and even remorse ; but there is a sort of pleasure even in them ; it is pleasant to repent , because you know that you are doing your duty ; and if there is no great pleasure in pain , it precedes an excess when it has left you .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 42]: I say again that , if you know how to extract it , there is a great deal of pleasure and of happiness in this world , especially if you have , as I have , a very bad memory . ''
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 8]: ` _ Allons , messieurs _ ! '
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 35]: said the _ conducteur _ ; and when I got in I found myself the sixth person , and opposite to the lady : for all the other passengers were of my own sex .
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 49]: Having fixed our hats up to the roof , wriggled and twisted a little so as to get rid of coat-tails , etcetera , all of which was effected previously to our having cleared _ Rue Notre Dame des Victoires _ , we began to scrutinise each other .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 40]: Our female companion 's veil was down and doubled so that I could not well make her out ; my other four companions were young men -- all Frenchmen , -- apparently good-tempered , and inclined to be agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 23]: A few seconds were sufficient for my reconnoitre of the gentlemen , and then my eyes were naturally turned towards the lady .
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 66]: She was muffled up in a winter cloak , so that her figure was not to be made out ; and the veil still fell down before her face , so that only one cheek and a portion of her chin could be deciphered : that fragment of her physiognomy was very pretty , and I watched in silence for the removal of the veil .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 49]: `` I have omitted to state that , before I got into the diligence , I saw her take a very tender adieu of a very handsome woman ; but , as her back was turned to me at the time , I did not see her face .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 36]: She had now fallen back in her seat , and seemed disposed to commune with her own thoughts : that did not suit my views , which were to have a view of her face .
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 35]: Real politeness would have induced me to leave her to herself , but pretended politeness was resorted to that I might gratify my curiosity ; so I inquired if she wished the window up .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 29]: The answer was in the negative , and in a very sweet voice ; and then there was a pause , of course so I tried again . ''
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 33]: ` You are melancholy at parting with your handsome sister , ' observed I , leaning forward with as much appearance of interest as I could put into my beautiful phiz . ''
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 13]: ` How could you have presumed that she was my sister ? '
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 4]: replied she . ''
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 21]: ` From the _ strong family _ likeness , ' replied I. ` I felt certain of it . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 18]: ` But she is only my sister-in-law , sir , -- my brother 's wife . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 32]: ` Then , I presume , he chose a wife as like his sister as he could find ; nothing more natural -- I should have done the same . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 29]: ` Sir , you are very polite , ' replied the lady , who lowered down the window , adding , ` I like fresh air . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 17]: ` Perhaps you will find yourself less incommoded if you take off your veil ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 31]: ` I will not ascribe that proposition to curiosity on your part , sir , ' replied the lady , ` as you have already seen my face . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 20]: ` You can not , then , be surprised at my wishing to see it once more . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 9]: ` You are very polite , sir . '
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 24]: `` Although her voice was soft , there was a certain quickness and decision in her manner and language which were very remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 13]: The other passengers now addressed her , and the conversation became general .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 19]: The veiled lady took her share in it , and showed a great deal of smartness and repartee .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 10]: In an hour more we were all very intimate .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 53]: As we changed horses , I took down my hat to put into it my cigar-case , which I had left in my pocket , upon which the lady observed , ` You smoke , I perceive ; and so , I dare say , do all the rest of the gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 23]: Now , do not mind me ; I am fond of the smell of tobacco -- I am used to it . '
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 5]: `` We hesitated . ''
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 18]: ` Nay , more , I smoke myself , and will take a cigar with you . '
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 5]: `` This was decisive .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 11]: I offered my cigar-case -- another gentleman struck a light .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 34]: Lifting up her veil so as to show a very pretty mouth , with teeth as white as snow , she put the cigar in her mouth , and set us the example .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 18]: In a minute both windows were down , every one had a cigar in his mouth . ''
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 11]: ` Where did you learn to smoke , madam ? '
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 17]: was a question put to the incognita by the passenger who sat next to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 3]: ` Where ?
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 9]: -- In the camp -- Africa -- everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 19]: I did belong to the army -- that is , my husband was the captain of the 47th .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 7]: He was killed , poor man !
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 20]: in the last successful expedition to Constantine : -- _ c ` etait un brave homme _ . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 3]: ` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 7]: Were you at Constantine ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 16]: ` Yes , I was ; I followed the army during the whole Campaign . '
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 25]: `` The diligence stopped for supper or dinner , whichever it might be considered , and the _ conducteur _ threw open the doors .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 45]: ` Now , ' thought I , ` we shall see her face ; ' and so , I believe , thought the other passengers ; but we were mistaken ; the lady went upstairs and had a basin of soup taken to her .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 18]: When all was ready we found her in the diligence , with her veil down as before .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 66]: `` This was very provoking , for she was so lively and witty in conversation , and the features of her face which had been disclosed were so perfect , that I was really quite on a fret that she would leave me without satisfying my curiosity : -- they talk of woman 's curiosity , but we men have as much , after all .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 23]: It became dark ; -- the lady evidently avoided further conversation , and we all composed ourselves as well as we could .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 24]: It may be as well to state in few words , that the next morning she was as cautious and reserved as ever .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 30]: The diligence arrived at this hotel -- the passengers separated -- and I found that the lady and I were the only two who took up our quarters there .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 20]: At all events , the Frenchmen who travelled with us went away just as wise as they came . ''
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 6]: ` You remain here ? '
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 15]: inquired I , as soon as we had got out of the diligence . ''
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 7]: ` Yes , ' replied she .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 25]: ` And you -- ' '' ` I remain here , certainly ; but I hope you do not intend to remain always veiled .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 9]: It is too cruel of you . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 29]: ` I must go to my room now , and make myself a little more comfortable ; after that , Monsieur l'Anglais , I will speak to you .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 13]: You are going over in the packet , I presume ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 11]: ` I am , by to-morrow 's packet . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 19]: ` I shall put myself under your protection , for I am also going to London . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 9]: ` I shall be most delighted . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 7]: ` _ Au revoir _ . '
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 30]: `` About an hour afterwards a message was brought to me by the _ garcon _ , that the lady would be happy to receive me at Number 19 .
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 16]: I ascended to the second floor , knocked , and was told to come in .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 24]: `` She was now without a veil ; and what do you think was her reason for the concealment of her person ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 13]: `` By the beard of Mokhanna , how can I tell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 75]: `` Well , then , she had two of the most beautiful eyes in the world ; her eyebrows were finely arched ; her forehead was splendid ; her mouth was tempting , -- in short , she was as pretty as you could wish a woman to be , only she had _ broken her nose _ , -- a thousand pities , for it must once have been a very handsome one .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 11]: Well , to continue , I made my bow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 21]: ` You perceive now , sir , ' said she , ` why I wore my veil down . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 36]: ` No , indeed , ' replied I. '' ` You are very polite , or very blind , ' rejoined she ; ` the _ latter _ I believe not to be the fact .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 29]: I did not choose to submit to the impertinence of my own countrymen in the diligence ; they would have asked me a hundred questions upon my accident .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 19]: But you are an Englishman , and have respect for a female who has been unfortunate . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 29]: ` I trust I deserve your good opinion , madam ; and if I can be in any way useful to you -- ' '' ` You can .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 8]: I shall be a stranger in England .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 22]: I know that in London there is a great man , one Monsieur Lis-tong , who is very clever . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 6]: ` Very true , madam .
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 31]: If your nose instead of having been slightly injured as it is , had been left behind you in Africa , Mr Liston would have found you another . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 15]: ` If he will only repair the old one , I ask no more .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 5]: You give me hopes .
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 14]: But the bones are crushed completely , as you must see . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 7]: ` That is of no consequence .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 13]: Mr Liston has put a new eye in , to my knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 28]: The party was short-sighted , and saw better with the one put in by Mr Liston than with the one which had been left him . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 5]: ` _ Est-il possible ?
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 7]: Mais , quel homme extraordinaire _ !
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 39]: Perhaps you will do me the favour to sit with me , monsieur ; and , if I mistake not , you have a request to make of me -- _ n'est - ce pas _ ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 34]: ` I felt such interest about you , madam , that I acknowledge , if it would not be too painful to you , I should like to ask a question . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 11]: ` Which is , How did I break my nose ?
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 7]: Of course you want to know .
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 25]: And as it is the only return I can make for past or future obligations to you , you shall most certainly be gratified .
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 7]: I will not detain you now .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 7]: I shall expect you to supper .
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 5]: Adieu , monsieur . '
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 42]: `` I did not , of course , fail in my appointment ; and after supper she commenced : -- '' ` The question to be answered , ' said she , ` is , How did you break your nose ?
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 5]: -- is it not ?
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 15]: Well then , at least , I shall answer it after my own fashion .
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 16]: So , to begin at the beginning , I am now exactly twenty-two years old .
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 9]: My father was tambour-majeur in the Garde Imperiale .
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 33]: I was born in the camp -- brought up in the camp -- and , finally , I was married in the camp , to a lieutenant of infantry at the time .
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 13]: So that , you observe , I am altogether _ militaire _ .
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 66]: As a child , I was wakened up with the drum and fife , and went to sleep with the bugles ; as a girl , I became quite conversant with every military manoeuvre ; and now that I am a woman grown , I believe that I am more fit for the _ baton _ than one-half of those marshals who have gained it .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 26]: I have studied little else but tactics and have as my poor husband said , quite a genius for them ; but of that hereafter .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 14]: I was married at sixteen , and have ever since followed my husband .
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 9]: I followed him at last to his grave .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 16]: He quitted my bed for the bed of honour , where he sleeps in peace .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 8]: We 'll drink to his memory . '
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 31]: `` We emptied our glasses , when she continued : -- '' ` My husband 's regiment was not ordered to Africa until after the first disastrous attempt upon Constantine .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 37]: It fell to our lot to assist in retrieving the honour of our army in the more successful expedition which took place , as you , of course , are aware , about three months ago .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 11]: I will not detain you with our embarkation or voyage .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 33]: We landed from a steamer at Bona , and soon afterwards my husband 's company was ordered to escort a convoy of provisions to the army which was collecting at Mzez Ammar .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 19]: Well , we arrived safely at our various camps of Drean , Nech Meya , and Amman Berda .
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 11]: We made a little _ detour _ to visit Ghelma .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 15]: I had curiosity to see it , as formerly it was an important city .
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 13]: I must say , that a more tenable position I never beheld .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 10]: But I tire you with these details . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 11]: ` On the contrary , I am delighted . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 6]: ` You are very good .
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 20]: I ought to have said something about the travelling in those wild countries , which is anything but pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 29]: The soil is a species of clay , hard as a flint when the weather is dry , but running into a slippery paste as soon as moistened .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 33]: It is , therefore , very fatiguing , especially in wet weather , when the soldiers slip about in a very laughable manner to look at , but very distressing to themselves .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 16]: I travelled either on horseback or in one of the waggons , as it happened .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 28]: I was too well known , and , I hope I may add , too well liked , not to be as well provided for as possible .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 19]: It is remarkable how soon a Frenchman will make himself comfortable , wherever he may chance to be .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 22]: The camp of Mzez Ammar was as busy and as lively as if it was pitched in the heart of France .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 41]: The followers had built up little cabins out of the branches of trees , with their leaves on , interwoven together , all in straight lines , forming streets , very commodious , and perfectly impervious to the withering sun .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 65]: There were _ restaurants , cafes , debis de vin et d'eau-de-vie _ , sausage-sellers , butchers , grocers -- in fact , there was every trade almost , and everything you required ; not very cheap certainly , but you must recollect , that this little town had sprung up , as if by magic , in the heart of the desert . ''
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 42]: ` It was in the month of September that Damremont ordered a _ reconnoissance _ in the direction of Constantine , and a battalion of my husband 's regiment , the 47th , was ordered to form a part of it .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 8]: I have said nothing about my husband .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 20]: He was a good little man , and a brave officer , full of honour , but very obstinate .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 29]: He never would take advice , and it was nothing but '' _ Tais-toi , Coralie _ , '' all day long -- but no one is perfect .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 21]: He wished me to remain in the camp , but I made it a rule never to be left behind .
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 25]: We set off ; and I rode in one of the little carriages called _ cacolets _ which had been provided for the wounded .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 33]: It was terrible travelling , I was jolted to atoms , in the ascent of the steep mountain called the Rass-el-akba ; but we gained the summit without a shot being fired .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 17]: When we arrived there , and looked down beneath us , the sight was very picturesque .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 58]: There were about four or five thousand of the Arab cavalry awaiting our descent ; their white bournous , as they term the long dresses in which they enfold themselves , waving in the wind as they galloped at speed in every direction ; while the glitter of their steel arms flashed like lightning upon our eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 88]: We closed our ranks and descended ; the Arabs , in parties of forty or fifty , charging upon our flanks every minute , not coming to close conflict , but stopping at pistol-shot distance , discharging their guns , and then wheeling off again to a distance -- mere child 's play , sir ; nevertheless , there were some of our men wounded , and the little waggon , upon which I was riding , was ordered up in the advance to take them in .
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 48]: Unfortunately , to keep clear of the troops , the driver kept too much on one side of the narrow defile through which we passed : the consequence was , that the waggon upset , and I was thrown out a considerable distance down the precipice . '
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 21]: ` And broke your nose , ' interrupted I. '' ` No , indeed , sir , I did not .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 31]: I escaped with only a few contusions about the region of the hip , which certainly lamed me for some time , and made the jolting more disagreeable than ever .
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 8]: Well , the _ reconnoissance _ succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 8]: Damremont was , however , wrong altogether .
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 42]: I told him so when I met him ; but he was an obstinate old fool , and his answer was not as polite as it might have been , considering that at that time I was a very pretty woman .
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 48]: We returned to the camp at Mzez Ammar ; a few days afterwards we were attacked by the Arabs , who showed great spirit and determination in their desultory mode of warfare , which , however , can make no impression on such troops as the French .
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 18]: The attack was continued for three days , when they decamped as suddenly as they had come .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 14]: But this can not be very interesting to you , monsieur . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 21]: ` On the contrary , do not , I beg , leave out a single remark or incident . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 6]: ` You are very good .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 17]: I presume you know how we _ militaires _ like to fight our battles over again .
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 31]: Well , sir , we remained in camp until the arrival of the Duc de Nemours , -- a handsome , fair lad , who smiled upon me very graciously .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 34]: On the 1st of October we set off on our expedition to Constantine ; that is to say , the advanced guard did , of which my husband 's company formed a portion .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 20]: The weather , which had been very fine , now changed , and it rained hard all the day .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 19]: The whole road was one mass of mud , and there was no end to delays and accidents .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 36]: However , the weather became fine again , and on the 5th we arrived within two leagues of Constantine , when the Arabs attacked us , and I was very nearly taken prisoner . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 5]: ` Indeed ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 49]: ` Yes ; my husband , who , as I before observed to you , was very obstinate , would have me ride on a _ caisson _ in the rear ; whereas I wished to be in the advance , where my advice might have been useful .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 58]: The charge of the Arabs was very sudden ; the three men who were with the _ caisson _ were sabred , and I was in the arms of a chieftain , who was wheeling round his horse to make off with me when a ball took him in the neck , and he fell with me .
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 31]: I disengaged myself , seized the horse by the bridle , and prevented its escape ; and I also took possession of the Arab 's pistols and scymitar . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 5]: ` Indeed ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 27]: ` My husband sold the horse the next day to one of our generals , who forgot to pay for it after my husband was killed .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 21]: As for the scymitar and pistols , they were stolen from me that night : but what can you expect ?
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 11]: -- our army is brave , but a little demoralised .
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 19]: The next day we arrived before Constantine , and we had to defile before the enemy 's guns .
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 44]: At one portion of the road , men and horses were tumbled over by their fire ; the _ caisson _ that I was riding upon was upset by a ball , and thrown down the ravine , dragging the horses after it .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 48]: I lay among the horses ' legs -- they kicking furiously ; it was a miracle that my life was preserved : as it was -- ' '' ` You broke your nose , ' interrupted I. '' ` No , sir , indeed I did not .
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 22]: I only received a kick on the arm , which obliged me to carry it in a sling for some days .
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 25]: The weather became very bad ; we had few tents , and they were not able to resist the storms of rain and wind .
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 71]: We wrapped ourselves up how we could , and sat in deep pools of water , and the Arabs attacked us before we could open the fire of our batteries ; we were in such a pickle that , had the bad weather lasted , we must have retreated ; and happy would those have been who could have once more found themselves safe in the camp of Mzez Ammar .
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 56]: I do n't think that I ever suffered so much as I did at that time -- the weather had even overcome the natural gallantry of our nation ; and so far from receiving any attention , the general remark to me was , `` What the devil do _ you _ do here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 10]: This to be said to a pretty woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 19]: ` It was not till the 10th that we could manage to open the fire of our batteries .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 60]: It was mud , mud , and mud again ; the men and horses were covered with mud up to their necks -- the feathers of the staff were covered with mud -- every ball which was fired by the enemy sent up showers of mud ; even the face of the Duc de Nemours was disfigured with it .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 17]: I must say that our batteries were well situated , all except the great mortar battery .
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 17]: This I pointed out to Damremont when he passed me , and he was very savage .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 27]: Great men do n't like to be told of their faults ; however , he lost his life three days afterwards from not taking my advice .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 39]: He was going down the hill with Rhullieres when I said to him , `` Mon General , you expose yourself too much ; that which is duty in a subaltern is a fault in a general . ''
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 35]: He very politely told me to go to where he may chance to be himself now ; for a cannonball struck him a few seconds afterwards , and he was killed on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 11]: General Perregaux was severely wounded almost at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 35]: For four days the fighting was awful ; battery answered to battery night and day : while from every quarter of the compass we were exposed to the fierce attacks of the Arab cavalry .
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 29]: The commander of our army sent a flag of truce to their town , commanding them to surrender : and , what do you think was the reply ?
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 45]: -- `` If you want powder , we 'll supply you ; if you are without bread , we will send it to you : but as long as there is one good Mussulman left alive , you do not enter the town . ''
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 6]: -- Was not that grand ?
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 39]: The very reply , when made known to the troops , filled them with admiration of their enemy , and they swore by their colours that if ever they overpowered them they would give them no quarter . ''
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 40]: ` In two days , General Vallee , to whom the command fell upon the death of Damremont , considered the breach sufficiently wide for the assault , and we every hour expected that the order would be given .
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 5]: It came at last .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 11]: My poor husband was in the second column which mounted .
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 25]: Strange to say , he was very melancholy on that morning , and appeared to have a presentiment of what was to take place .
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 32]: `` Coralie , '' said he to me , as he was scraping the mud off his trousers with his pocket-knife , `` if I fall , you will do well .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 15]: I leave you as a legacy to General Vallee -- he will appreciate you .
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 13]: Do not forget to let him know my testamentary dispositions . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 7]: ` I promised I would not .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 4]: The drums beat .
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 7]: He kissed me on both cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 16]: `` Go , my Philippe , '' said I ; `` go to glory . ''
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 19]: He did ; for a mine was sprung , and he with many others was blown to atoms .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 31]: I had watched the advance of the column and was able to distinguish the form of my dear Philippe when the explosion with the vast column of smoke took place .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 24]: When it cleared away , I could see the wounded in every direction hastening back ; but my husband was not among them .
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 21]: In the mean time the other columns entered the breach -- the firing was awful , and the carnage dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 22]: It was more than an hour after the assault commenced before the French tricolor waved upon the minarets of Constantine . ''
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 29]: ` It was not until the next day that I could make up my mind to search for my husband 's body ; but it was my duty .
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 30]: I climbed up the breach , strewed with the corpses of our brave soldiers , intermingled with those of the Arabs ; but I could not find my husband .
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 13]: At last a head which had been blown off attracted my attention .
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 38]: I examined it -- it was my Philippe 's , blackened and burnt , and terribly disfigured : but who can disguise the fragment of a husband from the keen eyes of the wife of his bosom ?
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 5]: I leaned over it .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 6]: `` My poor Philippe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 28]: exclaimed I : and the tears were bedewing my cheeks when I perceived the Duc de Nemours close to me , with all his staff attending him .
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 7]: `` What have we here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 10]: said he with surprise , to those about him .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 31]: `` A wife , looking for her husband 's body , mon prince , '' replied I. `` I can not find it ; but here is his head . ''
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 13]: He said something very complimentary and kind , and then walked on .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 18]: I continued my search without success , and determined to take up my quarters in the town .
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 31]: As I clambered along , I gained a battered wall ; and , putting my foot on it it gave way with me , and I fell down several feet .
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 32]: Stunned with the blow , I remained for some time insensible ; when I came to , I found -- ' '' ` That you had broken your nose . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 25]: ` No , indeed ; I had sprained my ankle and hurt the cap of my knee , but my nose was quite perfect .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 9]: You must have a little patience yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 48]: ` What fragments of my husband were found , were buried in a large grave , which held the bodies and the mutilated portions of the killed : and having obtained possession of an apartment in Constantine , I remained there several days , lamenting his fate .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 33]: At last , it occurred to me that his testamentary dispositions should be attended to , and I wrote to General Vallee , informing him of the last wishes of my husband .
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 30]: His reply was very short ; it was , that he was excessively flattered , -- but press of business would not permit him to administer to the will .
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 6]: It was not polite . ''
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 14]: ` On the 26th I quitted Constantine with a convoy of wounded men .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 22]: The dysentery and the cholera made fearful ravages , and I very soon had a _ caisson _ all to myself .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 16]: The rain again came on in torrents , and it was a dreadful funeral procession .
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 27]: Every minute wretches , jolted to death , were thrown down into pits by the road-side , and the cries of those who survived were dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 32]: Many died of cold and hunger ; and after three days we arrived at the camp of Mzez Ammar , with the loss of more than one-half of our sufferers . ''
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 33]: ` I took possession of one of the huts built of the boughs of the trees which I formerly described , and had leisure to think over my future plans and prospects .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 13]: I was young and pretty , and hope did not desert me .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 24]: I had recovered my baggage , which I had left at the camp , and was now able to attend to my toilet .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 46]: The young officers who were in the camp paid me great attention , and were constantly passing and repassing to have a peep at the handsome widow , as they were pleased to call me : and now comes the history of my misfortune . ''
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 41]: ` The cabin built of boughs which I occupied was double ; one portion was fenced off from the other with a wattling of branches , which ran up about seven feet , but not so high as the roof .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 28]: In one apartment I was located , the other was occupied by a young officer who paid me attention , but who was not to my liking .
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 25]: I had been walking out in the cool of the evening , and had returned , when I heard voices in the other apartment .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 28]: I entered softly and they did not perceive my approach ; they were talking about me , and I must say that the expressions were very complimentary .

Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 18]: I hope to be a general by-and-bye , and she would not disgrace a marshal 's baton .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 15]: I think I shall propose to her before we leave the camp . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 39]: ` Now , sir , I did not recognise the speaker by his voice , and , flattered by the remark , I was anxious to know who it could be who was thus prepossessed in my favour .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 35]: I thought that if I could climb up on the back of the only chair which was in my apartment , I should be able to see over the partition and satisfy my curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 45]: I did so , and without noise ; and I was just putting my head over to take a survey of the tenants of the other apartment when the chair tilted , and down I came on the floor , and on my face .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 44]: Unfortunately , I hit my nose upon the edge of the frying-pan , with which my poor Philippe and I used to cook our meat ; and now , sir , you know how it was that I broke my nose . ' ''

Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 66]: I had gone through the whole campaign without any serious accident , and -- But , after all , it was very natural : the two besetting evils of women are Vanity and Curiosity , and if you were to ascertain the truth , you would find that it is upon these two stumbling-blocks that most women are upset and break their noses . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 30]: ` Very true , madam , ' replied I. ` I thank you for your narrative , and shall be most happy to be of any use to you .
