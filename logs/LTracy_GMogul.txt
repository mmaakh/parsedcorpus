Parsing [sent. 1 len. 17]: THE GREAT MOGUL by LOUIS TRACY CHAPTER I `` And is there care in Heaven ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 6]: _ Spenser 's Faerie Queene .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 7]: _ `` Allah remembers us not .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 6]: It is the divine decree .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 23]: We can but die with His praises on our lips ; perchance He may greet us at the gates of Paradise ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 10]: Overwhelmed with misery , the man drooped his head .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 10]: The stout staff he held fell to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 27]: He lifted his hands to hide the anguish of eye and lip , and the grief that mastered him caused long pent-up tears to well forth .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 30]: His resigned words , uttered in the poetic tongue of Khorassan , might have been a polished verse of Sa'adi were they not the outpouring of a despairing heart .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 15]: The woman raised her burning eyes from the infant clinging to her exhausted breast .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 24]: `` Father of my loved ones , '' she said , `` let you and the two boys travel on with the cow .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 12]: If you reach succor , return for me and my daughter .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 17]: If not , it is the will of God , and who can gainsay it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 9]: The man stooped to pick up his staff .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 30]: But his great powers of endurance , suddenly enfeebled by the ordeal thrust upon him , yielded utterly , and he sank helpless by the side of his wife .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 20]: `` Nay , Mihr-ul-nisa , sun among women , I shall not leave thee , '' he cried passionately .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 12]: `` We are fated to die ; then be it so .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 20]: I swear by the Prophet naught save death shall part us , and that not for many hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 27]: So , to the mother , uselessly nursing her latest born , was left the woful task of pronouncing the doom of those she held dear .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 8]: For a little while there was silence .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 33]: The pitiless sun , rising over distant hills of purple and amber , gave promise that this day of late July would witness no relief of tortured earth by the long-deferred monsoon .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 5]: All nature was still .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 9]: The air had the hush of the grave .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 9]: The greenery of trees and shrubs was blighted .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 24]: The bare plain , the rocks , the boulder-strewed bed of the parched river , each alike wore the dust-white shroud of death .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 14]: Far-off mountains shimmered in glorious tints which promised fertile glades and sparkling rivulets .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 17]: But the promise was a lie , the lie of the mirage , of unfulfilled hope .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 33]: These two , with their offspring , had journeyed from the glistening slopes on the northwest , now smiling with the colors of the rainbow under the first kiss of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 20]: They knew that the arid ravines and bleak passes behind were even less hospitable than the lowlands in front .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 12]: Knowledge of what was past had murdered hope for the future .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 7]: They had almost ceased to struggle .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 12]: True children of the East , they were yielding to Kismet .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 20]: Already a watchful vulture , skilled ghoul of desert obsequies , was describing great circles in the molten sky .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 12]: The evils of the way were typical of their by-gone lives .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 12]: Beginning in pleasant places , they were driven into the wilderness .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 36]: The Persian and his wife , Usbeg Tartars of Teherán , nobly born and nurtured , were now poverty-stricken and persecuted because one of the warring divisions of Islam had risen to power in Ispahán .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 39]: `` It shall come to pass , '' said Mahomet , `` that my people shall be divided into three-and-seventy sects , all of which , save only one , shall have their portion in the fire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 17]: Clearly , these wanderers found solace in the beliefs held by some of the condemned seventy-two .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 95]: Striving to escape from a land of narrow-minded bigots to the realm of the Great Mogul , the King of Kings , the renowned Emperor of India -- whom his contemporaries , fascinated by his gifts and dazzled by his magnificence , had styled Akbar `` the Great '' -- the forlorn couple , young in years , endowed with remarkable physical charms and high intelligence , blessed with two fine boys and the shapely infant now hugged by the frantic mother , had been betrayed not alone by man but by nature herself .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 20]: At this season , the great plain between Herát and Kandahár should be all-sufficing to the needs of travelers .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 23]: Watered by a noble river , the Helmund , and traversed by innumerable streams , it was reputed the Garden of Afghanistán .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 41]: Pent in the bosom of earth , all manner of herbs and fruits and wholesome seeds were ready to burst forth with utmost prodigality when the rain-clouds gathered on the hills and discharged their gracious showers over a soil athirst .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 30]: But Allah , in His exceeding wisdom , had seen fit to withhold the fertilizing monsoon , and the few resources of the exiles had yielded to the strain .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 17]: First their small flock of goats , then their camel , had fallen or been slain .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 18]: There was left the cow , whose daily store of milk dwindled under the lack of food .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 53]: The patient animal , lean as the kine of the seven years of famine in Joseph 's dream , was yet fit to walk and carry the two boys , whose sturdy limbs had shrunk and weakened until they could no longer be trusted to toddle alone even on the level ground .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 27]: She stood now , regarding her companions in suffering with her big violet eyes and almost contentedly chewing some wizened herbage gathered by the man overnight .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 27]: Strange to say , it was on the capabilities of the cow that rested the final issue of life and death for one if not all .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 17]: The cow had carried and sustained the woman before and after the birth of the child .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 17]: Last and most valued of their possessions , she had become the arbiter of their fate .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 34]: The Persian , Mirza Ali Beg was his name , was assured that if they could march a few more days they would reach the cultivated region dominated by the city of Kandahár .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 23]: There , even in this period of want , the boundless charity of the East would save them from death by starvation .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 8]: But the infant was exhausting her mother .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 29]: She demanded the whole meager supply of the life-giving milk of the cow , and in Mirza Ali Beg 's tortured soul the husband wrought with the father .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 12]: That four might have a chance of living one should die !
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 12]: Such was the dreadful edict he put forth tremblingly at last .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 29]: And now , when the woman saw the strong man in a palsy at her feet , her love for him vanquished even the all-powerful instinct of maternity .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 19]: She fiercely thrust the child into his arms and murmured : -- `` I yield , my husband .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 16]: Take her , in God 's name , and do with her as seemeth best .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 17]: Not for myself , but for thee and for our sons , do I consent . ''
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 17]: Thinking himself stronger and sterner than he was , Mirza Ali Beg rose to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 23]: But his heart was as lead and his hands shook as he fondled the warm and almost plump body of the infant .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 7]: Here was a man indeed distraught .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 15]: Between husband and wife , who shall say which had the more grievous burden ?
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 39]: With a frenzied prayer to the Almighty for help , he wrapped a linen cloth over the infant 's face , placed the struggling little form among the roots of a tall tree , and left it there .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 61]: Bidding the two boys , dark-eyed youngsters aged three and five , to cling tightly to the pillion on the cow 's back , he took the halter and the staff in his right hand , passed his left arm around the emaciated frame of his wife , and , in this wise , the small cavalcade resumed its journey .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 13]: Ever and anon the plaint of the abandoned infant reached their ears .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 12]: The two children , without special reason , began to cry .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 13]: The mother , always turning her head , wept with increasing violence .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 14]: Even the poor cow , wanting food and water , lowed her distress .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 17]: The man , striving to compress his tremulous lips , strode forward , staring into vacancy .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 6]: He dared not look behind .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 24]: He knew that the feeble cries of the baby girl would ring in his ears until they were closed to all mortal sounds .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 30]: He took no note of the rough caravan track they followed , marked as it was by the ashes of camp fires and the whitened bones of pack animals .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 23]: With all the force of a masterful nature he tried to stagger on , and on , until the tragedy was irrevocable .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 45]: But the woman , when they reached a point where the road curved round a huge rock , realized that the next onward step would shut out forever from her eyes the sight of that tiny bundle lying in the roots of the tree .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 34]: So she choked back her sobs , swept away her tears , gave one last look at her infant , gasped a word of fond endearment , and fell fainting in the dust .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 18]: Amidst the many troubles and anxieties of that four months ' pilgrimage she had never fainted before .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 36]: Though she was a Persian lady of utmost refinement and great accomplishments , she came of a hardy race , and her final collapse imbued her husband with a stoicism hitherto lacking in his despair .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 13]: `` This , then , is the end , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 5]: `` Be it so .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 9]: I can strive against destiny no further . ''
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 22]: Tenderly he lifted his wife to a place where sand offered a softer couch than the rocks on which she lay .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 12]: `` I must bring the infant , '' he muttered aloud .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 10]: `` The touch of its hands will revive her .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 27]: Then I shall kill poor Deri -LRB- the cow -RRB- , and we can feast on her in the hope that some may pass this way .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 12]: Walk , with three to carry , we can not . ''
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 8]: This was indeed the counsel of desperation .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 14]: The cow , living , provided their sole link with the outer world .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 9]: Dead , she maintained them a little while .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 17]: Soon the scanty meat she would yield would become uneatable and they were lost beyond saving .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 17]: Nevertheless , once the resolve was taken a load was lifted from the man 's breast .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 19]: Bidding the elder boy hold Deri 's halter , he strode back towards the infant with eager haste .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 22]: As he drew near he thought he saw something black and glistening amidst the soiled linen which enwrapped the little one .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 7]: After another stride he stood still .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 6]: A fresh tribulation awaited him .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 30]: Many times girdling the child 's limbs and body was a hideous snake , a monster whose powerful coils could break the tiny bones as if they were straws .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 12]: The flat and ugly head was raised to look at him .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 36]: The beady black eyes seemed to emit sparks of venemous fire , and the forked tongue was darting in and out of the fanged mouth as though the reptile was anticipating the feast in store .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 15]: Mirza Ali Beg was no coward , but this new frenzy almost overcame him .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 23]: There was a chance , a slight one , that the serpent had not yet crushed the life out of its prey .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 18]: Using words which were no prayer , the father uplifted the tough staff which he still carried .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 4]: He rushed forward .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 25]: The snake elevated its head to take stock of this unexpected enemy , but the stick dealt it a furious blow on the tail .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 32]: Instantly uncoiling itself , either to fight or escape , as seemed most expedient , it received another blow which hurled it , with dislocated vertebræ , far into the dust .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 31]: The man , with a great cry of joy , saw that the child was stretching her limbs , now that the tight clutch of its terrible assailant was withdrawn .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 20]: He caught her up into his arms and , weak as he was , ran back to his wife .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 19]: `` Here is one who will restore the blood to thy cheeks , Mihr-ul-nisa , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 20]: And truly the mother stirred again with the first satisfied chuckle of the infant as it sought her breast .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 23]: The husband , heedless what befell for the hour , obtained from the cow such slight store of milk as she possessed .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 62]: He gave some to the two boys , the greater portion to the baby , and was refuting his wife 's remonstrance that he had taken none himself as he pressed the remainder on her , when the noise of a commotion at a distance caused them to look in wonderment along the road they had recently traversed in such sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 45]: There , gathered around some object , were a number of men , some mounted on Arab horses or riding camels , others on foot ; behind this nearer group they could distinguish a long _ kafila _ of loaded beasts with armed attendants .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 6]: `` God be praised ! ''
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 9]: cried Mihr-ul-nisa , `` we are saved ! ''
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 22]: This was the caravan of a rich merchant , faring from Persia or Bokhara to the court of the Great Mogul .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 41]: The undulating plain , no less than their own anguish of mind , had prevented the Persian and his wife from noting the glittering spear points of the warrior merchant 's retainers as they rode forward in the morning sun .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 24]: Surely such a host would spare a little food and water for the starving family , and forage for Deri , the cow !
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 9]: `` But what are they looking at ? ''
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 13]: cried the woman , of whom hope had made a fresh being .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 8]: `` They have found the snake . ''
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 5]: `` What snake ? ''
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 5]: `` It is matterless .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 23]: As I returned for the child , when you fell in a swoon , I met a snake and killed it . ''
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 9]: A startled look came into her eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 6]: _ Khodah hai _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 15]: -LSB- A -RSB- she murmured ; `` it would have attacked my baby ! ''
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 13]: -LSB- Footnote A : `` There is indeed a God ! '' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 14]: Two men , mounted on Turkoman horses , were now spurring towards them .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 11]: Mirza Ali Beg advanced a few paces to meet them .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 45]: One , an elderly man of grave appearance and richly attired , reined in his horse at a little distance and cried to his companion : -- `` By the tomb of Mahomet , Sher Khan , 't is he of my dream ! ''
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 37]: The other , a handsome and soldierly youth , came nearer and questioned Ali Beg , mostly concerning the disabled and dying snake , found and beaten into pulp by the foremost men of the caravan .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 24]: The Mirza told his tale with dignified eloquence ; he ended with a pathetic request for help for his exhausted wife and family .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 76]: This was forthcoming quickly , and , while he himself was refreshed with good milk , and dates , and cakes of pounded wheat , Malik Masúd , the elder of the two horsemen and leader of the train , told how he dreamt the previous night that during a wayside halt under a big tree he was attacked by a poisonous snake , which was vanquishing him until a stranger came to his aid .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 41]: The snake lying in the path of the _ kafila _ was the exact counterpart of that seen in his disturbing vision , but his amazement was complete when he recognized in Ali Beg the stranger who had saved him .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 54]: So , in due course , Mihr-ul-nisa , with her baby girl , was mounted on a camel , and her husband and two sons on another , and Deri , the cow , before joining the train , was regaled with a copious draught of water and an ample measure of grain .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 23]: Thus it came to pass that Mirza Ali Beg and his family were convoyed through Kandahár and Kábul in comfort and safety .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 34]: They rode through the gaunt jaws of the Khaibar Pass , and emerged , after many days , into the great plain of the Punjáb , verdant with an abundant though deferred harvest .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 46]: And no one imagined , least of all the baby girl herself , that the infant crowing happily in the arms of Mihr-ul-nisa was destined to become a beautiful , gracious and world-renowned princess , whose name and love-story should endure through many a century .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 39]: * * * * * In that same month of July , 1588 , on the nineteenth day of the month , to be exact , the blazoned sails of the Spanish Armada were sighted off the Lizard .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 23]: Sixty-five great war galleons , eight fleet galleasses , fifty-six armed merchantmen and twenty pinnaces swept along the Channel in gallant show .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 25]: Spread out in a gigantic crescent , the Spanish ships were likened by anxious watchers to a great bird of prey with outstretched wings .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 22]: But Lord Howard of Effingham led out of Plymouth a band of adventurers who had hunted that bird many a time .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 18]: Drake , Hawkins , Frobisher and the rest -- they feared no Spaniard who sailed the seas .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 27]: Their little vessels , well handled , could sail two miles to the Spaniards ' one , and fire twice as many shots gun for gun .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 18]: `` One by one , '' said they , `` we plucked the Don 's feathers . ''
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 13]: Ship after ship was sunk , captured , or driven on shore .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 57]: A whole week the cannon roared from Plymouth Sound to Calais , and there the last great fight took place in which the Duke of Medina Sidonia yielded himself to agonized foreboding , and Drake rightly believed that the Spanish grandee `` would ere long wish himself at St. Mary Port among his orange trees . ''
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 45]: During one of the many fierce duels between the ponderous galleons and the hawk-like British ships , the _ Resolution _ , hastily manned at Deal by volunteers who rode from London , hung on to and finally captured the _ San José _ .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 25]: It was no easy victory , for the Spaniards could acquit themselves as men when seamanship and gunnery gave place to swords and pikes .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 23]: Three times did the assailants swarm up the lofty poop of the _ San José _ before they made good their footing .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 44]: At last , the Spaniards gave way before the ardent onslaught led by a gallant gentleman from Wensleydale in the North , Sir Robert Mowbray , to wit , who , had he lived , was marked out for certain preferment at court .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 52]: Unhappily , in the moment of victory , a young , pale-faced monk , an ascetic and visionary , maddened by the success of his country 's hereditary foe , sprang from the nook in which he lurked and struck Mowbray a heavy blow with the large brass crucifix he carried .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 25]: The Englishman had doffed his hat and was courteously saluting the Spanish captain , who was in the act of yielding up his sword .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 23]: One outstretched arm of the image of mercy penetrated his skull , and he fell dead at the feet of his captive .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 8]: At once the conflict broke out anew .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 21]: Nothing could restrain the crew of the _ Resolution _ when they noted the dastardly murder of their chivalrous leader .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 6]: The galleon became a slaughter-house .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 30]: The monk , frenzied as a beast in the shambles , sprang overboard and was carried past another ship , the _ Vera Cruz _ , which rescued him .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 18]: This vessel was one of the few storm-wracked and fever-laden survivors of the Armada which reached Corunna .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 23]: The Englishmen learnt from wounded Spaniards that the fanatical ecclesiastic was a certain Fra Geronimo from the great Jesuit seminary at Toledo .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 11]: They remembered the name so that they might curse it .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 12]: They cried in their rage because Fra Geronimo had escaped them .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 48]: A black snake in the plain of Herát , a glittering crucifix on board the _ San José _ in the Channel off Gravelines -- these were queer links , savoring of necromancy , whereby the lives of gallant men and fair women should be bound indissolubly .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 46]: Yet it was so , as those who follow this strange and true history shall learn , for many a blow was struck and many a heart ached because Nur Mahal lived and Sir Robert Mowbray died in that wonderful month of July , 1588 .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 21]: CHAPTER II `` Up then rose the ` prentices all , Living in London , both proper and tall . ''
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 4]: _ Old Song .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 52]: _ Sir Thomas Cave , of Stanford in Northamptonshire , a worthy Knight who held his wisdom of greater repute at court than did his royal Master , was led by the glamour of a fine summer 's afternoon in the year 1608 to fulfil a long-deferred promise to his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 29]: At Spring Gardens , removed but a short space from the King 's Palace of Whitehall , that eccentric monarch , James I. , had established a menagerie .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 71]: Here could be seen certain mangy specimens of the wonderful beasts which bulked large in the lore of the period , and Mistress Anna Cave , with her fair cousin , Mistress Eleanor Roe , had teased Sir Thomas until he consented to take them thither on the first occasion , of fair seeming as to the weather , when the King would be pleased to dispense with his attendance .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 48]: The girls , than whom there were not two prettier maidens in all England , soon tired of evil-smelling and snarling animals , which in no wise came up to the wonderful creatures of their imagination , eked out by weird wood-cuts in the books they read .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 45]: They found the charming garden , with its beds of flowers and strawberries , its hedges of red and black currants , roses and gooseberries , and its golden plum-trees lining the brick walls facing west and south , far more to their liking .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 39]: Nor was it wholly unsuited to their age and condition that their eyes wandered from the cages of furtive wolves and uneasy bears to the smooth walks tenanted by a coterie of court ladies with their attendant gallants .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 54]: Anna Cave , eighteen , yet looking older by reason of her tall stature and graceful carriage , Eleanor Roe , a year younger , a sweet girl , at once timid in manner and joyous in disposition , found much to cavil at in the Spanish fashions then prevalent in high circles .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 31]: Born and bred in decorous and God-fearing households , they were not a little shocked by the way in which the great dames of the period dressed and comported themselves .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 43]: Yet , with all their youthful disapproval there mingled a spice of curiosity , and Nellie , the shy one , often nudged her more sedate companion to take note of a specially ornate farthingale or a Spanish mantilla of exquisite design .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 27]: Now , despite the reverence in which the stout Sir Thomas held the King , he did not approve of some of the King 's associates .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 33]: Especially was he unwilling that the bold eyes of any of the young adventurers and profligates who clustered under the banner of Rochester should survey the charms of his daughter and niece .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 33]: Therefore , when the girls would have him walk with them in the wake of Lady Essex , then at the height of her notorious fame , he peremptorily vetoed their design .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 22]: `` If you are aweary of the kennels , '' he said , `` we will stroll in our own garden .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 24]: It is fair as this , and the scent of the flowers therein is not aped by the cosmetics of the women . ''
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 43]: `` Nay , but , uncle , '' pouted Eleanor , disappointed that the style of the much talked-of Countess should be no more than glimpsed in passing , `` we have seen neither lion , nor tiger , nor humpbacked camel .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 25]: Surely the King 's collection is not so meager that one may find as many wild beasts at any May-day fair in Islington ? ''
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 12]: `` Lions , tigers , and the rest , Got wot !
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 14]: What doth a girl like thee want with such fearsome cattle ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 66]: 'T is only a few days since I heard one declaiming a passage in Master Shakespeare 's play of ` Macbeth , ' and he said : What men dare , I dare : Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear , The arm 'd rhinoceros , or the Hyrcan tiger ; Take any shape but that , and my firm nerves Shall never tremble .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 30]: Now , save a very harmless-looking bear , neither Ann nor I have seen these things , so we know not why they should be held so terrible . ''
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 15]: During this recital the knight 's red face became wider and wider with surprise .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 7]: `` Marry , Heaven forfend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 13]: he cried , `` what goings on there be behind my back !
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 13]: Anna , can you , too , spout verse as glibly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 14]: `` Indeed , father , Nellie and I know whole plays by heart .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 17]: Yet we would not indulge in this innocent pastime if we thought it angered you . ''
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 11]: Sir Thomas was as wax in his daughter 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 9]: Secretly , he feared her greater intellectual powers .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 36]: He believed that girls ' brains were better suited to housewifely cares than to the study of poetry , yet some twinge of doubt bade him keep the opinion pent in his own portly breast .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 21]: `` Nay , then , if it pleases you and wiles away dull hours , I will not hinder you .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 12]: But our sweet Nellie should not betray her gifts in public .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 11]: Folk hereabouts have rabbits ' ears and magpies ' tongues .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 13]: I fear me there are neither lions nor horned pigs to hand .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 23]: They are costly toys , and 't is whispered that his gracious Majesty obtaineth less credit abroad than among his liege subjects .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 39]: Further , my bonny girls , I have asked a certain youth , George Beeston by name , to sup with us to-night , and it behooves you -- What , Anna , has it come to that ?
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 9]: You shrug at the mere mention of him !
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 20]: And he a proper youth -- not one of these graceless rascals who yelp at Carr 's heels ! ''
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 42]: Again was Sir Thomas becoming choleric and red-faced , and the girls ' excursion promised to end in speedy dudgeon had not a messenger , wearing the Palace livery , approached and doffed his cap , bowing low as he halted .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 15]: `` Happily one said your worship was in the gardens , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 17]: `` I am bidden to tell you that the King awaits your honor in his closet .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 8]: The matter is of utmost urgency . ''
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 18]: Now , this announcement had the precise effect on its recipient calculated by those who sent it .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 12]: Sir Thomas , inflated with importance , was rendered almost incoherent .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 10]: Never before had he received such a royal message .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 7]: All considerations must bow to it .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 40]: He bustled the girls into a litter in which they could be carried to his brother 's house in the city without soiling their shoes or being exposed to the gaze of the throng in the Fleet or Ludgate .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 41]: He himself hurried off to Whitehall , there to be kept in a fume of impatience for a good hour or more , while the King disputed with a Scottish divine as to the exact pronunciation of the Latin tongue .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 42]: Admitted at last to the presence , he found that the urgency of his summons touched no greater matter than the cleansing of the Fleet ditch , a fruitful source of dispute between the monarch and the city in those days .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 40]: Sir Thomas had wit enough to promise that the King 's wishes should be made known to the Common Council , and sense enough to wonder why he was called in such hot haste to attend a trivial thing .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 42]: It was a time when men sought hidden motives for aught that savored of the uncommon ; the knight , borrowing a palfrey from a merchant of his acquaintance , rode homeward along the Strand revolving the puzzle in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 13]: Long before he reached Temple Bar he was wiser if not happier .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 29]: Soon after Anna Cave and the sprightly Eleanor entered their litter to be carried swiftly through the Strand , two young men approached Temple Bar from the east .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 64]: Their distinctive garments showed that while one was of gentle birth the other was a yeoman ; that they were not master and man could be seen at a glance , as they conversed one with the other with easy familiarity , and repaid with ready good-humor the chaff which they received from the cheeky apprentices who solicited custom in the busy street .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 25]: Indeed , the appearance of the yeoman was well calculated to stir tongues less nimble than those of the pert salesmen of Fleet Street .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 52]: Gigantic in height and width , his broad , ruddy face beaming with the delight afforded by the evidently novel sights of London , his immense size was accentuated by a coat of tough brown leather and high riding-boots of the same material which almost met the skirts of the coat .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 33]: Tight-fitting trousers of gray homespun matched the color of his broad-brimmed felt hat , in which a gay plume of cock 's feathers was clasped by a big brooch of dull gold .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 34]: The precious metal served to enclose a peculiar ornament , in the shape of a headless fossil snake , curled in a circle as in life and polished until it shone like granite .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 35]: Though his coat was girt by a sword-belt he carried no weapons of steel , apparently depending for protection , if such a giant required its aid , on a long and heavy ashplant .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 19]: In other hands it would be a cumbrous stake ; to him it served as a mere wand .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 41]: His immense size , aided by a somewhat unusual garb in well-dressed London , absolutely eclipsed , in the public eye , the handsome and stalwart youth who , in richer but studiously simple attire , strode by his side .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 18]: The apprentices , fearless in their numbers and unfettered in impudence , plied him with saucy cries .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 8]: `` What d'ye lack , Master Samson ?
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 21]: Here be two suits for the price of one , for one man 's clothes would never fit thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 6]: `` Come hither , mountain !
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 15]: I 'll sell thee a town clock that shall serve thee as watch . ''
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 5]: `` Hi , master !
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 12]: Let me show thee a trencher worthy of thy stomach . ''
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 21]: The last speaker held forth a salver of such ample circumference that the two young men were fain to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 25]: `` I ' faith , friend , '' said the giant , with utmost good-humor , `` we are more needing meat than dishes .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 10]: Nevertheless , you have ta'en my measure rightly . ''
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 21]: His North-country accent proclaimed him a Yorkshire dalesman , and the White Rose was popular just then in Fleet Street .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 34]: `` If that be so , '' said the sturdy silversmith 's assistant who had hailed him , `` you must hie to Smithfield , where they shall roast you a bullock . ''
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 8]: `` Come wi ' me , then .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 10]: Mayhap they need a puppy for the spit . ''
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 9]: The answer turned the laugh against the apprentice .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 6]: He bravely endeavored to rally .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 12]: `` I cry your honor 's pardon , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 14]: `` I looked not for brains where there was so much beef . ''
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 8]: `` Therein you further showed your observation .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 16]: Ofttimes the cockloft is empty in those whom nature hath built many stories high . ''
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 15]: Again the buoyant spirits of the Colossus won him the suffrages of the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 52]: Clearly , he had an even temper in his great frame of bone and sinew , for the easy play of his limbs showed that , big as he was , he held no superfluous flesh , while the heat of the day left him unmoved , notwithstanding his heavy garments .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 9]: But his companion caught him by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 10]: `` Come , Roger , '' he said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 9]: `` We must find our kinsman 's house .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 12]: There is still much to be done ere night falls . ''
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 7]: The crowd made way for them .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 51]: They passed westward through Temple Bar , which was not the frowning stone arch of later days , but a strong palisade , with posts and chains , capable of being closed during a tumult , or when darkness made it difficult to keep watch and ward in the city .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 28]: The Strand , which they entered , was an open road , with the mansions and gardens of great noblemen on the left , or south side .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 29]: Each walled enclosure was separate from its neighbor , the alleys between leading to the water stairs , where passengers so minded took boat to Southwark or Lambeth .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 36]: On the north were other houses , some pretentious , but more closely packed together , and , on this hand , Drury Lane and St. Martin 's Lane were already becoming thoroughfares of note .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 38]: One of these houses , not far removed from the Church of St. Mary-le-Strand , thrust the high wall of its garden so far into the road that it narrowed the passage between it and Somerset House .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 27]: Here , a group of young gallants had gathered , and some soldiers , of swarthy visage and foreign attire , were loitering in the vicinity .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 33]: `` This , if my memory serves , should be the house of Gondomar , the Spanish Ambassador , '' said Walter Mowbray , the elder and more authoritative of the pair .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 3]: `` Gondomar !
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 6]: Another name for Old Nick !
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 21]: The devil should keep his proper name in all countries , as he keeps his nature in all places . ''
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 15]: `` Hush , Roger , or we shall have a brawl on our hands .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 23]: I am no lover of Spaniards , you know full well , yet we must pass Gondomar 's men without unseemly taunt .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 11]: The King loves not to hear of naked blades . ''
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 58]: Thus admonished , his wonted grin of good-humor returned to Roger Sainton 's face , and , as the swaggering youngsters in the road were paying some heed to a covered litter rapidly approaching from the west , the friends essayed to pass them by taking the pavement close under the wall of the Ambassador 's garden .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 20]: As luck would have it , a sort of signal seemed to be given for a row to start .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 18]: Swords were whipped out , men ran forward , and there was a sudden clash of steel .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 42]: A laughing fop , for his sins , turned to seek some one with whom to pick a quarrel ; he chanced to find himself face to face with Mowbray , Roger being a little in front and at one side .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 19]: `` I 'll have the wall of you , sirrah , '' cried the stranger , frowning offensively .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 26]: Walter stepped back , and his right hand crossed to his sword hilt , so evident was the design of the other to insult him .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 4]: But Sainton laughed .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 9]: He caught the would-be bully by the belt .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 51]: `` Yea , and take the house , too , if the landlord be willing , my pretty buck , '' he growled pleasantly , whereon he heaved the swaggerer bodily over the wall , and they heard the crash of his body into the window of a summer house .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 20]: Those who stood near were rendered aghast by this feat of strength ; they had never seen its like .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 28]: Young Lord Dereham was no light weight , and his lordship 's wriggling carcass had described sufficient parabola to clear coping-stones set ten feet above the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 12]: The incident passed unheeded by the greater mob in the roadway .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 14]: For no reason whatever a crowd of struggling men surged around the litter .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 35]: Mowbray , clutching his undrawn sword , planted his back against the wall from which the discomfited aristocrat would have ousted him ; he called to Sainton : -- `` Stand by , Roger !
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 7]: There is some treason afoot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 36]: The words had scarce left his mouth when a Spanish halberdier felled the two nearest litter-bearers , and a shriek of dismay came from behind the drawn curtains as the conveyance dropped to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 19]: Another rush , also preconcerted , enabled some of the well-dressed rascals to possess themselves of the litter-poles .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 21]: The gates of Gondomar 's garden were suddenly opened , and a move was made to carry the litter thither .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 27]: At that instant Eleanor Roe , thrusting aside the curtains , showed her beautiful face , now distraught with fear , and cried aloud for help .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 30]: `` Be not alarmed , fair one , '' said one of her new escort , scarcely veiling his bold stare of admiration by an assumption of good manners .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 24]: `` We have saved you from some roistering knaves , and shall give you a pleasant refuge until the trouble be quelled . ''
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 9]: `` Where are my father 's serving-men ? ''
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 18]: demanded another voice , and Anna looked forth , though anger rather than fear marked her expression .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 13]: `` Prone in the dust , miladi , '' answered the cavalier .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 13]: Both girls saw that they were being taken towards Gondomar 's house .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 26]: `` I pray you convey us to Temple Bar , '' cried Anna , an alarmed look now sending shadows across her dark eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 18]: 'T is but a step , and there our names shall warrant us bearers in plenty . ''
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 45]: `` You are much too pretty to trust to such varlets , '' said the spokesman of the party , and , before another word of protest could be uttered , the litter was hustled within the gates , which were closed at once .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 18]: Now , both Mowbray and his huge companion were assured that the whole business was a trick .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 20]: The only sufferers from the riot were the unfortunate litter-bearers and the nobleman who was pitched over the wall .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 64]: All the rest was make-believe , save the unpleasing fact that two young and beautiful girls were left helpless in the hands of a number of unprincipled libertines such as followed the lead set by Carr , the Scottish page , and maintained , in later years , by `` Steenie '' and `` Baby Charles '' in a lewd and dissolute court .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 20]: But Mowbray was a comparative stranger in London , and Sainton had never before set eyes on the capital .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 30]: Common prudence suggested that they should not raise a clamor at the gates of Gondomar , whose great influence with the erratic King was widely known and justly dreaded .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 14]: Yet , when did prudence ever withstand the pleading of a pretty face ?
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 17]: Mowbray 's blood was boiling , and it needed but little to rouse him to action .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 6]: The impetus was soon forthcoming .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 12]: The noise of the disturbance brought people running from Temple Bar .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 10]: Others hurried up from the direction of Charing Cross .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 12]: Then , as now , Londoners dearly loved a street row .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 34]: Again , by well-planned strategy , the soldiers and some of the exquisites mingled with the crowd and gave lying assurances that the rogues who fought had run off towards the Convent Garden .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 10]: Roger recognized the silversmith 's apprentice among the gapers .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 34]: `` Here , lad , '' he said , beckoning him , `` ask yon fellow holding a kerchief to his broken head who were the ladies he carried in the litter . ''
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 28]: The man , thus appealed to , gathered his wits sufficiently to answer , and the honored names of Cave and Roe acted as sparks on tinder .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 20]: Forthwith , a number of city youths gathered round Mowbray and Sainton to hear their version of the fray .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 33]: As soon as they knew that the girls had been taken into Gondomar 's house , all the race hatred and religious bigotry of the time flamed forth in ungovernable fury . ''
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 3]: ` Prentices !
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 3]: ` Prentices !
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 2]: Clubs !
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 3]: Clubs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 29]: rang out the yell , and the war-cry of the guilds quickly reached to the city barrier , whence a torrent of youths poured headlong into the Strand .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 53]: `` We 'll have 'em out , if all the ambassadors in St. James 's barred the way , '' shouted the valiant silversmith , who contrived to keep very close to Roger in the press , and , when reinforcements arrived , a decided move was made towards the garden gate .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 11]: And now , indeed , a real fight was imminent .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 14]: Seeing their ruse foiled , Gondomar 's adherents banded together for the defense .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 34]: The citizens were determined to rescue the daughters of two men respected of all honest burgesses , but , if more numerous , they were not properly armed to attack swordsmen and halberdiers .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 27]: Hence , blood would be spilt in plenty before they won the gate , had not Roger pulled back Walter Mowbray , who headed the attack .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 10]: `` Leave 'em to me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 7]: `` I 'll side 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 20]: With that he leaped forward into the space cleared by the halberdiers , and made play with his staff .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 34]: A steel helmet was cracked like a potsherd , three unarmored gallants dropped beneath one blow , and two halberds were broken across as if they had been pipe-stems abhorred by the King .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 27]: Before this raging giant , with the tremendous sweep of his long arms and six-foot staff , ordinary swords and ceremonial battle-axes were of no avail .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 28]: He mowed down his adversaries as a scythe cuts grass , and a few lightning circles described by the ashplant , cleared the way to the gate .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 23]: The door was really a wide postern , sunk in the wall , built of stout oak and studded with iron rivets .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 11]: Without a moment 's pause , Sainton leaned against it .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 17]: There was a sound of rending wood-work , and the structure was torn from its hinges .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 27]: Mowbray parried a vengeful thrust made at his friend by a fallen Spaniard , and jammed the hilt of his sword into the man 's face .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 10]: Roger , bending his head , entered the garden .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 15]: Behind him came Walter , and the exulting mob poured in at their heels .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 5]: The garden was empty .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 53]: Leading to the house was a flight of broad steps ; at the open door of the mansion stood a tall , grim-looking , clean-shaven priest , a Spaniard , of the ascetic type , a man of dignified appearance , in whose face decision and strength of character set their seal .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 14]: At his elbow Mowbray saw the young nobleman who had addressed the girls .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 15]: He ran forward , fearing lest Roger should open the argument with his cudgel .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 4]: `` Hold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 8]: cried the ecclesiastic , in good English .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 11]: `` What want ye here in this unbridled fashion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 28]: `` We seek two ladies , daughters of Sir Thomas Cave and Master Robert Roe , who were brought hither forcibly but a few minutes back . ''
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 7]: `` They are not here . ''
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 19]: `` That is a black lie , black as your own gown , '' put in Roger Sainton .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 7]: The priest 's sallow face flushed .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 16]: He was of high rank , and not used to being spoken to so curtly .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 24]: Mowbray , already cooler now swords had given place to words , restrained Roger by a look and a hand on his arm .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 12]: `` My friend is blunt of speech , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 9]: `` He only means that you are mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 27]: It will avoid riot and bloodshed if the ladies are given over forthwith to the safe conduct of those who are acquainted with their parents . ''
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 28]: `` Who are you who can venture to speak on behalf of an ignorant and unmannerly gathering which dares to violate the sanctuary of an Embassy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 5]: was the vehement response .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 13]: `` My name is Walter Mowbray , '' was the calm answer .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 9]: `` There is no violation of sanctuary intended .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 15]: We are here to rescue two ladies inveigled into this house by unworthy device .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 10]: Either they come out or we come in . ''
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 20]: `` Aye , shaven-pate , 't is ill disputing with him who commands an army , '' cried Roger .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 29]: The cleric , on whom Mowbray 's reply seemed to have an extraordinary effect , shot glances at both which would have slain them if looks could kill .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 41]: But the impatient mob was shouting for active measures : it would have asked no greater fun than the sack of Gondomar 's residence ; moreover , the majority of the Spaniards and their allies were routed in the street .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 21]: So the priest swallowed his wrath and muttered something in a low tone to the silken-clad person by his side .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 6]: Then he faced Mowbray again .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 20]: `` When I said there were no ladies here , I meant that none had been conveyed hither forcibly .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 15]: Two young ladies were sheltered by his Excellency 's retinue , it is true .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 20]: If they choose they are at liberty to accompany you , and I shall now acquaint them therewith . ''
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 15]: A hoarse laugh from the crowd showed that the sophistry did not pass unheeded .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 50]: Nevertheless , Mowbray 's counsel of moderation swayed the mob into quiescence , and , a minute later , Anna Cave and Eleanor Roe , pale and trembling , hardly knowing what was toward , were carried in their litter to the city by an excited but good-tempered escort .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 15]: CHAPTER III `` The attempt , and not the deed , Confounds us . ''
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 8]: _ Shakespeare _ , `` Macbeth . ''
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 23]: Anna 's father , jogging along comfortably on the borrowed cob , overtook the rearmost of the rabble near St. Dunstan 's .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 25]: Anger made him red , and alarm made him white , when he heard the disjointed tales of those who sought to enlighten him .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 51]: That the daughter and niece of one who held high place in his native county , and whose brother in the city was loaded with civic dignities , should be waylaid in the Strand by a number of young profligates aping Rochester 's license , was not to be endured .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 37]: Therefore , Sir Thomas flushed like a turkey , and his right hand , long unaccustomed to more serious weapon than a carving-knife , tightened on the reins in a way that surprised his placid steed .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 48]: But it was an equally serious thing that certain youthful hot-heads , led by `` a pair of Yorkshire gallants , one of whom was like unto Gog himself , '' should have stormed the house of the Spanish Ambassador in order to rescue the two girls .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 37]: The royal prerogative , already in grave dispute , was sadly abused by this disorder , and Gondomar was well fitted , by diplomatic skill and political acumen , to make the most of the incident .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 50]: When Sir Thomas thought of the way in which James , with his dagger-proof doublet unfastened and his points tied awry , would stamp up and down his council-chamber in maundering rage , the color fled from his ruddy cheeks and left him pallid , with drawn under lip .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 34]: Nevertheless , when he reached the house of Alderman Cave , situate on the north side of Draper 's Garden , his natural dread of the King 's wrath soon yielded to indignation .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 31]: He found there not only Anna and Eleanor , but Walter Mowbray and Roger Sainton , with a concourse of friends and neighbors drawn together by news of the outrage .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 21]: The old knight 's vanity was not proof against the knowledge of the peril from which the girls were saved .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 26]: He swore roundly that he had been separated from them by a trick , and admitted that the King did not want him at all .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 16]: With tears in his eyes he thanked the two young men for their timely aid .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 22]: `` You will be the son of Sir Walter Mowbray who fell in the great sea-fight against the Spanish Armada ? ''
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 9]: he cried , seizing Walter 's hand effusively .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 6]: I scarce remember my father .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 10]: I was but five years old when he died .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 25]: Yet my mother taught me to regard all Spaniards as false men , so I scrupled the less to take part against Gondomar . ''
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 12]: `` Mercy-a-gad , she might justly have given thee sterner counsel .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 9]: Thy father was a brave and proper man .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 5]: I knew him well .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 21]: Were there more of the like to-day these graceless rogues would not treat as courtezans the daughters of honest folk .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 19]: And thy friend , if he be not Goliath come to life , how is he known ? ''
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 18]: `` Let me present to your worship Master Roger Sainton , of Wensleydale , in Yorkshire . ''
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 8]: `` Ecod , he is well named .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 21]: I warrant him sain -LRB- wholesome -RRB- and I trow he weigheth nearest a ton of any man breathing . ''
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 24]: Roger , seldom at a loss for a repartee , waited until the laugh raised by Sir Thomas 's jest had passed . ''
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 29]: 'T is an empty tun at this moment , your Honor , '' said he , glancing plainly at the row of shining tankards which graced a sideboard .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 7]: `` Where are those lasses ? ''
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 15]: shouted the knight , glad of the diversion afforded by the claims of hospitality .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 3]: `` Zounds !
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 14]: Here be their defenders athirst and not a flagon on the table . ''
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 50]: In truth , Anna and Eleanor , flurried out of their self-possession by the turmoil of the past hour , had escaped to their apartments , whence they sent the excuse that they were engaged in exchanging their out-of-door dresses and cloaks for raiment more suited to the house .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 63]: There were servants in plenty , however , to bring wine enough for a regiment , and certain city magnates , arriving about this time , were emphatic in their advice that Mowbray and Sainton should not attempt to traverse the Strand a second time that day in their search for the residence of the North-country nobleman whom Walter meant to visit .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 17]: `` A bonny tale will have reached his Majesty ere this , '' ran their comment .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 35]: `` Were the pair of you to be haled before him after Gondomar had poisoned his mind you were like to lose your right hands within the hour for brawling in the streets . ''
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 13]: `` Neither Roger nor I broke the peace , '' protested Mowbray .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 44]: `` They say that one of you nearly broke Lord Dereham 's neck , '' put in a city sheriff , `` and that will be held a grave crime when recited to his Majesty by his crony , Carr -LRB- Rochester -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 24]: No , no , my lads , bide ye in the city until such time as inquiry shall be made with due circumspection .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 51]: The King hath a good heart and a sound understanding , and I 'll wager my chain of office he shall not be pleased to hear that his name was used to decoy my worthy gossip , Sir Thomas Cave , from the company of his daughter and niece . ''
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 11]: This shrewd comment was greeted with solemn nods and winks .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 37]: The timely arrival of Alderman Cave , with the intelligence that Gondomar , summoned from play at Beaujeu 's , had ridden furiously to Whitehall , determined Mowbray to accept the safe custody offered to him .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 5]: Gradually the assemblage dispersed .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 23]: A man was sent to the Swan Inn , by Holborn Bridge , where the travelers ' nags and pack-horses were stabled .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 34]: Hence , ere supper was served , Walter wore garments of livelier hue , and Roger was able to discard his heavy riding coat and long boots for a sober suit of homespun .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 10]: The girls were discreetly reserved as to their adventure .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 11]: True , they said that no incivility was offered them .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 35]: For all they could tell to the contrary the Marquis of Bath and Sir Harry Revel , who made their names known to them , had really saved them from an affray of rowdies .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 31]: `` I would I had been there , '' vowed young George Beeston , who seemed to resent the part played in the affair by Mowbray and his gigantic friend .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 19]: `` A yard measure is of little avail when swords are drawn , '' cried Anna , tartly .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 22]: The hit was , perhaps , unworthy of her wonted good nature , for Beeston belonged to the Linen-drapers ' Company .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 55]: He reddened , but made no reply , and Sir Thomas took up the cudgels in his behalf : -- `` When George weds thee , Ann , thou wilt find that a linen-draper of the city is better able to safeguard his wife than any mongrel popinjay who flaunts it at Whitehall . ''
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 27]: `` I am in no mind to wed anyone , father , '' said she , `` nor do I seek other protection than yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 10]: `` Nay , lass , I am getting old .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 16]: Be not vexed with young Master Beeston because he guessed not of your peril . ''
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 15]: `` I would brave a hundred swords to serve you , '' stammered George .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 6]: Better had he remained silent .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 7]: No girl likes love-making in public .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 20]: Anna seemingly paid no heed to his bashful words , but her eyes sparkled with some glint of annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 34]: Roger Sainton , ever more ready to laugh than to quarrel , smoothed over the family tiff by breaking out into a diatribe on the virtues of the knight 's Brown Devon ale .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 23]: Mowbray , too , seeing how the land lay , offered more attention to Mistress Eleanor Roe than to her stately cousin .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 8]: Herein he only followed his secret inclination .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 22]: The girl 's shy blue eyes and laughing lips formed a combination difficult to resist , if resistance were thought of .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 7]: She was dressed in simple white .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 38]: Her hair , plaited in the Dutch style , was tied with a bow of blue riband , nor was her gown too long to hide the neat shoes of saffron-colored leather which adorned her pretty feet .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 18]: She wore no ornaments , and her attire was altogether less expensive than that of Anna Cave .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 13]: His own experiences had given Mowbray a clear knowledge of domestic values .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 24]: Judging by appearances , he thought that the house of Roe was not so well endowed with wealth as the house of Cave .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 8]: He did not find the drawback amiss .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 29]: He was young enough , and sufficiently romantic in disposition , to discover ample endowment in Eleanor 's piquant face and bright , if somewhat timid , wit .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 22]: Anna , who looked preoccupied , quickly upset an arrangement which threatened to leave her and Beeston to entertain each other .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 11]: It was not yet dark when the supper was ended .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 19]: Anna , rising suddenly when a waiting-man produced a dust-covered flagon of Alicant , assumed an animated air .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 19]: `` I see you sip your wine rather than drink it , Master Mowbray , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 24]: `` Will you not join Nellie and me in the garden , and leave to these graver gentlemen the worship of Bacchus ? ''
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 31]: `` Aye , '' growled George Beeston , spurred into a display of spirit , `` though Venus may be coy the god of wine never refuses his smile . ''
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 30]: `` Take an old man 's advice , George , '' said Sir Thomas confidentially , `` and never seek to woo a girl with a glum face . ''
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 20]: `` Better still , '' said Roger , reaching for the flagon , `` wait until she woos thee .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 24]: Gad , a woman plagues a man sufficiently after he is wed that his heart should ache before the knot is tied . ''
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 23]: `` If your heart ached , Master Sainton , its size would render the ailment of much consequence , '' said Eleanor .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 35]: `` Mayhap 't is like an August mushroom , which , when overgrown , hath the consistency of hide , '' he answered , and his jolly laugh caused even young Beeston to smile .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 29]: `` Roger and I were bred together , '' said Mowbray , as he walked with the two girls into the small public garden which faced the house .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 14]: `` I vow he never cared for woman other than his mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 15]: `` Belike it is the fashion in Wensleydale , '' was Anna 's comment .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 14]: `` Nay , Mistress Cave , such fashion will not commend itself anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 14]: Certes , I have observed that it does not prevail in London . ''
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 25]: This with a glance at Eleanor , but the retort told Anna that although Mowbray came from the shires his wits were not dull .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 21]: As his hostess , however , she curbed the inclination to make some one suffer vicariously for poor George Beeston .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 15]: `` May I make bold to ask if you seek advancement at court ? ''
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 4]: she inquired civilly .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 17]: `` Yes , if it help one at court to wish to fight for his Majesty .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 5]: That is my desire .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 36]: After much entreaty , my mother allowed me to travel hither , in the hope that my distant kinsman , the Earl of Beverley , might procure me the captaincy of a troop of horse .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 26]: As for Roger , his mother was my mother 's foster-sister , so the worthy dame sent her son to take care of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 34]: `` What will the good ladies say when they hear that you had not been in London an hour ere you stormed Gondomar 's house to succor a couple of silly wenches ? ''
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 4]: put in Eleanor .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 34]: `` My mother will remember that my father lamed two men who sought to stop their wedding , but Mistress Sainton will clap her hands and cry , ` Mercy o ' me !
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 20]: what manner o ' fules be those Spaniards that they didna run when they set eyes on my Roger ?
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 7]: They mun be daft ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 40]: His ready reproduction of the Yorkshire dialect brought a laugh to their lips ; it aided Eleanor in no small degree to hide the blush which mantled her fair cheeks when Walter so aptly turned the tables on her .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 24]: But Anna , if restrained in her own behalf , thought that this young spark 's wooing of her friend should be curbed .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 14]: `` There was purpose in your father 's prowess , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 34]: `` Sir Harry Revel told me he wished us no indignity , so , perchance , you erred in your boldness , though , indeed , I do not cavil at it . ''
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 6]: `` Sir Harry Revel lied .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 12]: When I meet the fop I shall tell him so . ''
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 5]: `` Nay , nay .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 6]: You take me too seriously .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 7]: I pray you forget my banter .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 17]: It would ill requite your service were careless words of mine to provoke another encounter . ''
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 17]: `` For my part , I plead with you on behalf of the Marquis of Bath .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 19]: He is but a goose , though he carries the feathers of a peacock , '' added Nellie .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 13]: In their talk they passed along the north side of the garden .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 13]: Here , a number of trees gave grateful shade in the daytime .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 35]: A wall beyond , with foliage peeping over it , showed that another smaller enclosure , belonging to some civic dignitary , occupied one of the few open spaces remaining within the city defenses .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 24]: At this moment , though darkness had not yet fallen , the gloom cast by the trees rendered persons near at hand indistinct .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 28]: Their voices must have given warning of their coming , for a tall cavalier , wrapped in a cloak , suddenly stepped from behind a broad-beamed elm .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 4]: `` Anna ! ''
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 7]: he said , `` and Nellie !
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 8]: But whom else have we here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 24]: The girls started , and Mowbray would have resented the newcomer 's manner had not Eleanor cried : -- `` My brother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 7]: Anna , too , quickly intervened .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 37]: `` This is Master Walter Mowbray , '' she said , `` and his breeding , no less than the help he rendered so freely to-day , warrants more courteous greeting from Sir Thomas Roe . ''
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 42]: The stranger , a young man of dignified appearance , made such amends for the abruptness of his challenge that Mowbray wondered how it happened that so elegant and polished a gentleman should have startled two ladies with a peremptory challenge .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 5]: Soon this bewilderment passed .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 34]: They strolled on in company , and they had not been discoursing five minutes before he discovered that Sir Thomas Roe was favored of Anna if young Beeston was favored of her father .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 45]: A certain reluctance on their part to return to the more open part of the garden did not escape him , and , although there was no actual pairing off , he found little difficulty in addressing his conversation exclusively to the bewitching Eleanor .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 33]: In the half light of evening she was fairy-like , a living dream of beauty , a coy sprite , who laughed , and teased , and tantalized by her aloof propinquity .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 36]: It was strange , too , that a youngster who could hold his own so fairly in an encounter of wits with Anna should be suddenly overtaken by one-syllable bashfulness when left alone with Eleanor .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 25]: Yet , if Master Mowbray 's confusion were inexplicable , what subtle craft can dissipate the mystery of Nellie Roe 's change of manner ?
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 8]: From being shy , she became pert .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 14]: She seemed to pass with a bound from demure girlhood to delightful womanhood .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 17]: When Walter strove to rally her with an apt retort she overwhelmed him with a dozen .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 11]: Her eyes met his and looked him out of face .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 44]: It might be that the presence of her brother gave her confidence , that the sweet gloaming of a summer 's eve enchanted her , that the day 's adventures flashed a new and wondrous picture into the undimmed mirror of her mind .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 21]: Whatever the cause , Mowbray was vanquished utterly , and , being of soldierly stock , he recognized his defeat .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 17]: There came to him , in that magic garden , the first dazzling vision of love .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 22]: Never before had he met a maid to whom his heart sang out the glad tidings that here was his mate .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 17]: Somehow , the wondrous discovery , though it thrilled his very soul , sobered his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 47]: And then , with quick alternation of mood , he found his tongue again , and behold , Mistress Roe must fain listen , with many a sigh and sympathetic murmur , whilst he poured forth his day-dreams of founding anew the fortunes of his house .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 22]: Ah , those summer nights , when hearts are virginal : they are old as Paradise , young as yester eve !
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 12]: Unhappily , true love does not always find a rose-strewn path .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 53]: Absorbed though they were in their talk , and ever drawing nearer until a rounded arm touched by chance was now pressed with reassuring confidence , they could not help seeing , when they met Anna and Sir Thomas Roe in a little open space , that the lady had been crying .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 28]: Indeed , she herself made no secret of it , but bravely carried off the situation by vowing that old friends should never say `` Good-by . ''
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 42]: `` Here is your brother , Nell , come to tell us that he sails forthwith for some far-off land he calls Guiana , '' she cried , striving to laugh in order to hide the nervous break in her voice .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 46]: `` Not content with that , he must need add that he hopes to discover the limits of that wild river of the Amazons , as if there were greater fortunes for men of intelligence in savage countries than in our own good city . ''
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 13]: `` Can it be true that you leave us so soon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 14]: cried Eleanor , disengaging her arm from Mowbray 's hand in quick alarm .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 17]: `` It is , indeed , but a matter of hours , '' he said lightly .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 37]: `` I did but break in on your after-supper stroll to ask your fair gossip for some token which should cheer my drooping spirits by kind remembrance when England shall have sunk below the line . ''
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 11]: `` A most reasonable request , '' put in Walter .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 29]: `` Had I another such keepsake from a lady whom I honor most highly I would seek the further privilege of going with you on your travels . ''
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 3]: `` Lack-a-day !
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 28]: at this rate we shall lose every youth of our acquaintance , '' said Anna , who found in excited speech the safest outlet for her emotions .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 42]: `` Yet , lest it be said that I would restrain young gentlemen of spirit who would fain wander abroad , I have here a memento of myself which Sir Thomas Roe shall carry as a talisman against all barbarians . ''
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 27]: She took from beneath a ruff of lace on her breast a small oval object which was fastened by a tiny gold chain around her neck .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 13]: Even in the dim light they could see it was a miniature .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 42]: `` It is the work of that excellent painter , Master Isaac Olliver , '' she added hastily , `` and , from what I know of his skill , I vow his brush was worthy of a better subject . ''
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 10]: `` Anna , it is your own portrait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 3]: cried Roe .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 14]: `` Indeed , would any woman give you the picture of another ? ''
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 13]: `` Not unless she wished me well and gave me yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 11]: `` Have you also sat to this Master Olliver ? ''
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 6]: whispered Mowbray to Eleanor . ''
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 11]: 'T is clear you come from the country , sir .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 23]: His repute is such that to procure one of his miniatures would cost me my dress for a year or more . ''
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 24]: `` Then he has not seen you , or , being an artist , he would beseech you to inspire his pencil . ''
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 71]: Already they were alone again , for Roe and his lady might reasonably be expected to say something in privacy concerning that painting , and there is no telling what topic Walter would have pursued with Eleanor , his dumbness having passed away wholly , had not the noise of some one running hastily in their direction along the gravel path drawn the four together with the men in front .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 27]: It was now nearly dark , and they knew not , until he was upon them , that the individual in such urgency was George Beeston .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 5]: `` Master Mowbray ! ''
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 21]: he called out , `` Master Mowbray , an you be in the company , I pray you answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 5]: `` Here I am .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 5]: Is aught amiss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 18]: `` But there is another , yet I left your good friend Sainton at the door ? ''
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 35]: `` We are accompanied by Sir Thomas Roe , with whom you are acquainted , '' intervened Anna , in the clear , cold accents which were but too familiar in Beeston 's ears .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 26]: The little word meant a good deal , but the young man was too single-minded to seek a quarrel with a rival at that moment .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 25]: Gulping back the bitter exclamation which rose to his lips , he said quietly : -- `` I am glad it is none other .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 7]: Here be ill news to hand .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 38]: The King has sent officers demanding the instant rendition of two strangers , one Mowbray by name and the other a maniac of monstrous growth , who committed grave default to-day without the confines of the city .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 15]: The requisition is made in proper form , under his Majesty 's sign manual .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 7]: The sheriff can not withstand it .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 23]: He hath sent a privy warning , and he comes hither with some pomp quick on the heels of his messenger . ''
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 10]: `` Then the King 's orders must be obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 7]: What sayeth Sir Thomas Cave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 3]: said Mowbray .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 7]: `` His worship is greatly perturbed .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 11]: He fears that Gondomar has poisoned the King 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 9]: You had best consult with him instantly . ''
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 16]: `` The sheriff did not give warning without motive , '' said Sir Thomas Roe .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 14]: `` He conveyed a hint that those he sought had better be absent .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 22]: Unhappily , Sir Thomas Cave would not be pleased by my presence in his house , or I would accompany you .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 10]: Nevertheless , I advise you to avoid arrest . ''
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 14]: `` Tell us , brother dear , how this can be accomplished . ''
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 22]: There was a tremulous anxiety in Eleanor Roe 's question that sent a thrill of joy through one listener at least .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 12]: Unnoticed in the darkness , Walter sought and pressed her hand .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 11]: Again Roe 's natural air of domination made itself felt .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 21]: Even Beeston , who would gladly have run him through the body , found himself waiting for his sage counsel .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 15]: `` Return , all of you , to the dwelling , '' said Roe .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 21]: `` Let Master Mowbray bring his friend hither , and I shall conduct them both to a place of safety .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 8]: None need know of my presence here .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 15]: If Master Beeston desires an explanation thereof I shall accord it fittingly hereafter . ''
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 25]: `` For my part I shall be equally ready to receive it , when these Yorkshire gentlemen are provided for , '' said Beeston .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 25]: `` Then these polite rejoinders are needless , '' cried Anna softly , `` for Sir Thomas Roe sails forthwith for the Spanish main .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 5]: No more idle words .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 10]: Our feet are more needed than our tongues . ''
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 20]: They raced away together , Walter thinking no harm in helping Nellie by catching hold of her slender wrist .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 14]: They found Sir Thomas Cave 's house in some disorder of frightened domestics .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 10]: The knight himself was raging at the garden door .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 28]: `` A nice thing , '' he roared at the girls , `` gadding about among the bushes and gilliflowers when men 's lives are at stake .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 17]: Here be arquebusiers by the score come from Whitehall -- '' `` Where is Sainton ? ''
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 15]: demanded Mowbray , wishful to cut short any discussion that threatened to waste time .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 9]: `` Gone to don his suit of leather .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 18]: He says he has no mind to see his mother 's good homespun cut by steel bodkins .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 2]: Gad !
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 6]: he is a proper man .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 10]: But this is a bad business , Master Mowbray .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 15]: I pray you demand fair trial , yet anger not the King by repartee .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 15]: He is fair enough when the harpies about him leave him to his pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 8]: I have some little favor at court .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 18]: It shall be exerted to the utmost , and backed by my last penny if need be .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 51]: Never shall it be said that I left my daughter 's protectors to languish in gaol , maimed for life , without striving with all my power -- '' `` Never fash yourself about us , most excellent host , '' roared Sainton , appearing behind the distressed old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 20]: `` Friend Mowbray and I can win our way out of London as we won our way into it .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 29]: Methinks 't is a place that has little liking for honest men , saving those who , like your worship , are forced to bide in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 33]: Seizing the cue thus unconsciously given by Roger , Walter said hurriedly : -- `` We bid you Godspeed , my worthy friend , and hope some day to see you again .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 5]: Farewell , Mistress Anna .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 4]: Come , Roger .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 13]: I think I hear the clank of steel in the distance . ''
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 14]: `` My soul , whither will you hie yourselves at this hour ? ''
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 4]: gasped Sir Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 15]: `` We can strive to avoid arrest , and that is a point gained .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 3]: Forgive me !
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 5]: Lights are dangerous . ''
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 14]: He seized a lantern held by a serving-man and blew out the flame .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 15]: Instantly he clasped Eleanor Roe around the waist and kissed her on the lips .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 27]: She was so taken by surprise that she resisted not at all , even lifting her pretty face , in sheer wonderment , it might be .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 9]: `` Good-by , sweetheart , '' he whispered .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 20]: `` I shall see you again , if all the King 's men made a cordon about you . ''
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 27]: Then Roger and he vanished among the trees , while a loud knocking disturbed the quietude of the night in the street which adjoined the gardens .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 12]: CHAPTER IV `` The Philistines be upon thee , Samson . ''
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 5]: _ Judges _ xvi .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 2]: 9 .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 17]: For the first time in his life Mowbray felt the tremor of a woman 's kiss .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 53]: Naturally , in an age when kissing was regarded , save by husbands and jealous lovers , as a mere expression of esteem , his lips had met those of many a pretty girl during a village revel or when the chestnuts exploded on the hearth of an All Hallow 's Eve .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 37]: Yet there was an irresistible impulse , a silent avowal , in the manner of his leave-taking of Eleanor Roe that caused the blood to tingle in his veins with the rapture of a new delight .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 9]: For a few paces he trod on air .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 40]: Big Roger , recking little of these lover-like raptures , brought him back to earth with a question : -- `` Had we not better seek the open streets than scramble through these uncertain trees , friend Walter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 4]: `` Forgive me .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 12]: I should have told you that one awaits us here . ''
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 3]: `` Marry !
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 7]: Is the refuge planned already ? ''
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 5]: `` I know not .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 15]: Hist , now , a moment , and we shall soon be wiser . ''
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 9]: They stood in silence for a few seconds .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 21]: They heard the clash of accouterments and the champing of bits from the cavalcade halted outside Alderman Cave 's door .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 22]: `` I ' faith , '' growled Roger , `` his most gracious Majesty hath sent an army to apprehend us .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 35]: Yet , if you be not misled , he bids fair to be no better off than Waltham 's calf , which ran nine miles to suck a bull and came home athirst . ''
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 6]: `` I pray you cease .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 3]: Sir Thomas !
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 5]: Sir Thomas Roe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 11]: At the call a figure advanced from amidst the trees .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 15]: `` Grant me your pardon , Master Mowbray , '' came the polite response .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 15]: `` I was not prepared to encounter a son of Anak in your company .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 18]: I had grave design to climb the wall speedily when I saw your giant comrade dimly outlined .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 18]: It will be a matter of no small difficulty to pilot him unobserved through the city . ''
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 18]: `` Show me the North Road and I 'll make my own gait , '' said Roger .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 9]: `` Nay , that is not my intent .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 10]: I was , in foolish parlance , thinking aloud .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 10]: Difficulties exist only that resolute men may surmount them .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 12]: I do not decry your length of limb , good sir .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 8]: Rather would I avail myself of it .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 23]: Behind these bushes there is a wall of such proportions that your height alone will enable us to scale it without noise .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 12]: Now , Master Mowbray , up on your friend 's shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 5]: I will follow suit .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 12]: Between the two of us we shall hoist him after . ''
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 9]: Roe 's cool demeanor inspired them with confidence .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 33]: Though it was now so dark , owing to storm-clouds having banked up from the west , that they had to grope their path through the undergrowth , they obeyed his directions .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 12]: All three were seated astride a ten-foot wall without much delay .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 72]: That they had not acted an instant too soon was evident from the fact that already armed men carrying torches were spreading fan-wise across Draper 's Garden from the Caves 's house , and they heard a loud voice bellowing from the private doorway : -- `` I call on all liege men and true to secure the arrest of two malefactors who have but now escaped from this dwelling . ''
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 15]: Mowbray found himself wondering why the hue and cry had been raised so promptly .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 15]: Some one must have indicated the exact place where he and Roger had disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 20]: But Roe dropped from the wall on the other side and whispered up to them : -- `` Follow !
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 6]: It is soft earth . ''
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 16]: `` Hold by the wall , '' he murmured when they stood by his side .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 8]: `` It leads to a wicket . ''
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 12]: Walking in Indian file they quickly passed into a narrow court .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 34]: Thence , threading many a dark alley and tortuous by-street , stopping always at main thoroughfares until their guide signaled that the way was clear , they crossed the city towards the river .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 8]: Roe knew London better than the watch .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 29]: Seemingly , he could find the track blindfold , and Walter guessed that the cavalier often used this device in order to encounter Anna Cave unseen by others .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 20]: It was passing strange that Nellie should be an inmate of a house where her brother was so unwelcome .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 10]: However , this was no hour to push inquiries .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 31]: He was now utterly lost as to locality , and he awaited , with some curiosity , the outcome of this nocturnal wandering through the most ancient part of London .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 26]: At last , the close air of the alleys gave place to a fresher draft , and his quick ear caught the plash of water .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 10]: `` Guard your steps here , '' said Roe .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 22]: `` The stairs are not of the best , but they will bear your weight if you proceed with caution . ''
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 12]: He appeared to vanish through a trap-door in a small jetty .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 35]: Down in the impenetrable darkness they heard him say : -- `` I have flint and steel , yet , if you give me your hand , I can dispense with a light . ''
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 51]: Thus , with exact directions , he seated them safely in a boat , and , controlling the craft by retaining touch with the beams of the wharf , after gliding through the gloom for a few yards he was able to ply a pair of oars in the stream .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 65]: Neither of the others had been on the Thames at night -- Roger had not even seen the river before -- and so , when the oarsman vigorously impelled the wherry straight into what looked like a row of tall houses , with lights in some of the upper windows , the North-country youths thought for sure they would collide violently with the foundations .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 20]: They were minded to cry a warning , but seeing that Roe glanced frequently over his shoulder they refrained .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 47]: Thus , they shot under one of the many arches of London Bridge , covered then throughout its length by tall buildings , and , once they were speeding in mid-stream of the open river , they saw a forest of masts rising dimly in front .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 37]: Ere long , Sir Thomas Roe , who exercised sailor-like skill in the management of his oars , picked out one of the innumerable company of ships and lay to under the vessel 's quarter . ''
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 6]: _ Defiance _ ahoy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 4]: he cried softly .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 19]: `` Aye , aye , '' replied a voice , and a rope ladder fell into the boat .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 26]: Whilst Roe held it his companions clambered aloft , gaining the deck of a fair-sized merchantman where watch was kept by a number of sailors .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 15]: It chanced that Sainton mounted first , and a lantern flashed into his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 30]: As he became visible , by feet at a time , for he stood nearly seven feet high , the man holding the light fell back in amazed fear .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 5]: `` Avaunt thee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 3]: he roared .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 7]: `` Up pikes to repel boarders !
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 11]: Here be the devil himself come to murther us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 29]: `` Peace , fellow , '' said Roger , `` when Old Nick visits thee he shall not need to come in the guise of an honest man .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 28]: Yet , I warrant thee , Sir Thomas Roe shall play the devil when he comes aboard if thou makest such a row without better cause . ''
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 18]: Mowbray 's appearance , with Roe close on his heels , quelled the excitement of the watch .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 10]: A few sharp words recalled them to their duties .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 37]: The ladder was hoisted in and the boat secured with a painter , whilst Roe led the newcomers to the after cabin , where , over a flagon of wine , he sought their better acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 37]: Mowbray gave him a detailed account of all that had taken place , and Roe 's finely-chiseled face flushed deeply when he heard the true extent of the outrage planned by the band of young gallants .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 22]: `` I have no wish to defend Gondomar , '' he said slowly , seeming to compel reason to master rage .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 9]: `` He has brought the Inquisition to England .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 9]: He carries our worthy King in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 33]: Yet I would fain believe that he is too wary and prudent to countenance such doings at the very gates of the city , which he fears alone in all England . ''
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 12]: `` To be just , I believe he was not present .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 35]: Nevertheless , word came to Sir Thomas Cave that when tidings of the affair reached him , he rose instantly from play at Beaujeu 's and hastened to Whitehall to demand our arrest . ''
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 9]: `` Ah , it is a bad business .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 7]: I am much bounden to you .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 12]: You know that one of these girls is my youngest sister .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 9]: The other I prize dearer than life itself .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 31]: Yet , unless you and Master Sainton agree to sail with me on this ship to the Amazons I fear that naught can save you from the King 's wrath .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 11]: I am powerless , being in ill repute at court .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 35]: The city is strong , but unwilling , as yet , to openly defy the thieves and adulterers who pander to James 's vanities and stop his ears to the representations of God-fearing men .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 5]: This can not endure .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 10]: Our people are long-suffering but mighty in their wrath .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 25]: If Elizabeth ruled with a strong hand she ever strove to advance the honor of England and to safeguard the liberties of her subjects .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 9]: Now our flag is trailed in the mud .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 18]: We are treated with contumely abroad and our protests at home are stifled by the Star Chamber .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 4]: It must end .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 4]: It shall end .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 9]: Monarchy itself shall rot ere England perishes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 5]: These were dangerous words .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 54]: They lost none of their tremendous import when uttered by a man of such statesman-like qualities that Anthony à Wood wrote of him long afterwards : `` Those who knew him well have said that there was nothing wanting in him towards the accomplishment of a scholar , gentleman , or courtier . ''
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 28]: It was inevitable that the opinion of such an one should weigh deeply with young Mowbray , and impress even the less critical brains of Roger Sainton .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 24]: Roe 's appearance , no less than his impassioned outburst , would have won the credence of any well-bred youths in the Kingdom .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 40]: In face , in figure , and indeed in many of his attributes , he resembled that gallant and high-minded adventurer of an earlier generation , Sir Walter Raleigh , who was now a close prisoner in the Tower .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 28]: He had the bright , penetrating eyes , the long , aquiline nose , firm mouth , and well-molded chin which bespeak good birth and high intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 18]: A mass of brown hair waved over a lofty forehead and fell in ringlets on his neck .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 39]: He wore the mustaches and Vandyke tuft of beard affected by gentlemen of the period , and the natural gravity of his expression could be wholly dispelled , when occasion warranted , by a smile of rare humor .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 10]: But he was in no smiling mood just then .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 11]: He leaned his head on his hand and sighed wearily .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 84]: Mowbray , notwithstanding his own desperate though wholly unmerited plight , now presented to his eyes in all its sinister significance , could not help marveling how it came about that the leader of an expedition to the Spanish Main , which could scarce be undertaken without royal sanction , should avow himself so helpless in that very circle , while it was still more strange that Roe 's position and attainments did not render him a favored suitor in the Cave household .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 64]: Moreover , the King had knighted him , and Nellie Roe had said , during their walk in the garden , that her brother was a great friend of Prince Henry , and declared laughingly that Anna should think herself highly flattered , for the gossip ran that Princess Elizabeth was much attached to `` Honest Tom , '' as she called him .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 17]: Roe 's disturbed reflections and Mowbray 's bewilderment alike were put an end to by Roger .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 4]: `` Ecod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 41]: he cried , thumping the stout table screwed to the floor of the cabin and making the tankards dance under the blow , `` Walter and I can ask no better fate than to voyage with you to the Indies .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 19]: We are in quest of fortune , and folk say that the Spaniards have gold for the taking .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 17]: Here 's to you , Sir Thomas Roe , and here 's to all of us !
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 11]: May we never want nowt , none of us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 18]: He drained his own tankard and caused a gleam of amusement to flicker on Roe 's face .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 31]: `` Had you lost your right hand for brawling , Master Sainton , '' he said , `` you would now lose the left if the King heard your sentiments .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 8]: Harry a Spaniard , i ' faith !
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 6]: That is rankest heresy nowadays .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 20]: Yet there is no telling what may befall when we set our course west by south of the Canaries .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 14]: And now , let me see to your comfort for the night . ''
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 51]: He called a young negro from the depths of the ship ; the sudden appearance of the boy 's shining black face in the cabin caused Roger Sainton to start so violently that Roe and Mowbray laughed , while the negro himself displayed all his teeth in a huge grin .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 39]: Mowbray , during an earlier visit to London , had seen many a dark-skinned man ; it was becoming the fashion to have one or more of these ebony-hued servitors in each household with any pretensions to grandeur .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 17]: But Roger had never before set eyes on the like , and the apparition was unexpected .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 24]: `` Gad , '' said he , reaching for the flagon again , `` no wonder the sailor-man thought he saw the devil !
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 13]: 'T is clear he fancied that this worthy had fallen overboard . ''
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 51]: He stood up , to follow Roe , whereupon the negro 's astonishment was even greater than Roger 's , for the cock 's feathers in the Yorkshireman 's hat swept the ceiling of the cabin , and his belt was nearly on a level with the other 's chin .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 12]: `` Where him one dam big fighting-man lie , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 6]: said the black to Roe .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 14]: `` Dere am no bunk in the ship will hold him half . ''
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 13]: Indeed , this was a minor difficulty which had not been foreseen .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 32]: In his own cabin , which Roe intended to place temporarily at their service , there were two bunks , but each was a full twelve inches too short for Sainton .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 16]: They were stoutly built , too , of solid oak and abutting on strong lockers .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 40]: The only way in which one of them could be made to serve his needs was to cut away the partition , and it was now a very late hour to seek the services of the ship 's carpenter .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 44]: `` If that is the only drawback , it is solved most readily , '' said Roger , and , with his clenched fist , guarded only by a leather glove , he smashed a strong oaken panel out of its dovetailed joints .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 31]: The negro 's eyes nearly fell out with amazement , and , indeed , Sir Thomas Roe was not prepared for this simple yet very unusual feat of sheer strength .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 47]: `` That blow would have felled an ox , '' he cried , and Mowbray told him how Roger once , in the market square of Richmond , had , for a wager , brought down an old bull with a straight punch between the eyes .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 41]: Now , the negro not only saw and heard , but he talked of these things to the watch , and they , in their turn , related them to others of the ship 's company in the early morning .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 39]: It chanced that a half-caste Spanish cook , hired because he knew the speech of the natives of Guiana , was among the auditory , and he stole to the cabin wherein the two Englishmen lay sleeping soundly .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 35]: Mere idle curiosity impelled him to gaze at the man who could perform such prodigies , and , having gaped sufficiently , he went ashore for a farewell carouse with certain cronies in Alsatia .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 32]: Not the great men of the world , but their petty myrmidons , are oft the mainspring of the events which shape the destinies not alone of individuals but of nations .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 37]: Even Pedro , the half-caste , might have dispensed with the day 's drinking bout had his cup been fashioned of the magic crystal which enables credulous people to see future events in its shadowy mirror !
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 15]: Assuredly , some of the sights therein would have sated his desire for stimulant .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 10]: Mowbray and Sainton were aroused by an unusual movement .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 24]: At first they hardly knew where they were , and it was passing strange that the floor should heave and the walls creak .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 31]: Mowbray sprang from his bunk quickly and looked through the open door to see if it were possible that the ship had cast off from her moorings during the night .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 22]: The frowning battlements of the Tower , dimly visible through a pelting rain , showed that his first surmise was incorrect .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 34]: The _ Defiance _ was anchored securely enough , but a high wind had lashed the river into turbulence , and the storm which threatened over night had burst with fury over London .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 6]: Roger , too , awoke .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 35]: `` Gad , '' he cried , `` I dreamt I was being hanged as a cutpurse , and I felt the branch of an oak-tree swaying as I swung in the wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 30]: `` You will have many such visions if you mix Brown Devon and Alicant with the wines of Burgundy in your midnight revels , '' said Walter , cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 17]: To his ordered senses had come the memory of the garden and Nellie Roe 's kiss .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 8]: He hailed the bad weather with glee .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 28]: Men would be loth to stir abroad , and , if Sir Thomas Roe 's arrangements permitted , he could foresee another meeting with Eleanor that evening .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 20]: `` At times you talk but scurvy sense , '' grumbled Sainton , pulling on his huge boots . ''
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 34]: 'T is the lack of a pasty , washed down by any one of the good liquors you name , that hath disordered my stomach and sent its fasting vapors to my brain .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 16]: By the cross of Osmotherly , I could eat the haunch of a horse . ''
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 5]: `` Without there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 3]: shouted Mowbray .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 16]: `` Where is the black summoned by Sir Thomas Roe to wait on us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 7]: The negro came at the call .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 31]: He told them that his master had gone ashore at daybreak , with intent to return before noon , but that breakfast awaited their lordships ' pleasure in the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 13]: The hours passed all too slowly until Roe put in an appearance .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 17]: He was ferried to the ship in some state , in a boat with six rowers .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 36]: He had learnt that the city was scoured for them all night , and the rumor ran that they had escaped towards Barnet , this canard having been put about by some friendly disposed person .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 16]: `` I can not understand the rancor displayed in this matter , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 30]: `` King James must have been stirred most powerfully against you , yet it is idle to think that you have earned the hatred of some court favorite already .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 31]: Perhaps Lord Dereham is seeking revenge for being thrown into the glass-house , though , if rumor be true , his Lordship dwells in one , being a perfect knave .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 22]: In any event , you must not be seen , and I shall warn my men to forget your very existence .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 25]: We sail with to-morrow morning 's tide , and , if this wind holds , shall be clear of the Downs by night . ''
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 23]: Thinking this speech augured badly for his hopes , Mowbray said nothing of his plan to visit Cave 's house after dusk .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 65]: The sailors , under Roe 's directions , began to warp the ship alongside a wharf , where many bales of merchandise and barrels of flour , salt beef , dried fish , preserved fruit for scurvy , wine , beer , and the mixed collection of stores needed for a long voyage , were piled in readiness to be placed in her hold .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 57]: Walter , and Roger especially , were warned to remain hidden in the after cabin , where none save the ship 's officers had business , and Roe felt that he could trust his subordinates , if for no better reason than self-interest , for two such recruits were valuable additions to the ship 's company .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 21]: Though the confinement was irksome it was so obviously necessary to their safety that they made the best of it .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 69]: Walter found in a cupboard a ship-master 's journal of a voyage to Virginia , and entertained Roger with extracts therefrom , whilst the latter , at times , stretched his huge limbs and hummed a verse or two of that old song of Percy and Douglas , which , as Sir Philip Sydney used to say , had the power to stir the heart as a trumpet .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 9]: The rain ceased with the decline of day .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 27]: The monotonous clank of the windlass and the cries of stevedores and sailors gave place to the swish of water as the watch washed the deck .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 30]: For convenience ' sake , a supply of fresh water being the last thing to be taken aboard next morning , the vessel was tied up to the wharf .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 14]: When the tide fell she was left high and dry on the mud .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 61]: Roe was much occupied ashore with those city merchants who helped him in his venture , but he undertook privily to warn Anna Cave as to the whereabouts of the two young men to whom she was so greatly indebted , and they might leave to her contriving the transfer of their baggage to the ship at a late hour .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 11]: `` You shall not see her again , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 24]: asked Walter , with a faint hope that her lover would strain every nerve in that direction , when he might accompany him .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 9]: `` No , '' was the determined answer .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 12]: `` Such a course would be fraught with risk to you .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 7]: I might be seen and followed .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 15]: Her father 's serving-men , coming hither by night , will pass unnoticed . ''
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 14]: `` Do not consider me in that respect , I pray you . ''
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 7]: Roe shook his head and sighed .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 9]: `` I am resolved , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 14]: `` We may not meet until I return , if God wills it .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 8]: I told her as much last night .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 13]: We said ` farewell ' ; let it rest at that . ''
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 29]: So Walter 's heart sank into his boots , for the case between him and Nellie rested on as doubtful a basis as that between Roe and Anna .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 27]: He sat down to indite a letter to his mother , which Sir Thomas would entrust to one of his friends having affairs in the north .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 29]: Roger could not write , but he sent a loving message to Mistress Sainton , with many quaint instructions as to the management of the garth and homestead .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 38]: `` Tell her , '' quoth he , `` that I be going across seas to reive the Dons , and that I shall bring back to her a gold drinking-cup worthy of her oldest brew . ''
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 19]: `` A man may catch larks if the heavens fall , '' commented Walter in Rabelais 's phrase .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 16]: `` Or if he lime a twig he may e ` en obtain a sparrow .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 16]: My auld mother will be pleased enough to see me if the cup be pewter .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 8]: Write , man , and cheer her .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 24]: I 'll warrant you have vexed Mistress Mowbray with a screed about yon wench you were sparking in the garden last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 6]: Indeed , it was true .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 10]: Walter bent to the table to hide a blush .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 17]: His letter dealt , in suspicious detail , with the charms and graces of Nellie Roe .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 9]: At last the missive was addressed and sealed .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 50]: It was nearly ten o'clock , and London was quieting down for the night , when the two quitted their cabin and walked to the larger saloon where Sir Thomas Roe , with Captain Davis , the commander of the _ Defiance _ , was busy with many documents .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 7]: They talked there a little while .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 11]: Suddenly they heard the watch hailed by a boat alongside .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 7]: `` What ship is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 5]: `` Who hails ? ''
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 7]: `` The King 's officer . ''
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 27]: Roe sprang to his feet and rushed out , for the cabin was in the poop , and the door was level with the main deck .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 4]: The others followed .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 24]: In the river , separated from the vessel by a few feet of mud , was an eight-oared barge filled with soldiers . ''
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 5]: ` Fore God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 13]: he whispered to Mowbray , `` they have found your retreat . ''
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 6]: They turned towards the wharf .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 19]: A company of halberdiers and arquebusiers had surrounded it and already an officer was advancing towards the gangway .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 13]: `` Bid Sainton offer no resistance , '' said Roe , instantly .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 21]: `` At best , you can demand fair hearing , and I will try what a bold front can do .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 13]: Remember , you are sworn volunteers for my mission to Guiana . ''
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 25]: As well strive to stem the water then rushing up from the Nore towards London Bridge as endeavor to withstand the King 's warrant .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 8]: The officer was civil , but inflexible .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 15]: Sorely against the grain , both Mowbray and Sainton were manacled and led ashore .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 16]: `` Tell me , at least , whither you take them , '' demanded Roe .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 23]: `` The King hath been misled in this matter and my friends will seek prompt justice at his Majesty 's hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 16]: `` My orders are to deliver them to the Tower , '' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 11]: `` Were you bidden come straight to this ship ? ''
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 5]: There was no answer .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 18]: The officer signified by a blunt gesture that he obeyed orders , but could give no information .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 56]: Surrounded by armed men and torch-bearers the unlucky youths were about to be marched off through the crowd of quay-side loiterers which had gathered owing to the presence of the soldiers -- Roe was bidding them be of good cheer and all should yet go well with them -- when an unexpected diversion took place .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 14]: Standing somewhat aloof from the mob were several men carrying bags and boxes .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 27]: With them were two closely cloaked females , and this little party , arriving late on the scene , were apparently anxious not to attract attention .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 19]: But the glare of the flambeaux fell on Roger 's tall form and revealed Mowbray by his side .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 18]: `` Oh , Ann , '' wailed a despairing voice , `` they have taken him . ''
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 10]: Walter heard the cry , and so did Roe .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 8]: They knew who it was that spoke .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 46]: Roe , with a parting pressure of Mowbray 's shoulder , strode off to comfort his sister , whilst Mowbray himself , though unable to use his hands , hustled a halberdier out of the way and cried : -- `` Farewell , Mistress Roe .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 35]: Though the cordon of King 's men be here , yet have I seen you , and , God willing , I shall not part from you so speedily when next we meet . ''
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 24]: He knew that the girls , greatly daring , had slipped out with the men who carried his goods and those of Sainton .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 30]: Though his heart beat with apprehension of an ignominious fate , yet it swelled with pride , too , at the thought that Eleanor had come to see him .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 16]: The guard , seeming to dread an attempted rescue , gathered nearer to their prisoners .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 19]: A slight altercation took place between Roe and the officer anent the disposition of the prisoners ' effects .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 23]: Finally , Sir Thomas had his way , and their goods were handed over to the soldiers to be taken with them .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 29]: Then , a sharp command was given , the front rank lowered their halberds , the crowd gave way , and the party marched off towards the Tower .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 19]: Roger , by means of his great height , could see clear over the heads of the escort .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 17]: `` That lass must be mightily smitten with thee , Walter , '' he said gruffly .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 19]: `` She would have fallen like a stone had not Mistress Cave caught her in her arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 28]: CHAPTER V `` This is the time -- heaven 's maiden sentinel Hath quitted her high watch -- the lesser spangles Are paling one by one . ''
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 61]: To understand aright the mixed feelings of anger and dread which filled the minds of the prisoners as they marched through the narrow streets on their way to the Tower , it is necessary to remember how the gross corruption of the court of the first Stuart had inspired Englishmen with a scandalized disbelief in the wisdom of their sovereign .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 18]: The Tudors reigned over a people who regarded even their mad temper with a half idolatrous reverence .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 32]: The great poet of the splendid epoch closed by the reign of Elizabeth fittingly expressed the popular sentiment when he spoke of `` the divinity that doth hedge a King . ''
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 57]: But James , a slobbering monstrosity , at once shallow and bombastic , claiming by day monarchical privileges of the most despotic nature , and presiding by night over drunken revels of the most outrageous license , had torn beyond repair the imperial mantle with which a chivalrous nation had been proud to clothe its ruler .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 13]: In the Puritan north especially was he regarded with fear and loathing .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 59]: Hence , Mowbray and Sainton , though prepared to face with a jest any odds in defense of their honor or their country , could now only look forward to an ignominious punishment , fraught with disablement if not with death itself , because they had dared to cross the path of one of the King 's favorites .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 10]: It was a dismal prospect for two high-spirited youths .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 54]: `` We have brought our eggs to a bad market , I trow , '' muttered Sainton , as the gates of the Tower clanged behind them and they halted in front of the guardroom , whilst the leader of their escort was formally handing them over to the captain of the guard .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 28]: `` I fear me you were ill advised to throw in your lot with mine , Roger , '' was all that Walter could find to say .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 12]: `` Nay , nay , lad , I meant no reproach .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 12]: Sink or swim , we are tied by the same band .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 19]: Nevertheless , 't is a pity I am parted from my staff and you from your sword . ''
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 11]: `` Here , they would but speed our end . ''
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 12]: `` Like enough , yet some should go with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 17]: He looked about him with such an air that the halberdiers nearest to him shrank away .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 7]: Though fettered , he inspired terror .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 21]: From a safer distance they surveyed him with the admiration which soldiers know how to yield to a redoubtable adversary .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 36]: The troops from Whitehall quickly gave place to a number of warders , and the two were marched off , expecting no other lot for the hour than a cold cell and a plank bed .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 16]: They saw , to their surprise , that some of the men carried their belongings .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 30]: This trivial fact argued a certain degree of consideration in their treatment , and their hopes rose high when they were halted a second time near the Water Gate .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 48]: Soon , the sentinel stationed on the projecting bastion shouted a challenge , the chief warder hurried to his side , and , after some parley , the gate was thrown open to admit the identical boat which they had seen lying alongside the _ Defiance _ .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 30]: Moreover , in the light of the torches carried by those on board , they now perceived that the soldiers and rowers were not King 's men but Spaniards .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 28]: The galley was brought close to the flight of steps leading down to the dark water beneath the arch , and the prisoners were bidden go aboard .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 4]: Walter hung back .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 17]: The slight hope which had cheered him was dispelled by the sight of the Spanish uniforms .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 16]: `` I demand fair trial by men of my own race , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 12]: `` Why should we be handed over to our enemies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 6]: He was vouchsafed no answer .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 16]: Sullenly , but without delay , the warders hustled him and Roger towards the boat .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 6]: They could offer no resistance .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 22]: Their wrists were manacled , and , as a further precaution , a heavy chain bound their arms to their waists .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 38]: It was more dignified to submit ; they and their packages were stowed in the center of the galley ; the heavy gates were swung open once more , and the boat shot out into the river .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 10]: For nearly three hours they were pulled down stream .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 15]: They could make nothing of the jargon of talk that went on around them .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 41]: Evidently there was some joke toward anent Roger 's size , and one Spaniard prodded his ribs lightly with the butt of his halberd , saying in broken English : -- `` Roas ' bif ; good , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 23]: By reason of his bulk , Sainton seemed to be clumsy , though he was endowed with the agility of a deer .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 28]: Suddenly lifting a foot , he planted it so violently in the pit of the Spaniard 's stomach that the humorist turned a somersault over a seat .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 11]: His comrades laughed , but the man himself was enraged .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 24]: He regained his feet , lifted his halberd , and would have brained Roger then and there had not another interposed his pike .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 18]: An officer interfered , and there was much furious gesticulation before the discomfited joker lowered his weapon .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 18]: He shot a vengeful glance at Roger , however , and cried something which caused further merriment .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 19]: What he said was : -- `` Would that I might be there when the fire is lit .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 9]: You will frizzle like a whole ox . ''
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 10]: Fortunately , the Englishmen knew not what he meant .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 23]: Yet they were not long kept in ignorance of some part , at least , of the fate in store for them .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 25]: The galley at last drew up under the counter of a large ship of foreign rig , lying in the tideway off Tilbury Hope .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 27]: With considerable difficulty , in their bound state , Mowbray and Roger were hoisted aboard , and taken to a tiny cabin beneath the after deck .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 16]: Then there was a good deal of discussion , evidently induced by Roger 's proportions .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 17]: Ultimately , a ship 's carpenter drove a couple of heavy iron staples into the deck .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 20]: The big man eyed the preparations , and had it in his mind to pass some comment to Walter .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 29]: Luckily , his native shrewdness stopped his tongue , else his spoken contempt for the holdfasts might have led to the adoption of other means of securing him .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 31]: Two chains , each equipped with leg manacles , were fastened to the staples , and the bolts were hammered again until the chains were immovably riveted in the center .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 15]: The prisoners were locked into the leg-piece , and their remaining fetters were removed .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 8]: These operations occupied some time in accomplishments .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 42]: They had been on board fully half an hour before the halberdiers left them , and they did not know that a tall man , heavily cloaked , who stood behind the screen of soldiers , was furtively watching them throughout .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 17]: A sentry , with drawn sword , was stationed at the door when the others departed .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 10]: The shrouded stranger imperiously motioned him aside and entered .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 6]: He threw open his cloak .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 15]: A tiny lantern swinging from the ceiling lit up his sallow , thin face .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 32]: The piercing black eyes , hawk-like nose , and lips that met in a determined line , would have revealed his identity had not his garments placed the matter beyond doubt .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 16]: It was the Jesuit whom they had encountered in the doorway of Gondomar 's house .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 9]: He regarded them in silence for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 20]: Then he smiled , and the menace of his humor was more terrible than many a man 's rage .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 39]: `` You are not so bold , now that a howling crowd is not at your backs , '' he said , speaking English so correctly that it was clear he had dwelt many years in the country .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 22]: `` It may well be that your holiness is bolder seeing we are chained to the floor , '' said Roger .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 5]: `` Peace , fellow .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 9]: I do not bandy words with your like .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 12]: When you reach Spain you shall have questions enough to answer .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 27]: You , '' he continued , fixing his sinister gaze on Walter , `` you said your name was Mowbray , if I heard aright ? ''
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 24]: What quarrel have I or any of my kin with Gondomar that my comrade and I should be entrapped in this fashion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 9]: `` Your name is familiar in my ears .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 37]: Are you of the same house as one Robert Mowbray , who fell on board the _ San José _ on the day when St. Michael and his heavenly cohorts turned their faces from Spain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 37]: `` If you speak of the Armada , '' answered Walter coldly , `` I am the son of Sir Robert Mowbray , who was foully murdered on board that vessel by one of your order .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 37]: Nevertheless , '' he added , reflecting that such a reply was not politic , `` that is no reason why I should be subjected to outrage or that you should lend your countenance to it .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 56]: My friend and I , who have done no wrong , nor harmed none , save in defense of two ladies beset by roisterers , have been arrested on the King 's warrant and apparently handed over to the Spanish authorities because , forsooth , we pursued certain rascals into the Ambassador 's garden . ''
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 34]: He paused , not that his grievance was exhausted but rather that the extraordinary expression of mingled joy and hatred which convulsed the Jesuit 's face told him his protests were unheeded . ''
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 3]: _ Domine !
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 4]: exaudisti supplicationem meam !
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 23]: _ '' murmured the ecclesiastic , `` I have waited twenty years , and in my heart I have questioned Thy wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 26]: Yet , fool that I was , I forgot that a thousand years in Thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past . ''
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 20]: The concluding words were in Spanish , but Walter had enough Latin to understand his exclamation in that tongue .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 16]: It bewildered him , yet he strove to clear the mystery that enfolded his capture .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 23]: `` I pray you , '' he said urgently , `` listen to my recital of events as they took place yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 31]: When the truth is known it shall be seen that neither Master Sainton nor I have broken the King 's ordinance , or done wrong to Count Gondomar . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 26]: 'T is not the King of England , so-called , nor the minister of His Most Catholic Majesty , to whom you shall render explanation .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 24]: Words are useless with those of your spawn , yet shall your neck bend and your back creak ere many days have passed .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 14]: Would that my sacred duty did not retain me in this accursed land !
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 13]: Would that I might sail in this ship to my own country !
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 31]: Yet I do commend you , Señor Mowbray , and that gross Philistine who lies by your side , to my brethren of the Seminary of San José at Toledo .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 33]: They shall tend you in the manner that beseemeth the son of him who sent the miraculous statue of our patron to lie deep beneath the waves which protect this benighted England .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 5]: _ Gloria in excelsis !
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 19]: _ Spain is still able , by the Holy office , to revenge insults paid to her saints .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 3]: _ Malefico !
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 2]: Malefico !
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 25]: _ '' Turning to the sentry , the Jesuit uttered some order which plainly had for its purport the jealous safeguarding of his prisoners .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 24]: Then , with a parting glance of utmost rancor , and some Latin words which rang like a curse , he left them .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 23]: `` I ' faith , '' laughed Roger , quietly , `` his holiness regards us with slight favor , I fancy .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 21]: The sound of your name , Walter , was unto him as a red rag to an infuriated bull . ''
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 18]: `` I never set eyes on the madman before yester eve , '' said his astonished companion .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 3]: `` Gad !
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 22]: he swore at us in Latin , Spanish and English , and 't is sure some of the mud will stick .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 51]: An auld wife of my acquaintance , who was nurse to the Scroopes , and thus brought in touch with the Roman Church , so to speak , did not exactly know whether priest or parson were best , so she used to con her prayers in Latin and English .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 15]: ` The Lord only kens which is right , ' she used to say .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 40]: I have always noticed myself that the saints in heaven cry ` Halleluiah , ' which is Hebrew , but , as I 'm a sinful man , I can not guess how it may be with maledictions . ''
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 18]: The Spanish soldier growled some order , which Walter understood to mean that they must not talk .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 7]: He murmured the instruction to Roger .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 11]: `` They mun gag me first , '' cried Sainton .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 24]: `` Say but the word , Walter , and I 'll draw these staples as the apothecary pulls out an offending tooth . ''
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 10]: Here the sentry presented the point of his sword .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 29]: His intent to use the weapon was so unmistakable that Roger thought better of his resolve , and curled up sulkily to seek such rest as was possible .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 16]: Hidden away in the ship 's interior they knew nothing of what was passing without .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 35]: Some food was brought to them , and a sailor carried to the cabin their own blankets and clothes on which they were able to stretch their limbs with a certain degree of comfort .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 14]: They noticed that their guard was doubled soon after the Jesuit quitted them .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 59]: One of the men was changed each hour , and this additional measure of precaution showed the determination of their captors to prevent the least chance of their escape , if escape could be dreamed of , from a vessel moored in the midst of a wide river , by men whose limbs were loaded with heavy fetters .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 11]: With the sangfroid of their race they yielded to slumber .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 48]: They knew not how the hours sped , but they were very much surprised when an officer of some rank , a man whom they had not seen previously , appeared in their little cabin and gave an order which resulted in their iron anklets being unlocked .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 8]: He motioned to them to follow him .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 14]: They obeyed , mounted a steep ladder , and found themselves on deck .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 10]: The first breath of fresh air made them gasp .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 69]: They had not realized how foul was the atmosphere of their prison , poisoned as it was by the fumes of the lamp , but the relief of the change was turned into momentary stupefaction when they saw that the banks of the Thames had vanished , while two distant blue strips on the horizon , north and south , marked the far-off shores of Essex and Kent .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 19]: With all sails spread to catch a stiff breeze the ship was well on her way to sea .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 34]: The prisoners had scarce reached the deck before a change of course to the southward showed that the vessel was already able to weather the isle of Thanet and the treacherous Goodwin Sands .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 37]: Roger 's amazement found vent in an imprecation , but Walter , whose lips were tremulous with a weakness which few can blame , turned furiously to the officer who had released them from their cell .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 7]: `` Can it be true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 15]: he cried , `` that we have been deported from our country without trial ?
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 40]: What would you think , Señor , if your King permitted two Spanish gentlemen to be torn from their friends and sent to a foreign land to be punished for some fancied insult offered to the English envoy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 5]: The outburst was useless .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 27]: The Spaniard knew not what he said , but Mowbray 's passionate gestures told their own story , and the courtly Don shrugged his shoulders sympathetically .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 12]: He summoned a sailor , whom he despatched for some one .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 11]: A monk appeared , a middle-aged man of kindly appearance .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 26]: He was heavily bearded , and his slight frame was clothed in the brown habit , with cords and sandals , of the Franciscan order .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 58]: The officer , who was really the ship 's captain , made some statement to the monk , whom he addressed as Fra Pietro , and the latter , in very tolerable English , explained that the most excellent Señor , Don Caravellada , was only obeying orders in carrying them to the Spanish port of Cadiz .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 46]: Arrived there , he would hand them over to certain authorities , as instructed , but meanwhile , if they gave him no trouble and comported themselves like English gentlemen , which he assumed them to be , he would treat them in like fashion .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 11]: `` To what authorities are we to be entrusted ? ''
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 24]: demanded Mowbray , who had mastered the first choking throb of emotion , and was now resolved not to indulge in useless protests .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 14]: A look of pain shot for an instant across Fra Pietro 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 15]: But he answered quietly : -- `` Don Caravellada has not told me . ''
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 18]: `` Belike , then , friend , he only needs the asking , '' put in Roger .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 36]: The monk shook his head , and was obviously so distressed that Roger went on : -- `` Nay , if it be a secret , let it remain so , in heaven 's name .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 14]: Mayhap I may request your barefooted reverence 's good offices in another shape .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 13]: At what hour is breakfast served on board this hospitable vessel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 13]: Fra Pietro answered readily enough : -- `` It awaits your pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 20]: The Señor Capitan bids me offer you , in his name , the best resources of the ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 34]: `` Egad , let us eat first , after which all he has to do to get rid of us is to place Master Mowbray and me in a small boat with oars .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 23]: ` Twill save us much bother and the ship much provender , for I am sharp set as a keen saw . ''
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 26]: Without reply , the monk led them to a cabin where plenty of cold meats , bread , wine , and beer graced the table .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 26]: He sat down with them , crossed himself , and ate sparingly of some dry crust , whilst Walter and Sainton tackled a prime joint .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 31]: Roger , pausing to take a drink , eyed askance the meager provender which sufficed for Fra Pietro ; he made bold to ask him why he fared so poorly .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 24]: `` It is fast day , and , unfortunately , I forgot to tell the cook to boil me some salted fish . ''
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 11]: `` Are there many such days in your calendar ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 3]: quoth Roger .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 11]: `` Yes , at certain periods of the year . ''
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 50]: `` Gad , if that be so , you ought to follow the practice of a jolly old priest I have heard of , who , having pork but no fish on a Friday , baptized it in a water-butt saying , ` Down pig ; up pike ! '
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 13]: Then he feasted right royally and without injury to his conscience . ''
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 4]: The monk smiled .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 14]: He was wise enough to see that the hearty giant intended no offense .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 16]: `` I do not need such sustenance as your bulk demands , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 31]: `` I heard the men speaking of your proportions , but , until I saw you with my own eyes I could scarce credit that such a man lived . ''
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 14]: `` I take it you are not in league with our captors ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 22]: put in Walter , anxious to gain some notion as to the extraordinary circumstances which led up to his present position .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 17]: `` I am but a poor Franciscan , availing myself of a passage to Lisbon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 13]: `` Do you know the Jesuit who visited us last night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 8]: `` I did not see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 9]: `` Perchance you may have heard of him .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 18]: He appeared to hold a high place in the household of Gondomar , the Spanish Ambassador . ''
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 25]: Fra Pietro dropped his eyes and murmured : -- `` I think he is Dom Geronimo , Grand Inquisitor of the Holy Office . ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 6]: Mowbray pushed away his plate .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 5]: `` Dom Geronimo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 7]: `` Your priestly titles are unfamiliar .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 24]: Is he , by any chance , one who was known in former years as Fra Geronimo , a Jesuit from Toledo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 8]: `` The same , I should believe .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 10]: He is now a dignitary of much consequence . ''
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 7]: `` He is a foul murderer !
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 17]: He slew my father by a coward 's blow , during the great sea-fight off Dover .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 7]: Oh , to think of it !
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 14]: Not yet two days since he stood in front of my sword . ''
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 24]: `` I was minded to tap the bald spot on his skull with my staff and you restrained me , '' growled Roger .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 10]: Mowbray 's bitter exclamation seemed to horrify Fra Pietro .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 8]: He placed his hands over his ears .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 6]: `` Madre de Dios ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 15]: he murmured , `` speak not thus of the head of the Holy Office .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 25]: Did anyone else hear you your fate were sealed , and the Lord knoweth your case is bad enough without adding further condemnation . ''
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 30]: Sensible that the Franciscan could hardly be expected to agree with the denunciation of his religious superior , Mowbray restrained the tumultuous thoughts that coursed wildly through his brain .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 14]: He bowed his head between his hands and abandoned himself to sorrowful reflection .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 11]: A good deal that was hidden before now became clear .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 46]: It was not to be wondered at that Sir Thomas Roe should be puzzled by the animosity displayed by an unknown clique in Whitehall against two strange youths who happened to participate , as upholders of the law , in a not very serious brawl .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 56]: The expression of the Jesuit 's face when he heard Mowbray 's name , the determined measures adopted by Gondomar to capture those who had defeated the cleverly planned abduction of the two girls , the remorseless hatred of Dom Geronimo 's words when he visited the captives overnight , all pointed to one conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 53]: The Jesuit was , indeed , the fanatic who killed Sir Robert Mowbray on board the _ San José _ , and he was ready , after twenty years , to pursue the son with a spleen as malevolent as that which inspired the assassin 's blow that struck down the father .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 15]: How crafty and subtle had been the means adopted to crush Roger and himself !
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 13]: Were fair inquiry held , no charge could have lain against them .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 38]: So an unworthy monarch , already a dupe in the game of king-craft played by Spain , had weakly consented to allow the royal warrant to become an active instrument in the hands of an implacable bigot .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 9]: Swift and sure was Dom Geronimo 's vengeance .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 41]: They had the misfortune to cross his path without the knowledge even of his identity , and now they were being ferried to Spain for some dread purpose the mere suspicion of which chilled the blood in Mowbray 's veins .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 4]: And Nellie Roe !
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 30]: She , with her beautiful and imperious cousin , was left in the city which harbored a hostile influence so venomous , so pitiless , and yet so powerful .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 34]: The suspicion that she , too , if only because a Mowbray was her rescuer , might fall under the ban of the Jesuit , wrung a cry of anguish from his lips .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 33]: Hardly knowing what he did , and not trusting himself to speak , he rushed on deck with the mad notion of throwing himself overboard in a vain attempt to swim ashore .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 16]: As he emerged from the companionway a whiff of spray struck him in the face .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 7]: The slight shock restored his senses .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 14]: A heavy sea was running , and the coast was six miles distant .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 8]: To spring over the bulwarks meant suicide .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 7]: Moreover , could he desert Roger ?
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 8]: It was not to be thought of .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 23]: Though death might be a relief , he must stick to his loyal friend , no matter what the ills in store .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 19]: Meanwhile , Roger , in his homely way , was telling Fra Pietro the story of their adventures .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 18]: The monk , who seemed to be of a very kind and benignant disposition , said little .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 5]: But he listened attentively .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 36]: Later , when Mowbray had steeled his heart to endurance , Fra Pietro spoke gently to him , and , when the pair were stricken with sea-sickness , he tended them like a skilled nurse .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 55]: And so the days passed until , with a favoring gale , they neared the Portuguese coast , and the _ Sparta _ , for thus was the ship named , bore up for Cape Finisterre and thence ran steadily , under the lee of the land , down to the harbor of Lisbon .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 57]: Fra Pietro , with whom they had contracted a very real friendship , although his beliefs and opinions ran counter to theirs on almost every topic they discussed , was greatly concerned when the captain 's edict went forth that during the vessel 's stay in port the two prisoners must be chained in their cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 31]: Yet he sought and obtained permission to visit them , and twice he brought them a goodly supply of fresh fruit and a flagon of the famed wine of Oporto .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 11]: The _ Sparta _ was not tied to a wharf .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 24]: She dropped anchor well out in the harbor , and communication with the shore could only be made by means of a boat .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 13]: Fra Pietro came to see his English friends for the last time .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 29]: There were always two sentries on duty at the cabin door now , so it was evident that Señor Caravellada meant to discharge his trust with scrupulous fidelity .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 35]: It is natural that the worthy monk , knowing full well the dreadful fate that awaited the two youths at the end of the voyage , should be much downcast during this farewell interview .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 16]: Yet there was a hesitancy in his manner that did not escape Walter 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 25]: He produced his basket of grapes and peaches and rich pomegranates , while , this time , he carried three wicker-covered flasks of wine .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 7]: Then he began to laugh nervously .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 24]: `` In one of these flagons , that with the broken seal , '' he said , `` the wine is extraordinarily potent .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 28]: It has the quality of sending a man into a sound sleep if he imbibe even a small measure , yet it tastes like other wine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 43]: `` Ah , '' exclaimed Roger , who had caught a hint from the close attention paid by Mowbray to the monk 's words , `` that should be a fine liquor if a man wanted to sleep but could not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 10]: Fra Pietro held out a luscious bunch of grapes .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 38]: `` Within a bowshot from this ship , '' he said , affecting a gaiety that should hide the serious nature of his words , `` there is a Portuguese vessel , the _ Sancta Trinidad _ .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 9]: She sails for the East Indies before dawn .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 34]: The captain , an honorable man , would give safe asylum to those who were distressed , could they but reach his ship , and in this cluster of grapes is a file .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 8]: My friends , may God prosper you !
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 15]: Though you are not of my faith I can not but wish you well .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 9]: I have striven hard ashore to help you .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 17]: I have pleaded with those in power , but my words have fallen on deaf ears .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 10]: Now you know the extent of my poor resources .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 4]: _ Dominus vobiscum !
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 9]: In manus tuas , Domine , commendo juventes .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 50]: _ '' Tears sprang into his eyes , he lifted his hands to heaven as he called down a blessing on them , and the two bowed their heads before this good and true man , in whom the spirit of Christian charity triumphed over narrow conceptions of dogma .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 8]: His prayers seemed to abide with them .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 45]: When night fell the men whose duty it was to maintain the watch indulged in a carouse , as those who had been ashore not only returned full of liquor but carried with them a liberal supply of wine for their less fortunate comrades .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 39]: Hence , though Roger drugged two of the guard into torpor , no suspicion was aroused when the relief came , but the sergeant , growling at the drunkards , determined to take a turn himself on duty .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 14]: Now this circumstance , at first forbidding , turned out to be providential .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 36]: Walter had plied the file industriously on his shackles , but it was quite certain that several hours of severe labor would be needed before he could cut through his own and Roger 's anklets .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 37]: Sainton , with his great strength , might have pulled the staples from the floor , but this would be of little avail if they were compelled to swim to the ship described by Fra Pietro .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 31]: Moreover , their freedom of movement would be so hampered that they might hardly hope to quit the vessel unperceived , even if a boat were moored to the stern .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 37]: As a last resource they determined to adopt this expedient , but the presence of the sergeant , in whose pouch rested the key of their leg irons , gave a new direction to their thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 14]: In the most friendly way , Roger plied him with the doctored wine .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 11]: Feeling himself becoming drowsy the man would have staggered out .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 20]: At this , the very crisis of a desperate situation , Sainton gave a mighty tug at his chain .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 13]: The restraining staple came away , tearing with it half a plank .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 13]: -LSB- Illustration : In a minute or less they were free . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 16]: Startled almost into full consciousness the sergeant sprang towards him , with sword half drawn .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 16]: So there was no help for it but to assist the action of the wine .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 27]: Roger grabbed him by the neck and held him , wriggling , until , to say the least , he was willing to lie very still .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 11]: In a minute , or less , they were free .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 10]: They knew that the hour was long past midnight .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 16]: The dawn would soon be upon them and there was no time to be lost .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 14]: Walter seized the sergeant 's sword and Roger took the sentry 's halberd .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 21]: They would fight for their lives now , even if they were compelled to face the whole ship 's company .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 6]: But fortune still favored them .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 35]: The watch on deck were mustered forward , and the clinking of a can , together with the manner of such speech as they overheard , told them that conviviality was well established there .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 19]: So they crept to the after part , Roger going almost on all fours to hide his stature .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 9]: Sure enough , a boat was moored there .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 23]: They climbed down into her , cast off , and a strong tide quickly carried them away from the _ Sparta _ .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 41]: They looked about for the _ Sancta Trinidad _ , and guessed aright that a fine brig , moored about a cable 's length distant from the _ Sparta _ , must be the vessel spoken of by Fra Pietro .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 13]: Rowing quietly towards her they hailed her by name and were answered .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 31]: They were hoisted aboard , and a stoutly built , black-bearded man , who came at the cry of the watch , met them cordially : -- `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 6]: he cried , `` Eenglish !
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 5]: One dam big fella !
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 14]: I haf wait you dis hour an ' fear you no come . ''
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 33]: Instantly , though it meant the loss of a good anchor and length of rope , the cable was slipped , a sail or two shaken out , and yards were squared .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 12]: The ship got some way on her and began to move .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 21]: In the ghostly light the _ Sparta _ looked like a great bird asleep on the dim waste of waters .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 11]: Soon her outlines faded and were lost in the gloom .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 28]: As the sails filled and more canvas was spread the _ Sancta Trinidad _ showed her mettle and spurned the lively waves from her well tapered bows .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 44]: The hills merged into the low-lying clouds , the lights ashore became smaller and smaller until they vanished altogether , the ship was well out to sea , and the two youths were saved , they hoped , from the devildoms of Spain .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 17]: They went to seek the captain , who greeted them again in the most friendly manner .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 15]: `` No tank me , '' he said , smiling until his teeth gleamed .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 6]: `` You tank Fra Pietro .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 4]: Him good man .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 15]: Him come my house an ' nurse my son when him sick wid plague .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 4]: _ Por Dios !
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 9]: _ I do anytink for Fra Pietro ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 14]: CHAPTER VI `` For her own person , It beggared all description . ''
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 10]: _ Shakespeare _ , `` Antony and Cleopatra . ''
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 18]: The road from Delhi , as it neared Agra , wound through a suburb of walled gardens .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 35]: Between occasional gaps in the crumbling masonry , or when the lofty gates happened to be left open , the passer-by caught glimpses of green lawns bordered with flowers and shaded by leafy mango-trees .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 20]: Diving into a ravine scarred with dry water-courses , the road passed a Hindu shrine and a Mahomedan tomb .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 53]: On the opposing crest it cut a cluster of hovels in twain ; thence it ran by the side of a long , low caravansary , and finally vanished , like a stream suddenly emboweled in the earth , within the dark portals of the Delhi Gate of the chief Mogul city .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 22]: Two Europeans , mounted on sturdy cobs of the famed Waziri breed , drew rein at the entrance to the caravansary .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 15]: One of them held up an authoritative hand to the sumpter train which followed .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 17]: `` Here we reach the end of a long journey , Roger , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 30]: `` Agra lies within the gate , the Palace stands beyond the bazaar , and this is the rest-house spoken of by Rasul , our native friend at Delhi .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 13]: The hour is yet early to seek an audience of the Emperor .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 40]: Let us refresh ourselves here , make some needed change in our garments , and then hire a guide to lead us to the house of Itimad-ud-Daula , for they say that he alone possesseth Akbar 's ear . ''
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 20]: `` That is another way of saying that he shall first possess himself of a moiety of our goods .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 6]: Well , be it so .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 9]: 'T is a strange land at the best .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 20]: Let us cram his maw , and mayhap he will tell us a more homely manner of addressing him .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 13]: It passeth my understanding how thou dost mouth this lingo , Walter .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 28]: Ecod , I can carry it off bravely with a Mahomed or a Ram Charan , but when it comes to Iti -- what d'ye call him ?
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 19]: -- my jaws clag and my tongue falters in the path like a blind man 's staff . ''
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 35]: So saying , Roger Sainton swung himself off his steed , and straightway the gapers gathered , for his height was not so apparent on horseback as when he stood square on his feet .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 15]: But the servants tending the pack-animals were accustomed to this exhibition of popular interest .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 15]: They warned off the rabble with the insolence every jack-in-office displays towards his inferiors .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 6]: `` Away , illegitimate ones !
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 6]: Have ye not work ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 3]: cried one .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 3]: `` Bapré !
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 18]: If ye stand not aside ye shall eat the end of my stick , '' shouted another .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 14]: `` Bring fire and singe their beards , '' growled a Mahomedan driver .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 8]: `` Kick , brother , kick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 37]: suggested a humorist , tickling a mule , whereupon the long-eared one ducked his head and lifted his heels in approved style , readily clearing a space , amidst the laughter and jeers of the onlookers .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 12]: By this time , Mowbray and Sainton had entered the caravansary .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 41]: It was a substantial looking building externally , but its four walls merely supported an interior veranda , split into sections , where merchants could sleep if they chose , or cook their food and rest during the midday hours .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 48]: In the open square , which occupied nearly all the inner space , was herded a motley collection of elephants , camels , bullocks , horses , and asses , -- while every conceivable sort of package of merchandise was guarded by attendants of many Indian races .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 59]: At first , it seemed that there was no more room for man or beast , but the requisite amount of shouting , and a lavish use of opprobrious epithets , couched in various languages , secured a corner of the square for the friends ' cavalcade and a clear space of the veranda for their own convenience .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 32]: Three years of life in the East , not to mention the new experience of a march of over a thousand miles up country , had accustomed them to such surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 35]: Whilst they were washing and dressing their servants prepared an excellent meal of kid and rice , which they tackled with a gusto that showed appetites in no wise impaired by residence in Hindustan .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 43]: They had ridden ten miles that morning , and it is hard to conceive a more exhilarating or healthful exercise than a march across the great central plain of India during the early hours of a fine day in the cold weather .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 42]: The date was the first day of November , 1611 , and , if the two Yorkshire adventurers had changed somewhat since they sailed away from Lisbon on board the _ Sancta Trinidad _ , the change was for the better .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 54]: Walter Mowbray had become more manly , more authoritative , less prone to flash his sword at the first sign of a quarrel , whilst Roger , if he had increased neither in height nor girth , had gained a certain air of distinction that was not due wholly to his gigantic proportions .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 8]: Their intervening history may be told briefly .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 35]: The _ Sancta Trinidad _ , touching at the Canaries , might have passed them on to an English ship , bound for Plymouth , which lay there waiting for the wind to change .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 15]: But worthy Captain Garcia had taken a great fancy to the pair of them .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 26]: He vowed that such fortunes were to be won speedily in the land of the Great Mogul that they agreed to sail thither with him .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 63]: They called at Table Bay , were nearly lost in doubling the dreaded Cape of Good Hope , were assailed by pirates off Madagascar , when Roger proved that a capstan-bar , properly wielded , is worth a dozen swords , and finally brought to in the harbor of Swally Road , at some little distance from Surat on the Tapti River .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 12]: Here , the worthy Garcia realized what his friendship had forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 41]: Englishmen were in small favor with his grasping fellow-countrymen , and the two encountered many reverses , until they fell in with an English factor , named Edwards , from Ahmedabad , who asked them to join him in business .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 33]: Though they were wanting in experience of the ways of Indian merchants , Edwards undertook to teach them , for he was greatly in need of those whom he could trust implicitly .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 61]: They learnt the Urdu language , Walter thoroughly , and Roger with less success ; they made the acquaintance of Prince Jahangir , acting as Viceroy for his father , Akbar , in the west country , and , ultimately , they and their partner put all their store to the hazard in an ambitious expedition to the far-off capital .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 22]: It was their intent to meet the renowned Akbar at Delhi on his way south from a summer spent in Kashmir .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 17]: News of a rising in the Dekkàn , however , had hurried the monarch 's movements .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 33]: They missed him at the ancient capital of India , so , having learnt , among other things , the eastern habit of patience , they marched by easy stages to Agra .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 25]: And now , refreshed and properly clothed in garments befitting their position , they mounted fresh horses which had been led during the march .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 16]: Preceded by a _ chuprassi _ , or attendant , they advanced towards the gate .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 6]: `` Make way there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 11]: shouted the man , `` stand aside , you basket-carriers !
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 12]: Hi , you with the camel , pass on the left !
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 16]: Oh , you pig of a bullock-driver , do you not see the sahibs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 25]: Thus , their advent heralded by much unnecessary bawling , they rode through the center one of the three pointed arches of the gate .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 19]: Beyond lay the principal street of the narrow bazaar in which the Agra merchants conducted their brisk trade .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 12]: And what a brilliant spectacle it offered in the glorious sunshine !
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 25]: Lofty houses , gay in tawdry colors and picturesque in their dishevelment , looked down on a crowd as varied as any on earth .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 11]: Caste and color of every sort jostled in the roadway .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 24]: Women , erect and elegant , carrying earthen jars on their heads , returning from riverside or well , moved with graceful carriage .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 18]: Merchants , coolies , sweetmeat sellers , and milk-venders rubbed shoulders with swaggering Rajputs and stately Mahomedans .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 24]: A Hindu pilgrim , laden with sacred water from the distant Ganges , paused for a moment to buy a handful of millet .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 33]: A white-turbaned Sikh , attracted by the striped and golden fruit of a melon-seller , tendered a small coin for a rosy slice and stalked on , eating gravely and with dignity .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 31]: Crawling snake-like in the dust , a devotee wound his way to far-off Ajodhia , where Holy Ganga , if ever he reached its banks , should lave his sins .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 49]: Near him stood a snow-white leper , thrusting fingerless stumps into the faces of the passers-by , and gaining , by his raucous cries and revolting appearance , a few cowries , or coin shells , from the few who did not remain utterly indifferent to his appeals .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 49]: An olive-skinned Brahmin , slender and upright , bearing on his forehead the marks of his proud descent , and carrying a brass vessel wherewith to draw the water for his morning ablution , pulled his red cotton wrapper more closely around him as he passed the leper .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 30]: A young Pathan , fair-complexioned , eagle-nosed , hawk-eyed , stalwart and stately as is the birthright of his mountain race , pushed through the crowd with careless hauteur .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 17]: The Sikh , the Brahmin , the Pathan , were the born aristocrats of the mob .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 84]: To add to the seemingly inextricable confusion , pariah dogs prowled in the gutter , bullock-carts crept along complainingly , stealthy footed camels lurched through the crowd , palanquins , borne on the shoulders of chanting carriers , passed swiftly amidst the vortex , and the two travelers encountered at least one native carriage , painted green and gold , and drawn by two white Dekkàni bullocks , conveying a party of Hindu women to the temple of Mahadeo , God of Love .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 56]: The occupants were young and pretty , too , clad in silks and laden with jewels , as could be readily seen by a peep through the folds of the _ chudda _ , left carelessly open , and they laughed musically as they caught sight of the Englishmen 's eyes turned towards them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 33]: 'T is clear enough that Akbar is a strong ruler and a just one , '' said Walter , his white teeth showing in a smile at the merry party of girls .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 10]: `` Such is his repute , '' answered Roger .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 7]: `` Repute may belie a man .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 5]: Here is ample proof .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 10]: In a Mahomedan city I find Hindus in excess .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 18]: Amidst a strangely assorted crowd , pretty women drive abroad in brave display of gold and gems .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 20]: I reason that every man knows he is protected by the law and a woman need fear no insult .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 13]: 'T is not so in another great city we wot of . ''
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 10]: `` Ecod , I was just thinking of London .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 21]: Not that I know much of the place , but the babel of the bazaar brought to mind the Fleet .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 28]: Ah , Walter Mowbray , 't was a queer gate we opened when you drew on my Lord Dereham and I heaved him over the wall . ''
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 7]: `` We were heedless youths then .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 12]: Now we are grave merchants and must comport ourselves as such .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 19]: I fancy it would better become our peaceful character had we left our swords at the caravansary . ''
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 10]: `` I ' faith , I differ from you .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 32]: Some chuck might have a notion to measure our bales by our blades , and I like ever to give a man an ell for a yard by that reckoning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 21]: So saying , Roger significantly tapped the handle of the tremendous weapon fashioned for him by an armorer at Ahmedabad .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 29]: Slung from his right shoulder by a baldric , the sword was nearly four feet in length , perfectly straight , double-edged , and strong in the forte .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 30]: Probably there was not its like in all India , as the expert native swordsman finds delight in manipulating a curved scimitar , with razor edge and tiny grip .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 16]: The Indian uses the sword to cut , the lance and the dagger to stab .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 5]: Mowbray shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 26]: `` There is so much at stake on this venture , '' said he , `` that I hope we may keep clear of quarrels .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 37]: Remember , I wrote to Nellie Roe telling her , if fortune smiles on us , we should return to England by the first ship that sails from Surat after we have adjusted accounts with Edwards .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 24]: Let us sell our silks and spices as best we may and haste back to the coast with lighter and speedier convoy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 16]: Roger laughed , so loudly and cheerily that many an eye was turned towards him .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 8]: `` By the cross of Osmotherly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 12]: he cried , `` that letter hath made thee a parson .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 45]: Yet I heard naught of this when Suráj Mul barred the way at Ajmere , and you and I rode down his sowars as if they were painted men and not bewhiskered knaves of flesh and blood , though of the black sort . ''
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 15]: `` Mayhap the near end of our journey hath made me serious minded . ''
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 20]: `` Now , I think with you , but I arrive at the same end by a different road .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 8]: Our swords have done us good service .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 14]: Let them keep in use and they may earn us hilts of gold .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 4]: But how now ?
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 7]: Do we leave the city ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 21]: Their guide had led them to the bank of the Jumna , where a bridge of boats spanned the stream .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 32]: In reply to a question by Walter , the man told them that the house of the Diwán , or Prime Minister , lay on the other side of the river .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 21]: They followed him , crossed the shaking bridge which made their horses nervous , and climbed the steep bank opposite .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 45]: Away to the right , on the city side of the Jumna , they could see the high piled red sandstone battlements of the palace , with some of its white marble buildings glistening in the sunlight over the top of the frowning ramparts .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 44]: A winding road led towards the castle along the left bank of the river , and , in the far distance , they could distinguish a gay cavalcade of horsemen , whose burnished ornaments and arms shone in the sun with dazzling gleams .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 8]: `` What pageant may that be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 6]: asked Walter of the guide .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 22]: `` The King of Kings may ride forth in state , sahib , or Prince Jahangir may go to the chase .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 4]: I know not .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 12]: At this season such spectacles are common in Agra . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 10]: 'T is a brave show , '' muttered Roger .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 12]: `` This Agra must be a grand place to loot . ''
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 45]: They lost sight of the cortège and halted in front of a strong but exceedingly beautiful gateway , fashioned in a Saracenesque arch of white marble , and bedecked with scrollwork wrought in precious stones , with a text in Persi-Arabic over the porch .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 30]: Whilst the guide spoke to a guard , Walter deciphered the script : -- '' ` May Allah prosper all who enter and all who leave this dwelling ! '
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 20]: A most noble wish , '' he said , `` and one which I reciprocate to the full . ''
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 20]: `` These Mahmouds have a way of uttering a prayer when they cut your throat , '' growled Roger .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 19]: `` They never kill a duck but they chant a verse of their scripture to mark the beheading .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 16]: Now , I 'll warrant me this is a canting rogue at the best . ''
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 6]: The gate was thrown open .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 40]: Between its portals was revealed a vista of a most delightful garden , where roses hung in festoons and all manner of beautiful shrubs gave shade to pleasant lawns or were reflected in the placid depths of clear lakes .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 57]: Half hidden among lofty trees they saw the low towers of a mansion built wholly of white marble , and decorated , like the gate , with flower-like devices wrought in topaz , and carnelians , and blue , red , and green gems that sparkled with the fire of sapphires , rubies , and emeralds .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 24]: `` The inmate may have the heart of a rogue , but he has the eye of an angel , '' said Walter .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 9]: `` Is this the house of Itimad-ud-Daula ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 7]: he went on , in Urdu .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 11]: `` It is , sahib , '' answered the guide .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 8]: `` And how is it called ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 6]: `` Bagh-i-dilkusha , sahib . ''
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 9]: `` The Garden of Heart 's Delight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 5]: He turned to Roger .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 7]: `` And well named , too .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 16]: If ever a place deserved such title methinks we are looking at it now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 22]: `` I vow he has been dreaming of Nellie Roe all night , '' growled Roger to himself as they dismounted .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 9]: `` I never knew him in such mood .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 2]: Gad !
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 19]: he is either sickening for a fever or he will write a set of verses ere sunset . ''
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 26]: They were asked to wait in the _ barámada _ , or porch , until a messenger took particulars of their errand to the Diwán .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 12]: But fortune smiled on them that day and carried them far .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 29]: The man had scarce set out towards the house when the clatter of a horse , hard ridden , announced the approach of some cavalier in hot haste .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 18]: The animal was reined in with remarkable celerity without , and the rider entered the garden hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 40]: He checked his speed , however , when he saw strangers , and not even the well-bred hauteur affected by the Persian nobles of Akbar 's court enabled him wholly to conceal the surprise with which he beheld Sainton .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 6]: Walter stepped forward and bowed .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 21]: `` We are English merchants , '' he said , `` and we seek an audience of the illustrious Itimad-ud-Daula .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 11]: These servitors are dull-witted and may not explain our errand .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 23]: Perchance , if you have affairs with his Excellency , you will be good enough to convey to him our request . ''
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 24]: The newcomer , a handsome , noble-looking man of thirty-five or thereabouts , laughed with a certain frankness that bespoke an open character .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 4]: `` Traders ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 3]: cried he .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 12]: `` Had you said soldiers I might have better understood you .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 7]: In what commodity do you deal ?
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 8]: Is it aught to eat or drink ?
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 17]: If so , on my soul , your friend gives good warrant of its virtues . ''
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 26]: `` Unhappily our land is too far distant to permit us to produce other than a sample of what our meat and wine can achieve .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 16]: But we have ample stock of rare silks and rich spices of Araby and Gondar .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 41]: If the ladies of this charming city are as fair to behold and as richly adorned as all else we have seen then our journey from Surat to the court of Akbar shall not have been made in vain . ''
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 22]: Mowbray 's easy diction and the distinction of his manner astounded the hearer quite as much as did Roger 's proportions .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 19]: The Persian , a born gentleman , well knew he was talking to his equal of another clime .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 37]: `` You and your wares could not have arrived at better season , '' he said gravely ; `` but I never yet met merchant so unlike a merchant as you and your gigantic companion . ''
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 17]: Walter 's quick intuition told him that here was one who might be a good friend .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 15]: It was important to stand well with him and leave room for no dubiety .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 24]: So , in a few well-chosen sentences , he told how it came about that he and Roger brought a pack-train to Agra .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 19]: The mere mention of Edwards 's name cleared up the mystery so far as his hearer was concerned .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 4]: `` Edwards ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 21]: he cried , `` a fat man , who struts as he walks and coughs loudly to command respect ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 11]: Mowbray admitted that the description fitted his partner sufficiently well .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 13]: `` You know he has been here himself in years past ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 5]: went on the Persian .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 15]: The knowledge he gained then led to the proper selection of our merchandise . ''
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 11]: `` Did he not tell you what befell him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 7]: `` Little of any consequence . ''
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 16]: `` He carried himself so ill that he bred a low repute of your nation .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 23]: He suffered blows from porters , and was thrust out of many places head and shoulders by base peons without seeking satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 13]: Yet he showed some judgment in choosing you two as his agents .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 5]: Name him to none .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 16]: Strive to forget him until you rate him for sending you hither without warning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 9]: No more unpleasing revelation could have been made .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 16]: Walter was fully aware of the difficulties which faced Europeans in India at that date .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 12]: The vain and proud Orientals lost no opportunity of humiliating strangers .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 21]: A cool and resolute bearing was the only sure fence against the insults and petty annoyances offered by minor officials .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 25]: It was , therefore , vexing to the uttermost degree that Edwards had endured contumely and not even prepared them for a hostile reception .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 40]: For the moment , Mowbray felt so disturbed that he was minded to retire to the caravansary to consider his next step , when Sainton , who understood the latter part of the conversation well enough , strode forward .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 12]: `` Where be the peons you spoke of , friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 4]: said he . ''
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 28]: 'T is fine weather , and the exercise you spoke of , if practised on me , will give them a zest for the midday meal . ''
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 11]: This time the stranger laughed as heartily as etiquette permitted .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 17]: `` No , no , '' he cried , `` such minions demand their proper subject .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 23]: Now , do you two come with me and I shall put your business in a fair way towards speedy completion . ''
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 23]: Talking the while , and telling them his name was Sher Afghán , he led them through the garden towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 30]: The deep obeisances of the doorkeepers showed that he was held of great consequence , and none questioned his right to introduce the two Englishmen to the sacred interior .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 55]: They passed through several apartments of exceeding beauty and entered another garden , in which , to the bewilderment of the visitors , who knew what the close seclusion of the zenana implied , they saw several ladies , veiled indeed , but so thinly that anyone close at hand might discern their features .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 23]: Courteously asking them to wait near the exit from the house , their Persian acquaintance quitted them and sought a distant group .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 15]: He salaamed deeply before a richly attired female and pointed towards Mowbray and Sainton .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 34]: Then he explained something to a dignified looking old man , robed in flowing garments of white muslin , whose sharp eyes had noted the advent of the strangers the moment they appeared .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 9]: With this older couple was a slim girl .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 50]: When the others moved slowly across the grass towards the place where Mowbray and Sainton stood , Sher Afghán hung back somewhat and spoke to the girl , who kept studiously away from him , and coyly adjusted her veil so that he might not look into her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 15]: He seemed to plead with her , but his words fell on heedless ears .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 76]: Indeed , ere yet the aged Diwán had conducted Queen Mariam Zamáni , sultana of Akbar and mother of Jahangir , heir to the throne , sufficiently apart from her attendants to permit the strangers to be brought before her -- the rank of the august lady enabling her to dispense with the Mahomedan seclusion of her sex -- Sher Afghán 's gazelle-like companion ran forward and gazed fearlessly at Mowbray , wonderingly at Sainton .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 10]: `` Their skins are not white but red ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 4]: she cried joyously .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 22]: `` Nevertheless one of them must come from the land of Tokay , which is famed for its white elephants . ''
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 16]: Hastily conquering his air of dejection the younger nobleman signed to the Englishmen to approach .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 8]: They obeyed , without haste or awkwardness .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 50]: Grasping their sword hilts in their left hands and doffing their hats with the elaborate courtesy of the age , they stood bareheaded before the elder pair , and certainly the kingdom of James I. had no cause to be ashamed of its latest representatives in the Mogul capital .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 51]: Roger Sainton had not his equal in height , in thickness of bone or strength of sinew , in all the wide empire governed by the most powerful of Indian monarchs , while Walter Mowbray 's splendid physique was in no wise dwarfed by the nearness of his gigantic comrade .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 17]: They were good to look upon , and so the girl found them notwithstanding her jest .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 22]: She herself was beautiful to a degree not often seen even in a land of classic features and exquisitely molded figures .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 42]: Her deep , violet eyes were guarded by long lashes which swept rounded cheeks of ivory tint , brightened by little spots of color which reminded the beholder of the gold and red on the sunny side of a ripe pomegranate .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 33]: Her lips were parted , and her teeth , dazzlingly white , were so regular and large that they appeared to constitute the chief attraction of a singularly mobile and expressive mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 39]: Again she laughed , with a musical cadence that was quaint and fascinating : -- `` May it please your Majesty , '' she said , addressing the Sultana , `` these are not merchants but courtiers . ''
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 21]: `` May it please your Majesty , '' said Walter , instantly , `` we would fain be both . ''
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 9]: His apt retort in high-flown Persian was unexpected .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 17]: His eyes encountered those of the girl , and they exchanged a glance of quick intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 28]: She was pleased with him , and he offered her the silent homage which every young man of proper spirit pays to a beautiful and sprightly woman .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 12]: Her brilliant orbs said : `` I will befriend you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 16]: In the same language he answered : `` You are peerless among your sex . ''
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 45]: And such was the manner of the meeting between Walter Mowbray , son of him who fell on board the _ San José _ , and Nur Mahal , the baby girl who was saved from death in the Khaibar Pass twenty years earlier .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 34]: It was a meeting not devoid of present interest , and of great future import , yet it is probable that if Nellie Roe had witnessed it she might have been greatly displeased .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 25]: CHAPTER VII `` She 's beautiful , and therefore to be woo 'd ; She 's a woman , therefore to be won . ''
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 24]: _ Shakespeare _ , `` King Henry VI , '' Part I. Nur Mahal was a Persian , not a native of India .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 11]: In her wondrous face the Occident blended with the Orient .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 51]: Its contour , its creamy smoothness , the high forehead and delicately firm chin were of the West , and the East gave her those neatly coiled tresses of raven hue , those deeply pencilled eyebrows , beneath whose curved arches flashed , like twin stars , her marvelous eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 28]: Her supple body was robed in a _ sari _ of soft , deep yellow silk , bordered with a device of fine needlework studded with gems .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 32]: It draped her closely , in flowing lines , from waist to feet , and a fold was carried over her right shoulder to be held gracefully scarfwise in one hand .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 40]: An exquisite plum colored silk vest , encrusted with gold embroidery , covered her finely molded bust , revealing yet modestly shielding each line and flexure of a form which might have served Pygmalion as the model of Galatea .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 19]: On her forehead sparkled a splendid jewel , an emerald surrounded by diamonds set _ en étoile _ .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 23]: Around her swanlike throat was clasped a necklace of uncut emeralds , strung , at intervals , between rows of seed pearls .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 6]: She wore no other ornament .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 30]: Her tiny feet were encased in white silk slippers , and , an unusual sight in the East , their open bands revealed woven stockings of the same material .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 26]: But the daughter of the Persian refugee who had risen to such high place in Akbar 's court was bound neither by convention nor fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 47]: She fearlessly unveiled when she thought fit , and she taught the ladies of Agra to wear not only the bodice and the inner skirt but also a species of corset , whilst to her genius was due the wonderful perfume known as attar of roses .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 33]: Again , although more than twenty years of age at that time , she was unmarried , an amazing thing in itself when the social customs of Hindustan were taken into account .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 32]: Suddenly brought face to face with such a divinity , it was no small credit to Walter Mowbray that he kept his wits sufficiently to turn her laughing comment to advantage .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 8]: The Sultana was graciously pleased to smile .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 22]: `` If your wares comport with your manners , '' she said , `` you will be welcome at the palace .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 18]: We hold a bazaar there to-morrow , and novelties in merchandise are always acceptable on such occasions .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 35]: Sher Afghán , '' she continued , `` see that the strangers are properly admitted to the Hall of Private Audience at the first hour appointed for those who bring articles for sale . ''
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 27]: The young nobleman bowed , as did Mowbray and Sainton , though the latter knew but little of the high-flown Persian in which the Sultana spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 29]: Nur Mahal , who appeared to be on terms of great familiarity with her august visitor , whispered something to Queen Mariam which made the good lady laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 37]: Obviously , the comment had reference to Roger , and that worthy blushed , for a woman 's eyes could pierce his tough hide readily , there being no weapon to equal them known to mankind .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 23]: `` She 's a bonny lass , yon , '' he murmured to Walter , `` and she has uncommonly high spirits .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 46]: I never kent afore why a man should make a fool of himself for a woman , but now that I have seen one who is half an angel I am beginning to have a dim notion of the madness which seizes some folk . ''
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 13]: `` There are others , but why only half an angel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 16]: asked Mowbray with a smile , for the Queen had turned to address the Diwán .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 9]: `` Because that is all we have seen .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 9]: The hidden half is the devil in her .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 21]: Mark me , Walter , there will be heads cracked in plenty before that fancy wench stops plaguing mankind . ''
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 35]: Courtesy was urging Sher Afghán to give some directions to the wanderers he had so greatly befriended , but inclination , always a willing steed , dragged him to the side of Nur Mahal .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 18]: `` I came to ask what you needed most for the bazaar , '' he said anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 13]: `` Naught that you can bestow , '' was the curt reply .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 10]: `` Sweet one , your words chill my heart .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 20]: 'T is but a week since your father -- '' She stamped a foot imperiously and clenched her hands .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 32]: `` I am not one of those to be dealt with as others choose , '' she cried , though modulating her voice lest it should reach the Queen 's ears .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 7]: `` Why do you pester me ?
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 7]: Your tall sheepskin cap affrights me .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 10]: Take it and your ungainly presence to far-off Burdwán .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 8]: I mean to abide in Agra . ''
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 6]: He bent low before her .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 40]: `` A blow from the hand of my beloved is sweet as a grape from the hand of another , '' he said , conscious , perhaps , of the manifest injustice of the attack on his personal appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 36]: Physically , he was a worthy mate even for such a goddess , and he had already won great renown in India by his prowess in the field and his skill in all manly exercises .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 27]: `` Gladly would I bestow on you a whole bunch of such grapes , '' she said , turning to follow the Sultana and her father .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 18]: But a laughing shout from the interior of the house caused all eyes to seek its explanation .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 6]: `` Well met , mother !
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 17]: Have you come , like me , to wring another lakh out of the Diwán ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 32]: A young man , tall and well built and of pleasing aspect , notable for his broad chest and long arms , and attired in sumptuous garments , entered the garden .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 24]: His words would have revealed his identity to Walter and Sainton had they not met him , two years earlier , at Surat .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 9]: This was Prince Jahangir , the heir apparent .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 61]: His complexion was a ruddy nut brown , his eyes , if somewhat closely set , were strangely keen and piercing , and it was a peculiar and noticeable fact that he wore small gold earrings , in token of bondage to the great saint Sheikh Salem , to whose intercession , it was said , he owed his birth .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 9]: Jahangir did not trouble to conceal his emotions .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 39]: His joyous glance , evoked more by the sight of Nur Mahal , it is to be feared , than by the unexpected presence of the Sultana , changed instantly to a scowl when he saw Sher Afghán .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 19]: Moreover , he discovered the presence of the Englishmen , and he affected a tone of surprised displeasure .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 7]: `` How now , Diwán ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 13]: `` Do you admit strangers to the privacy of your zenana ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 7]: `` These are merchants from Ahmedabad .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 24]: The Queen has commanded them to show their wares at the palace , '' was the courteous reply of the aged Prime Minister .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 4]: Jahangir smiled contemptuously .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 8]: The foreigners in no wise disturbed him .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 18]: He knew quite well that his insult had reached the one man for whom it was intended .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 10]: Sher Afghán 's pale face grew dark with anger .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 33]: `` Oh , it is matterless , '' said the Prince , flippantly , and he addressed Nur Mahal with a ready smile that utterly banished the anger from his expressive features .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 16]: `` Fair lady , '' he said , `` I have brought you a present .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 12]: I know your fondness for all that is rare and beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 10]: See if my gift will earn your approval . ''
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 33]: He clapped his hands , and a servant came , carrying a small gilded perch to which clung two snow-white pigeons , each fastened to the crossbar by a short silver chain .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 8]: Nur Mahal uttered a cry of pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 10]: She ran to meet the man with arms outstretched .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 12]: `` They are quite tame , '' said the gratified Prince .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 18]: `` After a little while they will come at your call and perch on your wrist . ''
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 9]: She took the birds and caressed them softly .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 40]: Suddenly , yielding to impulse , she unfastened a chain , and the pigeon , finding itself at liberty , darted up into the air and flew around in rapid circles , crying loudly to its mate the while .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 7]: `` How did that happen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 3]: demanded Jahangir .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 12]: `` Thus , '' she answered , freeing the second bird .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 11]: `` But they are unused to the garden as yet .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 6]: You have lost them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 9]: `` Sooner that than take away their freedom .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 12]: My heart weeps for all who are destined to captivity . ''
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 15]: `` Then you weep for me , as I am truly your captive . ''
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 24]: `` Ah , my bondage would be pleasant , and , like the birds , you could fly away when you chose . ''
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 24]: At that instant one of the pigeons dropped with angelic flutterings , and poised itself on the perch which the girl still held .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 19]: The other , timidly daring , followed its mate 's example , but settled on the same side .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 4]: `` See ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 4]: cried Jahangir excitedly .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 6]: `` The choice is made .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 8]: They come back to their fetters ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 20]: `` Your Highness will observe that there are two to dispute the vacant place , '' interposed Sher Afghán .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 23]: The icy distinctness of his words showed that the significance of the little comedy played by Nur Mahal had not escaped him .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 4]: The girl pouted .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 5]: Jahangir wheeled about fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 11]: A quarrel was imminent , but Queen Mariam stopped it .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 28]: `` Sher Afghán , '' she said , `` you , who are a soldier , should not take much interest in this idle playing with doves .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 24]: As I return soon to the palace , go with the strangers and let them exhibit their wares there after the midday meal .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 13]: That will better suit my convenience than the customary hour to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 14]: Bowing silently , the Persian motioned to Mowbray and Sainton to follow him .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 34]: He spoke no word , but a tumult raged within , and , at the gate , when a servant was slow in opening it , he felled the man with a blow .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 49]: Instantly regretting the deed he gave the fellow a gold mohur , but his face was tense and his eyes blazed as he mounted his horse and rode silently with the two Englishmen through the midst of the gay retinue which had escorted Prince Jahangir from the palace .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 26]: Guessing with fair accuracy the hidden meaning of the scene just enacted , Mowbray did not intrude on the sorrowful thoughts of his Persian friend .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 15]: `` We are in luck 's way , Roger , '' he said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 16]: `` We have escaped the Diwán and won the door of the Queen 's apartments .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 27]: If the good lady be as ready to pay as she is to buy , this bazaar to-morrow should ease us of all our goods . ''
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 12]: `` In which event we shall turn our faces westward ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 3]: asked Sainton .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 3]: `` Assuredly .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 16]: We must settle with Edwards , else I would take the river to Calcutta . ''
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 3]: `` Ecod !
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 25]: From the manner in which you gazed at that hoity-toity lass in yellow silk I thought you were minded to dally in Agra . ''
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 9]: For some subtle reason the remark nettled Mowbray .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 43]: `` We have already met two who are willing to come to blows about her , '' said he , tartly , `` but I fail to see why you should hold me capable of the folly of making a third . ''
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 13]: `` Nay , nay , '' said Sainton , with irritating composure .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 51]: `` I credit thee with wisdom beyond thy years , but if Solomon , who had three thousand wives , could go daft about yet an extra woman , there is small cause why thou , who hast no wife at all , shouldst not be bitten by the craze .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 63]: I warrant you Prince Jahangir hath a bevy of beauties in his private abode , and this chuck who hangs his head so dolefully may have half a score or more waiting his beck and nod at home , yet they both are keen to fall to with sword and dagger to dispute the possession of the quean we have just quitted .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 12]: ` Garden of Heart 's Delight , ' i ' faith !
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 17]: The flower they all seek there is of a kind that stings in the plucking . ''
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 22]: Mowbray , conscious that the dethronement of Nellie Roe in his mind was but momentary , regained his normal good humor .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 15]: `` You are in a mood for preaching this morning , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 35]: `` Now , had your tongue run so smoothly when the Sultana was present , you might have won her favor , as all the women have an eye for you , Roger . ''
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 12]: `` A murrain on the barbarous words that trip my speech !
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 45]: I could talk to her Majesty in honest Yorkshire , and I can make some headway in the language of the common folk hereabout , but when it comes to your pretty poesy of Shiraz I am perforce dumb as a Whitby mussel . ''
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 29]: Here , Sher Afghán , rousing himself from a mournful reverie , began to hum a verse of a well-known Persian love song : -- `` O love !
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 18]: for you I could die ; 'T is death from your presence to fly ; O love !
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 6]: will the pain never end ?
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 9]: Will our hearts ne'er in unison blend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 54]: They were crossing the bridge of boats at the moment , and the singer , more occupied with his thoughts than with external events , did not notice that a laden camel , advancing down the center of the swaying roadway , gave the party little enough room to pass on one side .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 8]: Walter drew his attention to the fact .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 39]: The Persian , disdainful of the lower orders as were all of his class , spurred his mettlesome Arab forward , caught the lounging _ unt _ by the halter and imperiously swung the beast to one side .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 27]: A shriek rang out wildly from behind the camel , whose load of firewood had struck a native woman walking on the side of the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 5]: She staggered and fell .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 14]: The infant she carried was jerked out of her arms into the river .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 46]: Walter , who saw what had happened , sprang from his horse , jumped into the water , which was deep enough at that point to drown a man , and caught the little naked child as it rose , struggling and gasping for breath .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 15]: With a vigorous stroke or two he reached the side of the nearest pontoon .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 28]: Roger leaned over , seized the collar of his friend 's jacket , and lifted him and the baby back to the firmer footing of the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 49]: The distraught mother flung herself at Mowbray 's feet and wound her arms around his ankles , thereby embarrassing him greatly , as he was soaked from head to foot , and the dense crowd which gathered with extraordinary speed threatened to block the bridge for an hour .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 51]: Sher Afghán , who was divided between wonder that a man should take so much trouble to rescue a wretched infant and amazement at Roger 's feat of strength , for Sainton had lifted Walter clean over the rails of the bridge with one hand , now awoke to actualities .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 34]: He beat a path through the gaping mob , extricated Mowbray from the extravagant gratitude of the Hindu woman , and quickly led the two Englishmen to the open road beyond the river .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 13]: `` Did you not know that the Jumna swarms with crocodiles ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 18]: he asked , when they were all mounted again , and riding onward at a sharp pace .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' said Walter .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 29]: `` Then , by the tomb of the Prophet , you did that which I would not have done for the sake of any brat in Agra . ''
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 21]: `` I gave no thought to it , or perchance I should have hesitated , '' was the modest reply .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 7]: The incident served one good purpose .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 56]: It effectually banished Sher Afghán 's love vapors , and he exerted himself so well in behalf of his new acquaintances that they and their packs -LRB- Walter having donned dry clothing -RRB- were admitted to the palace at the appointed hour , and marshaled past countless officials who would otherwise have barred their path .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 20]: The great fortress , in the center of which lay the royal apartments , was a city in itself .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 27]: Its frowning walls of dark red sandstone , sixty feet in height and defended by many a tower and machicolated battlement , surrounded a low hill .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 68]: This was crowned by the famous Moti Musjid , or Pearl Mosque , an edifice as celebrated to-day for its perfect architectural proportions and refined taste in embellishment as it was when the Great Mogul , during his daily orisons , occupied the small floor slab nearest to the northwest , and , behind him , six hundred and forty-nine nobles bent in devout homage towards Mecca .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 20]: The Hall of Public Audience , a splendid structure , was separated from the mosque by a large garden .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 36]: Near this rallying ground for all having business with the court stood the smaller but even more impressive Hall of Private Audience , to which there was direct access from the Emperor 's personal apartments .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 27]: The Zenana , marked by its exquisite Jasmine Tower , containing the Sultana 's boudoir and giving a far-spread view across the Jumna , lay beyond .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 56]: These buildings , and many another , constructed almost exclusively of white marble and decorated with scrollwork festoons of flowers wrought wholly in precious stones , shone in the rays of the afternoon sun as the Englishmen passed through the somber depths of the great City Gate and entered the open space surrounding the palace .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 12]: That they were the cynosure of many eyes goes without saying .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 7]: But here , curiosity was restrained .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 21]: The grave courtesy of an Eastern court was blended with the iron discipline enforced by a powerful ruler like Akbar .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 7]: `` The King 's order ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 14]: said Sher Afghán , and before the King 's order every head bent .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 55]: Thus , avoiding the crowd which thronged the path leading to the spacious Hall of Public Audience , where the Emperor in person was then dispensing justice with that even-handed promptitude which won him the respect of all his subjects irrespective of class or creed , Sher Afghán led them to a secluded stairway .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 15]: Certain formalities needed fulfilment before the strangers or their goods were allowed to ascend .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 31]: Guards with drawn swords stood there , and even Sher Afghán himself was compelled to satisfy the high-pitched questions of a gorgeously robed eunuch ere sanction was given to advance .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 54]: Mowbray and Sainton , eager to witness the successful end of their twelve hundred miles ' journey , were more concerned , doubtless , to display their silks and spices , their rich store of Arabian and Persian goods , than to note the marvels in sculptured stone with which they were encircled .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 39]: A mosaic pavement worth a monarch 's ransom was to them only a fine space for opening out bales of cloth cunningly bedizened with gold thread , whilst a balcony of carved marble served excellently as a counter .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 16]: At last , when all was ready , a messenger was despatched to the Sultana .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 15]: Queen Mariam came promptly , and with her were many ladies of the court .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 39]: They were all veiled , as was the strict rule when the Emperor was near at hand , but among them Sher Afghán , and perhaps Mowbray , looked in vain for the sylph-like form of Nur Mahal .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 6]: The scrutiny commenced at once .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 24]: `` Shopping '' was as dear to the heart of those Eastern dames as to their sisters of other climes and modern days .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 49]: The babble of tongues waxed eloquent , and the two traders , comparatively new as they were to the occupation , saw with gratification that the Sultana was as loud in her appreciation of the novelties spread before her eyes as was the youngest lady in her train .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 115]: All was going well ; Queen Mariam had asked the value of the whole consignment , and Mowbray , with some trepidation , had added half a lakh to the lakh of rupees with which he would be well content -- expecting , indeed , to obtain no more than the latter sum at the close of the bargaining -- when a sudden hush , a drawing together of the women , a protest suspended in its utterance by the Sultana herself , announced that the elderly man dressed solely in white muslin , who entered the hall from a raised veranda at the further end , could be none other than the Emperor .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 9]: His appearance was at once engaging and dignified .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 15]: Not so tall as his eldest son , he was even broader in build .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 36]: Possessed of prodigious muscular strength , due to the great breadth of his chest and his long , sinewy arms and hands , Akbar looked a ruler of men both in physical and intellectual properties .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 21]: His eyes were full and penetrating , with eyebrows that met in a straight line over his well shaped nose .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 16]: His face , a ruddy brown in color , was firm yet kindly in expression .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 30]: His forehead was high and open , and in the front folds of his white turban lay a single large ruby in which the sun kindled a fiery glare .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 10]: He surveyed the scene in silence for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 22]: Then , as his glance dwelt on Sainton , a somewhat prepossessed smile gave place to a look of genuine surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 30]: He turned and uttered some comment to one behind , and , as he strode forward , they saw that he was accompanied by the Prime Minister , Itimad-ud-Daula .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 41]: Every man present , save the armed guards and the two Englishmen , dropped to his knees and bent his forehead to the ground , but Mowbray and Roger , not accustomed to genuflection , contented themselves with bowing deeply .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 8]: The Emperor was in no wise offended .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 9]: He smiled again , showing his teeth plainly .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 24]: `` They told me you were a big man , '' he said to Sainton , `` but are you a strong one ?
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 16]: Big men are oft like long-backed horses -- they bend when the strain comes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 21]: Luckily , Roger understood him , and , though his Hindustani was rude , be sure it never lacked point .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 24]: `` I do not think , '' he said , `` that my back is too long for my height , your Majesty .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 31]: Be that as it may , they tell me there is no better judge of strength , whether of man or horse , than your Majesty in all India . ''
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 14]: `` By the shade of Nizam-ud-din , this giant is no fool ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 13]: cried Akbar , whose voice , though loud , was very pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 17]: `` Were I younger I would test thee , Elephant , but that day is past .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 16]: Tell me , couldst thou shear two tigers ' heads with a single stroke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 13]: `` Yes , if your Majesty first tied both heads together . ''
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 12]: `` Allah , here is a spark after my own heart !
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 6]: What is thy name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 11]: `` Roger Sainton , may it please your Majesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 4]: `` Raja Sainton !
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 19]: If you be of noble rank why do you come hither in the guise of a trader ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 29]: Sainton was puzzled , as Akbar 's elegant diction rendered the mistake difficult to understand , so Mowbray , in a few well-chosen words , set things right .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 20]: The Emperor gave a quick glance at Walter , and seemed instantly to appreciate the relation between the two .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 19]: But he addressed himself again to Roger : -- `` You have traveled far , and are welcome .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 13]: To-day I am busy , or I would discourse with you further .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 17]: Be here to-morrow , two hours before sunset , and we shall give each other entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 13]: Meanwhile , what can I do for you and your friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 32]: Sainton , filled with the sense of _ camaraderie _ which makes men of kindred sympathies quickly known to each other , realized that Akbar would not resent a little familiarity .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 43]: `` Sir , '' he said , `` if you buy our goods and give us good cheer we shall do that which those in your court ought to do every day , but fail therein most scandalously , I fear . ''
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 7]: `` And what is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 13]: `` We shall pray to God for your health and happiness . ''
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 7]: Akbar grasped him by the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 11]: `` List , all of you , '' he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 9]: `` Here is our Elephant showing his wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 42]: By the Prophet 's beard , I regret , for once , that there is peace in our dominions , else you and I , Elephant , should go to the war ere ever you sailed away to your distant land .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 11]: But we shall find sport , or my wit fails .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 33]: You , sir , '' he went on , speaking to Mowbray , `` shall tell us something of the ways of your country when the Elephant and I have wearied ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 13]: Meanwhile , the Sultana will buy your wares at your own rates .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 19]: I judge as much by the cackle of women 's voices I heard as I came hither . ''
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 23]: By way of a joke he gave Sainton 's shoulder a farewell squeeze that would have dislocated many a man 's bones .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 25]: Roger , pretending he had not felt it , stooped and picked up a small brass jar which he grasped around its narrow neck .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 17]: `` Let me give your Majesty a reminder of to-morrow 's meeting , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 17]: The Emperor , seeing more in the words than their mere purport , took the jar .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 11]: Roger had bent the brass cylinder into a double fold .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 12]: `` Thanks , friend , '' he said , quietly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 23]: 'T is well it was not my neck which received that grip , else there would be a new ruler in India .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 7]: And , by the Koran ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 16]: he added under his breath , `` I am minded now of another matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 19]: He looked around until he caught sight of Sher Afghán , standing somewhat apart from the listening crowd .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 20]: `` My young friend , '' cried he , `` I have been discussing you with my trusted Diwán .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 16]: He agrees with me that you should provide his beautiful daughter with a careful husband .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 4]: Marry her forthwith !
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 8]: To-night , if you be so minded !
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 21]: And lest anyone should dispute the prize with you take a troop of horse to escort you to Burdwán . ''
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 36]: Bombs were hardly known in India at that period , but the explosion of a live shell in the midst of the company would have created a sensation little more profound than Akbar 's words .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 15]: Nur Mahal , that fiery beauty , to be wed forthwith to Sher Afghán !
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 6]: What would Prince Jahangir say ?
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 19]: CHAPTER VIII `` The trenchant blade , Toledo trusty , For want of fighting had grown rusty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 14]: _ Butler 's _ `` Hudibras , '' Part I , Canto I .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 12]: Yet all knew it mattered not a jot what Jahangir said .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 53]: The Diwán had given his consent , the Emperor his approval , and it was common knowledge that both were acting for the welfare of the state in putting an effectual stop to the infatuation of the heir apparent for a girl with whom a recognized alliance was impolitic if not impossible .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 31]: But Queen Mariam , all of a tremble by reason of her fear lest Jahangir 's madness should lead him to excess , ventured to utter a word of protest .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 17]: `` My Lord , '' she said , `` this decision hath been taken suddenly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 7]: `` Do you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 5]: asked Akbar , pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 5]: His composure disconcerted her .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 14]: Nevertheless , love for her eldest born and favorite son gave her strength .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 15]: `` I would force no maid to wed where her heart is not set .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 7]: It oft leads to evil . ''
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 11]: he answered , `` you are becoming an old woman .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 11]: Were I one also I might think like you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 12]: The kindly tone of his words deprived them of their sting .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 38]: When he clenched an argument in such wise Akbar had a habit of stroking a large wart on the left side of his nose , a slight disfigurement which astrologers assured him was a most propitious sign .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 12]: Gently rubbing the wart now he turned again towards Sher Afghán .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 8]: `` Has delight rendered thee dumb ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 5]: he growled good humoredly .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 15]: `` Not so , O King of Kings , '' cried the young Persian .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 11]: `` Fearing that my ears betrayed me I was silent .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 9]: When your Majesty speaks all tongues are stilled .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 15]: I have but two possessions which I cherish , my sword and my honor .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 29]: The one has always been and will ever be at your Majesty 's disposal ; the other I fly to place at the feet of Nur Mahal . ''
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 19]: By this fearless utterance , Sher Afghán accepted the Emperor 's command and flung defiance to all others .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 6]: Salaaming deeply , he withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 56]: In the hush which had fallen on the assembly they heard him rush down the outer stairs , and , an instant later , the clatter of his Arab 's hoofs as he rode towards the gate showed that the wedding ceremony would not be delayed by any dilatoriness on the part of the bridegroom .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 3]: Akbar vanished .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 37]: The Diwán , who had not taken any overt part in the scene , followed him , and the Sultana , without casting another glance at the brave array of merchandise , withdrew with her retinue .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 54]: Mowbray and Sainton were left gazing blankly at each other , but an official , knowing better than they the domestic trouble which was brewing in the royal household , advised them to repack their goods , as , in his opinion , the bazaar projected for the morrow would certainly be abandoned .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 30]: `` I thought for sure yon sloe-eyed wench would bring us no luck , '' muttered Roger when he heard Mowbray bidding their servants load up their mules again .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 18]: `` My mother always advised me to wed a homely wife if I wanted to be happy .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 26]: Not that she was ill-looking herself , but I have heard her say that my father never had spirit enough to quarrel with anybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 41]: `` On my word , Roger , '' laughed Walter , smothering his own annoyance at the turn taken by events , `` you look as glum as Lot 's wife when she lost the use of her feet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 6]: `` Who would n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 3]: demanded Sainton .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 31]: `` We had the silver as good as in our breeches pockets , when some imp of mischief set the King to scratch his nose and talk about marriage . ''
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 7]: `` All is not lost yet .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 19]: I trust to your wit to make his Majesty realize to-morrow in what fashion he spoiled our market .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 18]: At the worst , we retain our goods , and still can trade in the bazaar . ''
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 51]: Two journeys through the tortuous streets of the city , joined to the labor of unpacking and packing their bales at the palace , had occupied so much of the short November afternoon that the sun was setting with the rapidity peculiar to the tropics ere they reached the caravansary .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 26]: The smoke of many fires clung to the ground , spreading over the streets and open spaces a hazy pall some ten feet in height .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 41]: Beneath , all was murky and dim ; above , the tops of trees and the upper stories of houses were sharply silhouetted against the deep crimson-blue of the sky , whilst the stars were already twinkling in myriads overhead .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 15]: This coverlet of smoke creeps nightly over every Indian town in the cold weather .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 55]: It is disagreeable to the eyes and nose if not to the artistic senses , and the haze is ofttimes so dense during the hours before midnight that , in the crowded bazaar , the range of vision becomes lessened and even familiar objects can not be recognized until they are close at hand .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 22]: The phenomenon was familiar enough to the two travelers not to excite their notice on this occasion save in one respect .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 24]: It was essential that heed should be given to the fondness of native servants for appropriating articles which did not belong to them .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 36]: Naught could be easier than for a pack animal to be slyly driven into a by-path , whence it would never return , whilst search for it and its valuable burden would be time wasted .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 45]: So now , as on every other night when they chanced to be belated , Mowbray and Sainton kept a sharp eye on their train , and stood at the gate of the caravansary until each mule and bullock had filed within its portals .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 41]: They were engaged in this task when the chant of palki-bearers and the glare of torches lighting up the roadway apprised them that some person of importance was being carried toward Agra from the direction of Delhi and the north .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 36]: The carriers were singing cheerfully , announcing in rhyme the close of a long march , and setting forth the joys of rice and _ ghi _ at the end of the day 's toil .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 37]: But the verse stopped suddenly , and the rapid shuffle of naked feet through the dust gave place to the objurgations of the torch-bearers addressed to the muleteers and bullock tenders of the Englishmen 's cortège .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 29]: Native servants curse each other fluently on the slightest provocation , so a lively exchange of compliments affecting the paternity and ancestry of both parties instantly broke out .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 8]: In reality , nothing could be done .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 61]: The mules and bullocks , eager as their drivers to have finished with the day 's work , were crowding into the caravansary , and the _ palki _ , or litter , could not pass for a minute or so unless the bearers quitted the beaten track and made a détour behind the mud hovels which faced the rest-house .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 18]: Glad of a moment 's respite the coolies preferred to halt , and wag their tongues scandalously .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 12]: Walter , somewhat amused by the scene , did not interfere .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 27]: There was only one _ palki _ , but the number of retainers and loaded ponies behind showed that the traveler was some one of consequence .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 45]: The occupant of the litter , evidently wondering what caused the commotion , drew apart the curtains on the side opposite to that on which Mowbray was standing , Sainton , urging on the rearmost of their train , being at some little distance .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 35]: A Pathan torch-bearer approached the _ palki _ , and , as luck would have it , Roger came to Mowbray at that moment to tell him that his count tallied with their reckoning .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 16]: Something said by the Pathan caused his employer to withdraw the second set of curtains .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 23]: Hence , the light of the torch illumined the interior of the litter and revealed most clearly the identity of its tenant .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 24]: Walter would scarce have believed his eyes had not Roger muttered : -- '' ` Fore God , 't is Dom Geronimo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 10]: `` He and no other , '' whispered Walter .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 29]: `` I knew there were Jesuits in Agra , but they are well spoken of , and I never dreamed that this wretch was numbered among them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 11]: `` He knows us , too , '' growled Sainton .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 16]: `` Why should we not requite him for the ill he would have done us .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 30]: ` Return good for evil , ' saith the maxim , and ` twill be a good deed to let some of the bad blood out of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 5]: `` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 8]: It would ruin our cause with Akbar .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 24]: Though he is our enemy , he is less able to work us harm in this heathen land than in our own country .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 4]: Let him pass .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 18]: I vow he takes us for malign spirits , come back to earth to vex him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 33]: Certainly the aspect of Dom Geronimo 's face as the _ palki _ moved on and his carriers resumed their song was that of a man who gazed at a threatening vision .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 24]: Incredulity blended with fear at first , to be succeeded by a glance of utmost malevolence as his shocked senses resumed their sway .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 12]: That he recognized the two friends was not to be doubted .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 49]: Sainton 's gigantic stature alone marked him out from other men , and , at that season of the year , their garb did not differ materially from the clothes they wore when the Jesuit left them to their fate on board the Spanish vessel in the Thames .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 25]: He closed the curtains of his _ palki _ with an angry gesture , as though the sight of them was displeasing to him .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 22]: Yet Dom Geronimo would have been a lucky man in that hour had he blotted them from his memory as well .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 35]: Nevertheless , his contemptuous action served to hide from him the fact that Roger reached out a long arm and detained a fellow who was hastening in the rear of the Jesuit 's retainers .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 7]: `` Whence comes thy master ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 4]: he said gruffly .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 24]: `` From Lahore , sahib , '' was the stuttering reply , for the man was frightened by the size of his questioner .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 8]: `` And whither is he bound ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 16]: `` To the court of the mighty Akbar , O protector of the poor . ''
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 10]: `` Hath he been long in these parts ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 7]: `` I know not , huzoor .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 19]: I am a poor man -- '' `` Treat him easily , Roger , '' put in Walter .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 13]: `` See now , brother , here is a rupee for thee .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 7]: How is thy master known ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 27]: `` He is called the Fire-Father , '' answered the native , reassured by the sight of the money and the relaxation of Roger 's grip .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 41]: `` They say he earned the name from the Emperor himself , because once , when a _ moullah _ disputed with him , the black-robed one challenged the _ moullah _ to enter with him into a raging fire .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 18]: The one would carry the Koran and the other a Book by which he sets great store .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 23]: Then , he said , it would readily be seen whether Mahomet or He whom he calls Christ were the more powerful .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 19]: But the _ moullah _ hung back , and the Emperor laughed , I have been told . ''
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 22]: `` Aye , '' said Roger in English , `` he has faith enough and to spare , I warrant ye .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 15]: Anyone who believes that Spain can win her way in England will believe owt .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 18]: And as for fire , God wot , he hath the stomach of a salamander for it .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 39]: Now , had I been the _ moullah _ , I would have bid him go first into the flames , when , an he survived the ordeal , Mahmoud should be scouted as a rank impostor . ''
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 32]: They could obtain little further information from the servant so they bade him hasten after his master , and , to still his tongue , Walter gave him another silver coin .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 51]: Though the presence of Dom Geronimo in Agra was an omen of bad fortune , they agreed , in converse over a meal of which they were much in need , that his animosity would be exerted in vain if they maintained the good relations already established with the Emperor .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 8]: Akbar was renowned for his religious tolerance .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 25]: The tale told by the native was one of many which revealed this generous trait in a ruler deservedly entitled `` the Great . ''
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 29]: The Jesuits , coming to India in the wake of the Portuguese , were already well established in Agra , where they were then building a splendid church .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 43]: They and the Capuchins , composed , for the most part , of learned and truly pious men , not only commanded respect by their discretion and Christian meekness , but won the admiration of the educated classes by their scientific knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 21]: It was probable that the religious zeal of a fanatic like Dom Geronimo would be restrained by his wiser brethren .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 44]: His intemperate language had earned him a typical _ soubriquet _ , which stood out in curious contrast to the charity of the doctrines preached by eminent missionaries like Father Joseph d'Acosta , a Portuguese , and Father Henri Busée , a Fleming .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 45]: `` I have heard , '' said Mowbray , expounding some such theory to Roger , `` that the Emperor once became impatient at the reproaches of the _ moullahs _ , who were ever denying him the use of certain meats and wines .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 30]: ` If these things are forbidden by the Koran , ' said he , ` according to what religion can a man eat and drink as he likes ? '
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 14]: ` That is the teaching of the Christians alone , ' said they .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 12]: ` Then let us all turn Christians , ' said Akbar .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 20]: ` Let tailors convert our loose garments into closer fitting coats , and fashion our turbans into hats . '
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 27]: He frightened them , and they all declared that , however it might be for common men , the Koran did not affect the sovereign . ''
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 33]: `` Be that as it may , '' said Sainton , `` and the tale is not unlike some in vogue about our own Jamie , I am a believer in portents .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 23]: Here we are in Agra , and not a whole day before we run up against a girl and a black robe .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 36]: In London -- '' `` You will anger me , Roger , '' cried Walter in sudden heat , `` if you speak thus of Nellie Roe and Nur Mahal in the same breath . ''
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 24]: `` Ecod , you flare up in the twinkling of a quart pot , the sheer name of which gives me a thirst .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 4]: What the devil !
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 15]: has it not a queer semblance to magic , to say the least ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 59]: Mowbray grudgingly admitted so much , but their discussion was interrupted by the arrival of a messenger who , on behalf of Sher Afghán , apologized very handsomely for his master 's apparent rudeness in leaving them so hastily at the palace , and invited them to the wedding ceremony that night at the residence of the Diwán .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 28]: `` Here is a spark in a hurry to light a bonfire , '' cried Roger when he disentangled the request from a maze of compliments . ''
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 13]: 'T was the Emperor 's command , '' said Mowbray , dubiously .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 7]: `` I suppose we must go .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 19]: He befriended us greatly , though I hold it the wiser thing to send a civil excuse . ''
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 19]: He rose to bid their servants prepare their best attire , and Roger eyed him with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 11]: `` Aye , aye , '' he murmured to himself .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 19]: `` Everything goes the same old gait , as the man said when he tried a second wife .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 9]: Here we are , off to the feasting .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 4]: Thank the Lord !
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 20]: if there be fighting to follow I shall not be snared this time like an owl in daylight . ''
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 43]: Indeed , the first visible indications of any unusual event in progress , when they crossed the bridge of boats before gaining the pavilion in the Garden of Heart 's Delight , savored far more of a campaign than of a wedding .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 15]: There were guards there , mounted and on foot , who challenged all comers .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 26]: The Englishmen had taken the precaution to detain Sher Afghán 's messenger , and he was useful now in preserving them from questioning and delay .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 14]: Clearly , the Persian warrior obeyed his master 's behests to the letter .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 28]: He not only knew the importance of speedy fulfilment of an order , but he did not disdain to use all requisite means to carry it out .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 35]: Outside the gates stood a troop of horse , the stalwart _ sowars _ being either Rajputs or Punjabi Mahomedans , as both of these warrior races found favor at the court of Akbar .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 46]: The transient gleams of flitting lanterns fell on their accouterments , and revealed the presence of several litters , destined , the young men thought , for the comfortable conveyance of Nur Mahal and her attendant women to the bridegroom 's far-off domain at Burdwán .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 10]: Within the peaceful garden a different spectacle presented itself .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 20]: The Diwán 's vast household had used every effort to make a brave display notwithstanding the short notice given .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 36]: A myriad little lamps festooned the trees or bordered the ornamental waters and flower-beds , whilst the main avenue from the gate to the house was brightened by Chinese lanterns and carpeted with rose leaves .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 37]: The guests were conducted , by a new way , to yet another portion of the magnificent garden , and here they were suddenly introduced to a spectacle which held them spellbound for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 26]: In the midst of a green plot was an artificial lake , square , and protected by a small and beautifully carved white marble balustrade .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 30]: From each side ran a causeway to a circular island in the center , its surface almost wholly occupied by an exquisite marble _ baraduri _ , or summer-house .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 15]: The delicate fantasy of the structure might have been designed by some Florentine artist .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 56]: Inlaid with jasper , carnelian and agate , it rose with superb grace from the setting of the dreamy lake , whilst the causeways of dark red sandstone enhanced its pearl-like sheen in the rays of the innumerable rows of tiny oil lamps which ran along every cornice and bedecked each tier of the plinth .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 53]: Fountains played in the lake itself , and the shimmering waters reflected now the starry gleams of the lights , and again the solemn shadows of a row of tall cypress trees , standing in stately order in the background and silhouetted against the unimaginable blue of an Eastern sky by night .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 17]: In the _ baraduri _ a band of native musicians were squatted on a rich carpet .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 46]: They made a deafening row with _ sitar _ and _ daf-thakri _ , _ murchang _ and _ mirdang _ , instruments with sounds as barbarous as their names , but capable , perhaps , of soul-stirring music to ears tuned to their torture .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 50]: Near them , covered with heavy cloaks , sat a bevy of nautch-girls , who , when the married pair had set forth on their first march , would be summoned to the warmer rooms inside the mansion , to dance there and sing their love songs until dawn .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 17]: Between the lake and the house stood a mighty elephant , eleven feet high at least .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 42]: His enormous proportions were magnified by a great silver _ howdah _ with roof and curtains , and by the long trappings of scarlet cloth , embroidered with gold thread , which swept down his massive flanks nearly to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 43]: That this fine brute was to provide the triumphal car for Sher Afghán and his wife was evident , when , in a covered court beyond , Mowbray and Sainton saw the Diwán and Sher Afghán entertaining a number of native gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 38]: Active servants , clad solely in white , threw garlands of jasmine round the neck of each guest or offered golden salvers of _ pan supari _ , the savory betel leaf so dear to Eastern taste .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 7]: There was expectancy in the air .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 14]: The bride would soon come forth and pass forever from the enchanted garden .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 36]: Itimad-ud-Daula received them with grave courtesy , and Sher Afghán , who seemed in no wise disturbed by the known fact that Nur Mahal hated the sight of him , made his English friends welcome .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 33]: `` I have met few of your nation , '' he said to Mowbray , `` but my heart has never gone out to a stranger as to you and your brother .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 9]: You shall not suffer because I leave Agra .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 10]: I have spoken to the Diwán concerning your affairs .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 7]: Rest content for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 24]: When matters are settled over there -- '' and he nodded scornfully towards the palace -- `` he will bring you forward again .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 14]: You may be obliged to wait a month or two for your money .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 14]: The Diwán will advise you of this , and you may trust him .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 23]: If it be so , come to me at Burdwán , and I shall show you how to kill a tiger . ''
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 23]: `` How little can a man see into the future , '' confided Walter to Sainton when the Persian was called away .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 23]: `` You will perceive , Roger , that we should have missed a good deal had we not come hither to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 25]: `` He talks of the killing of tigers , but I vow he will first have the taming of one , '' said Roger .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 6]: `` Here comes the bride .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 7]: Saw you ever such a spitfire ?
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 23]: Soul of my body , I 'd liefer charge a row of spears than climb into yon silver turret by her side .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 19]: Yet Sher Afghán is a proper man , a finer fellow by half than the spleenish Jahangir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 18]: `` Perchance she cares little for either , but would sell her happiness for a diadem . ''
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 9]: `` She looks a quean of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 28]: I ken nowt of love , such as folk make songs about , but my mother always tellt me never to wed a lass for a dowry .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 14]: She said it bred a heap of mischief and few fine bairns . ''
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 40]: Walter laughed , discreetly enough , but , at that instant , Nur Mahal , who had imperiously flung aside her veil and was preparing to mount into the howdah on the kneeling elephant , looked straight at him .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 16]: Her face was deathly pale , and her lustrous eyes shone with a strange light .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 8]: Pain struggled with anger in her glance .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 24]: She was defiant yet humiliated , and she shrank from the proffered hand of her husband as though his touch would defile her .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 26]: When her gaze fell on Mowbray she singled him out for a specially scornful arching of her eyebrows and contemptuous drooping of her beautiful lips .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 32]: Considering that he had seen her that day for the first time , and had scarce exchanged a dozen words with her , he was taken aback by her evident disdain .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 42]: Somehow , though no word was spoken , those wonderful eyes said to him : -- `` You , too , have come to witness my degradation -- you , in whom I thought I had found a new lover . ''
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 13]: For some reason , unknown even to himself , he bowed sorrowfully .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 57]: When he lifted his head again , Sher Afghán was seated beside his unwilling spouse , a gorgeously-clad _ mahout _ was prodding the elephant 's head with a steel ankus , and the stately animal was marching off into the shadow of the cypresses , his path being marked by two winding rows of lanterns .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 33]: Feeling themselves slightly out of place among the _ nawabs _ , _ omrahs _ , and other grandees who formed the Diwán 's guests , the Englishmen soon took their leave .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 77]: Their servants , thinking the sahibs would sit long at the feast , had gone off to revel with the rest of their kind , and there was a wearisome delay whilst one guard after another was despatched to search for them , the truth being that each _ chuprassi _ seized the opportunity himself to indulge in libation and eat the sweetmeats provided with lavish hand for the household , before he fulfilled his quest .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 53]: The wedding cortège had gone , the night was dark and cold , and the patience of the belated pair was fast ebbing , when a hubbub of shouting and firing , mixed with the screams of women and the neighing of horses at some distance , rudely disturbed the brooding silence .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 4]: `` Gad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 13]: roared Sainton , `` I thought there would be a fight . ''
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 8]: `` The Prince has attacked the escort .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 12]: He means to slay Sher Afghán and carry off the girl .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 6]: What can we do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 3]: cried Walter .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 6]: `` Bide where we are .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 10]: Here comes news if I be not mistaken . ''
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 38]: Indeed , the loud trumpeting of an elephant , and the shaking of the earth under his mighty rush , showed that not only had the Persian 's force been overcome but he was in full retreat .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 25]: The excited servants of the Diwán -- those who were left at the entrance -- barred the gate and left the Englishmen standing outside .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 31]: But there was a lamp there , and the row of little lights on top of the wall lit up the roadway sufficiently to reveal the approach of the elephant .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 23]: He came with the speed of a galloping horse , his trappings flying in wild disorder and his trunk uplifted in terror .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 37]: Behind him raced a mob of armed men , but , on his left side , managing a fine Arab with consummate skill , and cutting and thrusting madly at Sher Afghán , rode Prince Jahangir .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 60]: The Persian , leaning well out of the _ howdah _ , was endeavoring with equal fury to kill or maim his royal rival , but the swaying strides of the elephant , and the difference in height between the huge brute and the horse , made it difficult if not impossible for either combatant to injure the other .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 15]: Yet Sher Afghán 's face was bleeding , and Jahangir 's clothes were torn .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 22]: Evidently there had been a sharp tussle ere the _ mahout _ turned his obedient monster towards the Diwán 's residence .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 15]: Behind Sher Afghán , Mowbray saw the white , distraught face of Nur Mahal .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 60]: He fancied , though the whole incident was fleeting as a dream , that she held a dagger in her right hand , but his attention was distracted by Roger shouting : -- -LSB- Illustration : And that was the manner in which Nur Mahal on her wedding night came back to the Garden of Heart 's Delight . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 18]: `` I can see nowt for it but to cleave Jahangir in two as he passes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 41]: And cloven the Prince assuredly would have been , for Sainton had drawn his long , straight sword , had not the _ mahout _ suddenly wheeled the elephant against the gate , upsetting the snorting Arab by the maneuver .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 10]: Jahangir was thrown , almost at Mowbray 's feet .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 23]: The elephant charged the massive doors head downwards , and they were torn from their hinges as if they were paper screens .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 31]: The arch collapsed , there was a crash of falling masonry and rent wood-work , and the great brute himself , stunned by the shock , fell to his knees .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 25]: And that was the manner in which Nur Mahal , on her wedding night , came back to the Garden of Heart 's Delight .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 24]: CHAPTER IX `` Why didst thou not smite him to the ground and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 6]: _ 2 Samuel _ xviii .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 2]: 11 .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 7]: Jahangir was on his feet instantly .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 14]: Sher Afghán should not escape him now unless the gods fought against him .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 5]: `` To me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 3]: he yelled .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 4]: `` Spare not !
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 11]: Every man shall have a golden _ tauq _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 12]: -LSB- B -RSB- -LSB- Footnote B : Collar or circlet . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 9]: The elephant struggled to rise , but failed .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 12]: He was dazed by his terrific impact against the solid gateway .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 17]: Sher Afghán leaped from the _ howdah _ and rushed joyously to meet his frenzied antagonist .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 35]: Perhaps the fate of India would have been settled then and there for many a year had not the mob of horsemen , unable to stay their disorderly pursuit , swept between the rivals .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 44]: Many of the _ sowars _ were thrown by crashing into the immovable bulk of the squealing beast in the roadway : most of the others either reined in , expecting to encounter a fresh foe , or were carried past the gate .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 32]: Walter , in whom the fire of battle had extinguished the dictates of prudence , whipped out his sword , faced the enraged Prince , and engaged him in rapid play .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 29]: The curved scimitar of the East had no chance against the straight English blade , wielded as it was by one versed in the art of European swordsmanship .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 31]: Jahangir was disarmed , his wrist nearly broken when he would have drawn a dagger , and Mowbray , closing fearlessly , pinned him against the base of the wall .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 16]: His infuriated adversary was no puny youth , but Walter was now at his best .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 27]: He tripped Jahangir , got him down , and gripped him by the throat , saying : -- `` Yield , fool , and lie quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 13]: If Sher Afghán finds thee he will slay thee without mercy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 10]: In the road a remarkable change had taken place .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 21]: The elephant 's assault had dislodged a long and heavy iron bar which served to prop the door from within .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 17]: Sainton , alert as a fox in an emergency , saw it lying amidst the ruins .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 33]: Any ordinary man would find it a difficult thing to lift , but Roger , sheathing his sword , picked it up and used it with both hands as a quarter staff .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 19]: He leaped back into the mêlée and made onslaught with this fearsome weapon on men and horses alike .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 28]: In the press , the Prince 's retainers could not use their arrows , and their cumbrous matchlocks , once discharged , could not be reloaded readily .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 30]: As for their swords and short lances , of what avail were such bodkins against this raging giant , mowing down all comers with a ten-foot bar of iron ?
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 5]: Who could withstand him ?
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 43]: Those who escaped him fled , and the clash of steel beyond the circle of light told that Sher Afghán 's followers , though dispersed by the first unexpected charge , had rallied and were coming to the assistance of their chief .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 27]: Sainton , who thoroughly enjoyed the fight , ceased his exertions when he saw Sher Afghán helping Nur Mahal to alight from the _ howdah _ .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 51]: A crowd of guests and armed vassals , attracted by the noise of the conflict , had run from the house , and the obedience rendered to the Persian 's orders by a fresh batch of horsemen advancing out of the darkness showed that the assailants had been completely routed .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 4]: But some remained .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 32]: Six horses and more than twenty men were prone in the dust , and few of them moved , for that terrible bar had touched naught that it did not break .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 14]: The fallen elephant blocked the gate and the big Yorkshireman held the road .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 26]: None could come out from the garden save by a wicket , and neither friend nor foe dared to approach within striking distance of Roger .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 51]: Sher Afghán , who had not earned his name , `` Slayer of Lions , '' by bragging , glanced at the tumbled heap which surrounded Sainton and cried : -- `` May Allah bear witness this night that thou hast saved my life , friend from beyond the seas .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 15]: I did well to help thee , and nobly hast thou repaid my service .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 6]: But where is thy brother ?
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 10]: I trust he has come to no harm . ''
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 30]: `` When last I saw him he was instructing Prince Jahangir in the art of fence , '' said Roger , stooping to recover his hat which had fallen .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 6]: `` Ha , sayest thou ?
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 11]: Would that I had given the lesson in his stead !
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 18]: Search for him , I pray you , whilst I conduct this lady to her father . ''
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 16]: Nur Mahal , who stood near , seemed to be in a somewhat subdued mood .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 27]: There was a new note in her voice as she murmured : -- `` Heed me not , my Lord , but look for the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 10]: My heart misgives me as to his fate . ''
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 14]: Sher Afghán gave her a quick glance , clearing his eyes in wonderment .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 9]: Before he could reply the girl darted forward .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 13]: `` See , here he comes , and with him a prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 17]: For my sake , if for none other , let there be no further bloodshed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 5]: The appeal was timely .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 22]: Walter , holding Jahangir , whom he had purposely kept in the background until the turmoil had subsided , now advanced .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 12]: But the spirit of the combat had not wholly left him .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 25]: When Sher Afghán sprang forward , eager to renew a duel interrupted by the downfall of the elephant , his sword barred the way .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 9]: `` Not so , '' he cried determinedly .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 9]: `` The Prince is unarmed and my hostage .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 18]: Moreover , I can not see why two such gallant gentlemen should fight over a worthless woman .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 21]: Whilst you were defending her and yourself , Sher Afghán , her dagger was raised to strike you dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 11]: The Persian stood as though he had been stabbed indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 9]: He bent a piteous glance on his wife .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 20]: `` Is it true , '' he asked brokenly , `` that you would have done this thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 5]: She shrank from him .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 12]: `` You forced me to wed you , '' she protested .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 8]: `` I did not love you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 12]: Plucking a dagger from his belt he offered it to her .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 16]: `` I dreamed to conquer the fickle heart of a woman , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 19]: `` If you were minded to end your woes by my death , here is my unprotected breast .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 3]: Kill me !
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 5]: It is my desire .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 17]: Better that than an assassin 's blow at the hands of the woman I love . ''
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 13]: She burst into a passion of tears and fell to her knees .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 22]: `` Forgive me , my Lord , '' she sobbed ; and her grief was music in Sher Afghán 's ears .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 16]: If , indeed , his wife regretted her attitude he could afford to be magnanimous .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 12]: Throwing sword and dagger to the ground he bowed to Jahangir .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 14]: `` Your Highness has been misled by idle tongues , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 16]: `` Tidings of this brawl will reach the Emperor as fast as men can ride .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 15]: Let you and me hasten to his presence and together seek his clemency . ''
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 37]: It was a proposal which could only emanate from a chivalrous soul , but Jahangir was too enraged by his defeat , too embittered by Nur Mahal 's apparent submission , to avail himself of it .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 12]: `` I neither plead nor make excuse , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 9]: `` Go you in peace with your bride .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 17]: I call Allah to witness that I have been misled by none save Nur Mahal herself .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 20]: My followers have fled , though I am glad to see some of the hare-livered dogs cumber the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 19]: Give me a horse and I shall ride alone , if your foreign ally grants my liberty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 40]: The lowering anger in his closely set eyes , the quivering lips which scarce could form the words , showed that Jahangir was not only keenly resentful of his plight but that he scorned Nur Mahal for her meekness .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 32]: The appearance of the Diwán , agitated and faltering in his steps , put an end to a scene which at any moment might have assumed a new phase of violence .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 22]: The aged statesman , when his first alarm was sped , thought more of the morrow than of the present excitement .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 35]: He bade Sher Afghán undertake the interrupted journey in a litter as soon as his wounds were bound , and he despatched Jahangir to the fort with a strong guard of his own servants .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 19]: By this time the dazed elephant had yielded to the curses and endearments of the _ mahout _ .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 16]: He rose ponderously , and marched across the ruins of the gate to his stable .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 17]: For some reason the Diwán would not allow Mowbray and Sainton to return to the caravansary .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 29]: He may have feared for their safety , or perhaps he found comfort in the thought that Roger , mighty man of war , slept under his roof .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 16]: Before setting out a second time Sher Afghán came to the chamber allotted to them .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 14]: He threw around Roger 's neck a magnificent gold chain studded with turquoises .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 17]: `` Let me gild the bond of steel which rivets our friendship , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 29]: To Walter he handed a dagger , with a handle so encrusted with diamonds that it blazed in the light of a lamp like a single huge stone .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 40]: `` It is worthy of the hand of my friend and the heart of my enemy , '' he cried , nor would he harken to their protests , but hurried away to the waiting litter and Nur Mahal .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 13]: `` How read you the riddle of this night 's doings ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 10]: asked Roger , when they were alone once more .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 6]: `` There is no riddle .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 16]: 'T is nothing new in history for a woman to plot for a throne . ''
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 9]: `` But the wench blew hot and cold .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 21]: One minute she was for striking her husband dead and the next she was tame as a pet lamb . ''
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 6]: `` There you have me .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 20]: I am only sorry that a brave man like Sher Afghán should be enamored of such a siren . ''
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 24]: `` By the cross of Osmotherly , Walter , I came to think I ken more than you of the ways of women .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 13]: Now , mark me , she is a hoyden of some spirit .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 19]: When the Prince would have reaved her she was willing enough , and tempted to aid him withal .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 18]: But when the fight started , she hung back , like a doe watching two contending stags .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 32]: Her husband was the better man and the greater gentleman , and he did more to win her by a five minutes ' contention than by a month 's wooing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 17]: `` You are right , Roger , but you had most to say in that respect .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 6]: Now , let us rest .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 6]: Jahangir was no mean antagonist .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 13]: He struggled like a bull when I had him on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 5]: I am weary . ''
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 35]: They slept late , and , when they had dressed and eaten , were at a loss whether to go or stay , as the Diwán had hastened to the palace soon after daybreak .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 7]: But their doubts were quickly resolved .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 18]: A mounted messenger from the Diwán bade them bring their packs with all speed to the fort .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 29]: The Emperor had laughed when told that his heir was lying abed with sore bones , and gave imperative orders that the bazaar should take place as arranged .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 48]: The man told them that the fair was the _ Khus-roz _ , or `` Day of Pleasure , '' and the scene in the garden of the zenana , when Mowbray and Sainton had hurried their train thither , showed that the festival was not misnamed .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 52]: Not only the ladies of the court , but the wives and daughters of the chief nobles , occupied the stalls , and , while Walter was busily superintending the unpacking of his bales , he heard the Emperor himself chaffering like an old wife about the value of a penny .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 17]: He was bargaining shrewdly with a beautiful Kashmiri , and receiving as good as he gave .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 9]: `` What do you know of merchandise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 17]: `` You may be a good king , but certainly you are a poor trader . ''
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 27]: `` And you are selling inferior silk by your pretty face , just as a fine rind may cover a bad apple , '' he retorted .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 28]: `` If your Majesty can only admire my face , '' said she , `` I fear you must go where you will be better served . ''
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 8]: `` Ohé , here is a prude !
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 14]: Come , accept my price and let me take my compliments elsewhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 16]: `` And what shall I say when I render short account to the Sultana ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 18]: `` Tell her that the King thought you ill-looking , so he showed you no favor . ''
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 13]: `` Your Majesty is reputed a better judge of women 's nature .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 12]: Then , indeed , the Sultana would regard me curiously . ''
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 6]: `` Oh , go to !
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 7]: You are vain as a peacock .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 8]: Here , not a pice more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 19]: He threw down some copper coins , and affected to drop a number of gold pieces by accident .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 22]: The lady promptly covered them with a fold of her _ sari _ , and Akbar strolled away to another stall .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 23]: Among the money she found a rare pearl , and the gift of a jewel was a signal sign of royal favor .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 30]: `` They tell me an elephant broke loose outside the Diwán 's house last night , '' said Akbar , stopping in front of Walter and eying him keenly .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 22]: `` For a little while I fancied it was a whole menagerie , your Majesty , '' was the quick answer .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 3]: `` So .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 16]: And this other elephant , the Hathi-sahib , made a pen for the beasts ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 12]: `` Assuredly they found him occupation for a time . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 4]: 'T is well .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 11]: I am sorry I did not see him at work .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 13]: Meanwhile , you shall not lose trade because young blood grows hot .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 9]: What is the value of your wares ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 11]: `` A lakh and a half , your Majesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 6]: `` Bones of my father !
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 19]: They must have told you that ` Akbar ' meant ' a mint ' in your language . ''
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 19]: `` The meaning of your Majesty 's name is known far beyond the confines of your kingdom . ''
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 3]: `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 5]: Thy tongue is glib !
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 10]: And what is my repute with your King ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 32]: `` I have been told that he regards your Majesty with great respect , which is saying much , as he is held by many to be a very Solomon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 17]: `` Aye , the wisest fool in Christendom , '' broke in Sainton , in English .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 15]: Mowbray smiled and Akbar cried eagerly : -- `` What sayeth the Hathi ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 13]: The translation , which Walter rendered accurately , made him laugh heartily .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 24]: `` I doubt not thou hast an apt phrase to describe me when my back is turned , '' he said to Roger .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 27]: `` If your Majesty leaves behind you the lakh and a half demanded by my partner I shall at least say that which is true . ''
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 8]: `` And what will it be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 13]: `` That none but a royal bird could cast such feathers . ''
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 3]: `` Bismillah !
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 4]: Aught but that !
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 28]: The four winds would blow hither every knave in India , for they will read it that none but a royal goose could lay such eggs . ''
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 61]: Of course the imperial quip was much applauded by those who stood near , and Akbar was so pleased with his own wit that he called for pen and paper and commanded an attendant to write an order on the Treasury for the amount named , for , strange to say , this far-seeing and intelligent monarch was quite illiterate .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 13]: He could scarcely read , and his signature was a mere scrawl .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 21]: Nevertheless , his hieroglyphics covered , in this instance , a considerable sum , its English equivalent being # 15,000 .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 37]: Seeing that the cost and transport of their goods amounted to only one-third of the sale price , both Mowbray and Sainton had the best of reasons to rejoice at this rapid change in their fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 16]: But Akbar knew the value of money as well as the poorest of his subjects .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 37]: Turning to a corpulent nawab who had laughed loudest at his joke , he said : -- `` Now , Agah Khan , thou shalt see that I am as ready a seller as a buyer .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 8]: Look at this roll of Persian silk .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 11]: Think of the joy it will cause in thy household .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 35]: Is it not cheap at two hundred gold mohurs , or shall we say two-fifty , as thou wouldst not care to rob a man who scarce knew the value of his commodities . ''
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 37]: Agah Khan , not at all elated by this twist of the royal humor , hastened to say that two hundred and fifty was the true price , at which figure he would certainly purchase it .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 4]: He knew Akbar .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 13]: Had he hesitated the figure would have risen by hundreds a minute .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 25]: `` Nay , be not so shy , Nur-ud-din , '' called out the Emperor after one who affected an interest in another stall .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 20]: `` Here be spices of Gondar that shall make thee eat until the mirror reveals one twice thy size .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 6]: What shall it be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 14]: `` Fifty , O King of Kings , '' was the quick response .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 3]: `` Fifty !
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 8]: When each grain doth season a meal !
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 7]: A hundred at the least ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 12]: `` Be it so , shadow of Allah on earth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 39]: said Nur-uddin ; yet he looked so dismal , for he was a reputed skinflint , that Akbar smiled grimly , and there was discreet mirth even among those who dreaded their own dealing with this masterful salesman .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 4]: `` Gad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 18]: whispered Sainton to Walter , `` I begin to catch the drift of the King 's bargain .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 7]: He hath a nice wit . ''
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 20]: In half an hour Akbar had sold three fourths of their stock and retained the best quarter for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 26]: They , all aglow with pleasure at this successful close of their venture , watched the proceedings in patience until the Emperor approached them again .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 23]: `` It grieves me that affairs in the Dekkàn will detain me to-day , '' he said , looking fixedly at Walter .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 30]: `` Visit the Treasury to-morrow , come hither at the hour fixed for this evening , and then journey with all speed and good fortune back to Surat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 10]: Now , Walter read a hint into the words .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 17]: He bowed deeply , assuring the Emperor that he would obey his commands to the letter .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 17]: Then , Akbar having gone , he and Roger went on their way with light hearts .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 26]: In a land where intrigue was rife , the signal favor shown by the Emperor to the two strangers was in every man 's mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 17]: This was clear from the respect paid to them as they rode forth from the palace .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 21]: Each menial salaamed , and officials who had surveyed them with hauteur during their first visit now rendered obsequious attention .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 31]: They were yet some little distance from the bazaar when two richly clad nobles , mounted on fine Turkoman Arabs , overtook them , drew rein and entered into conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 24]: At first , Walter answered their courteous inquiries unguardedly , but a question anent the previous night 's escapade revealed a hidden motive .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 12]: He described the affair jestingly , robbing it of serious import .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 22]: `` Nay , friend , '' said one , the elder of the pair , `` we heard Akbar 's words .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 16]: Prince Jahangir , a profligate and a drunkard , hath grieved him by his excesses .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 30]: Had the edge of thy sword fallen on Jahangir 's neck , instead of the flat blade on his wrist , there would have been little harm done . ''
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 12]: `` A bold speech from one whom I know not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 21]: `` Would that a bold action by one whom we know not had rid the land of a pest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 18]: Amazed and somewhat disturbed by this outspoken declaration , Mowbray wheeled his horse squarely towards the speaker .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 14]: `` I would have you realize that my companion and I are traders .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 19]: We have no concern with the court beyond the sale of our goods , '' he said sternly .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 11]: `` Traders should not have enemies in high places . ''
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 6]: `` We have none . ''
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 19]: `` Why , then , is one of the foreign preachers closeted with Jahangir since the ninth hour ?
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 39]: Why hath this same preacher spread the rumor in the bazaar that you are spies , emissaries of a king beyond the black water who is sending armed ships to prey on our territories in the west ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 7]: Here was unpleasant news , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 27]: Mowbray must have looked his annoyance , because the other continued eagerly : -- `` This black gown hath established too great an influence over Jahangir .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 29]: Were he dead , and his brother Khusrow recognized as heir , all would be well , and the store thou hast made to-day would be quadrupled . ''
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 8]: `` To whom do I speak ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 9]: `` I fear not to give my name .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 16]: I am Raja Man Singh , and this other is the chief of Bikanir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 10]: `` Why do you tell me these things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 15]: said Walter , sorely troubled , for the men were grandees of high position .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 24]: `` Because , in God 's name , if Jahangir comes in front of thy sword again , plunge it into him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 41]: Roger , who gathered the drift if not the exact significance of the talk , broke in in English : -- `` If they 're athirst for Jahangir 's blood , Walter , bid them slit his weazand themselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 21]: They evidently read his ejaculation as hostile to the Prince , for he from Bikanir murmured : -- `` Good !
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 6]: The Hathi hath trumpeted . ''
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 13]: Now , Roger did not like the nickname given him by Akbar .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 21]: He stretched out a huge fist toward the Rajput and roared : -- `` I kill only in fair fight .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 30]: Beware lest the slaying be done now , when , perchance , we may win not only the Emperor 's approval , but that of his eldest son . ''
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 11]: His attitude surprised them , but they showed no fear .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 12]: Raja Man Singh said coldly : -- `` I have spoken .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 18]: Many hours may not pass before you feel that my words were not uttered without cause . ''
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 15]: He spurred his horse , and the other followed him in a sharp canter .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 7]: They soon vanished in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 22]: The incident , perplexing though it was , would not have troubled them greatly save for the reference to Dom Geronimo .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 28]: Here was one whose rancor was implacable , his spleen being probably augmented by their presence in the Mogul capital and the notable success they had attained .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 39]: When they recalled the Emperor 's advice as to their departure they saw that there were dangerous undercurrents in existence which might swamp the argosy of their fortunes if they did not conduct their affairs with exceeding discretion .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 23]: Hence , they hailed with joy the invitation from the Diwán to make his house their own during further residence in Agra .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 16]: In the caravansary they were surrounded by strangers who might be in anyone 's pay .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 45]: In the Garden of Heart 's Delight they were , at least , under the protection of an influential minister , whose abode even Prince Jahangir was compelled to respect , else he would not have resorted to the ambuscade of the previous night .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 25]: But the blind god , having tossed them towards the smooth haven of prosperity , blew them back into a storm with malignant caprice .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 29]: That night , the Diwán died suddenly , poisoned said some , while others held that his end was hastened by the turmoil attending Nur Mahal 's marriage .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 12]: Application to the Treasury for payment of their order was futile .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 74]: They were assured , civilly enough , that no money could be disbursed until a new Diwán was appointed , and , when they kept the appointment fixed by Akbar , they were told that the Emperor , overwhelmed with grief at the death of his favorite minister , added to the news of the illness of one of his sons , Dániál , at Burhampur , was secluded in his private apartments .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 25]: Day after day they waited , devising many schemes to secure their money and leave a city they would gladly see the last of .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 8]: They lived in the Diwán 's house .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 28]: None interfered with them , and the place itself was an earthly Paradise wherein they would be well content if other matters had progressed to their liking .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 13]: The warning given by Raja Man Singh had no justification in fact .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 23]: Jahangir had apparently forgotten their existence , while Dom Geronimo gave no sign that he concerned himself in any way about them .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 19]: Walter not only visited the palace daily , but wrote letters , none of which received an answer .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 10]: At last the truth could no longer be hidden .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 16]: Akbar , who had reigned over India fifty-one years , was stricken down with paralysis .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 27]: In the words of the chronicler , `` His Majesty , finding that his last moments had come , summoned all his Omerahs to his bedside .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 20]: Wistfully regarding them , he asked forgiveness of any offense he might have been guilty towards any of them .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 28]: Then he gave them a sign to invest his son , Jahangir , with his turban and robes , and to gird him with his favorite simitar .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 34]: He entreated Jahangir to be kind to the ladies of the family , to discharge all his -LRB- Akbar 's -RRB- obligations , and never to neglect or forsake old friends and dependents .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 13]: The grandees prostrated themselves before their dying lord and did him homage .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 24]: The King repeated the confession of faith , closed his eyes , and died in all the forms of a pious Musalman . ''
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 33]: The worthy scribe no doubt intended his concluding sentence to dispel , once and for all , the rumor which found credence with many that Akbar had a decided leaning towards Christianity .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 19]: However that may be , the tidings of his death sounded the knell of the adventurers ' hopes .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 20]: Not only had they lost the fortune within their grasp , but they and their Surat partner were ruined .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 18]: Walter 's dream of gaining a competence and sailing speedily to England and Nellie Roe was shattered .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 21]: In his despair he debated with Roger the advisability of quitting Agra secretly , and journeying towards Calcutta by river .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 32]: But Roger swore , with quaint oaths , that he would beard Jahangir in his palace and shame him before all his nobles if he did not fulfil Akbar 's behest .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 13]: Matters were in this desperate plight when a royal messenger was announced .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 15]: Wondering greatly what new development fickle fate had in store they admitted the man .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 49]: He salaamed with much ceremony and said : -- `` My master , the Emperor Jahangir , second Sahib-i-Qirán , -LSB- C -RSB- bids the illustrious strangers wait on him to-morrow after he appears at the jharoka -LRB- window -RRB- to receive the blessings of his subjects . ''
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 27]: -LSB- Footnote C : Literally , `` Born under favoring planets , '' a title conferred by historians on Taimúr , and assumed by Jahangir . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 9]: Here was the unexpected happening in very truth .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 7]: Had Kingship made Jahangir a King ?
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 13]: Would he rise superior to petty considerations and treat them with justice ?
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 4]: Who could tell ?
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 24]: As Roger said : -- `` We mun eat a good breakfast , buckle on our swords , and trust in Providence . ''
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 18]: CHAPTER X `` Out of this nettle , danger , we pluck this flower , safety . ''
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 10]: _ Shakespeare _ , `` King Henry IV . ''
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 10]: Jahangir received them in the Hall of Public Audience .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 24]: If he wished to inspire respect by a display of magnificence , his appearance and surroundings were well calculated to achieve this purpose .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 12]: The fine building itself supplied a fitting shrine for regal splendor .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 21]: The Arabesque roof was borne on Byzantine arches , which gave free access on three sides from a delightful parterre .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 21]: It was closed on the north , as here it rested against the higher ground which contained the private apartments .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 28]: A raised marble canopy stood out from the center of the built-in side , the floor being some eight feet above the mosaic pavement of the hall .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 18]: This retreat held the Emperor 's throne , to which a small door communicated from the back .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 11]: The throne was elevated on a dais of silver steps .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 18]: Four massive silver lions bore an inner canopy of gold , curiously wrought and emblazoned with jewels .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 34]: Tavernier , the French traveler , himself a goldsmith , estimated the value of this wonderful structure at so many millions sterling that later historians have held the sum named to be incredible .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 20]: Nevertheless , it made a brave show in the clear light of an Indian interior in the cold weather .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 10]: Not less striking was the figure of Jahangir himself .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 19]: Robed in white muslin , his belt , simitar , dagger-hilt , and scarf literally blazed with diamonds .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 25]: On his turban reposed a Persian diadem with twelve points , each terminating in a large diamond of purest water and most brilliant luster .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 38]: Within a mass of sparkling stones in the center was set a shimmering pearl of extraordinary size and value , while a necklace of smaller but exquisite pearls served to enhance the lustrous ornament in his crown .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 16]: Tavernier , probably with reasonable accuracy , valued the diadem alone at two millions sterling .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 36]: Grouped near him on the steps of the dais , or on the platform , were several court dignitaries , amidst whose gorgeous robes the Englishmen 's eyes quickly discerned the cassock of Dom Geronimo .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 48]: A host of officials and nobles of lesser importance thronged the floor of the great hall , and the scene was one of glittering animation at the moment the two friends arrived , the only somber and sinister note being the unrelieved black robe of the Jesuit .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 20]: That they were expected was demonstrated by the sudden stilling of tongues and craning of necks as they approached .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 36]: All men made way for them , as men will , though the path be to the steps of a throne , when they think a fellow creature is doomed to instant death or torture .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 44]: It was common knowledge that these two had not only thwarted Jahangir 's amours and laid violent hands on him in the process , but that he was their creditor , in his father 's behalf , for a considerable sum of money .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 14]: What better reasons could there be for hanging the pair of them forthwith ?
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 47]: Yet , some prudent souls , noting the fearless glances cast around by Sainton and his less colossal but powerfully built companion -- thinking , perhaps , that the Emperor might call on his faithful subjects to seize these two -- edged away from the vicinity .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 17]: It would be much easier to yell than to act when Jahangir cried `` Maro ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 13]: -LSB- D -RSB- -LSB- Footnote D : `` Kill them ! '' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 20]: `` Desperate need calls for desperate deed , '' growled Roger as they strode forward , side by side .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 22]: `` If it comes to a fight , Walter , let me sweep a clear space with a stroke or two .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 15]: Then I shall catch thee by the belt and heave thee up at Jahangir .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 7]: It will take him by surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 13]: Bring him out , as a keen dog would draw a badger .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 15]: Once we have him on the floor , perchance we can make terms . ''
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 4]: Walter laughed gaily .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 36]: The suggestion that they should terrorize the whole Mogul court by sheer force was ludicrous , and its humor was not lessened by the knowledge that they were both in a position of imminent danger .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 48]: The presence of the Jesuit in close attendance on the Emperor was , in itself , an ominous sign , and the mere sight of him brought a glint into Mowbray 's blue eyes which boded ill for Jahangir if Roger 's last daring expedient became necessary .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 17]: They advanced near to the marble canopy , and , doffing their hats , bowed respectfully .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 26]: Roger , with an eye over his shoulder , thought that the eager mob of courtiers was inclined to tread too closely on his heels .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 35]: With his left hand he pressed the hilt of his long sword , and the scabbard , sticking straight out behind him , seemed to indicate that he did not intend to be incommoded .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 55]: Anyhow , those in the rear read his wishes that way , and anxiously whispered to others not to thrust them forward , while the wiser men , who had kept aloof , noting the strange expression on Jahangir 's face , thanked Allah for the wit which stationed them in a safe place .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 39]: Walter , who , of course , acted in the assumption that Jahangir had sent for him in the most friendly spirit , began the conversation by addressing a neatly worded compliment to the monarch on his accession .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 28]: `` It is the happy law of nature , '' he said , `` that the setting of the sun shall be followed by the rising thereof .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 29]: May your Majesty 's reign continue for as many years as that of your illustrious father , and may the brightness of your glory illumine the earth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 17]: Having some trick of versification , he gave the words a turn towards a Persian couplet .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 27]: There was a rustle of gratified surprise among the audience , few of whom were aware of Walter 's proficiency in the courtly language of Hindustan .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 30]: Jahangir , smiling acidly , bent forward : -- `` I sent for a merchant , '' he said , `` but you have brought me a poet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 15]: `` A happy chance enables me to combine the two , your Majesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 17]: The Emperor , without any hesitation , answered : -- `` You are modest , withal .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 26]: The last time we met I discovered in you other qualities , whilst your words savored more of the battlefield than of the court . ''
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 51]: `` I have not seen your Majesty before , '' said Walter boldly , for he could in no wise guess what line Jahangir intended to take with him , and he was not prepared for this open allusion to the struggle at the gate of the Diwán 's garden .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 13]: The King 's face exhibited some amazement , as well it might .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 15]: He significantly touched his right forearm , which was closely wrapped in black silk .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 27]: `` My eyes and ears may have deceived me , '' he cried , `` but I have that here which bears witness against thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 19]: `` Your Majesty is good enough to allude to a slight dispute which involved Prince Jahangir and another .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 36]: It did not concern me , and I was foolish to take part in it , but I maintain that had I encountered the Emperor on that occasion I would have behaved very differently . ''
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 34]: Dom Geronimo , who lost no word of the interview , seemed to be displeased by Mowbray 's adroit distinction between the occupant of the throne and a prince of the royal blood .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 15]: He leaned over and whispered something , but Jahangir paid little heed to him .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 13]: `` Then , you think a monarch should have no memory ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 8]: he asked , looking fixedly at Walter .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 4]: `` Not so .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 11]: He should remember his friends and forget his enemies . ''
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 12]: `` And how shall I class thee and thy comrade ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 20]: `` We trust that your Majesty will continue to show us the favor manifested by your royal father . ''
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 3]: Jahangir laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 18]: `` It is strange , '' he said slowly , `` but you have read my intention .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 23]: I am told that the renowned Akbar had it in mind to give you an exhibition of certain sports which he loved .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 22]: Faithful to his wishes in every respect as I am , I have brought you hither to-day for that same purpose .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 10]: I have ordered a steward to wait on you .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 23]: After the midday meal he will conduct you to the _ tamáshá-gáh _ , -LSB- E -RSB- where I will meet you .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 2]: Farewell .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 5]: God is great ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 10]: -LSB- Footnote E : Arena , or sport-ground . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 8]: `` May His brightness shine forth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 40]: chanted the Mahomedans present , and , ere Mowbray and Sainton well understood the King 's desire , Jahangir had vanished and they were confronted by a bowing chamberlain , who besought them to accompany him to a guest-room .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 8]: Here , an excellent meal was served .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 10]: On the table were several flagons of various wines .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 55]: Though they knew not what was in store for them , and the Emperor 's manner was as inscrutable as his words , they fully believed that he did not mean them to be poisoned on that occasion , so they ate heartily , notwithstanding Roger 's earlier precaution in the matter of breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 13]: But the wine , though its novelty was tempting , they spared .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 29]: They knew its effects in that climate , and until they were far removed from Agra it behooved them to keep eye undimmed and blood free from fever .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 55]: The less they drank the more the steward pressed the wine upon them , until Roger , whom the sight of the flagons tried sorely , bade the man , if he were minded to be truly hospitable , send the liquor to their abode , where they would endeavor to do it justice .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 26]: `` If your Honor will say that you have already partaken of it I shall obey your behest , '' said the other with alacrity .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 47]: `` That will be only the bare truth , '' was the astonished reply , for they had each tasted a small quantity and found it excellent , there being Canary , Alicant , Malaga , and the famed product of Oporto on the board . ''
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 10]: ` Ware hawk , Roger , '' interposed Walter .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 16]: `` Unless I mistake me greatly we are being screwed up to undergo some ordeal .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 7]: Jahangir said naught of paying us .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 6]: I dislike his civility . ''
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 3]: `` Gad !
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 29]: if this honest fellow keeps his word and conveys the bottles to the old Diwán 's house , I shall change my mind anent the chuck ere midnight .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 9]: What flea hath bitten thee now , Walter ?
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 23]: The King hath dealt with us right royally , and you and he seemed to oil each other with smooth words . ''
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 8]: `` I can not forego my suspicions .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 7]: They are useless , I admit .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 23]: We have thrust our heads into the jaws of the lion , and can scarce complain if he snaps them off . ''
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 20]: `` Let us rather resolve to give him the toothache if he tries any tricks , '' growled Sainton .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 13]: `` Make for him , lad , if there be aught amiss .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 8]: Trust to me to clear a path .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 29]: For each one in the crowd who draws for the King there will be another ready to draw against him should they see a chance of success . ''
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 5]: They spoke in English .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 23]: Their native attendant , seeing that they had finished their meal , begged to be allowed to depart for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 16]: When all was ready he would come and bring them to the _ tamáshá-gáh _ .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 24]: They were seated in a beautiful apartment , with frescoed walls , mosaic floor , and arched Moorish roof composed of colored tiles .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 9]: On one side it opened into a garden .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 68]: The palace , unlike most kingly residences , was not one vast building , but was made up of a series of exquisitely proportioned halls or small private abodes , sometimes connected by covered ways , but often standing quite apart , and always surrounded by a wealth of flowers and foliage peculiarly grateful to eyes wearied by the glare of the sun reflected from white marble .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 14]: Industriously watering the plants was a sturdy _ bhisti _ , or water-carrier .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 8]: His goatskin bag seemed to be inexhaustible .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 15]: He had been traversing the garden paths throughout the whole time they were eating .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 25]: No sooner were they alone in the room than he ran close to the plinth and began to deluge the rose-bushes in good earnest .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 7]: `` Protector of the poor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 10]: he murmured to Walter , `` stay not here .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 10]: Go away quickly , in God 's name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 22]: Considerably startled by the man 's words , which chimed so strangely with his own forebodings , Mowbray bent towards him .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 10]: `` Who bade thee give me this message ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 20]: he asked , knowing full well that such a menial would never dare to speak on his own authority .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 22]: `` One who wishes thee well , sahib -- my wife , to wit , '' answered the _ bhisti _ .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 5]: `` Thy wife ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 6]: `` Yes , honored one .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 36]: You plucked our child from death in the river , and my wife heard from others that there is intent to make sport with thee and the Hathi-sahib ere both are put to death . ''
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 10]: Swish , swish went the water among the rose-leaves .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 22]: Never was there a more energetic _ bhisti _ , for a gardener had appeared , and further talk was impossible .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 17]: `` As well die here as a mile away , '' was Roger 's quiet comment .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 15]: `` We have breakfasted , we have dined , and a fight is toward .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 7]: What more can a man want ?
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 19]: Out with your hanger , Walter , when Jahangir so much as opes his mouth to speak crossly .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 20]: We shall give him a feast of steel , with first , second , and third course all alike .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 13]: There shall be much carving , yet none will tarry to eat .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 2]: Gad !
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 27]: this talking makes me thirsty , and , if I am fated to fall to-day , their blades may as well let out some good liquor .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 5]: Fall to , lad !
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 8]: We may not have another chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 13]: He seized a bottle of Alicant and poured out two generous measures .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 26]: Mowbray lifted a tankard and cried : -- `` Here 's to Old England and Nellie Roe , if I never see either again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 18]: `` And here 's to the day when I set foot on the heather once more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 6]: was Roger 's sturdy rejoinder .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 14]: It was in such spirit that they followed the chamberlain when he reappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 13]: They had no opportunity of conversing again with the _ bhisti _ .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 57]: Whatever good cause inspired his mysterious message they were now on the verge of enlightenment , so Walter called the poor fellow towards him and openly presented him with some rupees , saying : -- `` He that refreshes the thirsty earth and causes the flowers to grow is among the most deserving of mortals . ''
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 7]: The man shifted his water-bag uneasily .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 9]: `` Salaam , sahib , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 14]: `` May your years be numbered as the pice in these coins ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 44]: Now , there are sixty-four pice in a rupee , so the _ bhisti 's _ wish had not an uncheerful ring in their ears as they followed their guide across the garden and thence to a new part of the palace grounds .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 28]: They were conducted to an extensive stone platform , built level with the fortifications at a point where the outer walls were laved by the river Jumna .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 28]: Exactly in front of and below the platform , however , a square enclosed court , or arena , was reclaimed from the bed of the stream .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 57]: The preparations in progress there , no less than the presence of several elephants in battle gear , hunting leopards in leash , antelopes trained for fighting , buffaloes whose tremendous horns were tipped with lance points , and many other animals , including even the ungainly rhinoceros , showed what manner of sport was forthcoming .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 20]: Notwithstanding the precarious condition of their own fortunes , both Mowbray and Sainton regarded the scene with curious eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 81]: They had , of course , during their three years ' sojourn , witnessed the fierce spring of the _ chitah _ -LSB- F -RSB- onto the back of a flying deer ; they had chased wild boar and even _ nilgau _ , the fierce blue cow of India , on horseback ; they had seen a trained eagle pounce onto an antelope and buffet the frightened creature 's head with its wings until the claws got to work .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 33]: But a combat of elephants was a King 's amusement , as few save a monarch could afford the cost or compel men to risk and lose their lives in such fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 23]: -LSB- Footnote F : Leopard -RSB- The broad terrace on which they stood was flanked by the graceful buildings of the zenana .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 37]: A double line of spear-men guarded it on three sides , while another batch of warriors surrounded a ponderous block of black marble , resting on four low supports , which bore the Emperor 's chair .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 31]: This was placed close to the edge of the battlements , so that his Majesty could watch each detail of the sanguinary encounters in the arena some twenty feet beneath .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 37]: The chair was securely bound to the marble block lest it should topple over in a moment of royal excitement , and there was standing room on the huge stone to accommodate a dozen privileged spectators .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 48]: For the rest , the platform extended so far on either hand that all could look easily into the enclosure , whilst many a window and balcony of the palace permitted the ladies of the household to take part in the proceedings if they were so minded .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 22]: When the Englishmen arrived there were already many rajahs , omrahs , and other notabilities standing in groups on the terrace .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 26]: None of these addressed the strangers , but muttered words and covert looks showed that some event was toward of which those present were cognizant .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 10]: Roger eyed the strength of the guard and smiled .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 20]: He laughed outright when he nudged Walter to note the manner in which even the royal chair was protected .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 15]: `` Jahangir either plans mischief or is afraid of it , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 16]: `` He hath marshaled a small army to protect him in his own house . ''
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 26]: Walter straightway took the bull by the horns in addressing a question to one who stood near and with whom he had a slight acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 12]: `` Is such display of force usual within the palace ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 6]: The other shrugged his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 15]: `` They talk of a fierce tiger being let loose , '' he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 9]: `` One never knows what may happen . ''
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 6]: He vouchsafed no further information .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 12]: Indeed , at that moment , Jahangir put in an appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 17]: His swarthy face was flushed and there was an evil glint in his close set eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 11]: Evidently he had been imbibing liquor forbidden by the Prophet .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 33]: Accompanied by a few young noblemen whose appearance betokened the force of kingly example , he strode towards his chair without paying the slightest attention to the respectful salaams of the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 10]: `` Bring the sheep first , '' he grunted .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 10]: `` We shall deal with the pigs later . ''
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 10]: This obscure joke was greeted with shouts of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 3]: `` Karamat !
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 3]: Karamat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 47]: -LSB- G -RSB- was the exclamation , for every Mahomedan there had laid to heart the Persian proverb : -- `` Should the King say that it is night at noon , Be sure to cry : ` Behold , I see the moon ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 7]: -LSB- Footnote G : `` Wonderful !
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 4]: Wonderful ! '' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 52]: Yet Mowbray , alert to discern the slightest straw-twist on the swirl of the current , thought that some of the older men glanced askance at each other , which puzzled him , as he knew quite well that the death of a Feringhi was of little account to an Asiatic .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 26]: The `` sheep '' alluded to by Jahangir were veritable carcases of those animals , slung from poles by the feet tied in a bunch .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 50]: They were carried by servants onto the terrace itself , and forthwith a few athletic youths created some excitement by endeavoring , in the first place , to cut through the four feet at one blow , and , secondly , to divide the body in the same way .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 20]: They used their razor-edged simitars with much skill , science rather than great strength being demanded by the task .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 31]: When half a dozen carcases had been dissected with more or less success , Jahangir shouted a question to Sainton , of whose presence he seemed to be unaware hitherto .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 10]: `` Tell me , Hathi , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 10]: `` Canst perform either trick with thy long sword ?
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 12]: Thy arm is strong , but is thy wrist supple ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 25]: All eyes were instantly bent on Roger , to whom Mowbray whispered the King 's meaning lest he had not properly caught the words .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 5]: The giant grinned genially .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 16]: `` A slung sheep offers but slight resistance to a blow , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 14]: `` Were he fresh from the spit I 'd sooner eat him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 27]: Discreet mirth rewarded his humor , but Jahangir wheeled round in his chair towards the ditch and clapped his hands as a signal to the attendants .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 37]: At once began a series of sanguinary events in which buffaloes contended with _ nilgau _ , hunting dogs tore down bears let loose from invisible caverns , and panthers made magnificent leaps after flying deer .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 5]: Few were real combats .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 39]: In most cases a helpless creature was ruthlessly slaughtered by some vicious and snarling enemy , and the more ghastly the dying struggles of the doomed antelope or bellowing cow the more excited and vociferous became the spectators .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 10]: A fight between elephants was a really thrilling affair .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 34]: Two magnificent brutes , specially imported from Ceylon , were led up on opposite sides of a low mud wall built on wood and carried into the arena by a host of men .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 22]: Gorgeously caparisoned , and trumpeting strange squeals of defiance , each elephant was urged towards this barrier by his two riders .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 61]: Separated at first by the wall , they fought furiously with heads , tusks , and trunks , while the leading _ mahout _ encouraged his mount by shrill cries , forcing him to the attack with a steel _ ankus _ , or striving to ward off the blows of the opposing beast 's trunk with the same instrument .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 13]: It was quickly apparent why there were two men astride an elephant .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 36]: Each cunning brute knew that it was an advantage to get rid of his adversary 's _ mahout _ , and , indeed , one rider was killed before the fight was long in progress .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 43]: But the death of the man so enraged his elephant that he sprang onto the wall ere the second attendant could climb to his head , and gored his opponent in the flank with such ferocity that the other turned and fled .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 28]: The two rushed towards the end of the enclosure , and the leading animal charged a stout barricade so blindly that it yielded before his great bulk .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 10]: He fell , and the pursuer attacked him furiously .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 45]: At once a terrific fanfare of hautboys and cymbals burst forth , and a number of men ran with lighted fireworks , mostly Catherine wheels , attached to long sticks , which they thrust under the legs and before the eyes of the victor .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 40]: This device caused him to abandon the assault , and he allowed his remaining _ mahout _ to drive him away , but not until two unfortunate _ bhois _ , or attendants , had been trodden to death .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 45]: Jahangir nodded his satisfaction , and the riders of the elephants were permitted to alight , each man being given a sackful of pice , while the ears of the conquering animal were decorated with tails of the white Tibetan ox , or yak .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 53]: As for the inanimate corpses of the hapless _ mahout _ and his assistants , they were huddled onto biers and borne away , followed by some shrieking women , whose plaints were drowned by the din of trumpets six or seven feet in length and a foot wide at the mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 13]: It must not be imagined that the spectacle disgusted the English onlookers .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 46]: In an age when men lived by the sword , when personal bravery and physical hardihood were the best equipment a youth could possess , there were no fastidious notions as to the sacredness of human life or the deliberate cruelty involved in such encounters .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 37]: They were wondering what would provide the next act in this drama of blood and death when a stir towards the rear of the platform on which they stood caused them to look in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 17]: Sainton , by reason of his height , could see over the heads of the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 8]: `` By the cross of Osmotherly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 9]: he cried , `` the mystery is cleared .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 14]: Here comes Sher Afghán , closely tended , if not a prisoner . ''
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 33]: It was , indeed , the Persian noble himself who now advanced towards Jahangir , the Emperor having swung his chair , which was on a pivot , to face the palace .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 13]: Sher Afghán 's mien was collected , his dress in good order .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 18]: He was unarmed , and the mace-bearers who marched behind him might be merely doing him honor .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 13]: With eyes for none save Jahangir he strode on with firm step .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 10]: At the proper distance he stopped and bowed deeply .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 16]: `` To hear the King 's order is to obey , '' he said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 29]: `` Your Majesty 's messenger rode far , for I hastened to Burdwán , but when he reached me I turned my horse 's head that moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 12]: `` Say rather , you gave orders to your litter carriers .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 18]: When last we parted you had pleasant company in the _ palki _ , '' replied Jahangir .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 14]: `` Neither my wife nor I love indolence , O King of Kings .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 14]: We have ridden hither at the rate of sixty miles a day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 7]: `` I am glad of it .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 30]: Being newly come to the throne I did not wish the most beautiful and the bravest of my subjects to be banished from the capital to far Burdwán . ''
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 17]: `` Your Majesty 's words are more propitious than a favorable sign in the heavens . ''
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 26]: `` They carry no better augury than the hour of your arrival , for , in very truth , I feared you might be tardy .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 19]: I owe these strangers from beyond the black waters some slight debt in my illustrious father 's behalf .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 24]: Certain monies shall be paid them , but first I have discharged a promise of the great Akbar 's to entertain them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 20]: He waved a jeweled hand towards Mowbray and Sainton , and the Persian saw them for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 40]: But Jahangir went on slowly , his white teeth showing as if he wished to bite each word : -- `` Thy coming , friend , hath provided for all a truly marvelous close to a day of pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 11]: Art thou not named Sher Afghán , Slayer of Tigers ?
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 13]: Behold , then , a foe worthy even of thy reputation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 6]: Again he clapped his hands .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 40]: A door was opened in the cellars beneath , and a great Bengal tiger , maddened by hours of torture , sprang into the center of the arena , the broken barrier having been hastily repaired with strong hurdles .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 44]: The lissome beast , whose striped skin shone like cloth of gold and brown velvet in the rays of the declining sun , stood for a little while lashing his sides in fury with his tail until he caught the scent of blood .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 14]: Then he crouched , and began to stalk , he cared not what .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 23]: The air was fetid with killing , and this past master in the hunter 's art knew the tokens of his craft .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 37]: But the arena was otherwise empty , and his lambent eyes , searching eagerly for the cause of so much reek , were raised at last to the intent row of faces looking down at him .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 13]: `` What sayest thou , Sher Afghán , '' cried the Emperor .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 29]: `` Art thou minded to vindicate thy title with one who seems to dispute it , or has a happy marriage robbed thy arm of its prowess ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 4]: The Persian hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 31]: He , like his English friends , had thought it better to brave Jahangir 's animosity in Agra itself than fall beneath the attack of hirelings in some distant fray .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 37]: In the capital , there was always a chance of a political upheaval as the outcome of a quarrel , whereas , in a remote part , the minions of a vengeful monarch might strike unheeded .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 11]: Jahangir 's tenure of the throne was far from stable .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 39]: Yet , though he might not dare openly to put to death a noble of high rank , this challenge meant little else , even if it held the plausible pretext that Sher Afghán chose his doom voluntarily .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 15]: A thrill of anticipation shook all hearers as they awaited the Persian 's answer .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 28]: He gazed around on them disdainfully , for he was well aware that many there would utter a protest did they not fear for their own skins .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 4]: Then he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 23]: `` Give me arms and a ladder , '' he said , `` and I shall try to kill the beast . ''
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 14]: A murmur arose , like the hum of wind-tossed leaves presaging a storm .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 30]: Some men might have been warned by it , but the Emperor , already half intoxicated , was now goaded to utter madness by his rival 's cool daring .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 20]: `` Arms thou shalt have , '' he screamed , `` but what need is there of a ladder ?
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 4]: Why not jump ?
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 6]: There is sand beneath ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 30]: Now this , indeed , was spurring Sher Afghán to his death , for the tiger would be on him with inconceivable speed ere he could recover his feet .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 18]: Among those who thronged breathlessly forward to hear all that passed , Roger Sainton listened and understood .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 21]: The big Yorkshireman 's eyes glowed like live coals , and the veins on his neck bulged with sudden passion .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 46]: It was in his mind to end the quarrel then and there by sweeping the Emperor and a row of his guards into the fosse , but a quaint idea suddenly gripped him , and , without any hesitation , he put it in force .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 12]: Thrusting the gapers left and right he reached the royal dais .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 22]: `` If not a ladder , friend , '' he said to Sher Afghán , `` why not a step ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 16]: With that , he stooped and caught hold of the huge block of black marble .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 30]: Before anyone so much as grasped his intent he lifted it from its supports , toppling Jahangir and several of his favorites in a confused heap on the terrace .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 21]: Then he pitched the mass of stone into the arena and it chanced to fall flat onto the crouching tiger .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 18]: His sword flashed out as several spear-men , having recovered their wits , made lunges at him .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 8]: `` Hold back , good fellows ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 15]: he cried cheerily , for Roger 's anger never continued when steel was bared .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 11]: `` Mayhap the Emperor thinks the revel is ended ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 16]: CHAPTER XI `` I do not set my life at a pin 's fee . ''
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 22]: _ Hamlet _ , Act I. Mortal fear has caused many a man to run who thought himself unable to walk .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 10]: It now gave a tonic to an inebriate king .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 18]: Jahangir , struggling to his feet , obtained a fleeting glimpse of Roger Sainton 's amazing achievement .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 38]: He heard more definitely the crashing fall of the great stone into the arena , and his first emotion was one of profound thankfulness that he and several of his boon companions had not gone with it .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 18]: But instantly there came the knowledge that he had been treated with contumely before all his court .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 38]: So his face , already pallid with terror , became even more white with anger , and words trembled on his lips which , if uttered , would have been the irrevocable signal for a wild tumult .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 48]: Yet , hidden away in the brain of this headstrong debauchee there was a latent sense of king-craft which taught him caution , and deep down in his soul was a certain nobility of character which age and the cares of a ruler developed in later years .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 10]: His quick eyes discovered what Roger had truly divined .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 45]: There was many a powerful noble there ready to espouse the cause of Sher Afghán , whilst , such was the awe inspired by Sainton 's almost supernatural feat , it was more than likely the giant 's onslaught would create a mad stampede .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 37]: Moreover , Jahangir himself was as conscious as any present that he had witnessed a deed whose memory would endure through the ages , and the warring influences in his breast sobered him for the moment .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 15]: With a self-control that was wholly creditable , he held up an authoritative hand .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 11]: `` Who dares to strike ere the Emperor commands ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 23]: he cried , and his strong voice stilled the rising waves of agitation as oil beats down the crests of troubled waters .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 24]: Heedless , or perhaps unknowing , that his turban was awry , he walked to the edge of the parapet and looked over .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 27]: There lay the fine marble slab , broken in two as it remains to this day , though it was quickly restored to its old-time site .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 25]: Bound to it were the silken cords which fastened the imperial chair , the seat itself having been crushed into a thousand splinters underneath .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 25]: He turned towards Roger ; though a cruel despot , Jahangir was a sportsman : -- `` Did it fall on the tiger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 9]: The big man pretended to scan the arena .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 30]: `` As the beast is nowhere else to be seen I doubt not he is on the right side of the stone , your Majesty , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 11]: `` Why did you not warn me of your intent ?
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 15]: I would have given a lakh of rupees to have seen this thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 15]: Roger was far too quick-witted not to accept the cue thus thrown to him .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 15]: `` There was scant time for words , your Majesty , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 22]: `` In another instant your devoted servant , Sher Afghán , would have been in the pit with the snarling brute .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 9]: For sure you meant but to try him .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 25]: Nevertheless , I made bold to interfere , as there is many a tiger , but only one such man among your vassals . ''
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 39]: The big man 's humor was mordant , but the excited throng chose to ignore the implied disparagement , and a murmur of applause told the Emperor that in curbing his wrath he had acted with exceeding wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 10]: `` You are right , '' he said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 26]: `` I am much beholden to you , and that is more than some kings would say who had been flung headlong to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 35]: But see , '' he added , making a brave show of nonchalance as he faced the crowd and waved a haughty hand toward the west , `` the hour of evening prayer approaches .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 7]: Let us to the mosque ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 56]: `` Now look you , '' murmured Sainton to Walter , who stood watchful , with sword-arm ready , during these thrilling moments , `` there goes a man with murder in his heart , yet will he turn his jowl to Mecca and chant verses from the Koran with the best of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 9]: `` I fear he only bides his time .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 13]: But what good fairy prompted you to act in such a way ?
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 7]: I knew not what to do .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 22]: I felt that any moment we might be fighting for our lives , yet I saw no loophole of escape . ''
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 24]: `` Ecod , I remembered my mother telling me that a white sheet makes nine parts of a ghost on a dark night .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 13]: I reckoned to scare 'em with a bogie , and succeeded . ''
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 16]: In company with Sher Afghán , they quitted the palace fortress without let or hindrance .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 19]: The gallant Persian , after thanking Roger for his aid , explained his motive in returning to Agra .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 19]: He had reached the Garden of Heart 's Delight only an hour after they quitted it that morning .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 36]: Hence , Jahangir was evidently quite well informed as to his movements , and had planned the escapade with the tiger as a means of requiting one , at least , of his avowed enemies .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 43]: Indeed , they learned later that , in the event of Sher Afghán 's death , the spear-men were ordered to close round Sainton and Mowbray and bear them down by sheer force of numbers if they strove to assist their friend .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 17]: Roger had defeated the scheme only by taking advantage of a prior moment of intense excitement .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 36]: When Sher Afghán told them that Nur Mahal and he , with their retinue , had taken up their residence in the Diwán 's house , the Englishmen wished to return forthwith to the caravansary .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 10]: But this the Persian would in no wise permit .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 48]: He sat late with them that evening , and , from words which fell now and then in the talk , they gathered that while he was even more enamored than ever of his wife the haughty beauty herself was far from being content with her lot .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 31]: `` She intended to be a queen , '' he sighed once , `` and , alas , my kingdom is too small and rude to suit her tastes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 26]: `` Why , then , did you not send her to Burdwán , and come here alone in deference to the king 's command ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 3]: asked Walter .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 9]: `` Because there she would pine in solitude .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 14]: Here , I have good hopes that Jahangir 's profligacy will disgust her .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 10]: Already I have heard grave rumors of court dissensions .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 13]: Saw you not to-day how ready were many to oppose him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 14]: `` Thank Heaven it was so , else naught could have saved us .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 6]: But what of the morrow ?
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 6]: You will incur constant danger .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 19]: As for us , we have well nigh abandoned all hope of gaining the reward of our venture .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 24]: Were it not for my stout-hearted friend we had endeavored long ere this to leave our fortunes a sunken ship in Agra . ''
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 5]: `` Say not so .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 25]: The shame of foregoing Akbar 's obligations would travel far , and the King can not afford to lose his good name with traders .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 5]: Bide on in content .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 19]: His mood changes each hour , and surely the day will come when he shall treat you royally .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 22]: I have good cause to hate Jahangir , yet I would never say of him that he is wholly ignoble . ''
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 25]: Their conversation was interrupted by a servant , who announced that a store of wine had been sent from the palace for the Feringhis .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 4]: `` Gad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 13]: cried Roger , `` that cat-footed servitor hath not forgotten my request .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 9]: And it is good liquor , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 18]: Sher Afghán was very suspicious of the gift until they apprised him of all that had happened .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 27]: Though he would not drink he smelt and tasted samples of the wine , which , apparently , had not been tampered with in any way .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 13]: His brow cleared when he convinced himself that no trick was intended .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 20]: `` I told you , '' he said , `` that Jahangir 's nature owed something to his lineage .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 21]: May Allah grant him wit enough to win me and others to his side by reason of his forebearance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 11]: With this magnanimous wish on his lips he quitted them .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 13]: They were fated soon to recall his words in bitterness and despair .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 42]: Jahangir , sunk in renewed orgy , and twitted by his evil associates with the failure of the afternoon 's device , was even then devoting himself , with an almost diabolical ingenuity , to a fresh plot for their undoing .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 32]: He limned the project fully , but declared with scorn that it needed a man of courage to carry it out , and there was not one such in his court .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 75]: Whereupon , Kutub-ud-din , his foster-brother , who was noted chiefly for the girth of his paunch , but who , nevertheless , had some reputation for personal bravery , sprang up from the cushions on which he reposed and cried : -- `` Give me the vice-royalty of Bengal and I swear , by the beard of the Prophet , to bring you news of Sher Afghán 's death ere day dawns . ''
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 4]: The Emperor paused .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 38]: It was a high price , but the memory of Nur Mahal 's beauty rushed on him like a flood , and he said : -- `` Keep thy vow and I shall keep my bond . ''
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 20]: The conspirators knew nothing of Roger 's pact with the chamberlain , else their task were made more easy .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 26]: But there is in India a poisonous herb called _ dhatura _ , the presence of which can not be detected in food or drink .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 33]: Taken in any considerable quantity , it conveys sure death , quick and painless as the venom of a cobra ; in less degree it induces lethargy , followed by heavy sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 68]: Now , Sher Afghán 's doubts of the Emperor 's wine were justified to this extent , that it had been slightly tinctured with _ dhatura _ , in the belief that Mowbray and Sainton would drink heavily during the midday meal , and thus be rendered slow of thought and sluggish in action when put to the test by the Persian 's encounter with the tiger .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 18]: Such drugs , thwarted by the unforeseen , oft have exactly the opposite effects to those intended .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 34]: Their state of rude health , and the exciting scenes which took place before the Emperor played his ultimate card and failed , caused the poison to stimulate rather than retard their faculties .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 7]: With night came reaction and weariness .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 18]: Nevertheless , they did not retire to rest until nearly an hour after Sher Afghán left them .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 60]: They drank a little more of the wine , discussed their doubtful position for the hundredth time , and thus unconsciously spun another strand in the spider 's web of fate , for Jahangir , whom fortune so aided , might have spent his life in vain conjecture ere he guessed the circumstance which in part defeated his malice .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 32]: While the two talked the glorious moon of India , late risen , sailed slowly across the blue arc of the heavens , and garbed all things in silver and black .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 46]: The air was chill , but these hardy Britons were warmly clad , and they preferred the cold majesty of nature 's own lamp to the evil-smelling oil and smoky wicks which , at that period , were the only means of lighting Indian houses .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 65]: When , at last , they stretched themselves on the charpoys which , for greater safety , they placed side by side in a spacious chamber of the suite they occupied , they did not undress , but threw off their heavy riding-boots , unfastened their coats , and arranged their swords so as to be ready to hand at a moment 's notice .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 17]: They knew that Sher Afghán 's trusty retainers guarded the gate and slept in each veranda .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 29]: There was little fear of being taken by surprise in the unlikely event of an armed attack being made during the night , yet they neglected no precautions .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 14]: `` Sleep well , Roger , and may the Lord keep thee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 41]: was Walter 's parting word ; and Sainton answered drowsily , for something more potent than the day 's emotions had wearied him : -- `` An He fail either of us , lad , naught else shall avail . ''
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 8]: The bright moon circled in the sky .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 30]: Her beams , low now on the horizon , penetrated to the recesses of the room and fell on the low trestle-beds on which they reposed in deep slumber .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 35]: It was a small matter , this nightly course of the luminary , yet , perchance , in those still hours , the direction of a stray shaft of light made history in India .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 67]: About two o'clock , when the tall cypress trees of the Garden of Heart 's Delight threw black shadows toward the house , a small , naked man , smeared with oil lest anyone should seize him , and covered again with dust to render him almost invisible , crawled along the dark pathway of the shadow and crossed the veranda outside the Englishmen 's room .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 44]: He moved with the deathly silence of a snake , passing between two sleeping Rajputs , so quickly and noiselessly that one who saw him would most likely have rubbed his eyes and deemed the flitting vision a mere figment of the imagination .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 25]: Once inside the house he crouched in the shade of a pillar , and waited until another ghoul joined him in the same manner .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 20]: These two were Thugs , murderers by caste , who worshiped the pickaxes with which they buried their victims .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 32]: Had Milton or Dante ever heard of such the abode of harpy-footed furies and the lowest circle of Inferno would alike have been rendered more horrific by a new demoniac imagery .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 14]: No man was safe from them , none could withstand their devilish art .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 31]: Sainton , whom not a score of Thugs could have pulled down in the open , was a mere babe in their clutch when he knew not of their presence .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 6]: For these fiends never failed .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 25]: They were professional stranglers , with sufficient knowledge of anatomy to dislocate the neck of him whom they had marked down as their prey .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 16]: Never a cry , scarce a movement , would betray a strong man 's death .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 18]: Of them it might indeed be truly said : -- Their fatal hands No second stroke intend .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 20]: Creeping stealthily , they reached the two charpoys , and each squatted at the back of his intended victim .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 16]: Sainton slept nearer the veranda , and his wide-brimmed hat was lying on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 25]: Throughout his wanderings he ever sported a plume of cock 's feathers and he still retained the curious ornament which served as a brooch .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 42]: It was lit up now by a moonbeam , and the Thug , whose watchful eyes regarded all things , saw what he took to be a headless snake , coiled in glistening folds and surrounded by a ring of gold .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 19]: The wretch , in whose dull brain glimmered some dim conception of a deity , drew back appalled .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 27]: Here was one guarded by his tutelary god , the snake , a snake , too , of uncanny semblance , reposing in a precious shrine .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 8]: He had never before encountered the like .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 24]: Weird legends , whispered at night in trackless forests , where he and his associates had their lair , trooped in on him .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 18]: He quaked , and shrank yet further away , a fierce savage tamed by a mere fossil .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 14]: The sibilant chirp of a grasshopper brought his fellow Thug to his side .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 16]: Glaring eyes and chin thrown forward sufficed to indicate the cause of this danger signal .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 5]: No words were needed .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 6]: With one accord they retreated .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 20]: Squirming across the veranda and along the path of the lengthening shadows they regained the shelter of the cypresses .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 14]: `` Brother , '' whispered one , `` they have a jadu ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 11]: -LSB- H -RSB- -LSB- Footnote H : An amulet . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 12]: `` Who shall dare to strike where the jungle-god reposes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 4]: was the rejoinder .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 11]: `` A snake without a head , ringed and shining !
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 7]: Saw one ever the like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 12]: `` Let us escape , else we shall be slain . ''
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 55]: The trees swallowed them , and , although sought vengefully , they were never seen again by those whose behests they had not fulfilled ... Minutes passed , until the stout Kutub-ud-din , hiding near the gate with a horde of hirelings , grew impatient that his vice-regal throne in Bengal was not assured .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 31]: So he growled an order and strode openly to the gate , where , in the Emperor 's name , he demanded of a wakeful sentry audience of Sher Afghán .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 10]: `` My master sleeps , '' was the answer .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 7]: `` The matter must wait . ''
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 6]: `` It can not wait .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 7]: It concerns thy master 's safety .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 21]: Here is Pir Muhammed Khan , Kotwal -LSB- I -RSB- of Agra , who says that two Thugs are within .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 17]: We have come in all haste to warn Sher Afghán to search for the evil-doers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 14]: -LSB- Footnote I : A functionary akin to a chief of police . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 30]: Now , the mere name of the dreaded clan was enough to alarm his hearer , who well knew that none could guard against a Thug 's deadly intent .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 19]: Warning his comrades he unbound the door , but showed discretion in sending messengers to arouse Sher Afghán .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 25]: Kutub-ud-din , thinking the Persian and the Englishmen had been killed half an hour earlier , deceived the guard still further by his earnestness .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 33]: Giving directions that some should watch the walls without , while others searched every inch of the gardens , he , followed by a strong posse , went rapidly towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 11]: Almost the first person he encountered was Sher Afghán himself .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 24]: The young nobleman , awakened from sound sleep by strange tidings , no sooner recognized his visitor than his brow seamed with anger .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 7]: `` What folly is this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 19]: `` Why hast thou dared to come hither with a rabble at such an hour , Kutub-ud-din ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 40]: Surprise , disappointment , envious rage , combined to choke the would-be viceroy , but he answered , boldly enough : -- `` You should not requite with hasty words one who thought to do thee a service . ''
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 11]: `` I am better without any service thou canst render .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 18]: Be off , dog , and tell thy tales to some old woman who fears them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 13]: Beside himself with anger and humiliation , Kutub-ud-din raised his sword threateningly .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 4]: It was enough .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 34]: Sher Afghán , seeing naught but some new palace treachery in this untimely visit , drew a dagger and sprang at his unwieldy opponent with the tiger-like ferocity for which he was famous .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 23]: Kutub-ud-din endeavored to strike , but , ere his blow fell , he was ripped so terribly that his bowels gushed forth .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 15]: Here was no vice-royalty for him , only the barren kingdom of the grave .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 5]: `` Avenge me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 25]: he yelled , as he fell in agony , for your would-be slayer is ever resentful of his own weapons being turned against him .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 66]: Pir Muhammed Khan , an astute Kashmiri , seeing his own advancement made all the more certain by reason of the failure of the Emperor 's foster-brother -- thinking , too , that Sher Afghán might be taken at a disadvantage whilst he looked down on his prostrate foe -- leaped forward and dealt the Persian a heavy stroke on the head with a scimitar .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 10]: Sher Afghán turned and killed him on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 43]: It chanced , unhappily , that among those in the immediate vicinity of this sudden quarrel the Kotwal 's retainers far outnumbered the followers of Sher Afghán , many of whose men were yet asleep , while others were scouring the gardens .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 31]: The native of India may always be trusted to avenge his master 's death , so a certain dog-like fidelity impelled a score or more to attack the Persian simultaneously .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 21]: Realizing his danger he possessed himself of the fallen Kotwal 's sword and fought furiously , crying loudly for help .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 25]: Oh , for a few lightning sweeps of the good straight blades reposing peacefully in their scabbards by the beds of his English allies !
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 12]: How they would have equalized the odds in that supreme moment !
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 25]: How Roger would have shorn the heads and Walter slit the yelling throats of the jackals who yelped around the undaunted but over-powered Persian !
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 20]: For the blood from the Kotwal 's blow poured into his eyes , and he struck blindly if fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 23]: Closer pressed the gang , and , at last , he fell to his knees , struck down by a matchlock bullet .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 11]: He must have felt that his last hour had come .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 24]: Struggling round in order to face towards Mecca , he used his waning strength to pick up some dust from the garden path .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 25]: He poured it over his head by way of ablution , strove to rise and renew the unequal fight , and sank back feebly .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 36]: A spear thrust brought the end , and the man who had dared to rival a prince 's love died in the garden to which the presence of Nur Mahal had lent romance and passion .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 31]: Roger , whom the clash of steel might have roused from the tomb , stirred uneasily in his sleep when the first sounds of the fight smote his unconscious ears .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 19]: The shot waked him , though not to thorough comprehension , so utterly possessed was he with drowsiness .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 58]: Then a light flashed in the room , and he saw a beautiful woman standing in an inner doorway , a woman whose exquisite face was white and tense as she held aloft a lamp and cried : -- `` Why do ye tarry here when my husband is fighting for his life and for yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 6]: Now he was wide awake .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 20]: It was Nur Mahal , unveiled and robed all in white , who stood there and spoke so vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 12]: Up he sprang , and roused Mowbray with his mighty grip .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 30]: The new conflict raging over Sher Afghán 's body was music in his ears , for several Rajputs had come , too late , to their master 's assistance .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 8]: `` God in heaven , lad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 15]: he roared , `` here 's a fray in full blast and we snoring .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 6]: Have at them , Walter !
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 7]: The pack is on us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 14]: His words , no less than a vigorous shaking , awoke his companion .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 7]: `` Oh , come speedily ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 5]: wailed Nur Mahal again .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 20]: `` I know not what is happening , but I heard my husband 's voice calling for aid . ''
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 17]: They needed no further bidding , though their eyes were strangely heavy and their bodies relaxed .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 19]: Once they were out in the night air and running toward the din of voices the stupor passed .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 50]: Yet , when they reached the main alley , where Sher Afghán lay dead , they knew not whom to strike nor whom to spare , so intermixed were the combatants and so confused the riot of ringing simitars , of hoarse shouts , of agonized appeals for mercy .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 31]: But Nur Mahal , quicker than they to distinguish between native and native , cried as she ran with them : -- `` My husband 's men wear white turbans .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 7]: All the others are strangers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 6]: They needed no further instruction .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 32]: When they saw a bare poll , a skull cap , or a dark turban , they hit it , and the battle , equal before , soon became one sided .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 10]: The presence of Roger alone determined the fight instantly .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 47]: Kutub-ud-din and the Kotwal had assured their supporters that the Feringhis were dead , and hinted , in vague terms , that the looting of the Diwán 's house would not be too strictly inquired into if the `` search '' for the Thugs were resisted .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 28]: But here was the terrific mass of the giant looming through the night , and here was his sword sweeping a six-foot swath in front of him .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 13]: No man who saw him waited for closer proof of his existence .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 24]: Soon the Garden of Heart 's Delight was emptied of the gang save those who were dead or too badly injured to crawl .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 5]: Then lights were brought .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 12]: Nur Mahal was the first to find her husband 's body .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 12]: She threw herself by his side in a gust of tears .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 4]: `` Alas ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 9]: she sobbed , `` they have slain him !
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 10]: It is my fault , O prince of men !
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 11]: What evil fate made thee wed me , Sher Afghán ?
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 19]: I vow to Allah , though I could not love thee living , I shall mourn thee dead .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 15]: Jahangir , if thou hast done this thing , bitterly shalt thou rue it !
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 18]: Oh , my husband , my husband , thou art fallen because of an unworthy woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 18]: It was with difficulty that Walter could persuade her to leave the corpse of the dead hero .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 18]: Tears choked her voice , and her self-reproach was heartrending , inasmuch as it was quite undeserved .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 46]: The distraught girl could not be blamed because a marriage planned for state reasons had not prospered , and even Mowbray , who was prejudiced against her , knew quite well that she was no party to this night attack against her father 's house .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 27]: Finally , he led her to the trembling serving-women who cowered within , and then addressed himself to an inquiry into all that had taken place .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 9]: Piece by piece , the tangle resolved itself .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 32]: At first , the references of the watchman at the gate , supported by certain wounded prisoners who gave testimony to the presence of Thugs in the garden , were puzzling .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 46]: But a Rajput , who knew the ways of these human gnomes , found a smear of oil and dust against the wall of the sahibs ' bedroom , and even traced their tracks , to some extent , by similar marks on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 26]: None could guess the reason of the Thugs ' failure , which was unprecedented , but the remainder of the sordid story was legible enough .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 18]: Two hours before dawn , Walter sent word to Nur Mahal that he wished to consult her .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 21]: She came instantly , and he noted , to his surprise , that she was garbed as for a journey .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 16]: He began to tell her what he had discovered , but soon she interrupted him .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 13]: `` I know all that , and more , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 12]: `` I can even tell you what will be done to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 19]: Jahangir will repudiate the deed , and execute those concerned in it whom he can lay hands on .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 7]: But you and I are doomed .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 10]: With Sher Afghán dead , who shall uphold us ?
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 7]: We have but one course open .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 11]: We must fly , if we would save our lives .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 13]: Let us go now , ere daybreak , and ride to Burdwán .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 21]: Once there , I can frame plans for vengeance , whilst you shall go to Calcutta , not unrewarded . ''
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 16]: The firmness of her tone astounded Mowbray as greatly as the nature of her proposal .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 31]: When he came to seek Roger 's advice he found that his friend had swung round to the view that it was hopeless now to seek redress from the Emperor .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 30]: The number and valor of Sher Afghán 's retainers gave some promise of security , and , once away from the capital , there was a chance of escape .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 39]: So Nur Mahal was told that they would adopt her counsel , and it was wonderful to see how a woman , in that hour of distress and danger , imposed her will on every man she encountered .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 29]: It was Nur Mahal who instructed certain servants of her father 's to see to the embalming of her husband 's body and its safe conveyance to Burdwán .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 21]: It was she who sent couriers to start the caravan of the Feringhis on a false trail back to Delhi .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 37]: It was she who arranged the details of the first march , forgetting nothing , but correcting even the most experienced of Sher Afghán 's lieutenants when he declared impossible that which she said was possible .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 43]: And finally , it was Nur Mahal who , after a last look at the face of him whom she revered more in death than in life , rode out again into the darkness , from the Garden of Heart 's Delight .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 34]: But , this time , Walter Mowbray and Roger Sainton rode with her , and those three , as it happened , held the future of India in the hollows of their hands .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 14]: CHAPTER XII `` Who ever loved that loved not at first sight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 10]: _ Marlowe _ , `` Hero and Leander . ''
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 36]: Of all the perils encountered by Walter Mowbray since he left his home in Wensleydale , there was none so impalpable , and therefore none so mortal , as the daily companionship of Nur Mahal .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 20]: She used no wiles , practised no arts -- her subtle mesmerism was the unseen power of the lodestone .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 10]: At first , there never was woman more retiring .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 27]: Mowbray and Sainton were seldom absent from her side ; nevertheless , she spoke only when the exigencies of the journey demanded a few simple words .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 23]: The horror of Sher Afghán 's death seemed to weigh on her heart , and her natural vivacity was almost wholly eclipsed .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 35]: Yet her face would kindle with a rare smile when acknowledging some trivial act , and the fragrance of her presence might be likened to the scent of roses in a garden by night .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 15]: It was there , ravishing the very air , whilst its source remained invisible .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 68]: Though she rode fast during many a weary hour , and bore without a murmur hardships under which her more robust waiting women sank , one by one , until five out of eight were perforce left to recuperate in various small towns passed on the way , she never lost that wondrous sense of delightful femininity which constituted her chief attraction and her most dangerous allurement .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 60]: In guiding , counselling , controlling , her intellect was crystal ice , but let any man render her a service , let him help her to dismount or bring her a cup of water , and , with the touch of her hand , the flash of her deep violet eyes , she thrilled him to the core .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 51]: It was natural that Walter should be her attendant cavalier on many such occasions , a fact greatly to be regretted in the interests of Nellie Roe , whose saucy blue eyes and golden locks were too far away to deaden completely the effect of Nur Mahal 's bewitching personality .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 16]: And , truth to tell , England had a somewhat shadowy aspect in those days .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 39]: After three years of sojourn in the East , here were Mowbray and his faithful companion no better off than when they rode along the North Road into London one fair summer 's afternoon to seek their fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 17]: Then they had their swords , some equipment , and a few crowns in their pockets .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 31]: Their case was even worse in this semi-barbarous land , for their worldly goods were not enhanced , while they themselves were fugitives from the spleen of a vengeful tyrant !
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 14]: Not even Roger was proof against the magic of Nur Mahal 's smile .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 53]: At the close of the third march , when their leg-weary horses were unable to reach the hamlet of Mainpura , the intended goal of the night , they camped under a tope of trees , lit fires , and proceeded to make themselves as comfortable as circumstances permitted until the dawn .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 26]: Nur Mahal , having taken leave of them with her accustomed grace , rested in a small tent which was carried by a pack animal .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 46]: Mowbray and Sainton sat on saddles piled near a fire , and Roger showed the trend of his thoughts by asking : -- `` Is it in your mind , Walter , to tarry long in Burdwán after we have brought my lady thither ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 6]: `` How can I answer ?
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 9]: We are but a degree removed from beggars .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 20]: If she gives us the wherewithal to journey speedily to Calcutta , why should we remain at Burdwán ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 8]: `` You parry one question with another .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 23]: I may be much mistaken , yet I doubt if my lady sought our escort for the sake of the journey . ''
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 36]: Mowbray , who was striving to burnish a rusted bit , looked sharply at his big comrade , whose broad red face , propped on his hands , was clearly revealed by the dancing flames .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 11]: `` Out with it , Roger , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 16]: `` Thou hast not been so chary of thy words for many a year . ''
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 25]: `` Well , to be plain , '' said the other , `` I think yon bonny head is well dowered wi ' brains .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 18]: Here is a land where wit , wedded to a good sword , can win its way .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 55]: Were you and she married -- nay , jump not in that fashion , like a trout on a hook , else I may deem the fly well thrown -- were you and she married , I say , she is just a likely sort of quean to carve out a kingdom for herself .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 44]: Here you have Mahmouds , Rajputs , Hindustanis , Bengalis , and the Lord knows what hotch-potch of warring folk , each at variance with the other , and all united against a galling yoke such as may fairly be expected from Jahangir !
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 32]: Why , man , were you lord of Burdwán and husband of Nur Mahal , you might run through India like a red hot cinder through a tub of butter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 10]: Mowbray breathed hard on the steel in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 28]: `` Roger , '' he said , `` had you not eaten half a kid an hour gone I would have dosed you for a fever . ''
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 22]: `` Aye , aye , make a jibe of it , but there 's many a true word spoken in jest .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 38]: If King Cophetua could woo a beggar-maid , the devil seize me if it be not more likely that the beauty tucked up under yonder canvas should make pace with a fine swaggering blade like thyself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 8]: `` Thou art too modest , Roger .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 22]: If she wants a hammer wherewith to beat out an empire , where could she find a mallet to equal thee ?
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 28]: And is it not reasonable to suppose , if such were her intent , she would have furthered the aims of our poor friend , Sher Afghán ?
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 15]: He was of her own people , and would soon find a backing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 36]: `` It seems that any man will suit her needs save the one she fancies , '' said Roger drily , and , to Mowbray 's exceeding relief , he pursued the matter no further .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 58]: Yet the notion throve on certain doubts which it must have found imbedded in Walter 's own mind , and , next day , with memories of Nellie Roe very tender in his heart , now that all chance of wedding her was lost in gloom , he avoided Nur Mahal as thoroughly as politeness would admit .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 18]: She gave no sign of discontent , but suffered him to go his new gait in silence .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 52]: Once , indeed , when he made to help her onto her Arab horse , she sprang to the saddle ere he could approach , and , at night , when she parted from him and Roger with a few pleasant words , a fold of her veil screened her face .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 62]: It were idle to pretend that Mowbray was in his usual happy vein during this part of the journey , and when , at the next evening 's halt , Nur Mahal signified that after Sainton and he had eaten she would be glad of some conversation with them , he was , if not elated , certainly much more cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 29]: She received them with smiling gravity , and bade them be seated on stools which her servants had procured in the village where their little camp was pitched .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 17]: She herself reclined on a number of furs which served as a couch when she slept .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 22]: They noticed that her dress , which , by some marvel , was white and fresh , was devoid of ornament .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 38]: Indian widows wear purple , but the exigencies of the hour might well excuse this neglect of custom , and , for that matter , Nur Mahal was not one to pay any heed to such ordinances .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 27]: `` I have fancied , '' she said , addressing Roger , `` that you are not wholly satisfied with this present journey , Sainton-sahib . ''
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 37]: Now , Roger was so taken aback by this side stroke that he blurted out : -- `` In the name of your excellent prophet , Princess , why do you charge this to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 8]: She flashed her star-like eyes on Mowbray .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 6]: `` Perhaps I am mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 17]: Is it you , Mowbray-sahib , who would gladly be quit of my poor company ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 21]: The attack on Roger had prepared him , as , indeed , Nur Mahal may have meant that it should .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 23]: `` Your Highness , '' he said , `` has some good motive in stating a belief which would otherwise be incredible .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 5]: What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 10]: She sighed , and answered not for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 16]: Maybe she wished Walter had been more confused and , by consequence , more lover-like .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 13]: But , when she spoke , her sweet voice was well controlled .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 15]: The affair was of slight import from all the index that her manner gave .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 16]: `` A woman 's mind is oft like a smooth lake , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 23]: `` It mirrors that which it sees , but a little puff of wind will distort the image into some quaint conceit .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 4]: Let that pass .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 14]: My object in seeking your presence has naught to do with idle thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 32]: To-morrow , an hour after sunrise , we reach that point on the road whence one track leads to the Ganges , and to Calcutta , and the other to Burdwán .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 37]: It will , I do not doubt , be better for you to make your way to the river , and leave me and my wretched fortunes to the hazard which the future has in store .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 57]: I am greatly beholden to you for all that you have done in the past , and it grieves me sorely that this journey , taken so unexpectedly , leaves me so short of money that I can only offer you a sum which is barely sufficient for the expenses of the voyage down the Ganges .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 34]: But I have in my possession a goodly store of jewels , and in Calcutta , or in your own country , there are merchants who will buy them at a fair price .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 31]: Take them , and be not angered with me , for I would not have you go away thinking that my acquaintance had brought you naught but ill luck . ''
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 22]: From beneath a fold of her _ sari _ she produced a small cedar wood box which she offered to Walter .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 10]: He sprang to his feet , with face aflame .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 47]: `` I may be only a poor merchant , Princess , '' he cried , `` but I have yet to learn from your own lips what word or deed of mine leads you to believe that I would rob a woman of her diamonds . ''
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 33]: `` Ohé , '' she wailed , with a very pleasing pout , `` how have I offended your lordship , and who talks of robbery where a free gift is intended ?
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 25]: Tell me , you whom they call Hathi-sahib , see you aught amiss in taking the only valuable articles I can presently bestow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 5]: `` Please God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 38]: said Roger , `` we shall set you and your gems safe within the walls of Burdwán ere we turn our faces towards Calcutta , and that is all my friend Walter meant by his outburst . ''
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 44]: Her eyes fell until the long lashes swept the peach bloom of her cheeks , for the physical difficulties of the journey , instead of exhausting her , had added to her beauty by tinting with rose the lily white of her complexion .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 6]: `` Is that so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 26]: she murmured , and Walter , who knew that she questioned him , said instantly : -- `` No other thought entered our minds . ''
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 5]: `` It is well .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 14]: I shall retain my trinkets a little while longer , it seems . ''
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 33]: She laughed quietly , with a note of girlish happiness in her mirth that he had not caught since the day of their first meeting in the Garden of Heart 's Delight .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 30]: `` Now that you have repaired my imagined loss , '' she said , `` will you not be seated again , and tell me something of your country .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 13]: I have heard that women there differ greatly from us in India .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 5]: Are they very pretty ?
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 9]: Do they grow tall , like Sainton-sahib ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 14]: Here was a topic from which their talk might branch in any direction .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 49]: Soon Walter was telling her of his mother , of life in London and the North , while a chance reference to his father led up to the story of Dom Geronimo 's crime , and the implacable hatred he bore towards even the son of his victim .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 12]: Nur Mahal followed the references to the Jesuit with close interest .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 40]: When Mowbray would have passed to some other subject she interrupted him , and clapped her hands as a signal to one of her women , whom she bade summon Jai Singh , the Rajput chief of her guard .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 17]: `` What was the story you heard on the road as we returned to Agra ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 9]: she asked when the rissalder stood before her .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 25]: `` It dealt with certain Christian priests who dwell in that city , and with others at Hughli , if I mistake not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 34]: `` A dervish , who sought some grain , maharáni , told us that Jahangir was privately minded to seize all the black robes because they encouraged the Portuguese traders to greater boldness .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 28]: He ever counseled the great Akbar to that effect , but the Emperor , his father , was too tolerant towards the Feringhis to listen to him .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 24]: Now , said the dervish , Jahangir would make all the men good Mahomedans and send their young women to the zenana . ''
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 15]: `` You hear , '' she said , as Jai Singh saluted and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 36]: `` Jahangir is opposed to strangers , and it is quite probable he harbors some such project , which he has discoursed with the _ moullahs _ , being anxious to win their favor . ''
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 21]: `` But the crow was standing by his side when we went to the palace , '' put in Roger .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 6]: `` That may well be .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 19]: If this man spoke evil against you , Jahangir would listen , though his own purpose remained unchanged .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 15]: I had this in my mind when you spoke of going to Calcutta . ''
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 17]: `` When you spoke of sending us thither to-morrow , you mean , '' cried Walter .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 53]: `` I should have warned you , '' she replied , but her hearers saw another purpose behind her words , because anything in the shape of a disturbance on the Hughli rendered it very necessary that they should tarry at Burdwán and avoid the river route until the trouble was ended .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 22]: Again , a sense of distrust welled up in Mowbray 's breast , but Nur Mahal 's soft voice allayed it .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 27]: `` It must not be forgotten , '' she said , `` that affairs at Agra may cause the King to forego the folly he contemplates .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 44]: Khusrow , his brother , has many adherents , and if Jahangir , as I am told is true , devotes his waking hours to wine and dissolute companions , he shall not long retain the throne his father built so solidly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 8]: Both men recalled Sher Afghán 's words .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 37]: How strange it was that his wife , who had not quitted the walls of Dilkusha during the few hours of her recent tenancy , should be so well informed as to events in the palace .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 3]: Walter laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 41]: `` If I could not see your face and hear your voice , '' he cried , '' ` twere easy to believe it was the Diwán , and not his incomparable daughter , who spoke with such wisdom . ''
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 3]: `` Incomparable !
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 6]: It is an idle word .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 4]: Who is incomparable ?
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 21]: Not I. Assuredly there is a maid beyond the sea whose attractions far outweigh mine in your estimation , Mowbray-sahib .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 13]: Nay , seek not for some adroit phrase to flatter and mislead .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 36]: Men tell me I am beautiful , but there never yet was rose in a garden which the next south wind did not help to destroy while fanning its budding rival into greater charm . ''
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 29]: She spoke with a vehemence that caused Roger , who followed her poetic Persian simile with difficulty , to believe that Walter had said something to vex her .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 10]: `` What ails thy tongue to-night , lad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 5]: he cried in English .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 15]: `` It is not wont to rasp so harshly on such fair substance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 18]: `` You disturb my comrade , '' said Mowbray , glancing covertly into the girl 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 9]: `` He thinks I have offended you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 11]: She flung a quick glance at Sainton , and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 27]: Some pleasant quip was on her lips , but , in that instant , the hoof-beats of horses , hard ridden , came to their ears .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 13]: In the present state of the fugitives , the sound was ominous .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 9]: At once the men were on their feet .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 43]: Mowbray bade Nur Mahal retire to her tent , an order which she was slow to obey , and then betook himself to the disposal of his small force , lest , perchance , the distant galloping signaled the approach of pursuers .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 36]: The night was dark but clear , the only light being that of the stars , and it was strange indeed that any party of horse should ride with such speed over a broken road .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 21]: It was essential that the nature of the cavalcade should be ascertained before it was permitted to come too close .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 16]: Flight was not to be thought of , owing to the condition of the horses .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 24]: If the newcomers were the Emperor 's minions the only way to avoid capture was to show a bold front and strike first .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 21]: Rissalder Jai Singh was ordered to mount and ride forward with two sowars to bring the party to a halt .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 26]: If they were strangers , of peaceable intent , he would courteously request them to pass , after explaining the necessity of the precautions taken .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 63]: Were they the King 's men , he was to demand a parley with their leader , failing which , he and his companions must turn and ride at top speed towards the village , giving the defending force , stationed under a clump of trees on both sides of the road , an opportunity to ambush the enemy on both flanks .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 27]: It was a hasty scheme , evolved so hurriedly that Jai Singh cantered off while as yet the invisible horsemen were quarter of a mile away .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 31]: Mowbray and Sainton , adjusting their sword-belts , stood on the road between their men and listened for the first sounds which should indicate the reception given to the rissalder .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 35]: Suddenly Roger said : `` Lest harm should befall Nur Mahal , is it not better that you should take a couple of horses and lead her to some point removed from the track ?
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 33]: Then , if this force overwhelms us , you have a chance of escape , whereas the presence of one sword more or less will make slight difference to the odds . ''
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 21]: `` Did I think you meant what you have said , you and I should quarrel , '' retorted Walter .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 11]: `` Sooner would my right hand quarrel with the left .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 6]: Yet my counsel is good .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 20]: Whilst one of us lives she is not wholly bereft , and you are the lad of her choosing .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 21]: I ' faith , if she showed me such preference , I 'd take a similar offer from thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 20]: `` You are not wont to anticipate disaster , Roger , nor yet to frame such clumsy excuse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 13]: `` I have never before been so mixed up with a woman .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 10]: Argue not , Walter , but away with her .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 12]: I 'll strike more freely if I ken you are safe .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 7]: It is good generalship , too .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 24]: She is the treasure they seek , and she should not be left to the hazard of a rough-and-tumble in the dark . ''
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 12]: `` Then let her ride alone if she be so minded .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 19]: We have fought side by side too often , Roger , that we should be separated now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 16]: Sainton 's huge hand reached out in the gloom and gripped his comrade 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 15]: `` Gad , Walter , '' he growled , `` thou art tough oak .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 34]: Least said is soonest mended , but the notion jumbles in my thick head that Nur Mahal will surely be a quean , and that thou art fated to help in her crowning .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 2]: Hark !
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 4]: What now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 20]: They heard Jai Singh 's loud challenge , followed by the confused halting of a large body of horse .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 14]: The clang of arms and the champing of bits came to them plainly .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 30]: The distance was too great to distinguish voices at an ordinary pitch , but it was reasonable to suppose that Jai Singh was conversing with some one in authority .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 8]: They were not kept long in suspense .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 12]: A few horsemen advanced slowly , Jai Singh at their head .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 4]: `` Sahiba ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 23]: he called , when close at hand , `` there is one here who would converse with your Lordships in privacy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 32]: Although the fealty of a Rajput to his salt can never be doubted , there was a chance that Jai Singh might have been deluded into an exhibition of false confidence .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 43]: Walter , therefore , ordered his little force to march close behind Roger and himself , but when he saw that Jai Singh and the two sowars were accompanied by only one man he knew that his suspicions were not well founded .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 26]: The stranger was the Chief Eunuch of Jahangir 's court , and the mere presence of such a functionary betrayed the object of the pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 6]: He dismounted and salaamed deeply .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 15]: `` Praised be the name of Allah that this undertaking nears its close ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 15]: he cried , his queer , cracked voice rising and falling in irregular falsetto .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 19]: `` Seldom have men and never has a woman ridden so fast and far during so many days .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 40]: Had not those whom you left on the way assured me that you were truly before me , I had returned to Agra long since , though my head might have paid the forfeit of a fruitless errand . ''
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 17]: The Chief Eunuch , important official though he was , commanded little respect from other men .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 23]: Even the manner of Jai Singh 's announcement of his presence betrayed the contempt with which creatures of his type were held .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 22]: So Walter said , sternly enough : -- `` The length of the journey might well serve to condense thy speech .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 9]: Hast thou brought some message from the Emperor ?
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 8]: If so , out with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 40]: `` Honored one , I am charged to escort the Princess Nur Mahal back to Agra , where , sayeth my Lord , the King , she can dwell in peace and content in her father 's house . ''
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 7]: `` What sayeth the capon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 38]: demanded Roger , who caught the peremptory tone of the man 's words and was minded to clout him , for such a menial is apt to become unconsciously insolent when he carries his master 's commands .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 10]: Mowbray 's restraining hand warned Roger not to interfere .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 6]: `` Is that all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 6]: he said with ominous calm .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 8]: `` No , protector of the poor .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 13]: The Emperor Jahangir sends his compliments to you and to the Hathi-sahib .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 38]: He says that if you return with the Princess you shall be received with all honor , paid in full , and forwarded , at his proper charge , to Ajmere on the road to Bombay . ''
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 11]: `` And if we refuse the King 's offer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 8]: `` Why should you refuse , sahib ?
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 21]: My Lord , the King , is wroth that any should dare act as did that foolish man , Kutub-ud-din .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 27]: All those who took part in the attack on Sher Afghán have been impaled alive on the road leading from Dilkusha to the bridge of boats .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 15]: I and my companions rode between their writhing bodies as we quitted Agra . ''
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 25]: `` It were foolish to distrust so just a monarch , yet what say you if we choose rather to proceed to Burdwán ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 8]: The Chief Eunuch suddenly became very humble .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 11]: `` I am only an envoy , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 26]: `` Behind , there are two hundred soldiers , mounted on the best horses in the King 's stables and commanded by a valiant officer .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 11]: Behind them , there is the might of the Empire .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 18]: I pray you believe that my Lord , Jahangir , means to do well by you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 36]: There is an Indian story of a crocodile inviting a lamb to inspect his beautiful teeth as he lay with his mouth open , but the messenger 's fair words placed Walter in a quandary .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 62]: Obviously , he must consult Nur Mahal ere he returned the answer which was ready enough on his lips , for he thought that the two hundred , however valiant their officer , would never dare to attack half the number of stalwart Rajputs trained by Sher Afghán , especially when they knew that they must also encounter the terrible Man-Elephant .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 13]: As for the King 's armies , Burdwán was a far cry .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 18]: -LSB- Illustration : `` If we go to Burdwán are you content to abide there ? '' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 12]: `` Bide you here , Roger , '' he muttered shortly .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 10]: `` Keep things as they are until I return .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 8]: I go to seek Nur Mahal . ''
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 39]: A cloaked woman , who had passed silently between the line of soldiers on the road , and who heard each word of the dialogue , evidently guessed what Walter said , though he used English to Sainton .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 9]: She darted forward now and clasped his arm .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 20]: Even before she spoke he knew who it was , for the mere touch of her fingers thrilled him .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 6]: `` I am here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 3]: she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 6]: `` Let us draw apart .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 11]: I have that to say which is best said now .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 17]: One of us two must answer that man , and we gain naught by delay . ''
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 27]: By the roadside grew a field of millet , the sparse crop of some poor ryot in the village who cared little for kings or courts .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 24]: He would grin with amaze if told that his small holding formed the council-chamber in which was settled the affairs of a nation .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 30]: Yet it was so in very truth , for Nur Mahal led Mowbray into the midst of the standing crop until they were out of earshot of the others .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 39]: Then she turned towards him , and there was a rapture in her face which was bewildering , though the way in which she still clung to his arm caused the warm blood to tingle in his veins .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 24]: `` Tell me , '' she murmured softly ; `` if we go to Burdwán , are you content to abide there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 26]: CHAPTER XIII `` A man that hath friends must show himself friendly ; and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother . ''
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 3]: _ Prov .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 3]: _ xviii .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 2]: 24 .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 12]: That man would be a fool who pretended to misunderstand her .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 10]: She would have said more , but words failed .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 22]: Her labored breath betrayed her , and the light that kindles only in a woman 's eyes leaped out at him .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 14]: He seemed to be wandering in a maze with a siren as guide .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 6]: What magic spell surrounded him ?
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 22]: Why had the arrival of Jahangir 's messenger forced this tacit avowal from the lips of the proudest woman in India ?
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 36]: If she defied the Emperor and continued the journey to Burdwán , it must be as the promised wife of Walter Mowbray , an alien in race , and one who professed a hostile faith .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 7]: Never was stranger compact dreamed of .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 19]: They knew little of each other , beyond the acquaintance arising from an enforced companionship of five days .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 8]: They scarce had a thought in common .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 15]: They were bred and reared under social conditions as wide asunder as the poles .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 29]: Nature , indeed , careless of arbitrary restrictions , had fashioned them in superb comparison , for never were man and woman better mated physically than these two .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 29]: But the law which parts the East from the West divided them , and , although Nur Mahal would have scorned the unseen barrier , Mowbray drew back .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 43]: Assuredly , there is no knowing what his answer would have been had not another face risen before his entranced vision , and a despairing voice cried bitterly in his ears : `` Oh , Ann , they have taken him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 27]: Yes , though far from Spanish halberds and London Tower , here was lifelong bondage chaining him with a glamour more enduring than fetters of iron .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 38]: It says much for the charms of Eleanor Roe that the memory of her anguish when last their eyes met on the Thames-side quay rescued her lover now from the imminent embrace of a most potent rival .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 8]: It was no time for measured phrase .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 17]: His heart rose in pity as he took Nur Mahal in his arms for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 44]: `` Sweet lady , '' he said , `` were I not pledged to one whom I hold dear as my very soul I would abide with you in Burdwán , and my sword should defend you while my hand could use it .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 8]: But no man can gainsay his fate .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 14]: He can only keep his conscience clean and leave the rest to God .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 22]: I came to India hoping to earn a fortune wherewith I could return to my own land and claim my love .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 16]: I have failed , yet my purpose will endure until I succeed or die . ''
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 38]: He felt the shrinking form he held shake with a sob , and he would have striven to comfort her with some faltering prediction of future happiness had she not raised her beautiful face in wild appeal .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 14]: `` I have not humbled myself in vain , '' she fiercely cried .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 19]: `` You must not deem me unworthy because I have departed from the path ordained for my sex .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 12]: I am no timid maid who nurses her woes in secret .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 16]: It may be that I am incapable of feeling that which other women call love .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 14]: Never was man more deserving of true and faithful wife than Sher Afghán .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 5]: Yet I hated him .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 10]: You are one whom I could trust and honor .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 12]: Had the fates willed it we should have gone far together .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 7]: Now I yield to my destiny .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 2]: Go !
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 4]: It is ended .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 36]: If I never see your face again , at least think well of me , and strive to forget that , in a moment of folly , I sacrificed my self-respect for your sake . ''
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 31]: And now she struggled to free herself , but , because of his true regard for her , he would not suffer her to leave him in such self-condemning mood .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 17]: `` Nay , fair lady , '' he murmured , `` we do not part thus .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 16]: I have misjudged you in the past ; be it mine now to make amends .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 19]: You were wedded against your will , yet who shall hold you guilty of your husband 's death ?
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 22]: Be assured that none in all this land shall shield your high repute as I and my honest comrade , Sainton .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 32]: Lead us to your State , and if Sher Afghán 's followers prove faithful to his widow 's cause , Jahangir may wreck his throne in seeking to injure you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 17]: Again she lifted her wondrous face to his , and tears were glistening in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 21]: Yet , in the dim light of the open field he fancied he saw a piteous smile dimple her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 10]: `` Spare me your vows , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 18]: `` Keep them for her whose love is so strong that it binds you beyond the seas .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 8]: And now , let us return . ''
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 16]: She looked up at him so wistfully that he yielded to impulse and kissed her .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 15]: Perchance her heart fluttered with the thought that she had won , after all .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 20]: But Mowbray was adamant in his faith , and his was the kiss of pity , not of passion .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 36]: `` I shall never know peace again , '' he cried , `` until you are well content that I am pledged to another , and even wish her well of a poor bargain . ''
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 21]: `` Then you are doomed to a life of misery , for that shall never be , '' she retorted .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 7]: `` Say not so , Princess .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 9]: Your name alone was chosen with wondrous wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 16]: It marks out one who has but to seek a throne to obtain it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 9]: `` Ah , is that your secret thought ?
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 11]: Strange , indeed that it should pair with mine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 18]: She wrenched herself free from his embrace , and ran a little way back through the millet .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 32]: Then she stopped , and there was the wonted imperious ring in her voice as she cried : -- `` A moment ago you undertook to defend me from my enemies .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 12]: Swear , then , that you will obey my wishes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 16]: `` In all things which concern your welfare -- '' `` Fear not , Mowbray-sahib .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 9]: I offer myself twice to no man . ''
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 20]: Her quick transition from melting femininity to stern dominance surprised him as greatly as aught that had gone before .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 6]: It relieved him , too .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 22]: Who could deny the truth of Nur Mahal 's estimate of herself , that she was not like unto other women ?
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 5]: `` I swear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 11]: he said , wondering what new madness possessed her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 8]: 'T is well , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 12]: `` I shall soon put your fealty to the test . ''
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 24]: Without another word , she passed to the road , where Sainton 's giant figure towered among the group of men and horses .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 22]: Her quick eyes discovered Jahangir 's messenger , and she addressed him as if he were a servant of lowest rank .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 4]: `` Ibrahim ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 19]: she cried , `` did thy master , the Emperor , give thee thy charge in writing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 6]: The Chief Eunuch bowed obsequiously .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 32]: `` Knowing your repute for exceeding discernment , '' he said , `` I even asked the Emperor of the World -LSB- J -RSB- to honor me with his written command .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 7]: I carry it with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 15]: -LSB- Footnote J : A literal translation of the name `` Jahangir . '' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 7]: `` Follow me to the village .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 8]: There we can procure a light . ''
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 25]: Whatever purpose she had in mind she gave no sign of her intent until she had perused the script which Ibrahim handed to her .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 59]: Mowbray , watching her mobile features as she broke the seal of the Emperor 's parchment , whilst one of her women held a lantern , saw only an expression of fixed resolve , her set lips and thoughtful eyes revealing a determination to carry out in the best way the course upon which she had already decided .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 43]: She read Jahangir 's letter twice before she spoke , and , even then , there was an odd restraint in her manner when she addressed Mowbray and Sainton , who , with the Chief Eunuch , had accompanied her in silence .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 15]: `` Jahangir told his envoy the chief part of that which he has written .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 14]: Ibrahim 's message is exact in so far as it touches your affairs .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 14]: I will fulfil the Emperor 's behests in all save one slight matter .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 7]: You must not return to Agra .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 35]: The Ganges lies a short march ahead , and , now that I have Jahangir 's written promise to pay you , there is no reason why I should not discharge his obligations . ''
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 16]: `` I have brought no great store of money , '' put in Ibrahim nervously .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 8]: `` Said I aught to thee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 6]: she blazed out at him .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 16]: `` It will be thy turn to speak when the Emperor demands a witness . ''
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 14]: `` Do you revert to a proposal which we have once refused ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 11]: asked Walter , with Saxon doggedness frowning in his face .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 15]: `` I revert to your promise given me quarter of an hour ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 17]: `` I swore to obey you , but -- '' `` Obey then , without question .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 22]: Since you force me to it , I command you to accept my jewels in payment of the Emperor 's debt .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 10]: A lakh and a half , is it not ?
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 12]: If you are not cheated , they are worth as much .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 17]: Further , I advise you to retain a score of my men until you reach Calcutta .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 35]: They will follow you , I doubt not , but , to make certain of their allegiance , I shall promise them a good reward if they return bearing me a letter from you .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 20]: They can not deceive me , as I shall have your signature on the receipt for the money . ''
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 27]: `` In truth , Princess , 't is easy to see that you are the daughter of the High Treasurer , '' broke in Roger suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 47]: Nur Mahal 's tense expression relaxed for an instant ; nevertheless , Walter , vexed that he should be forced into a settlement exceedingly repulsive to his feelings , asked gloomily : -- `` What other of the Emperor 's requests do you carry out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 12]: `` I go back to the Garden of Heart 's Delight .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 8]: You spoke just now of fortunate names .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 7]: Is it not happily entitled ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 48]: The quiet scorn of the question revealed to him an utter hopelessness which was so greatly at variance with her confident mien during their flight that not even the scene which took place in the field of millet served to explain it wholly to his puzzled brain .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 25]: In the presence of the rabbit-eared Chief Eunuch it was not advisable to say too much , but he could not forbear a comment .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 18]: `` I have heard you describe a woman 's mind as a lake , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 33]: `` Will you forgive me if I liken it to a whirlpool , in which thoughts flowing in one direction at one moment , fly in the opposite way the next . ''
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 13]: She laughed lightly , though the joy had gone from her mirth .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 11]: `` You still would have me go to Burdwán ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 11]: `` Yes ; and I care not who hears . ''
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 17]: `` Nor do I , for the Emperor bids me return , and I am dutiful .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 12]: Who could deny the wish of so benignant a prince ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 13]: `` Burdwán without a husband is not to your liking , perchance .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 46]: It would be dry meat , anyhow , as the fellow said after coursing a hare and losing it , '' said Roger , who , for a cause best known to himself , attempted to deprive the undercurrent of their speech of its vinegar .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 23]: `` Spare us such ill-timed jokes , '' growled Mowbray angrily in English , but Roger only answered : -- `` Gad !
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 17]: if the quip run not with thy humor , leg it after the hare again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 22]: Walter realized that his level-headed comrade appreciated the situation sanely , and was , indeed , advising him how to act .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 10]: Yet he was torn by a thousand conflicting emotions .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 13]: That field of millet had been to him a bed of nettles .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 10]: He was still smarting from the sting of recollection .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 25]: If Nur Mahal offered herself twice to no man , assuredly she was a woman whom few men would refuse at the first asking .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 10]: And to what purpose had he thrust her away ?
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 17]: For all he knew to the contrary , Nellie Roe might be married these two years .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 12]: He had conversed with that sprightly maid during half a day .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 6]: He had kissed her once .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 44]: He had seen her fall fainting into the arms of Anna Cave , as any girl might have done who witnessed the arrest of a young cavalier for whom she felt a passing regard and whose ill fortunes were incurred in her behalf .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 13]: Frail bonds , these , to hold in leash a warm-blooded youth !
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 16]: His adventurous soul spurred him on to follow the career which Nur Mahal offered him .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 24]: In those days , when the world was young , a stout heart and a ready sword were a man 's chief credentials .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 39]: In no land did they lead to the Paradise of happy chance more readily than in India , where the golden fruit of the pagoda tree was ever ripe for him who dared to shake a laden branch .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 23]: And yet , and yet -- a lover 's kiss in an English garden withheld him from the glamour of it all .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 25]: It was fortunate , perhaps , in that hour of fiercest temptation , that Nur Mahal was too proud to stoop again to conquer .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 18]: There were not wanting signs to her quick intelligence that Mowbray was fighting with beasts at Ephesus .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 32]: Yet she disdained , by word or look , to join the contest , and it may be that her Eastern brain conceived a more subtle way of achieving her object .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 15]: She brought forth the little box of cedar wood and handed it to Walter .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 28]: `` Take heed , Ibrahim , '' she said , `` that I have given the sahiba diamonds to the value of a lakh and a half .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 16]: You shall prepare a full quittance for the Emperor , and Mowbray-sahib shall sign it .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 4]: Be speedy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 13]: She gave Walter a quick look from those wonderful eyes of hers .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 19]: `` Whilst Ibrahim inscribes the receipt , '' she continued , `` you should choose your attendants . ''
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 6]: `` At this hour ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 4]: `` Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 10]: When an Emperor is urgent the night becomes day .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 10]: I begin the march back to Agra forthwith . ''
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 20]: Even the wearied Chief Eunuch would have protested , but she did not deign to heed his stammering words .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 26]: It took Ibrahim some time to write all Jahangir 's titles on the parchment which set forth Nur Mahal 's settlement of Akbar 's debt .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 37]: When the last flourish was drawn , and Mowbray had appended his name to the script , with Roger 's cross as agreeing to the same , the masterful lady herself was equipped for the road .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 20]: She sought no private leave-taking of the man whom , an hour earlier , she was willing to espouse .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 13]: Before them all , she curtsied most gracefully to the two Englishmen .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 9]: `` Farewell , sahiba , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 7]: `` May Allah prosper you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 7]: And with that she was gone .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 23]: Ere they were fully resolved that this was , indeed , the end , they heard the hoof-beats of her retreating cavalcade .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 21]: Soon they knew , from the distant commotion , that the Emperor 's troopers were withdrawing to their last camping-place .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 28]: Mowbray , a prey to thoughts which he could ill control , stood with Sainton a little apart from the cluster of mud huts adjoining their bivouac .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 50]: Roger , sympathizing with the stress of his comrade 's reflections , gazed at the stars and softly whistled a few bars of an air popular in the North : `` O , do ye ken Elsie Marley , honey -- The wife that sells the barley , honey ?
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 20]: For Elsie Marley 's grown so fine , She wëan ' t get up to feed the swine . ''
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 27]: But Jai Singh , who had elected to go with them to Calcutta , did not scruple to break in on his new master 's reverie .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 26]: To him , no matter what the comedy played by his mistress , one woman more or less in the world was of little import .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 12]: `` Do we , too , march to-night , sahib ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 14]: he asked , when he discovered Mowbray on the outskirts of the hamlet .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 9]: `` No , '' was the curt reply .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 14]: `` Then , sahib , if Khuda permits it , let us sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 16]: Three times in one month have we passed restless nights in this accursed village . ''
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 3]: `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 16]: Why are these poor dwellings more hateful than any others passed on the road ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 16]: `` I know not , sahib , unless it be a meeting-place of evil spirits .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 18]: When the Maharani came this way to Burdwán she wept all night and refused to be comforted .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 19]: When she returned she wept again , for it was here we rested after regaining the great road .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 21]: To-night , when I saw her smiling whilst she conversed with your Lordships , I thought the spell was broken .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 17]: Yet , by the beard of Mànu , now she is gone -- and for what ?
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 18]: -- to indulge the fancy of a king who murdered that good man , Sher Afghán . ''
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 20]: `` It may be that the local fiends are unfriendly to her and not to thee , Jai Singh .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 4]: Sleep in peace .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 8]: We march betimes in the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 14]: He knew full well that ambition was the sprite which plagued Nur Mahal .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 23]: It had tortured many before her , nor would it cease to vex mankind long after her restless soul was stilled eternally .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 32]: `` In truth , '' said Roger , as they walked slowly after Jai Singh , `` I am resolved now that your lucky star shines over these hovels , lad .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 21]: Had you tried to shoe yon filly she would have requited you by kicking you into the smithy fire . ''
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 53]: `` My soul , that would be the proper lot of an indifferent smith , '' said Mowbray , with a queer bitterness in his voice , for weak human nature is so made up of contradictions that he missed Nur Mahal sorely now that he had seen the last of her .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 31]: `` Ecod , if that is your way of thinking , why did n't you give her a hearty hug when she led you forth into the field of chick-peas ?
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 17]: Women will oft yield to a squeeze when they cry ` Pshaw ' to a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 68]: My mother told me -- '' `` I pray to the saints , if ever we see England again , thy mother may tell thee when to hold thy tongue , '' cried Walter wrathfully , whereat Roger whistled another bar of `` Elsie Marley , '' and winked portentously at a gnarled and wizened village head-man , who cowered in his blanket close to their fire .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 25]: The old fellow wondered dully what all these comings and goings of great folk betokened , but the giant 's humor pleased him greatly .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 14]: It was propitious to be thus noticed by a lord of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 14]: Thenceforth , their days and nights provided an uneventful record of quiet travel .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 20]: They reached Allahabad next day , and the local _ Kotwal _ was minded to give them some trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 26]: He was cowed instantly when Walter exhibited Akbar 's order to the Treasurer , which he had forgotten to hand to Ibrahim with the receipt .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 55]: Nevertheless , being now well versed in the ways of Indian officials , he marveled at the man 's hectoring manners , since this city , situated at the confluence of the Ganges and the Jumna , was one of the chief resting-places for merchants passing between the Mogul capital and the Hughli delta .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 19]: Even at that date the Bay of Bengal was becoming noted as the site of important trading stations .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 15]: It was passing strange that the civil head of Allahabad should be so impolitic .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 18]: No restrictions were placed on his movements , however , and the incident scarce demanded further thought .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 48]: Indeed , the _ Kotwal _ deigned to help him by ordering his men to belabor the curious crowds which hampered progress through the bazaar , for the fame of Sainton 's stature spread like wild-fire , and numbers of mild-eyed Hindus came to gaze at him .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 15]: Here , they were able to test the value of Nur Mahal 's gift .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 43]: Deeming it wise to replenish their small stock of ready money , eked out as it was by a sum which she had entrusted to Jai Singh for the expenses of the escort , they sold four small diamonds in the bazaar .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 48]: The gems brought a thousand rupees , after some bargaining , so it was evident , even to non-experts , that the two hundred stones in the little cedar cabinet , some being very large and pure , must be worth even more than the price estimated .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 25]: With the money thus obtained they purchased three roomy , flat-bottomed boats , spacious enough to house the whole party , man and horse .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 29]: Assured that there would be no difficulty in securing food and fodder on the long river voyage they did not burthen their craft with a bulk of stores .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 37]: Nevertheless , their preparations , though simple , consumed several days , for , to the native of India , _ Kal _ -LRB- to-morrow -RRB- is as precious a word as Mañana to the Spaniard .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 40]: At last , after a weary delay , towards which Mowbray strongly suspected the _ Kotwal _ contributed indirectly , the huge , osier-woven sails of their buggalows were hoisted , and the unwieldy caravels lumbered slowly down stream .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 31]: Owing to the ever-changing channel , the numerous sand-banks , the occasional barriers of half sunken trees and other débris , they could only move during the hours of daylight .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 24]: At night they tied up near some village , where young goats , eggs , poultry , milk , and grain were obtainable .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 26]: At times , the people were so poor that even these primary commodities ran short , but , on the whole , they fared well .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 11]: A week 's quiet voyaging did wonders for their horses .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 8]: The hardy country-breds became sleek and fat .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 14]: When taken ashore for exercise they would plunge and caper for sheer liveliness .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 53]: One evening , after they had passed Benares , some such ebullition on the part of the powerful stallion which carried Sainton during the march from Agra caused his master to growl : -- `` It seems a daft thing to me , Walter , to ferry these ill-mannered brutes so far .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 7]: They are in good condition now .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 23]: Why not sell them at the next big town , and let Jai Singh purchase others for his return up country ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 15]: `` I have been thinking of that same plan , '' agreed his friend .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 14]: `` Let us consult Jai Singh , and hear what he says . ''
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 9]: But the shrewd old Rajput opposed the suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 33]: He pleaded that no such cattle could be bought in Lower Bengal , and that they themselves would be glad of good mounts when they quitted the river to ride into Calcutta .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 37]: The argument prevailed , though his real intent was to sell the animals as soon as their backs were turned and procure wretched tats for himself and his comrades , thereby netting a very handsome profit .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 12]: In life , it is ever the trivial things that count .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 13]: A straw would have swayed them to barter the horses at Dinapore .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 12]: Had they done so this history would have changed its course .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 12]: It was their custom to pass through populous places without stopping .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 27]: Seen from the banks , they attracted little attention , which suited their purpose better than to leave behind them a trial of surmise and gossip .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 22]: The dull villagers they encountered had no ideas beyond the state of the crops and the prospect of an early monsoon .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 34]: Hence , they slipped quietly , if slowly , over a very long stretch of their journey to the sea without any important event breaking the monotony of peaceful nights and restful days .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 22]: The pranks which fortune had played them in the past might have warned them that this idyllic existence could not continue .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 9]: But the fickle jade gave them no portent .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 68]: Little did they realize that stern times were come again when one evening , whilst strolling ashore on a high bank and idly watching the Rajputs watering the horses , a man , black as a negro , but dressed in semi-European costume , suddenly appeared from a clump of trees crowning the promontory carved from the land by a bend of the stream at that point .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 11]: Half running , half staggering , he made towards them .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 14]: As he came nearer , they perceived that he was in desperate plight .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 47]: His garments were blood-stained ; his gait and aspect told of abject fear ; his eyes glistened like those of a hunted fawn ; and , sinister token , his hands were weighted with heavy gyves of a fashion usually intended for the legs of prisoners .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 4]: `` Gad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 29]: cried Roger , staring at the apparition , `` this chuck minds me of that image of Satan who greeted us on board Sir Thomas Roe 's ship .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 16]: Yet , an he be the devil himself , some one hath bound him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 22]: The poor wretch reached them , fell panting at their feet , and gasped in Portuguese : -- `` Save me !
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 15]: Save me , for the love of God , if ye are Christians ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 29]: Their long voyage with Captain Garcia had taught them sufficient of the _ lingua franca _ of the high seas at that period to understand his frantic appeal .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 8]: Walter stooped and patted his shoulder encouragingly .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 26]: He found it hard to arrange a sentence in the man 's language , but he managed to say : -- `` Have no fear .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 5]: We are English . ''
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 36]: Then it occurred to him that one who wandered in such fashion through the wilds of India must surely know Hindustani , so he continued : -- `` There are none here to harm you .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 5]: Why are you chained ?
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 8]: Of whom are you so afraid ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 49]: The man , a Portuguese half-caste , who , like many of his class , more resembled an African than an Indian , save in respect to his smooth , blue-black hair , seemed to be too dazed to do other than pour out trembling demands for succor .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 25]: Roger , thinking deeds served better than words , to reassure him , lifted the heavy links which connected the fetters on his wrists .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 20]: `` Mayhap , '' he said , `` if thy hands are freed thy tongue may loosen itself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 15]: With that , he tore apart the rivets binding the chain to the bracelets .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 12]: Two mighty tugs , and the chain lay on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 10]: But this exhibition of strength merely stupefied the captive .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 5]: Surprise made him dumb .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 33]: It was not until they led him to the boats and gave him some food , which he ate ravenously , that they were able to extract an intelligible story from him .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 59]: With many a vow to the Mother of Mercy and all the chief saints in the calendar , the fugitive , a youth of twenty , who said his name was Antonio da Silva , told them how Abdul Aziz , a fanatical Musalman of high position in Bengal , had treacherously attacked the Portuguese colony at Hughli .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 36]: There was a fight , in which many were killed , but the multitude of assailants , no less than the wholly unexpected nature of the assault , sufficed to carry the town by storm .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 55]: After looting the stores , Abdul Aziz paraded the survivors , offered degrading terms to those of both sexes who would become Mahomedans , and , when only three men and one woman yielded , out of some two hundred prisoners , despatched the whole company , strongly guarded , to the northern capital .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 25]: Hearing this story , which so curiously bore out the accuracy of Nur Mahal 's information , the two Englishmen looked at each other .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 16]: `` Now we know why she bade us take the river , '' said Roger .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 13]: `` Had we gone by road we had encountered these unfortunates . ''
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 12]: `` We are much beholden to her , '' said Mowbray .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 12]: `` But how and when did you contrive to escape ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 11]: he went on , filling Antonio 's empty plate again .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 15]: `` Yesterday , at the close of a weary march -- '' `` Yesterday !
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 9]: Is the convoy so close , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 7]: Da Silva pointed to the west .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 17]: `` The party is not more than five miles distant over there , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 22]: `` It chanced last night that there was some confusion owing to the advance guard having gone beyond the agreed camping-ground .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 9]: We prisoners were hurried back in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 31]: Passing through a wood , and scarce able to walk owing to fatigue and the weight of my fetters , I stumbled over a rock and fell into a hollow .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 19]: I lay there , expecting to be roused with a lance-thrust , but careless what fate awaited me .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 3]: Mater Misericordia !
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 7]: the black dogs heeded me not .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 16]: When I discovered that I had not been missed , hope gave me new strength .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 38]: I rose , and went rapidly along the road in front , thinking that search would not be made far in that direction , whereas any attempt to reach the south road would lead to my capture .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 28]: At dawn , utterly spent though I was , I turned into the cultivated land , knowing that in time I should gain the river 's bank .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 23]: I kept on until the presence of villagers caused me to hide in the tope of trees whence I first saw you .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 31]: I dared not reveal myself to the natives , because they would conduct me back to the column , being fearful lest the soldiers should pillage them for concealing me .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 27]: So I lay close all day , without so much as a drink of water , until the good God sent your lordships towards my hiding-place .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 9]: Then I felt that I was safe . ''
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 13]: There was a spice of humor in the tragedy of his story .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 34]: He called Indian Mahomedans `` black , '' and alluded to the inhabitants of Upper Bengal as `` natives '' with all the assurance of the whitest white who ever entered the country .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 20]: But the Englishmen were more concerned in the character of his news than in his way of imparting it .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 29]: While such a gang as the swashbucklers of Abdul Aziz infested the neighborhood , it behooved them to keep watch and ward until the marauders were far removed .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 10]: Moreover , the magnitude of the affair was alarming .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 23]: If the Hughli district were overrun , the other stations at Calcutta and lower down the river would be difficult of access .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 40]: Da Silva , in reply to further questions , said that the sacking of the Portuguese colony took place nearly a month since , so Jahangir must have despatched his murderous order soon after he came to the throne .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 12]: Were his couriers carrying a similar mandate to the west coast ?
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 17]: Would the Christian posts at Surat , Ahmedabad and Bombay also be given to the flames ?
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 7]: Certainly , here was a dilemma .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 33]: Yet their only course , precarious though it might be , was to guard against sudden attack , keep to the river , and endeavor at all hazards to reach the sea .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 22]: Ere night fell , Jai Singh and a sowar made an extensive reconnaissance on horseback beyond the perimeter of the village .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 18]: They returned , to report that many fires were lit in the locality described by the half-caste .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 25]: By this time , da Silva 's confidence was somewhat restored , and he bethought himself of the miserable lot of his fellow captives .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 13]: he sighed , `` what would I not give to help them .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 17]: Think of that gracious lady , the Countess di Cabota , being subjected to such indignities !
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 27]: Though she looks young enough , she is very stout , and she suffers greatly from the vagaries of the mule on which she is strapped .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 7]: And then , the good priests !
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 21]: I can see them now , patiently enduring contumely and insult , and answering each blow with a prayer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 5]: `` A Countess ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 3]: said Mowbray .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 15]: `` How came a lady of rank to be in an Indian station ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 38]: `` They say she was jealous of her husband , who was a very handsome man , and when he was named Governor of the Portuguese possessions in the East Indies she insisted on coming with him .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 21]: But he died of a fever , and she was about to go home when the attack took place . ''
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 10]: `` Are there many women among the prisoners ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 12]: `` About forty , your lordship , but some are converts .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 12]: Perhaps twenty , all told , are Europeans like myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 7]: Walter repressed the temptation to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 19]: `` It is a grave matter , '' he said , `` and Portugal should avenge it heavily .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 15]: While the names are fresh in your mind tell me all you can remember .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 17]: I shall set them down for the information of the first Portuguese official I encounter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 10]: The roll progressed until da Silva reached the ecclesiastics .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 10]: `` First , let me think of the Franciscans .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 15]: Who , that knew him , would not weep for good Fra Pietro ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 5]: `` Fra Pietro ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 27]: There was many a `` Brother Peter '' in the Franciscan order , yet the words smote Mowbray 's ears with a sudden menace of disaster .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 12]: `` Tell me of this Fra Pietro , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 9]: `` What manner of man is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 22]: Da Silva , glib of tongue now , told of a monk who was sent to India nearly three years ago .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 51]: It was rumored that he had been guilty of a breach of discipline , or had , in some manner , displeased the authorities at Lisbon , though what his error none knew , since there never was saint who walked the earth more humble and devout than Fra Pietro .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 36]: Yes , Antonio was sure the excellent father spoke English , because he conversed , in their own language , with the sailors on board an English ship which once came up the Hughli river .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 18]: Surely his lordship must have met Fra Pietro , seeing that he described the friar so accurately .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 25]: He was , indeed , very thin and pallid , with large brown eyes that seemed to be ever contemplating the happiness of heaven !
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 32]: Then Walter set aside his tablets and hastened to find Sainton , who was eating an extra heavy supper on the set principle that a good deal might happen ere breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 27]: `` Roger , '' he said , quietly , unconscious in his perplexity of the pain in his voice , `` here is ill news . ''
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 10]: `` Why , what ails thee , lad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 26]: demanded the giant , suspending his assault on the haunch of a deer , though , to be sure , he had his mouth full .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 14]: `` You remember Fra Pietro , who saved us from the Inquisition ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 5]: `` Remember him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 3]: cried Roger .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 10]: `` I shall forget my own name first . ''
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 11]: Mowbray pointed to the dying light on the western horizon .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 20]: Against the golden purple of the sky was silhouetted the indigo line of the great central plain of India .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 12]: `` He is among those unhappy people , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 15]: `` Unless I err greatly he is there because he helped us to escape .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 13]: Perchance he was banished because they feared to put him to death .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 7]: Roger , what say you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 3]: `` Say !
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 6]: What is there to say !
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 12]: Sit thee down , lad , and eat while we think .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 22]: We mun have him out , whole and hearty , though every cut-throat between here and hell barred the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 17]: CHAPTER XIV `` As if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel . ''
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 6]: _ Ezekiel _ x. 10 .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 11]: Roger 's cheery optimism was an excellent thing in itself .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 34]: Nevertheless , the best of good-will can not withstand the logic of hard fact , and prolonged discussion of the means whereby Fra Pietro might be rescued revealed an undertaking bristling with difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 42]: After extracting from da Silva all the material information he possessed , they considered a hundred varying expedients , rejecting one proposal after another until they almost despaired of hitting upon any scheme which offered even a remote chance of success .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 8]: They took Jai Singh into their confidence .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 19]: Unless he and his Rajputs yielded willing help it was hard indeed to see what could be done .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 29]: Two and twenty men , well mounted , might , if fortunate , achieve something : two men alone , with hundreds against them , were utterly powerless .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 37]: It was whilst Jai Singh was strenuously opposing Sainton 's suggestion of a direct attack that Walter , inspired by idle chance , hit upon a plan the very daring of which commended itself to them .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 15]: To be sure , Roger long remained stubborn ere he would agree to it .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 5]: At last he yielded .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 35]: Admittedly , the project was a forlorn hope , yet none other they could propound gave such promise of speedy realization , and nothing could shake their resolve that Fra Pietro must be saved .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 50]: The horses were quietly disembarked ; by present payment , and promise of greater reward , a guide was obtained from the village ; and the whole party , less da Silva and three trustworthy men , set off under the starlight to march across country by field paths .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 25]: The three Rajputs who remained behind were charged to safeguard the boats and prevent any enterprising villager from carrying news to the distant column .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 41]: Da Silva was left not only because he was paralyzed with fright at the bare thought of falling again into the hands of his captors , but also on account of the suspicion his presence in their company would arouse .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 50]: Before daybreak they reached the main road , a dust-laden track with slight pretense to the characteristics of a highway other than the occasional felling of trees and the cutting of an approach wherever the steep banks of a nullah offered a barrier to the passage of a caravan .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 18]: If it had none of the virtues it held full measure of the vices inseparable from traffic .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 71]: Though animals alone , camels for the most part , carried Indian merchandise over long distances , the ryots were wont to use heavy two-wheeled carts , drawn by oxen , and the numerous ruts left by these caused the so-called road to bear more semblance to a ploughed field than the land which was actually tilled , as the Indian plough merely scratches the ground and leaves no furrow .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 12]: The whole party halted at some distance from the road itself .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 30]: It was essential that the presence of a body of horse should not be discovered , so , at this point , Mowbray and Sainton bade each other farewell .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 23]: Never before , during their many wanderings , had they separated in the course of any enterprise which threatened disaster or death .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 11]: Walter handed to his disconsolate friend the box of jewels .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 26]: `` If things go awry , '' he said , with a smile , `` you will be the last to fall , Roger . ''
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 11]: `` Aye , lad , '' was the rueful response .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 14]: `` I am doubting now lest we ought not to hunt together . ''
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 19]: `` Your heart says so , but your head warns you that we have chosen the better way .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 3]: Good-by ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 14]: `` Good-by , Walter , and may the Lord be with you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 26]: Accompanied by a single Rajput trooper , a brave youth specially recommended by Jai Singh , Walter turned his horse 's head towards the road .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 22]: The others , led by their guide , rode off into the jungle , where they were speedily lost to sight .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 23]: Soon the sun , dissipating the dawn-mist , disclosed a cloud of dust rising slowly from the track some two miles southwards .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 7]: Walter advanced at a walking pace .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 7]: He was dressed with unusual care .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 35]: His long sword was slung from a handsome baldrick ; Sher Afghán 's dagger shone in his belt ; a cloak of quilted silk , trimmed with rich fur , hung from his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 38]: These accessories , together with his plumed hat , heavy riding boots , and attire of dark brown cloth , gave a distinguished appearance to one whose face and figure proclaimed him a cavalier of high lineage .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 15]: His attendant , too , had donned the state livery of his former master .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 38]: The two were superbly mounted , and well calculated , by their style and bearing , to take by surprise the leader of a rabble host marching through a country where all was new to his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 14]: For Mowbray , as shall be seen , had prepared his measures judiciously .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 31]: When he sighted the mounted vanguard of the convoy he clapped spurs to his horse , and , followed by his orderly , galloped towards them at a rapid pace .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 40]: Pulling up within a few yards of the astonished soldiers , who were already consulting as to the identity and errand of this unlooked-for embassy , he shouted sternly : -- `` Halt , in the Emperor 's name !
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 8]: Bring Abdul Aziz hither at once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 17]: He calculated that this assumption of authority would not be questioned , nor was he mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 27]: `` It is not known to your honorable presence that Abdul Aziz remains at Hughli , '' said one who was the captain of the guard .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 5]: Mowbray exhibited well-feigned surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 19]: `` If not Abdul Aziz -- for which he may thank the Prophet -- who commands you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 12]: `` Nawab Fateh Mohammed , his nephew , your Excellence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 19]: `` Pass the word to halt , then , and ride at speed to bring him hither . ''
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 17]: Fair Europeans , particularly Englishmen , were rarer than white blackbirds in India at that period .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 22]: The Portuguese invaders were , for the most part , so swarthy as to rival the brown skin of the natives .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 31]: Never had the Musalman officer encountered a man of such mien and semblance , who , moreover , spoke the aristocratic language of the court in all its sonorous purity .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 15]: Nevertheless , it was passing strange that the Emperor should choose such a messenger .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 33]: `` Forgive me , your Honor , '' he stammered , `` but I must have some authority before I -- '' `` Does Jahangir need to speak twice by my mouth ?
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 20]: Am I to exhibit the seal of the Conqueror of the World to the first who questions me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 11]: The officer simply could not withstand Mowbray 's grand air .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 30]: He civilly asked the other to await his return , gave some orders to the guard , and vanished in the dust-cloud which enshrouded the remainder of the column .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 12]: Walter saw that the troopers surrounded him as if by accident .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 21]: He paid not the slightest attention to the maneuver , but took off his hat and fanned his face nonchalantly .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 14]: Behind him , the Rajput sowar sat his horse like a carved statue .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 53]: Scarce comprehending what enterprise was forward , knowing little save that he would surely swing from the nearest tree if he kept not a still tongue and obeyed orders , the native soldier took his cue from his master in the matter of disregarding the ring of steel which girt them both .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 43]: But Nawab Fateh Mohammed must have hurried , judging from the speed of his approach on a long-striding camel , which loomed out of the dust so suddenly that there was barely time to stop the lumbering beast and avoid a collision .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 23]: The nawab was a stout man , though young , and it was his ambition to make his way in life quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 12]: This laudable aim arose , however , from a base intent .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 19]: The more wealth he amassed in a little time the more speedily could he gratify his ignoble passions .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 16]: Such a person is usually hectoring towards his inferiors and servile to those above him .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 42]: At present he was all of a twitter owing to the unexpected presence of a messenger from the Emperor , whilst his informant had not failed to apprise him of Mowbray 's imperative mien and the half-veiled menace of his words .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 12]: Luckily , Walter took the man 's measure at a glance .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 43]: Here was one designed by nature to play the cowardly tyrant , and such a personality was far better suited to his purpose than a straightforward soldier , who would have obeyed his own chief 's instructions and cared not for consequences .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 28]: So the _ soi-disant _ courier of Jahangir saluted the nawab with dignity and said : -- `` Be pleased to dismount and walk apart with me .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 11]: His Majesty 's words are not for all ears . ''
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 10]: Fateh Mohammed , although nervous , felt slightly flattered .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 12]: It was new to him to be addressed in that way .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 62]: He glanced at the single Rajput trooper who held Mowbray 's horse , and saw forty of his own men within instant call , so he had no fear in his mind other than that instilled by the vague threats conveyed to him by the leader of the guard , who now stood near and watched the nawab for a signal .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 18]: He followed Walter willingly enough until they could not be overheard if they spoke in low tones .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 63]: `` Information has reached the Emperor , '' began Walter , `` that Abdul Aziz , whilst carrying out the royal mandate to prevent the encroachments of Portuguese traders in Bengal , attacked and burnt the settlement at Hughli , killed many of the inhabitants , and despatched the survivors , numbering some hundreds , to the Imperial court at Agra . ''
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 24]: `` The Shadow of Allah did indeed -- '' `` Better hear me first , '' interposed Mowbray , with a serious smile .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 27]: `` It is most fortunate that Abdul Aziz himself does not march with the convoy ; otherwise , my mission would be of a different nature .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 17]: Of course , you have not heard of recent occurrences in the Emperor 's household ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 44]: `` No , but my uncle -- '' `` Even he could not be aware that the beautiful Nur Mahal , whose fascination for Jahangir is known to all India , would become a widow , and hence regain her ascendency at court .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 4]: It is true .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 9]: Her husband , Sher Afghán , is dead .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 40]: She herself is Sultana by this time , and her first act has been to free all the European prisoners in Agra , Delhi , and other cities , whose bondage was the result of Jahangir 's earlier policy .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 18]: Judge for yourself what she will say when she hears of the excesses committed by Abdul Aziz .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 25]: The Emperor , knowing your uncle , dreaded the account of his actions , but he dreads much more the frown of Nur Mahal .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 11]: Hence , I have been despatched with a double mission .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 18]: Had Abdul Aziz been present in person I had no choice but to deal with him harshly .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 27]: In his absence it is my more pleasant duty to bid you explain to the captives in your charge that a terrible mistake has been made .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 40]: They must be treated with all courtesy and attention , and , indeed , brought to see , before they reach Agra , that it is the special design of the Emperor to recompense them in every way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 12]: `` Then they are not to be set at liberty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 26]: gasped Fateh Mohammed , who had been so carried away by Mowbray 's announcement that he quite forgot to ask for any verification of it .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 7]: `` In a sense , yes .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 28]: They are to be clothed , fed , and provided with means of conveyance in such manner as to show that they are the Emperor 's guests .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 7]: But they must go to Agra .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 6]: It could not be otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 26]: They must be maintained fittingly until order is restored in Bengal , their ruined houses rebuilt , and means taken to insure their future safety .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 13]: Thus only can Jahangir undo the evil deeds of Abdul Aziz . ''
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 10]: `` This intelligence -- '' `` Finds you unprepared .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 5]: What is more natural ?
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 15]: But the downfall of one man oft opens the door of opportunity to another .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 5]: The Emperor is free-handed .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 8]: He rewards as fully as he punishes .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 21]: Leave to me the pleasing task of informing him how quickly you fulfilled his behests to the last letter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 10]: `` It shall be so , in very truth .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 11]: Yet your lordship sees the difficulties that confront me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 9]: `` I am bidden help you dispel them .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 9]: I have money and fair words at command .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 14]: Be sure that neither a mule nor a woman can resist such pleading .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 14]: But let all clemency come through you in the Emperor 's name . ''
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 9]: Fateh Mohammed flushed deeply under his bronze skin .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 10]: He pursed his lips and set his feet apart .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 10]: A dazzling vista opened before his mind 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 44]: He pictured Abdul Aziz , whose severe tenets he loathed in so far as they restrained his own gross desires , swinging from a _ nim _ tree , while a mourning nephew journeyed back in state to take up an assured position .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 5]: Mowbray watched him narrowly .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 45]: He saw the man 's vanity puffing him up like the frog in the fable , and he could scarce restrain a smile at the thought that , in all probability , this fantastic scheme would actually result in the way he had described .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 27]: But it was necessary to strike while the iron glowed , so he continued impressively : -- `` Above all things , keep your own counsel .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 7]: You and I can be discreet .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 29]: If others know your mind they have you at a disadvantage , for they can shape their conduct to further their own ends while skilfully defeating yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 24]: `` The Emperor 's wishes shall be locked within my heart , '' said the other in a tone of absolute confidence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 4]: 'T is well !
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 22]: I will accompany you to the prisoners -- Jahangir 's guests -- after despatching my attendant to summon my escort . ''
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 5]: `` Your escort ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 17]: `` Surely you can not imagine that the Emperor 's courier rode with only one sowar !
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 24]: You see he wears the livery of Sher Afghán , whose retinue is placed at my disposal by Jahangir 's own act . ''
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 11]: Fateh Mohammed little guessed how literally true this statement was .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 22]: He knew naught of affairs at Agra , nor was he skilled in the new heraldic fashions then penetrating the East .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 27]: But the assumption that he was an adept therein added the last drop to the cruse of oil which had been so judiciously administered to him .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 22]: Having ascertained when the escort might be expected , he gave orders that it was to be received with proper honor .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 31]: As soon as the sowar had ridden away north , _ ventre à terre _ , the two grandees mounted and proceeded slowly through the ranks of the halted cavalcade .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 29]: Walter , chatting affably about the splendors of the court , counted two hundred fairly serviceable horsemen , and half as many armed guards of the baggage train .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 32]: He estimated that a similar number would bring up the rear , so the futility of a surprise attack by night , which Roger had suggested , was now quite demonstrated .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 63]: Even if a panic were created and the host broke up in disorder , what could be done next day , and every other day for weeks , by twenty men burthened with a host of helpless captives , for da Silva 's account made it certain that nearly all the Portuguese soldiers had fallen in the first fierce fight at Hughli .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 7]: The whole country would be roused .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 20]: Every Mahomedan would deem it a religious duty to slay the Giaours , and they would all perish miserably .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 58]: Yes , his amazingly daring plan , now that the first barrier was passed , promised ultimate success , and his heart throbbed at the thought that two Englishmen , alone and almost unfriended in a powerful foreign land , should have adopted such a mad device and carried it triumphantly to the very gate of achievement .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 6]: For this was his scheme .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 20]: He counted that , long ere this , Nur Mahal was firmly established as the despot of a despot .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 27]: He was sure that a woman of cultured and artistic tastes would sway the shallow-minded King back from his retrogade policy with regard to other nations .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 51]: Therefore , the instant Jai Singh heard that Fateh Mohammed had taken the pill so neatly prepared for him , the Rajput and a couple of men would ride at utmost speed to Agra and warn Nur Mahal as to the way in which Jahangir 's authority had been usurped .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 20]: If she did not gainsay it , but promised to make smooth their path , all would be well .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 30]: If aught untoward happened , Jai Singh was to collect as many of Sher Afghán 's retainers as were available , and ambuscade the caravan at some preconcerted place .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 30]: They would endeavor to secure the escape of those able-bodied prisoners who could ride , the Europeans thereafter plunging recklessly into Central India with the hope of reaching Bombay .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 9]: If not all , some could be saved .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 10]: These alternatives each depended on Walter 's primary success .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 65]: If , however , Fateh Mohammed were suspicious or actively hostile -- it was thought he would not dare do more than detain Mowbray until his pretended mission were justified or otherwise -- then the only course which remained open was a surprise attack at midnight , of which Mowbray would privily warn all whom he could trust in order to create a diversion .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 11]: Here , obviously , lay the chief risk of failure .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 58]: But Mowbray steadily believed in his theory that Nur Mahal would so mold Jahangir 's mind that Fateh Mohammed would be acclaimed as a most judicious person when he reached Agra , and , by consequence , that he himself and Sainton would have no difficulty in proceeding to the west coast by the direct overland route .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 28]: At any rate , granted the less favorable outcome , they made sure of saving Fra Pietro , who , after all , most enlisted their sympathies .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 24]: And now the sowar was speeding to the agreed rendezvous to apprise Roger and Jai Singh that all had gone well thus far .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 24]: No wonder Mowbray felt elated , and that his confident air left room in Fateh Mohammed 's brain for no shadow of suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 33]: But his gaiety , subdued and decorous as became a person who ranked high in the trust of a king , was rudely dispelled by the first sight of the wo-begone prisoners .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 41]: He first encountered a batch of men each chained securely after the manner in which da Silva was manacled , but now bound together by strips of cowhide , since , apparently , a few had escaped like the half-caste .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 9]: They were haggard , foot-sore and in rags .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 19]: Poor souls , they had taken advantage of the unexpected halt to lie down again in the dust .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 12]: Such was their misery that they had lost all human interest .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 32]: They looked at Walter and his companion with lack-luster eyes , like those on the point of death who retain some glimmer of consciousness yet have already quitted the living world .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 24]: Fateh Mohammed , giving a sidelong glance at Jahangir 's envoy , saw the stern frown in his face and began to explain .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 12]: `` Abdul Aziz is a hard man , '' he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 12]: `` He gave his orders and I could only obey . ''
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 5]: Mowbray stifled his rage .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 9]: He must play his part to the end .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 13]: `` Of course , '' he said , `` there were difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 14]: This is no time to tell these unfortunates of the Emperor 's regret .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 10]: Order them to be freed and given good food .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 19]: Then let them rest all this day until horses and camels are procured for to-morrow 's march . ''
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 44]: The stout commander obeyed instantly , with such denunciations of his myrmidons and such appeals to the Prophet that his own men deemed him temporarily insane , while some among the unhappy prisoners lifted their heads to ascertain if they had heard aright .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 10]: The plight of the women was not so bad .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 13]: None save the young and good looking had been brought from Hughli .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 26]: They were supplied with mules and ponies , and were destined for the zenanas of such court favorites as might take a fancy to them .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 11]: All the older women had been massacred in cold blood .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 22]: There were girls who had lost their mothers , wives who had seen their husbands cut to pieces before their eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 10]: Over them , too , brooded a settled despair .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 6]: Tears had long been dried .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 10]: There remained only a haunting terror of the future .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 22]: Prominent among them , if only on account of the richness of her soiled garments , was the Countess di Cabota .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 34]: Although she was , in Eastern eyes , bewitching by reason of her fair skin , large brown eyes , and exceedingly plump figure , she was undoubtedly over thirty years of age .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 33]: Hence , she owed her life to that which many another woman risks her life to avoid , namely , a somewhat too pronounced development of a figure naturally inclined to solidity .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 22]: The unhappy lady -- perhaps by subtle operation of the principle _ noblesse oblige _ -- retained some degree of vivacity .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 19]: Her glance no sooner fell on Mowbray than she cried in Portuguese : -- `` Mother of mercy !
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 6]: An Englishman of rank ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 8]: Walter doffed his hat with ceremonious politeness .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 15]: `` A friend , too , I trust , Countess , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 16]: `` You may believe that , from this moment , your sufferings have ended . ''
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 3]: `` Misericordia !
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 6]: how can that be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 20]: `` His excellency the Nawab Fateh Mohammed will explain better than it is possible for me to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 40]: Thus impelled , his `` Excellency '' did , indeed , give the Countess and her companions a cheering message , which the half-caste women joyfully interpreted for those who did not follow the native words with complete understanding .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 15]: Then , after many days , some broken hearts found relief again in tears .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 25]: At last , not venturing to search too eagerly , yet missing none he passed in this Via Dolorosa , Mowbray found the Franciscan .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 62]: Utterly spent , unable to move one foot before the other , Fra Pietro would have been dead a week gone had not some bullock-driver , whose crushed fingers he had dressed , lifted him into a grain cart and kept him there in defiance of repeated advice to throw the Giaour into the jungle and let him glut the jackals .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 32]: Nevertheless , the good monk , broken in body and exhausted for want of food suited to his condition , had not benefited greatly by the jolting repose thus given him .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 48]: He was still exceedingly ill , and when Mowbray , who knew him instantly , could not refrain from leaping to the ground and bending over him , the parched blue-white lips were moving in fitful prayer : -- `` De profundis clamavi ad te , Domine !
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 15]: ... Dona me requiem æternam ... Ostende me , Domine , misericordiam tuam ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 60]: `` The Lord has heard thee , good friend , though happily thy days of eternal rest may be long deferred for the good of mankind , '' murmured Walter to himself , for he dared not be too openly recognized by the Franciscan , lest Fateh Mohammed should be moved to ponder upon all that had taken place .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 23]: Yet something must be done , and quickly , too , if that flickering soul were to stay in its earthly tabernacle .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 6]: He turned to the nawab .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 21]: `` Here is one who , I have good reason to believe , will be highly esteemed by the Sultana .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 22]: He should be carried to a tent , given a little wine and milk , and receive the most careful attendance .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 22]: If , indeed , his name be Fra Pietro , his life is of the utmost value to all concerned . ''
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 27]: At each moment Fateh Mohammed saw how essential it was to adopt prompt measures if he were to earn the good will of this masterful envoy .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 74]: He bestirred himself now to such effect that when Roger and the remaining Rajputs , including the three left in the village -LRB- whence da Silva was advised to go down the river in one of the boats -RRB- , marched into the camp , there was an air of liveliness among the Europeans long absent from their tortured existence , whilst Fra Pietro was sleeping peacefully on a couch of soft furs .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 8]: Sainton 's arrival created the customary stir .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 16]: By none was he gazed on with greater interest than by the Countess di Cabota .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 34]: She vowed , by all the saints , she had never seen such a man , and likened him to the terrible Archangel who defied the fiends when they would have assaulted heaven .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 50]: To Fateh Mohammed the sight of this unexampled specimen of humanity , joined to the appointments and smart appearance of Sher Afghán 's horsemen , gave the last proof , if further proof were needed , that Jahangir 's delegate was indeed a person to be treated with deference .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 43]: He became dog-like in his servility , and transformed his train from a band of ruffianly jailers into a troupe of servitors , each and all being anxious to win the friendship of those whom formerly they goaded to madness or insensibility .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 12]: Mowbray 's word was law , his least wish was executed .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 20]: Within three days , after fraternizing judiciously with others , he and Sainton were able to visit Fra Pietro .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 8]: The meeting between them was joyful indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 18]: The Franciscan , when he regained faculties bewildered by recognition of them , was moved to tears .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 31]: To him , because he spoke English , they could talk without reserve , and his breath came fast with alarm when he learned what they had done for him .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 6]: `` Nay , nay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 23]: protested Roger , `` fear not that we shall come to an ill end because we took a risk on your account .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 38]: They tell me you are here owing to the timely aid you gave us , and , by that same token , our arch enemy , Dom Geronimo , is now laid by the heels at Agra .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 33]: I know not who cast the net which gathered us all in this God-forgotten land , but , by the cross of Osmotherly , he hath hauled together some queer fish . ''
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 7]: `` Have you met Dom Geronimo ?
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 10]: Does he know of your presence in India ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 6]: `` Trust him for that .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 14]: He hath the sight of a vulture where friend Mowbray is concerned . ''
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 48]: `` I attribute to him some part of the bad fortune which has pursued us , '' said Walter , and , the topic thus broached , he gave the Franciscan a full account of all occurrences since Roger and he first crossed the portals of Dilkusha .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 23]: The monk listened intently , only interposing a question at times when the changeful moods of Nur Mahal seemed to puzzle him .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 39]: He was surprised to learn that the Jesuit had succeeded , even temporarily , in gaining the ear of Jahangir , for , as he said in his mild way : -- `` Dom Geronimo is too zealous .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 39]: It was his intemperate acts which unfitted him for the Holy Office in Europe , and he was despatched to India , a country which offered a more suitable field for one whose fiery ardor knew no bounds .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 20]: Therefore , it is hard to see how such a man could win his way with the Emperor . ''
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 31]: When , after conversing until a late hour , Fra Pietro thoroughly understood the nature of their present undertaking , he again urged them to consider the danger they incurred .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 20]: `` You have already done more than I thought possible for mortal man to achieve , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 31]: `` Why not , on some good pretext , ride on in front of the column and leave the success or failure of your scheme in the hands of Providence ?
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 13]: If all goes well we shall be treated with the same consideration .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 18]: Should there be aught amiss you will be far away on the road to the sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 28]: `` Where your life is at issue , we bide with you and you with us until the die is cast , '' said Walter , firmly .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 26]: Then they left him , carrying with them his blessing , and regained the spacious tent allotted to their use by the obsequious Fateh Mohammed .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 14]: They slept soundly at night , and were not troubled by anxious forebodings .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 27]: Jai Singh and his followers could not reach them on the return from Agra for at least ten more days at the best rate of traveling .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 15]: Not until they had his budget could they decide definitely as to their future .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 26]: But these things are oft settled for men by a Power to whom the comings and goings of a Jai Singh are of little account .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 46]: And it was so now , for , when Mowbray and Sainton awoke in the morning , they found their swords removed , their daggers withdrawn from the sheaths , and they saw twenty muskets leveled at them through the open door of the tent .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 24]: Behind the file of musketeers stood Fateh Mohammed , livid with rage , yet with a certain gratified malice sparkling in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 37]: `` Ohé , '' he yelled , when Roger , missing his sword , gazed steadily at the phalanx without , `` ohé , Elephant , thy tricks have led thee into the _ kheddah _ .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 39]: -LSB- K -RSB- Stir hand or foot , resist those who will bind thee by so much as a refusal to submit thy limbs to the fetters , and thou shalt be pierced by a dozen balls . ''
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 14]: -LSB- Footnote K : The enclosure in which wild elephants are captured . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 13]: Walter , roused by the bellowing , raised himself on one arm .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 18]: Instantly he realized that Fateh Mohammed had found out the ruse of which he was the dupe .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 16]: `` Roger , '' said he , quietly , `` we have been betrayed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 13]: `` Aye , lad , and by a woman , I fear .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 4]: What sayest thou ?
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 9]: Shall we die here or in Agra ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 5]: `` I care little .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 8]: Have it which way you will . ''
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 23]: CHAPTER XV `` Bring me to the test , And I the matter will re-word , which madness Would gamble from . ''
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 9]: _ Hamlet _ , Act III , Sc .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 2]: 4 .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 17]: Perchance they had dared the certain death which faced them had not Fateh Mohammed spoken again .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 50]: Vain as he was , and furious at the thought that a Feringhi should have lorded it over him for days , he was held in leash by the written orders of the Emperor , which , this time , he had really received and read with bulging eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 19]: `` I am bidden , '' he said , `` bring you to Agra , alive if possible .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 16]: Hence , though clemency ill accords with my present mood , I offer you terms .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 32]: Suffer my men to bind you securely -- for none would be such a fool as to trust that Man-Elephant at large -- and I will have you carried in litters .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 8]: Refusal means instant death to both . ''
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 11]: `` Hast thou suddenly gone mad , Fateh Mohammed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 21]: demanded Mowbray , thinking , by a display of boldness , to save the situation even at the twelfth hour .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 23]: `` Aye , mad , indeed , to accept the word of the King of Kings from the mouth of an unbeliever !
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 23]: Oh , thou Feringhi dog , open thy lips again in defiance and I will make thee a sieve for bullets ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 11]: Walter knew that the bubble of his pretense was pricked .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 26]: Some bolt had fallen from a blue sky , else this subservient rogue would never venture to bluster in such wise if he feared reprisals .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 19]: Nevertheless , the contempt inspired by the groundling served the Englishman in good stead at a critical moment .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 17]: `` Thou shalt be most bitterly enlightened ere many days have passed , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 56]: `` Sainton-sahib and I can do naught at present but yield to your demands , yet I warn thee , Fateh Mohammed , that for each second of ill-treatment meted out to us or to the unhappy people brought from Hughli thou shalt be requited by an hour of torture on thy unwieldy carcass . ''
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 40]: Here was defiance , truly , from one whose capture , living or dead , Jahangir 's couriers , riding hot-foot in pursuit , had demanded an hour earlier when they came at dawn to Fateh Mohammed 's tent .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 14]: These men carried no tidings save the Emperor 's warrant for their action .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 41]: They knew , they said , that Sher Afghán was slain -- it was even rumored that the companion of the Hathi-sahib was concerned in the deed -- and that his widow had gone towards Burdwán with the two Feringhis .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 76]: As for the statement that Jahangir had charged these latter with a mission , it was manifestly absurd in view of his eagerness to secure their arrest , while it was impossible that anyone so far south could be aware of Nur Mahal 's fortunes at Agra , seeing that they , the messengers , had passed her returning escort privily by night , being urged thereto by the Chief Eunuch , who accompanied her .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 30]: Indeed , the Eunuch , Ibrahim , was responsible for the Emperor 's action , having sent a private report to Jahangir , by carrier pigeon it was thought .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 20]: It was on their advice that Fateh Mohammed had adopted irresistible safeguards ere he summoned the Englishmen to surrender .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 20]: The bazaar gossip of Agra had invested Roger Sainton with a legendary halo which would daunt the bravest heart .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 33]: No half measures could be taken with the Hathi-sahib , said the King 's _ chuprassis _ : he must either be killed or bound as one would tie a wild bull .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 33]: Now , it was distasteful , above all things , for men who had been treated with the utmost deference during many days to permit themselves to be led forth in fetters .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 26]: The bare thought of such ignominy sent the blood bounding through Mowbray 's veins and caused an ominous frown to deepen in Sainton 's face .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 44]: The big Yorkshireman stood close to the tent-pole ; had Walter deferred further speech for another tick of a clock , the tent had been torn from its supports and Roger had either fallen or knocked down a dozen of the waiting musketeers .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 17]: But he heard his friend say quietly : -- `` Hearken to me , Fateh Mohammed .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 19]: If one of us , speaking in haste , has used injurious words , let them be forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 11]: You have your orders -- assuredly they must be obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 7]: Sainton-sahib and I are already disarmed .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 11]: You probably disarmed our escort ere you came to us .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 18]: We , on our part , pledge ourselves to go with you to the fort at Agra .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 28]: Under no circumstances shall we seek to escape , and we will counsel all others who may be guided by our admonitions to give the same gage .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 34]: If you are the wise and far-seeing man I take you to be you will content yourself with this promise , and treat us and the remainder of the Europeans with due courtesy .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 4]: What say you ?
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 45]: Shall the Emperor upbraid you for faithfully carrying out your charge , or do you care to risk the unknown dangers of flaunting the wishes of one who , for anything you or I know to the contrary , may now be Sultana ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 37]: Fateh Mohammed , though naturally distrustful of the honeyed poison of Mowbray 's counsel , felt in his heart of hearts that the Giaour was not only giving him good advice but making a fair offer .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 32]: Yet , like a cur which cowers and snarls when a determined hand would stroke it , he said sullenly : -- `` How am I to place trust in you ?
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 45]: You told me -- '' `` I told you what I truly believed , and still believe , to be the Emperor 's intent , '' interrupted Walter , who saw that the fat man was weakened by the bare hint of palace intrigue .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 28]: `` Look back through my words and you will find no single phrase in which I actually represented myself as charged with a mission by Jahangir himself .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 7]: Nay , be not so amazed .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 4]: It is true .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 19]: You may have been misled , I admit , but it was a most fortunate mistake for you .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 8]: Did I not meet you almost alone ?
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 15]: Have we not marched with you daily and slept nightly on the same camping-ground ?
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 18]: If Sainton-sahib and I wished to betray you , have we not passed a hundred opportunities ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 6]: Fateh Mohammed was manifestly uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 11]: The affair was not so simple as he deemed it .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 20]: Moreover , by placing a degree of faith in Mowbray , he applied salve to his own wounded vanity .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 31]: In simple parlance , if he managed things aright now , he would not look such a dupe in the eyes of others as he was in his own estimation .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 11]: `` Never was man more perplexed , '' he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 6]: `` You may be honest !
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 5]: How can I tell ?
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 33]: Certainly , the King of Kings does not say you are to be treated with contumely , yet , what security have I that you will act according to your promises ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 10]: Mowbray resolved to risk all on a final hazard .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 5]: He turned to Roger .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 11]: `` Give me the cedar box , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 8]: The big man reached for his hat .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 13]: Cunningly tied inside the lofty crown was the gift of Nur Mahal .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 28]: `` I am a heavy sleeper , '' he grinned in explanation , `` and I thought none would search there though they might scour my clothes .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 25]: When waking , I reckoned to hold the gew-gaws whilst my brains were undisturbed , so I kept them under the same thatch . ''
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 4]: `` Here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 26]: cried Mowbray , opening the box and handing it to Fateh Mohammed , `` these diamonds are worth a lakh and a half of rupees .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 7]: They shall be my bond . ''
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 15]: To a native of India , such a guarantee was worth a thousand oaths .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 13]: Fateh Mohammed might be trusted to take this view and none other .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 17]: The production of a hidden hoard showed that this most enigmatical Englishman was really in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 20]: It needed only a glance to assure him that the gems were worth the sum named , and more .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 15]: His voice was thick as he answered : -- `` Soul of the Prophet !
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 8]: you give me a worthy bail ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 5]: `` You think so !
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 14]: See to it that the box and its contents are well cared for .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 10]: If not I , Nur Mahal knows each stone .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 18]: And now , if we are to march ere the hot hours , let us eat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 18]: Promising to observe his part of the compact , Fateh Mohammed withdrew his imposing array of soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 23]: Soon , a servant brought them some food , curried chickens and rice , with new milk , eggs , and bread .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 43]: Not a word did they exchange until they had eaten , for Mowbray was dismayed by the collapse of his scheme , and he dared not seek from his loyal comrade the forgiveness which would be only too readily extended to him .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 52]: Their fortune as good as lost , their lives in imminent jeopardy , their honor pledged to render themselves up to the spite of an implacable tyrant , and all because he trusted more to the machinations of a beautiful siren than to the good swords of which they were deprived .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 15]: Truly , the outlook , hazardous enough before , was now desperate beyond description .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 15]: No wonder Walter ate silently , fearing to trust his gloomy thoughts to language .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 16]: Suddenly Roger cried : -- `` Gad , these Paradise birds are rare eating ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 7]: `` Birds of Paradise , man !
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 7]: They are but common fowls . ''
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 9]: `` Never , on your life , Walter !
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 8]: This mun be Heaven , for sure .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 13]: I heard the gates click when the musketeers cocked their flints . ''
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 13]: After all , that was the best way to take their misfortunes .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 37]: As Roger said to Fra Pietro , when , later , they told him the news which camp rumor had twisted into grotesque form : -- `` It is your turn now , most worthy friar .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 34]: ` Fight first and pray afterwards ' has ever been my honored motto , but from fighting I am debarred both by loss of my sword and by perjury of my good name .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 22]: Pray , then , brother , in every tongue thou knowest , and mayhap the Lord will list unto thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 10]: Mowbray sought an opportunity to question Jahangir 's emissaries .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 13]: Their statements showed that Jai Singh must have passed them in Allahabad .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 32]: The _ Kotwal _ of that city urged them to keep to the road , and inquire at each large town if boats carrying men and horses had passed down stream .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 12]: In that way they could make sure of intercepting the fugitives .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 17]: `` How came you to slip so quietly away from the camp of Nur Mahal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 39]: he asked , but to this they replied vaguely , so Mowbray concluded that the Chief Eunuch had bribed them to silence , in which event it were best not to tell them of Fateh Mohammed 's admission .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 43]: They said , frankly enough , that had any chance led them to miss the Hughli contingent , the first intimation of the Emperor 's wishes would only have been forthcoming at Allahabad , where the Kotwal must have recognized the sahibs .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 26]: Walter reflected ruefully that , had he bribed this man to silence , he might have despatched the messengers on a hopeless chase by river .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 6]: It was now too late .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 45]: Although so much depended on Jai Singh 's journey to Nur Mahal , he was bound irrevocably to go on to Agra , and must veto the rescue which the gallant Rajput would undoubtedly attempt should matters at court be not to his liking .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 13]: It was an inglorious end to an undertaking which opened so auspiciously .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 26]: The sole consolation Mowbray could derive from soul-wearying thought as to the future arose from the certain relief he had given to the unhappy captives .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 30]: From the depths of misery the Portuguese were raised to a level of comparative comfort , whilst Fra Pietro had assuredly been snatched from the very jaws of death .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 21]: So , at last , Walter resolved to abandon useless gropings against the veil which shrouded the days to come .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 42]: He made himself as agreeable as might be to Fateh Mohammed , and so played upon the latter 's ambitious dreams that not even the hostile Kotwal of Allahabad was able to disturb the arrangement into which they had mutually entered .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 26]: The column crawled up country at a slow rate , for such a mixed company travels perforce at the pace of its most dawdling units .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 33]: Fifteen miles was a good day 's march , and , where a river barred the road , many hours were wasted in safely transferring men and animals from bank to bank .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 18]: And now , for the first time in his life , Roger Sainton fell under petticoat dominance .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 32]: _ Buen principio , la mitad es hecha _ -- `` Well begun is half done '' -- says the Spanish proverb , and certainly the Hathi-sahib made a good start .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 26]: The Countess di Cabota professed that she never felt safe from the perils of the way unless the big Yorkshireman held her mule 's bridle .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 64]: He beguiled the hours by improving her English , of which language she already had a fair knowledge ; she repaid him by many a bright smile , and displayed a most touching assiduity in mastering the broad vowels and quaint phrases of his speech , for Roger 's slow diction was the pure Anglo-Saxon which yet passes current in his native dale .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 31]: They were thrown together the more that Walter sought distraction from troubled reverie in learned discourse with Fra Pietro , and for this sort of talk Roger had no stomach .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 23]: Once Mowbray rallied the giant on the score of the attention he paid to the buxom Countess , but Roger countered aptly .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 28]: `` I ' faith , '' he said , `` she is a merry soul , and not given to love vaporings like most of her sex .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 39]: She tells me her heart troubled her somewhat before she married , but the fit passed quickly , and now she will be well content if the Lord sends her home to wholesome fare and a down pillow .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 13]: After that , commend me to a fat woman for horse sense .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 56]: Your scraggy ones , with saucer eyes , would rather a love philter than a pint of wine , but set down a stoup of both before her Ladyship and I 'll wager our lost box of diamonds that she 'll spill the potion on the ground and the good liquor down her throat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 18]: `` At last , then , you have found a woman who marches with your humor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 20]: `` I 'm not one to judge such a matter quickly , '' murmured Roger with a dubious frown .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 24]: `` They 're full of guile at the best , yet I vow it pleases me to hear Matilda say ` Caramba ! '
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 4]: to her mule .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 15]: It minds me of my mother rating a lie-abed maid of a Monday morning .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 21]: ` Drat you for a huzzy , ' she would cry , ` here is six by the clock already !
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 22]: To-morrow 's Tuesday an ' next day 's Wednesday -- half t ' week gone an ' nowt done ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 10]: `` So the lady 's name is Matilda ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 3]: `` Aye !
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 16]: She has a lot more , but I fancied the sound of that yen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 11]: `` Surely you do not address her so familiarly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 5]: `` And why not ?
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 2]: Gad !
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 15]: she calls me Roger , pat as a magpie with a split tongue . ''
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 6]: `` This is news indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 13]: Yet you tell me she is not inclined to tender passages ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 4]: `` Tender fiddle-de-dee !
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 18]: She laughs like a mime if I tickle her ribs with my thumb when the mule stumbles .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 36]: My soul , Walter , you are grown so used to every woman making sheep 's eyes at you that you think they 'll treat a hulk like me after the same daft fashion . ''
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 29]: `` In truth , '' said Mowbray , sadly , `` my courtships have been all too brief , and threaten to end in aught save laughter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 7]: `` Nay , nay , lad .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 6]: Let not thy spirits fail .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 16]: I can not but think that you and I shall scent the moors again together .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 28]: We have driven our pigs to queer markets ; mayhap we shall sty them yet , despite this cross-eyed Emperor and that fly-by-night , Nur Mahal . ''
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 12]: `` I have dreamed of home in my sleep of late .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 9]: Methought I saw my mother weeping . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 4]: 'T is well .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 7]: They say dreams go by contrary .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 12]: Were it otherwise , has she not good cause to greet ?
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 21]: By the Lord Harry , when we show our noses in Wensleydale , my auld dam will clout my lugs .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 49]: ` Roger , you good-for-nowt , ' she will say , ' I tellt ye te keep Master Mowbray frae harm , and here hev ' ye led him tiv a pleace wheer t ' grass grows downwards and t ' foxes fly i ' t ' air .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 8]: I 'm fair shammed on ye ! '
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 20]: Eh , man , but I 'll be glad to hear her tongue clack i ' that gait . ''
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 21]: And with this cheerful dictum Sainton strode away to bewilder and amuse the Countess di Cabota with his amazing lingo .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 32]: Although they were now enjoying the glorious cold weather of India , the absence of wind and the brilliant sun of the Doab served to render the midday hours somewhat sultry .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 10]: Her Ladyship , being plump , complained of weariness .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 16]: `` You have a most excellent color , '' said Roger , eyeing her critically .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 3]: She sighed .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 20]: `` It may be , '' said she , `` that as we are near Agra my heart droops .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 7]: What manner of man is Jahangir ?
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 10]: Is he of a generous and princely disposition ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 17]: `` If he takes after his father he should be open-handed with other folks ' money .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 36]: I know him to be a fine judge of a woman , which is a right royal attribute ; but he drinks freely , a better quality in a sponge than in a king . ''
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 4]: `` Sancta Maria !
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 10]: A spendthrift , a libertine , and a sot !
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 10]: What hope have we of such a one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 26]: Roger laid a huge paw on her shoulder , and his merry eyes looked down into hers although she was riding a fair sized mule .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 9]: `` Be not cast down , Matilda ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 17]: `` If the sky were cloudy you would not vow the sun would ne'er shine again .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 16]: I observed it was hotter in coming to the Line than under the Line itself .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 23]: Here , Got wot , it is hottest of all , yet fear and fancy may be worse bogies than fact . ''
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 15]: For some reason , his hopeful philosophy did not console the lady that morning .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 16]: She leaned a little against his arm , and glistening tears suddenly dimmed her vision .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 4]: `` Alas ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 27]: she sobbed , `` we are all going to our death , and you , good Roger , have risked your life to no purpose . ''
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 16]: `` Then shall I die in good company , a thing much to be commended .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 17]: He that went to the grave with Elisha recovered his breath owing to his lodging . ''
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 7]: She straightened herself in the saddle .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 13]: `` I like not this talk of dying , '' she snapped .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 19]: `` Gad , it is not greatly to my mind on a fine morning after a hearty meal .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 14]: When I can strike no longer may I fall handsomely , say I .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 29]: Yet I thought you were bent on chewing the unsavory morsel , though , to be sure , you mainly use your teeth to vastly better purpose . ''
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 11]: She glanced up at him , clearing her eyes defiantly .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 15]: `` You make no allowance for a woman 's feelings , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 19]: `` Did I not know the contrary , I should believe you held women of no account . ''
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 13]: `` I ' faith , that would be doing me an injustice .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 14]: When a woman says ` Lack-a-day , ' my tongue wags in sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 14]: If she weeps , my heart grows as soft as a fuzz-ball . ''
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 3]: `` Fuzz-ball !
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 15]: That is a word you have not yet taught me , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 20]: `` It much resembles a round mushroom , and when dry , it bursts if you squeeze it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 6]: `` Oh , go to !
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 8]: I never before met your like . ''
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 38]: She laughed , though there was a spice of irritation in her mirth , but Roger gripped her round the waist , for the mule , more perceptive than the man , stumbled at the right moment .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 11]: To comfort her , he gave her a reassuring hug .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 22]: `` There is naught of the fuzz-ball about thee , Matilda , '' he vowed , and the Countess laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 29]: But she blushed , too , and murmured in her own language : -- `` After all , the truest romance is more than half a comedy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 36]: One night , when the cavalcade was halted in the very village whence Nur Mahal had turned northwards with such quick vagary , an owl hooted from the depths of a _ nim _ tree .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 48]: The weird note thrice boomed unheeded through the air , for all in the camp were weary , but , when the mournful cry rang out for the fourth time , one of Sher Afghán 's Rajputs raised himself quietly from his bed of leaves and listened .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 15]: At the fifth hoot he glanced around and saw that none other was disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 21]: He rose and sauntered quietly towards the tree , in whose deep shade he was lost for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 11]: He returned , and with him now walked another Rajput .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 22]: The two reached the camp fire around which lay their clansmen , and conversed in whispers with others whom they awakened .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 16]: Then the newcomer , following directions , strolled towards the tent occupied by the Englishmen .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 41]: Entering in the dark he was seized by Walter , who was lying sleepless , thinking of the possible outcome had he given Nur Mahal a different answer when they last stood together in the millet-field so near at hand .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 23]: Jai Singh had said that the place was bewitched , and lo , here was Jai Singh himself wriggling in his clutch !
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 34]: As for Roger , the sound of the scuffle roused him , and both Mowbray and he were vastly surprised when the old Rajput gasped : -- `` Slay me not , sahib !
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 11]: My throat is sore enough with screeching to deaf ears .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 8]: Soul of Govind , let go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 9]: Bad news can be told with scant breath .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 31]: It did not take Jai Singh long to acquaint them with the dire intelligence that Nur Mahal , although received in great state by Jahangir , had openly defied him .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 37]: She charged him with the murder of her gallant husband , and , woman-like , even unfairly taunted him with his cowardice in destroying by a trick one whom he dared not encounter in fair fight .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 25]: Lashed to rage by her scorn , Jahangir gave instant orders that she should be sewn in a sack and thrown to the crocodiles .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 31]: But even in that servile court there lingered memories of Akbar 's justice , and the infuriated tyrant was compelled to rescind his cruel mandate before it could be executed .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 11]: Some subtle instinct of statecraft told him the better way .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 37]: He boldly declared that Nur Mahal 's late husband had conspired with others to slay Kutub-ud-din , whilst Sher Afghán had himself fallen a victim to an intrigue between his wife and the Englishman , Mowbray .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 30]: Ibrahim , Chief Eunuch , proved that his royal master was absolutely in ignorance of the facts until he -LRB- Ibrahim -RRB- told him certain things he had discovered .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 23]: Here was actually a receipt showing that Nur Mahal had given the Feringhi jewels worth a lakh and a half of rupees .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 35]: It was evident that her motive in returning to Agra was to stir up disaffection on the one hand and to purge herself of crime in the eyes of the public on the other .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 25]: What better excuse could Oriental monarch devise to clear his own reputation and to confiscate the estates of Sher Afghán and the late Diwán ?
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 48]: A royal _ hukm _ -LSB- L -RSB- was drawn up forthwith , and one of the richest heiresses in India became a pauper , while pensions were conferred on the relatives of those who had been unjustly slain for participating in the attack on Sher Afghán .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 7]: -LSB- Footnote L : Order . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 33]: But remorse is an invisible snake whose fangs can not be drawn , and its venom tortured Jahangir during the few hours each day that his brain was clear of wine fumes .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 23]: The prize he had so dearly bought was now within his power , yet he affected to take no notice of her .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 11]: Nur Mahal was allotted a mean apartment in the seraglio .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 33]: She was appointed an attendant on the king 's mother at a salary of one rupee a day , and the Dowager Queen Mariam was forbidden to show her any favor whatever .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 57]: Though this ordinance was not strictly fulfilled , Jai Singh , when he , after much difficulty and with grave peril , obtained an interview with Nur Mahal , found her doing needlework and painting silk , in which arts she excelled , to support herself and the few devoted women who refused to leave her .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 32]: Jai Singh delivered this budget in an unconcerned way that did not escape Mowbray 's ear , for , in the gloom , he could not see the Rajput 's face .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 16]: `` Nur Mahal knows that we are marching to Agra with the Portuguese captives ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 16]: he asked , when Jai Singh seemed to invite questions rather than continue his recital .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 5]: `` Assuredly , sahib .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 10]: How else could I explain my presence there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 6]: `` Did it need explanation ?
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 13]: Was there no knowledge of Jahangir 's intent to capture me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 27]: The other hesitated , and Mowbray cried bitterly : -- `` Tell all thy tale , Jai Singh , or else leave me in peace . ''
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 5]: `` Hush , sahib !
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 4]: Not so loud .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 14]: I swear by Khuda I am party to no device against your Excellency .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 31]: If I look through glass I can see what is beyond , but if I look into a woman 's mind I peer at the reflection of my own conceits .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 11]: I can only tell you of things as they are .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 17]: When I seek to fathom Nur Mahal 's thoughts I am gazing into a mirror . ''
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 13]: `` Forgive my haste , Jai Singh , and speak on . ''
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 9]: `` My story is nearly ended , sahib .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 25]: At dawn you march to the next camping-ground , which will surely be on the south side of a big nullah fourteen miles ahead .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 24]: While perched in the tree I noted the lie of the camp , and , doubtless , it is the same each night .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 13]: At the eleventh hour I and threescore followers will cross the nullah .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 3]: Be ready !
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 11]: Strike fearlessly when you hear an owl hoot three times .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 24]: If the commotion starts in the center they will think the devil has broken loose when the real attack comes from the flank .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 26]: There will be led horses in plenty once we ford the nullah , provided you tell me now how many will escape with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 5]: `` And then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 14]: `` Then we ride to the east and back to the south . ''
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 5]: `` Whither bound ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 4]: `` To Burdwán .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 14]: Nowhere else can we obtain shelter until we make our next move . ''
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 9]: `` The plan is Nur Mahal 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 12]: `` You forget , sahib , it is your own . ''
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 5]: `` But she approves .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 4]: What of her ?
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 7]: Does she bide in Agra ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 14]: `` She bides there , sahib , if that be your wish . ''
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 8]: Was that her word to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 8]: `` Nothing could be clearer , sahib .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 20]: If you choose to help her she will escape from the palace and join you at an agreed place .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 27]: If your only desire is to make for the sea I am pledged to her on Ganges water to aid you with money and life . ''
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 31]: `` But she is poor , you said , obliged to adorn others not worthy to adjust her gown if beauty were alone to wait on the most beautiful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 18]: `` There is money in plenty for the removal of Jahangir , '' was the laconic answer .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 7]: `` Hearest thou , Roger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 15]: said Mowbray , reaching out to touch his comrade 's arm in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 17]: `` Aye , lad , I hear , '' came the giant 's low growl . ''
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 18]: 'T is a pity affairs are ordered differently , else we should see some pretty fighting . ''
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 8]: Jai Singh , too , leaned forward .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 12]: He thought they were agreeing that he had planned most excellently .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 47]: Already he could sniff the sacking of Agra fort , in which the accumulated treasure was so great , when Akbar had an inventory made , that four hundred pairs of scales were kept at work five months weighing silver , gold , and precious stones .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 7]: His breath came thick and fast .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 18]: His voice gurgled just as it did under the pressure of Mowbray 's hands on his windpipe .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 16]: A revolt now , properly handled , would mean the loot of a century . ''
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 12]: ` Twill soon be sunrise , sahiba , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 6]: `` I must be going .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 22]: Remember , the eleventh hour -- three hoots -- '' `` Stay , Jai Singh , '' said Walter , quietly .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 10]: `` There must be no attempt at a rescue .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 19]: If any attack be made on the column , Sainton-sahib and I will strike hard for Fateh Mohammed .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 15]: We have given our bond to accompany him to the very presence of Jahangir .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 16]: God helping us we will maintain our honor in this matter as in all others .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 12]: Go you , and tell Nur Mahal what I have said .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 6]: There is no other way .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 33]: We are pledged to meet the Emperor face to face as his prisoners , and he must do with us what he wills , or , rather , what God wills . ''
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 12]: `` Sahib , you know not what you are refusing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 17]: `` Go , nevertheless , Jai Singh , and tell Nur Mahal that I have refused .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 12]: Perchance , now , she may hasten alone to Burdwán . ''
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 10]: `` Hear me , sahib , I beseech you .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 19]: She rode to Agra meaning to marry Jahangir , but her gorge rose at the sight of him .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 9]: Do not hold her guilty of deceiving you .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 19]: It was your memory which forced bitter words from her lips when the Emperor expected her kisses . ''
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 6]: `` It may be so .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 17]: But when you gave your oath by the sacred Ganges you meant to keep it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 7]: `` Until death , sahib . ''
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 19]: `` Know then , Jai Singh , that Sainton-sahib and I have given our word to Fateh Mohammed .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 13]: An Englishman 's word is strong as any vow by holy river .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 15]: You have discharged your trust most faithfully -- would that I could reward you !
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 5]: But I am penniless .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 17]: Even certain diamonds , concerning which Jahangir was rightly informed , are part of my bond .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 28]: Leave us , good friend , and warn Nur Mahal that we are , perhaps , less able to help her than she to help us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 21]: CHAPTER XVI `` And when a lady 's in the case , You know all other things give place . ''
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 12]: _ Gay _ , `` The Hare and Many Friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 53]: Fateh Mohammed , whose name , literally translated , meant `` The Victorious and Praised , '' intended to halt his cohort a short day 's ride from Agra , in order to patch its way-worn aspect into some semblance of dignity ere he entered the presence of the King of Kings .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 23]: Had he ever heard of Falstaff he might well have cried with Sir John : `` No eye hath seen such scarecrows .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 14]: I 'll not march through Coventry with them , that 's flat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 33]: The wear and tear of seven hundred miles had pressed so heavily on the resources of guards and prisoners alike that their clothes and accouterments did , indeed , require some furbishing .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 15]: In this ragged regiment the Englishmen and their Rajputs alone presented a reputable appearance .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 64]: But , stout though he was , and otherwise much resembling plump Jack in his rascally tastes , Fateh Mohammed possessed a fair share of Eastern wiliness , so he took good care to apprise Jahangir beforehand of the curious conditions under which he was bringing to the capital the two men whose presence there was so greatly desired by his imperial master .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 16]: The recital naturally showed that the fat man was a model of zeal and discretion .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 81]: If the Conqueror of the World regarded the Giaours as malefactors , here they were , ready to be bound and dealt with according to the King 's command , but , should it happen to please the Planet-born to treat them as friends , naught had been done to give ground for other supposition , save in such slight and easily arranged matters as disarming them and holding certain valuable securities for their observance of the pact agreed upon .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 51]: Hence , Fateh Mohammed felt neither `` victorious '' nor `` praised '' when a high official , accompanied by a glittering retinue , rode out from Agra and greeted Mowbray and Sainton with much deference , inviting them to return with him forthwith and accept the Emperor 's hospitality !
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 28]: They had gone through so many vicissitudes of late that this bewildering attitude on the part of the Mogul monarch left them outwardly unmoved though inwardly amazed .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 18]: No one could be more surprised than Mowbray , the too successful prophet of the royal intent .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 67]: Yet he bowed his polite acceptance of the proffered honors , and his manner was discretion itself when Fateh Mohammed , jelly-like in agitation , expressing his regrets with the spluttering haste of water poured from a narrow-necked bottle , hastened to restore not only the cedar box with its contents intact , but also the swords and daggers stolen from the Englishmen while they slept .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 39]: Mowbray did not know then that the court official had curtly told Fateh Mohammed he was in grave peril of being hanged on the nearest tree if Jahangir had reason to complain of his treatment of the strangers .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 41]: It was in vain that the fat man pleaded the Emperor 's written instructions , which were ambiguous certainly , but which must be interpreted by his Majesty 's anxiety to secure the presence of the two Feringhis at Agra .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 72]: `` If you interpret a King 's wishes you run the risk of making a false translation , '' was the chilling response , so Fateh Mohammed was left alternately thanking the Prophet that he had not obeyed his inclinations and slain the Giaours when he learnt how they had hoodwinked him , and shivering with fear lest , after all , Jahangir might find cause to be displeased with him .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 26]: Therefore , he groveled before Mowbray , and , like Prince Henry 's sack-loving companion , wished `` it were bedtime and all well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 22]: The mystery of the Emperor 's attitude deepened when Walter learned that Nur Mahal was , indeed , a palace menial .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 27]: Even the weather-cock courtier , skilled in the art of polite evasion , did not scruple to show his contempt for feminine influences at the best .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 17]: `` I have seen many such butterflies dancing in the sun , '' he said scoffingly .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 18]: `` They are very brilliant until the rain falls , or some hungry bird eats them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 36]: His orders were to conduct the Englishmen and their followers to Dilkusha , where they would be in the midst of familiar surroundings , and it was Jahangir 's wish to receive them that afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 30]: When Mowbray insisted that Fra Pietro should come with them the envoy was dubious at first , but Walter would not yield the point , which was ultimately conceded .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 21]: As for the others , they were to bide in their present camp until arrangements were made for their disposal .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 4]: `` Gad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 21]: cried Roger , paying some heed to this statement , `` that will not be to Matilda 's liking ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 15]: `` Have affairs come to the pass that you may not be parted ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 30]: asked Walter , roguishly , his perplexities vanishing for the moment as he pictured the Countess 's agitation when told she was to be separated from her cavalier . ''
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 36]: 'T is to me a matter of no great cavil , '' was the reply , `` but the poor body will surely miss me when the mule crosses a bad bit of road . ''
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 9]: `` Why not bring her with us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 3]: `` Aye .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 7]: That is to be thought of .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 17]: There are always more ways of killing a dog than choking him wi ' butter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 11]: `` But you must marry the lady first , Roger .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 19]: At a pinch , Fra Pietro -- '' `` The devil fly off with thee and thy pinching !
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 5]: Who spoke of marrying ?
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 18]: Thy humor , at times , Walter , is dry as the Swale after a drought . ''
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 23]: `` From what I have seen of the Countess I fear that marriage will be the only cure for her affliction . ''
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 8]: `` By the cross of Osmotherly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 23]: cried Sainton , hotly , `` if that be her malady she will ail a long time ere I give her physic .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 4]: Marry , forsooth !
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 25]: If ever I seek a wife , which I greatly doubt , I 'll hitch up wi ' a lass from my own dales .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 41]: Not that Matilda is ill-looking , or , for that matter , as skittish as some I have seen , but may the Lord help any woman I bring to Wensley afore my mother runs an eye over her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 14]: `` I fear , then , her Ladyship must remain here willy-nilly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 22]: Sainton , more annoyed than he cared to show , drew his long neglected sword and began to burnish it affectionately .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 28]: `` Thou hast a toad 's tongue at times , lad , '' he growled , breathing on the steel before rubbing it to a fine sheen .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 42]: `` The thing had not troubled me a whit hadst thou not spoken of it , but , now I come to think over bygones , I am constrained to admit that mayhap her Ladyship may have construed my actions amiss .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 18]: Women are oft prone to look through a chink when the door is open all the time .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 9]: On my soul I fear to face her .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 12]: My hang-dog looks will betray me and she 'll upbraid me .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 22]: Go thou , Walter , and tell her -- tell her -- '' `` That thou hast no mind to wed. .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 15]: Nay , Roger , that would be ungallant , to say the least . ''
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 13]: `` Tell her any glib lie that will get me safely away .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 25]: Samson was half conquered when it was known wherein his strength lay , and my only sure refuge is flight if a woman attacks .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 3]: Poor Matilda !
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 10]: I would I had the heart to appease her .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 23]: Yet I am not for matrimony , and no barber can make a wig of a hide that is bald of wool .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 11]: But I vow you have vexed me by your niceties .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 4]: Drat the thing !
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 28]: I trust the bit of Latinity our worthy friar gave me yester e ` en is sound sense , else I 'll mope for a week . ''
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 9]: `` And what was that , Roger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 13]: asked Mowbray , turning to hide a smile from his wrathful friend .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 27]: `` He spoke to me of certain passages twixt you and Nur Mahal , as he built somewhat on her power despite Jai Singh 's story .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 10]: Yet he sighed and said : ` Quid vento ?
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 2]: Mulier .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 3]: Quid muliere ?
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 3]: Nihil ! '
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 32]: It tickled my fancy to put the quip into rhyme : -- ` More fickle than wind Is woman 's mind ; More fickle than woman Naught you 'll find . '
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 3]: Beshrew me !
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 23]: It fitted Nur Mahal all right , but the cap seems to sit awry when worn by my jolly and pleasant-spoken Countess .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 17]: Would you grin at me , you dog , like a clown gaping through a horse-collar ?
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 17]: I 'll wager , were the business yours , you 'd carry a longer jowl . ''
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 23]: `` On my word , Roger , if you trumpet so loudly I must even believe that my Elephant is sore wounded .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 8]: Why say aught to-day to the Countess ?
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 39]: Once we are sped on some new path I promise to write her on your behalf , and in such a strain that any silly notions she may be harboring shall vanish after a day 's fasting . ''
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 8]: `` Ecod , you know not Matilda .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 10]: She would not miss her dinner for twenty men .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 9]: And that is what draws me to her .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 9]: A plague on all weddings , I say .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 9]: They mar a woman and vex a man .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 4]: What the devil !
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 46]: A nice thing Noah did for the world when he took nowt but pairs into the Ark. '' Nevertheless , though angered by his tardy discovery , Sainton was far too good-natured to steal away covertly from the genial presence of the Countess di Cabota .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 14]: He cudgeled his brains to invent some reasonable excuse for bidding her farewell .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 21]: Finally he hit upon an expedient that pleased him greatly , and chased the unwonted frown from his cheerful face .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 60]: In view of the expected state visit to Jahangir he had donned his best garments , which , though soiled , were yet free from rents , and never a finer man trod the iron earth of India than Roger that day when , with his four-foot sword clanking against his thigh , he approached the Countess 's camping-place .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 10]: Already , of course , rumor had been busy .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 31]: The perturbation of Fateh Mohammed and the haughty curling of Rajput mustaches which followed the advent of Jahangir 's envoy told some portion of the tale to the stealthy-eyed natives .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 5]: Gossip did the rest .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 11]: Roger found the Countess all agog with joyous hope . ''
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 6]: _ Por gracia di Dios !
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 30]: _ '' she cried , clapping her hands , `` now that I see you wearing your sword I know that what I have been told is true . ''
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 28]: `` I ' faith , Matilda , you are a rare hand at guessing sheep when you smell roast mutton , '' was his hearty greeting . ''
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 18]: 'T is indeed true that some favoring star hath moved the king to deal with us kindly .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 14]: Perchance 't is the moon , which is said to rule certain humans .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 6]: But my news is stale .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 9]: I come to take leave of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 27]: The Countess 's ruddy cheeks paled beneath the tan of long exposure to the open air , and a spasm of fear dilated her pretty eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 7]: `` To take leave of me !
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 4]: _ Mater misericordiæ !
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 6]: _ What say you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 13]: `` Nay , my bonny Countess , you read my words wrongly .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 13]: Master Mowbray and I are bidden ride ahead to meet the Emperor .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 5]: That is all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 8]: `` You will return ere night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 8]: Roger stroked his chin with dubious calculation .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 10]: The action enabled him to avoid her startled glance .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 29]: `` I have my doubts , '' he said , and , not so sure now of the simplicity of his errand , wisely added not another word .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 21]: `` Do you mean that you go on to Agra and leave me here with -- with Fateh Mohammed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 19]: There was a directness , yet a veiled inference , in the question that did not escape him .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 10]: `` Be reasonable , Matilda , '' he pleaded .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 9]: `` We go but to prepare the way .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 20]: You forget that Jahangir , for some reason not known to any of us , is changing his plans .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 10]: From fire and murder he hath turned to clemency .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 22]: It may be that he thinks some quiet talk with Master Mowbray may clear the thorns from his new path . ''
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 15]: `` Then let Master Mowbray go to him , and you bide here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 6]: `` That can not be .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 6]: It would argue distrust . ''
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 34]: `` I think I understand , '' said the Countess , quietly , with all a woman 's irritating assumption of the truth when a man would soothe her with a plausible tale .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 19]: Roger , whose wit was keen enough when he encountered opposition , was helpless before this passive attitude .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 12]: Yet he blundered on , trusting to luck to extricate him .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 36]: He fumbled with a small package he took from his breast , and swayed from one foot to the other , losing some of his gallant air in an attitude which reflected his mental stress .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 15]: `` There 's nowt to make sike a pother about , '' he growled .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 20]: `` We haste to Agra , you follow more slowly , and that is all there is to it .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 35]: But you are in sad plight , Matilda , after these weary days of travel , without a stitch to your old clothes , so to speak , or means to buy new ones .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 13]: Now , a lady of your condition should be garbed more reputably .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 26]: Though I doubt not Jahangir will treat you generously in his altered mood , I would not have you wholly dependent on his tardy grace .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 31]: I have no money , but here is money 's worth , and it can never be put to better use than in purchasing the wherewithal to adorn you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 48]: So saying , and thankful that the concluding sentence , which he had concocted with some care , had not escaped his memory , he dropped Sher Afghán 's magnificent gold chain into her lap , for the Countess was sitting on a saddle outside the tent .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 27]: She bent forward , as if to examine the present , passing each of the fine turquoises with which it was set mechanically through her fingers .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 13]: She managed so well that her voice seemed to be under control .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 16]: `` You are very kind and thoughtful , '' she said in a low tone .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 13]: `` I am , indeed , much in need of repair . ''
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 3]: `` Gad !
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 10]: I would smite sorely the man who said so .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 12]: I spoke of the husk , not of the kernel . ''
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 13]: `` And I shall value the gift highly , '' she continued .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 8]: `` Stick out for the last rupee .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 6]: These Agra goldsmiths are thieves .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 12]: If not the whole , you might sell a portion . ''
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 7]: Her head drooped a little more .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 29]: `` They are beautiful links , well knit , and of the best workmanship , '' she said , `` and I have never before seen such stones .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 9]: ` Twould be a pity to sunder them .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 21]: They will be pleasant to look upon long after the flimsy silks they would buy are faded and threadbare . ''
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 19]: Resignation , not to say hopelessness , was a new phase to Sainton in woman 's varying humors .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 28]: Had the Countess di Cabota stormed , or protested , or even broken down utterly , Roger , though profoundly uncomfortable , might have survived the ordeal .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 7]: But the merry-eyed lady was crushed .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 30]: She who was wont to toss her curls so saucily when he tried that excellent specific of a thumb in the ribs now sat before him with hidden face .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 8]: And Roger was terrible only in war .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 25]: Let him have his way he was easily swayed as a child ; but to-day he was a child perplexed by a new problem .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 32]: `` If you are not minded to use the gaud in that way , '' he growled hesitatingly , `` I must devise some other manner of meeting your wants . ''
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 12]: `` I am greatly beholden to you , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 44]: `` Mayhap I may not see you again , so , should you succeed in sending me some money , let your messenger bring a parchment , and I will write an order on a certain house in London for your repayment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 4]: This was unbearable .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 17]: Roger stooped , placed a great hand under her chin , and raised her unresisting face .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 26]: His unlooked-for action caused pent-up tears to tremble on her eyelashes , while there was a suspicious quivering in the corners of her red lips .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 31]: `` Are you bent on plaguing me , Matilda , or is it that you truly believe I am seeking some pretense to go away under a false flag ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 4]: he demanded fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 9]: `` I can not tell you , Roger .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 5]: You know best yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 5]: Why should I complain ?
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 19]: I owe my life , and many days of happiness , to you and to your good friend .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 33]: Whether you go or stay may the Lord watch over you , and bring you safely to that pleasant home in the North of which you have so often spoken to me !
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 17]: I think I have seen it in my dreams , and the notion pleases me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 21]: She caught his hand and would have pressed it to her face , but he was too quick for her .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 24]: Before she well knew what was happening she was lifted to her feet , and Roger had kissed her heartily on the lips .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 13]: `` That is a quittance for the chain , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 26]: `` When I want another for the money I shall bring thee , be not surprised if I discharge the debt in like fashion . ''
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 21]: Woman-like she glanced hastily around , all aglow with sudden embarrassment , to learn if others had observed his action .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 15]: Certainly the eyes of some of the Portuguese captives were turned curiously towards them .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 9]: Making a tremendous effort , she laughed gaily .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 19]: `` Your English leave-taking is very nice , but somewhat unusual to our ideas , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 14]: `` Nevertheless , I am glad to have your promise to return . ''
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 12]: `` I swear it , by the cross of Osmotherly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 71]: vowed Roger , and with this mighty oath the Countess was satisfied , though , as a good Catholic , she might have been surprised if she knew that the giant 's favorite expletive only referred to a crossroad on the summit of a Yorkshire hill , where King Oswald is supposed to lie buried by the side of his mother , whence the name Osmotherly : `` Oswald-by-his-mother-lay . ''
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 22]: There was some dubiety among the remaining Europeans when they saw the Englishmen ride off with Fra Pietro and the Rajputs .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 17]: So might sheep feel in a wolf-infested land , if the shepherds and dogs were withdrawn .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 24]: `` What is to become of us , '' they asked , `` and why have our protectors taken the friar alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 10]: But the Countess bade them be of good cheer .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 12]: `` They will come back , '' she said , calmly .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 17]: `` They have promised ; and those men never say what they do not mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 28]: Yet one of the pair reflected ruefully , as he jogged towards Agra , that he had said a good deal more than he meant to say .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 38]: Mowbray , noting his comrade 's introspective mood , forbore to question him as to his farewell interview with the Countess , and Roger quaked at the thought of putting into words his recollections of the scene .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 27]: So Walter chatted with Fra Pietro , seeking that grave counselor 's views as to the possible motives which inspired Jahangir 's remarkable _ volte-face _ .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 28]: To reach the Garden of Heart 's Delight the cavalcade crossed a ford of the Jumna and followed a road along the left bank of the river .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 22]: Thus , they passed close to the royal palace , being separated from it only by the width of the stream .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 38]: Its lofty red sandstone walls , high piled towers and threatening battlements , topped by the exquisite spires and minarets of the white marble buildings within , made a resplendent and awe-inspiring picture in the vivid sunlight .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 33]: Dominating the cluster of regal apartments on the river face was the superb Diwán-i-Khas , or Hall of Private Audience , which stands to this day `` a miracle of beauty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 5]: Mowbray knew it well .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 37]: Behind its inlaid walls lay the garden in which Akbar chaffered with the ladies at the fair , and on the south side was the broad terrace whence Roger heaved the great stone onto the tiger .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 44]: Standing boldly out in the angle formed by the Diwán-i-Khas and the terrace was the Golden Pavilion , so called because of its roof of gilded copper , and nestling close to this glittering apex of the zenana was the fairy-like Jasmine Tower .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 16]: No strange eyes might dare to rest on that imperial sanctuary save from a distance .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 145]: Yet Mowbray , from description oft repeated , could tell the Franciscan some of its glories ; how the marble pavement of its inner court represented a pachisi-board , on which the Sultana and her ladies played a clever game with shells ; how the lovely lattice-work of the window screens was cut out of solid slabs of marble ; how trailing devices of flowers and fruit were fashioned in pietra dura with carnelians , agates , turquoises , and all manner of bright colored or sparkling gems ; how fountains made music where marble baths were sunk in the floor , while the dripping naiads who emerged from the cool depths might survey their charms in the Shish Mahal , or Room of a Thousand Mirrors , wherein a cascade of rippling water fell over a tiny terrace artificially lighted with colored lamps .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 38]: These and other marvels did he pour into Fra Pietro 's ears , until the friar piously crossed himself and said with a smile : -- `` Yet a little while and these glories shall be forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 26]: ` Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was ; and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 56]: `` But you will grant , good brother , that a man only lives once on earth , and it would be scarce credible , did we not know it , that with all our Western wit we have naught in London or Paris to match the skill of these barbarians , '' cried Walter .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 25]: `` I have seen in old Rome the crumbling fragments of palaces for which the proudest hall in Agra might serve as an ante-chamber .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 28]: Brethren , more traveled than I , and learned men withal , have told me of the still more wondrous works of ancient Greece and forgotten Babylon .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 10]: Of what avail are the vain efforts of man !
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 14]: ` Lord , a day in Thy courts is better than a thousand .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 17]: Heaven and earth shall pass away , but Thy word shall not pass away . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 17]: Though the friar spoke Latin when he quoted the Bible , Walter followed his thought closely .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 15]: Here was a man wholly unmoved by the pomp and vanity of the world .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 27]: Fra Pietro paid more heed to a budding shrub as a manifest sign of the Creator than to all the transient splendor of the Mogul capital .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 61]: Yet he was one who seldom mixed religion with his conversation , and it is reasonable to suppose that his utterances would have taken a less abstract form had he known that the bright eyes of Nur Mahal were even then fixed intently on the cavalcade from the recess of a small apartment over the Water Gate of the palace .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 69]: Perchance the subtle mesmerism of her glance was more potent with his gentle spirit than with the hardier soul of the young Englishman , for his sedate mule had not gone many paces by the side of Walter 's mettlesome Arab ere he spoke again : -- `` Forgive me , friend , '' he said , `` if I broke in on your discourse with solemn reflections .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 24]: One must be boorish , indeed , to deny a just meed of praise to the designers and builders of yonder superb pile .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 23]: Tell me , as you seem to know its ways so well , in what quarter does Nur Mahal probably dwell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 9]: and Mowbray pointed straight towards the Water Gate .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 9]: That is the very heart of the fortress .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 9]: It will be difficult to reach her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 15]: `` Difficult indeed , dangerous for a native and wholly impossible for a European .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 7]: But why do you ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 29]: The Franciscan 's remark took his hearers by surprise , and Roger , who listened silently to their talk , smiled for the first time during five hours .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 29]: `` Hola , my chuck , '' he muttered to himself , `` now it is thy turn to be roasted while a woman turns the spit . ''
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 22]: `` I think she is the _ fons et origo _ of all that has occurred , '' said the friar .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 23]: `` Whether exalted or lowly , such a woman will ever be the yeast in the leaven of a man like Jahangir .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 42]: He may neither believe nor admit that this is so , yet I incline to the opinion that the character of your reception is due to the promptings of a higher intelligence than that with which the Emperor is endowed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 26]: `` I would rest assured if Nur Mahal supplied his inspiration , '' answered Mowbray , conscious that Roger 's eye was cocked at him .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 25]: `` But remember there is a chance that my arch-enemy , Dom Geronimo , may have survived the Emperor 's edict against the Christians .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 28]: In the East one perforce looks for guile , and I fear that the smooth seeming of Jahangir 's actions may prove a snare for our undoing .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 15]: I account in that way for the desire to separate us from the others .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 16]: It is idle to say that this great city could not house us without preparation .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 13]: And now you have my secret mind as to your presence here .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 17]: If Jahangir means evil , Roger and I , knowing his methods , may defeat him .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 20]: Assuredly you are safer with us than with the poor souls who remain in Fateh Mohammed 's custody . ''
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 16]: Then Roger swore so violently that Fra Pietro turned and looked at the fort again .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 7]: `` By all the fiends ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 21]: he roared , `` why didst thou not tell me thy secret mind , as thou callest it , earlier ?
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 27]: Here have I left Matilda with yon spawn of Old Nick , and kept her content only by a pledge to return with proper haste . ''
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 5]: `` Roger , Roger !
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 11]: never before hast thou addressed me with such unreasoning heat .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 14]: Who asked thee , this morning , to bring the lady with us ?
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 10]: Who asked me to make thy excuses to her ?
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 11]: What of my dry humor , my toad 's tongue ?
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 24]: Who was it that grinned like a clown through a horse-collar because he would not lie glibly enough to suit thy purpose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 22]: Sainton gulped down his wrath , but Mowbray was disturbed by the expression of ox-like stubbornness which suddenly clouded his face .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 11]: Roger , wearing such aspect , was hard to control .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 10]: `` I mun go back , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 10]: `` Look for me ere midnight , Walter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 15]: Without another word of explanation he bared his sword and wheeled his powerful horse .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 7]: `` Make way , there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 3]: he bellowed .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 8]: `` Out of my path , swine !
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 15]: Quickly , ye sons of pigs , I am not to be stayed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 19]: Thinking the Hathi-sahib had gone mad the troopers who rode with Jahangir 's emissary scattered right and left .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 35]: Mowbray , though vexed by the untoward incident , promptly endeavored to rob it of grave significance by ordering half a dozen of his own Rajputs to follow Sainton-sahib and help him if necessary .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 17]: Before the nawab who headed their escort quite realized what was happening , Roger had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 46]: The last glimpse Mowbray obtained of his gigantic countryman was when Sainton , sitting bolt upright on his charger and holding his sword aloft like a steel torch , disappeared in the cloud of dust created by the passage of himself and his small troop .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 13]: -LSB- Illustration : `` Out of my path , swine . '' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 36]: Now , the high-placed official was vastly offended by Roger 's rude and peremptory words , and some little time elapsed before Mowbray 's apologies , couched in the most polite Persian , were accepted .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 31]: There was nothing for it but to credit the Colossus with a touch of the sun , and add thereto a hint of his passionate attachment for the buxom Countess .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 9]: Even then Walter 's difficulties were not exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 33]: Fra Pietro , speaking very firmly , said that his place was with his people , and he would be glad if some arrangement were made whereby he could return to them .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 16]: `` It is not to be thought of , '' was Mowbray 's instant answer .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 43]: `` Not only will Roger create difficulty enough when he encounters Fateh Mohammed , should the latter oppose the departure of the Countess , but I look to you to champion the cause of the other captives at our meeting with Jahangir .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 10]: A woman may account for my comrade 's absence .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 8]: Such excuse will not avail you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 5]: The friar bowed meekly .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 30]: `` I would not burthen you with fresh cares , '' he said , `` but I can not save my own life and leave my flock to perish .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 22]: Nevertheless , if it be best in your judgment , I will go with you into the Emperor 's presence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 27]: Mowbray 's resolute features must have shown the irritation which mastered him , for the Franciscan added : -- `` Be not angered with your friend .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 25]: He hath a heart of a size to match his body , and 't is a man 's privilege to protect the weaker sex .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 15]: ` From the beginning of creation God made them male and female . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 20]: `` Believe me , brother , I am mostly concerned about my own lack of foresight in this matter .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 28]: Thank Heaven there is no woman here for whose sake I should be compelled to act , it may be , even more hastily than Roger ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 22]: `` Did you not tell me that Nur Mahal inhabits that portion of the zenana situate over the Water Gate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 9]: `` Yes ; what if she does ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 17]: `` While Master Sainton was venting his ire I chanced to turn my eyes that way .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 12]: A white scarf fluttered for an instant high above the gate .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 5]: there it is again !
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 11]: Take heed lest some of the others follow your glance !
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 35]: You are not prone to rash vows , friend , yet I am much mistaken if there be not a woman in Agra who shall perplex you sorely ere many hours have passed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 32]: And , indeed , Walter did see a whirl of muslin tremble in the air like a tiny cloud from one of the many small windows which pierced the frowning battlements .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 9]: CHAPTER XVII `` Under which King , Bezonian ?
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 6]: Speak , or die ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 14]: _ King Henry IV _ , Part II , Act 5 , Sc .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 2]: 3 .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 41]: When a woman 's head governs her heart she is to be feared ; and that is why Providence , meaning her to be loved , ordained that , for the most part , her heart should govern her head .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 30]: In the rarer descriptions of the human clay a woman unites in herself romance and the critical faculty , as though the Master delighted in blending Aphrodite with Athene .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 14]: Nur Mahal , true daughter of the gods , was such a one .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 22]: Gifted with the intelligence and cold intellect of an empire-ruler she seldom yielded to the divine femininity which was her birthright .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 30]: It was an impulse of sheer emotion which led her to betray her joy by a signal when she distinguished Mowbray in the midst of the troop of horse .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 39]: Not unnaturally , she interpreted the sudden halt caused by Roger 's anxiety anent the Countess as arising from Mowbray 's wish to let her know that he had seen the fluttering scarf and rightly guessed its owner .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 9]: If so , his action was an indiscretion .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 18]: Who could tell how many pairs of eyes were watching him from hidden chamber or open battlements ?
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 27]: The departure of Sainton in such furious haste puzzled her exceedingly , but she was reassured when Mowbray turned his horse 's head again towards Dilkusha .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 45]: She knew now that the brown-robed stranger who rode so near to him was not only the friend , spoken of by Jai Singh , for whom the Englishman had dared so greatly , but that he , too , had observed her token .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 40]: So she ventured to thrust forth the gossamer muslin a second time , and she was sure that Mowbray looked towards her and bowed gracefully , even raising his hat to show that he was aware of her presence .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 49]: In Agra , during the Mogul dynasty , such was the perfection reached by the weaver 's art , muslin was fashioned of a texture so delicate that a turban or girdle , if spread out , would sink gently , with surprising slowness , to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 26]: Nur Mahal , though impoverished , still retained her wardrobe , and this scarf was one of the lightest and most beautiful in her possession .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 26]: Nevertheless , a flaming torch thrust into an oil-soaked beacon could not have kindled a tocsin fire of more furious significance than those floating folds .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 20]: Aware of her environment she , having hastily adjudged Mowbray guilty of imprudence , should have been prudent herself .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 27]: But prudence is a negative quality seldom allied with the magnetic powers which sway men , and Nur Mahal was bold in either love or hate .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 7]: Moreover , she despised her enemies .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 42]: So it came to pass that the Emperor pleaded fatigue when Mowbray and Fra Pietro rode to the palace that afternoon , and they returned to the Garden of Heart 's Delight more perplexed than ever by Jahangir 's inscrutable attitude .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 9]: Of Jai Singh they could glean no tidings .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 22]: All the servants in the late Diwán 's residence were newcomers and Mahomedans , to whom the old Rajput was unknown .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 44]: His fellow-clansmen of the escort had no later intelligence of his movements than Walter himself , who , though restored to familiar surroundings , was nevertheless in the position of a traveler returned to a place whence the well-known landmarks have been effaced .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 47]: Fra Pietro , in his placid way , admired the beauty of the garden , the elegance of the building , the wealth of roses and flowering plants which adorned each lovely vista , and then settled down to read his breviary by the waning light .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 60]: `` It is a salutary practise , '' said he quietly , `` to turn one 's thoughts heavenward when the world grows dark , '' and indeed , Walter , confused by a hundred conflicting issues , found himself regretting the lack of spirituality in his soul which rendered such solace unattainable in the present stress of events .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 7]: For never was man more mystified .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 17]: Clemency , even from a Mogul ruler , was not altogether a vain thing to expect .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 10]: But why had Jahangir 's grace taken such form ?
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 35]: If the Europeans were to be well received , why had the Emperor denied them admission to the fort under a trumpery excuse , after having expressed a wish to see them at once ?
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 5]: Where was Jai Singh ?
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 42]: Evidently Nur Mahal , assuming it was she who signalled from the tower , had definite news of their coming , and it was most unlikely that she could be so accurately informed save through the medium of her devoted adherent .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 48]: What mad adventure was Roger engaged in that he was not come ere sunset , for he would reach Fateh Mohammed 's camp about noon , and he would surely hasten the Countess 's departure , if unopposed , to permit arrival at Dilkusha before night fell ?
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 39]: Yet the shadows cast by the cypress trees were fast merging with the somber pall spreading over the land , and not a sound of jingling mule bells or clanking steel came to the anxious listener 's ears .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 12]: Darkness fell with the phenomenal rapidity of the vast Indian plain .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 5]: The sky was overcast .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 27]: The winter rains were long due , and heavy clouds were massed aloft ready to break when the first cold wind swept down from the Himalayas .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 43]: But the wind , as Fra Pietro would have it , was only surpassed in fickleness by woman , and it chose now to linger in the icy solitudes of the awful hills rather than seek the pasture lands awaiting its caress .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 52]: Hence , the atmosphere was oppressive , stirred only by languorous zephyrs from the southwest , and the silence of the garden was such that the uneasy perching of a bird or the rustle of a mongoose in the undergrowth were sounds of import , demanding watchful eyes and strained hearing .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 22]: Mowbray and the friar were lodged in that part of the building which overlooked the _ baraduri _ , or summer-house .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 21]: As frail man , whether warrior or saint , must eat , the pair partook of a well served meal .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 21]: Other things being equal the repast would have provided a grateful change from the hard fare of the journey up-country .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 19]: But anxiety is a poor sauce , and they ate rather because they must than because they chose .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 17]: And now , even the Franciscan put aside for the hour his indifference to matters mundane .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 14]: `` Our good Roger is belated , I fear , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 28]: `` Unless he cometh soon I shall offer a prayer in his behalf to St. James , the special patron of all who travel by night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 47]: `` If the result be guaranteed , brother , pray earnestly , I beg you , and , should your list of heavenly advocates include one noted for his wise counsel , ask him to guide our steps aright when next we leave this bewitched abode .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 34]: In my childhood I was told that the little people who dwell under the green knolls on the hillsides always lead those mortals who fall into their power to scenes of fairy beauty .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 10]: Certes , this garden is planned for like sorcery .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 27]: I first entered it a simple trader , but ever since that day my brains have been clouded and my feet meshed in hidden snares . ''
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 22]: Walter spoke bitterly , else he would not have even hinted at his disbelief in the efficacy of the apostolic protection .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 32]: There never was man of humbler spirit than Fra Pietro , yet he took up the cudgels in earnest when his companion seemed to discredit the son of Zebedee and Salome .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 17]: `` Blame not the Garden of Eden because it held a snake , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 49]: `` Whether in garden or desert the Lord will listen to my petition , and grant it the more readily , should it be for the good of my soul , if it be carried to the foot of the throne by a holy sponsor like St. James .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 36]: His mother , some commentators hold , was sister to the Blessed Virgin ; he taught the gospel to each of the twelve tribes ; and he was the first Christian bishop to undergo martyrdom .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 53]: He is ever portrayed with the gourd , shell , staff , and cap of a traveler , and it is only reasonable to suppose that such a pillar of the Church should be in special favor in that eternal garden where he is receiving the reward of his earthly sufferings . ''
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 20]: The friar 's outburst , delivered with much fervor , aroused Mowbray to some sense of his involuntary error .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 14]: `` I beseech your pardon , good Brother Peter , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 13]: `` Not for a moment would I dare to disparage St. James .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 5]: Forget my heedless words .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 48]: My faith , was it not one named after him who packed me neck and crop into such wanderings as have not been endured by many of my generation , unless it be those few countrymen of mine who crossed the Spanish Main with Hawkins and Grenville ?
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 26]: Assuredly , it would ill become me to question the potency of a James , whether Saint or King , where travelers were concerned . ''
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 12]: Perhaps he had phrased his apology better were he less preoccupied .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 23]: The Franciscan , watching him , sighed and murmured : -- `` Gratiam tuam quaesmus , Domine , mentibus nostris infunde ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 25]: The hours passed and naught happened , until Mowbray , harassed by evil forebodings , resolved that further inaction was not to be endured .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 28]: He marshaled his Rajputs , of whom there were fourteen , and asked for three volunteers who would ride to Fateh Mohammed 's camp and bring news .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 42]: He would see to it that they were allowed to depart from Dilkusha , and thenceforth they were not to draw rein until they reached the camp , which they were to enter by such means as seemed best to them .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 29]: If Sainton-sahib were there they must return with utmost speed , one or all , as soon as they had gleaned some explanation of the sahib 's detention .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 32]: Each man was willing , so he selected three , and one other , whom he commissioned to search the bazaar and inquire in likely quarters for tidings of Jai Singh .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 48]: There was some difficulty at the gate , but Mowbray 's determined air , no less than the truculent attitude of his men , whose belief in him was unbounded , soon quelled the scruples of the doorkeeper , and the four clattered out into the night .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 29]: It was now ten o'clock , and , in Walter 's opinion , nothing short of force had kept Roger from joining him within the preceding five hours .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 43]: He deemed it wise to guard the gate on his own account , so he selected the oldest Rajput , one Devi Pershad , to act as lieutenant , while he split up the remainder of his small force into three watches .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 57]: He gave strict orders that thenceforth , until daybreak , none should enter or leave the compound without his knowledge and sanction , and he fancied that the Musalman durwán , thus deposed from his duties , smiled maliciously when he heard the lordly stranger imposing his will on those who maintained the dwelling for Jahangir .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 9]: Instantly the man was put to the test .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 36]: Ere he could banish the smile from his face , Mowbray grasped him by the neck , and Devi Pershad held a lantern close to his eyes while his master bared Sher Afghán 's dagger .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 7]: `` How now , dog ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 3]: Walter cried .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 10]: `` Wouldst thou dare to question my commands ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 6]: The doorkeeper 's knees yielded .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 8]: Here was one who read his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 29]: `` Not so , protector of the poor , '' he gasped , `` but many have come within the hour , and there may be others . ''
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 6]: `` Many , sayest thou ?
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 22]: There are not twenty servants in the house all told , '' and he shook the fellow till his teeth rattled .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 17]: `` I am a poor man , sahib -- and I do as I am bid .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 16]: Those who come with a sign -- I admit , '' was the stuttering answer .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 7]: `` What manner of sign ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 40]: `` Some tap once and cry _ sufed-kira _ -LRB- death watch -RRB- ; others tap thrice and say _ Jai _ -LRB- victory -RRB- , and it was my _ hukm _ to admit both without question . ''
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 13]: If the trembling wretch 's confession needed evidence it was fittingly supplied .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 17]: From without came three slight knocks and a voice : -- `` Within there , brother .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 8]: The word is _ Jai _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 13]: Mowbray released the durwán , sheathed his dagger and drew his sword .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 6]: He motioned to the door .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 13]: -LSB- Illustration : Instantly the man was put to the test . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 19]: `` Open , and act as thou wouldst have done were I not here , '' he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 28]: He and Devi Pershad , with the Rajputs of the first guard , hastened into the dark interior of the lodge while the man unbound the gate .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 41]: There entered a very harmless couple , a _ bhisti _ , carrying his empty water-bag of goatskin , and a veiled woman whose simple garb showed that she was of the same caste , in all probability his wife .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 23]: But why had such a pair used a password , and why were two different passwords in vogue at all that night ?
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 14]: Here was a minor riddle of which a sword-point might find the key .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 8]: Walter sprang forth and seized the water-carrier .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 18]: The woman uttered a slight cry of alarm , but seemed to regain instant control of herself .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 33]: The poor _ bhisti _ was so taken aback by the sight of the gleaming blade with which the Englishman enforced his stern demand for information that he uttered not a word .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 13]: His jaw fell and he gazed up at Walter in dumb fear .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 19]: Somehow , when the rays of the lantern revealed his features , Mowbray thought he knew the man .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 5]: Suddenly , recollection came .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 23]: This was the palace servant who warned him and Roger against Jahangir 's malice on the day of the wild beast combats .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 46]: But , whatever form Mowbray 's questions might have taken , all such speculations were driven from his brain , and he released the _ bhisti _ in blank amazement , when a well-remembered voice murmured sweetly : -- `` Harm him not , Walter .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 11]: He is a humble well-wisher who escorted me hither . ''
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 7]: It was Nur Mahal who spoke .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 28]: Never before had she addressed him by his Christian name , the sound of which she must have learned owing to Roger 's frequent use of it .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 26]: Clearly , she had acquired its facile pronunciation by much private endeavor , for his own mother could not have uttered the word more accurately .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 10]: And what was he to say , or do ?
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 51]: Though it was always a likely thing that Nur Mahal , knowing he was in Agra , would endeavor to reach him , now that she was actually here how should he shape his course to avoid the complications sure to result if her visit came to Jahangir 's ears ?
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 50]: It is not to be wondered at if his brain whirled with jostling thoughts , nor that her presence should obscure for the nonce the vital importance of ascertaining the significance of the passwords , whose mere choice showed that they represented the rival factions of Mahomedans and Hindus .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 39]: `` I see that you are not to be taken by surprise , let those plan who will , '' she whispered , and she laughed musically , with a certain frolicsome lightness long absent from her manner .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 19]: Was the winsome maid of the Garden of Heart 's Delight re-born amidst the sorrows which encompassed her ?
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 26]: Was her rapid descent from high estate the means of her regeneration , seeing that content oft arrives by the door through which ambition departs ?
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 4]: Who could tell ?
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 18]: Certainly not Mowbray , to whose already grievous load of cares her presence added no inconsiderable charge .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 13]: But , if the man were flurried , the woman was not .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 27]: She threw back her veil , being ever disdainful of the ordinance that women of rank and beauty should hide their faces from the common ken .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 16]: `` Thank you , good fellow , '' she said to the _ bhisti _ .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 29]: `` Get you back to the fort speedily , and remember that those who serve me without words shall be paid ten times more than those who talk .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 3]: Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 37]: she continued , turning to the wondering Rajputs who , of course , recognized her as soon as the light illumined her animated features , `` Jai Singh told me you were faithful to your salt .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 18]: It could not be otherwise with men from Rajputána , yet such fidelity is worthy of reward .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 8]: It shall not be long delayed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 40]: The coarse linen _ sari _ of the water-carrier 's wife had fallen from her head and shoulders , and even the flickering glimmer of the oil lamp revealed the fact that Nur Mahal was attired with uncommon splendor .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 33]: She not only looked but spoke like a queen , and her way of addressing the poor retainers at the gate was as gracious and dignified as if they were court nobles .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 9]: `` Have you brought no other retinue ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 16]: asked Walter , at a loss for more pertinent question before so many inquisitive ears .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 16]: She laughed again , and the silvery note of her mirth was pleasant if disconcerting .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 10]: `` All in good time , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 23]: `` Let us go to the house , but first inquire , if you do not know , who have preceded me .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 11]: Then I shall tell you who will come after . ''
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 19]: Amidst the chaos of his ideas Mowbray was conscious that Nur Mahal was rendering him one invaluable service .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 10]: She brought with her certainty where all was void .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 11]: Her words , her air , betokened a fixed purpose .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 36]: For all he knew he might be a pawn or a king in the game she was playing , but , until he was further enlightened , it was advisable to move as she directed .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 12]: Then , being a free agent , he might become erratic .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 27]: The doorkeeper , brought to the domain of dry figures , whittled down his earlier statement as to the number of strange visitors he had admitted .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 38]: There were two Mahomedans , using the significant countersign `` Death Watch , '' while no less than eight Hindus , excluding Nur Mahal -LRB- herself a Mahomedan -RRB- , were of the `` Victory '' party .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 4]: He knew none .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 8]: His orders were from the Grand Vizier .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 6]: `` Whither have they gone ?
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 8]: Are they secreted in the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 3]: demanded Mowbray .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 12]: `` Enough said , '' was Nur Mahal 's laconic interruption .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 5]: `` Come with me .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 5]: I will explain . ''
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 9]: She led him into the avenue of cypresses .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 10]: When he would have spoken she caught his arm .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 5]: `` Not here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 3]: she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 12]: `` I am told you are lodged in the Peacock Room .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 8]: Let us converse there in privacy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 24]: `` You know so much , '' he murmured , `` that perchance you can tell me what has befallen Roger Sainton ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 3]: She stopped .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 8]: `` Why did he leave you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 13]: `` He went to rescue one whom he promised not to abandon .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 18]: My fear of intrigue led him to bring the lady here ere it was too late . ''
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 9]: `` To bring a woman -- here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 4]: `` Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 9]: If one woman , why not another ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 4]: `` Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 3]: she urged .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 16]: `` We are at cross purposes , but I have no information as to Sainton-sahib .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 15]: I had hoped he was with you , for he is worth a thousand .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 4]: Silence now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 16]: His feet crunched the gravel of the path , yet he disdained to walk stealthily .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 9]: Nur Mahal 's tiny slippers made no noise .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 49]: She moved by his side with swift grace , and when he would have made a détour , led him to the main entrance , paying no heed to those of the house servants stationed at the door , though they stared as if she were a ghost .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 43]: It may be that some among them were aware of her identity , but in any case the apparition of such a woman , unveiled , in the company of a foreigner , was sufficiently remarkable in India to create unbounded astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 25]: She swept on through the building , casting aside the cumbersome _ sari _ as if its purpose of concealment were at an end .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 34]: The few lamps which lit the inner rooms were scattered and dim , but Mowbray could see that his first impression as to the magnificence of her garments was not a mistaken one .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 60]: She had yielded so far to convention , being a widow , as to wear a purple dress , but the bodice of white silk was fringed with silver , an exquisite shawl draped her shoulders in diaphanous folds , diamonds gleamed in her hair , and her rapid movements showed that her silk stockings were shot with silver .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 44]: A strange garb , truly , for one who , according to Jai Singh , lived on a pittance of one rupee a day , and even more noteworthy when the manner and hour of her visit to Dilkusha were taken into account .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 47]: When she entered the Peacock Room she found Fra Pietro kneeling , with his face sunk in his hands , near to the _ charpoy _ , or roughly contrived bedstead , which , like all Europeans , he preferred to the cushions of the East .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 60]: Walter had quitted the room by another door , so the worthy Franciscan 's spellbound look , when he raised his eyes to learn who it was who came from the interior of the house and saw the radiant figure of Nur Mahal , would surely , under other circumstances , have brought a laugh to Walter 's lips .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 26]: The friar , wishing to read some portion of the daily `` office , '' had obtained four lamps and trimmed them with some care .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 50]: Comparatively speaking , there was a flood of light at his end of the spacious chamber , and the obscurity reigning in the further part only added to the bewildering effect of the sylph-like being who , after advancing a little way , stood and gazed at him irresolutely .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 20]: But Mowbray 's firm tread broke the spell against which Fra Pietro was already fortifying himself by fervent ejaculations .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 27]: A prophet surprised by the fulfilment of his own prophecy , he rose to his feet , and bowed with the ready politeness of his race .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 19]: `` Princess , '' he said , speaking Urdu , with slow precision , `` I greet you !
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 8]: None but you can resolve our perplexities .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 9]: You are , indeed , well come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 45]: The aspect of the friar , with the shaven crown , untrimmed beard , coarse brown robe and hood , white cords and rough sandals of St. Francis d'Assisi , was no less astounding to Nur Mahal than was her regal semblance to him .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 22]: In her eyes he was on a parity with the fakirs , thebmullahs , the religious mendicants of her adopted country .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 34]: The few Europeans she had seen were soldiers , merchants , or dignified ecclesiastics of the Jesuit order , but here was one whose poverty-stricken appearance might well have prejudiced her against him .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 26]: Like the Apostle whose name he bore , Fra Pietro had said : `` Lo , we have left all , and followed Thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 10]: Of such renunciatory gospel Nur Mahal had no cognizance .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 29]: Nevertheless , such was the depth of this girl-widow 's sagacity , that she caught instantly from the Franciscan 's benign features some glimpse of his exalted character .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 21]: She half turned to Walter with her enchanting smile : -- `` I had forgotten the presence of your friend .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 26]: This , doubtless , is the priest of whom I have heard , and for whose sake you dared do more than for mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 18]: `` I owed him my life , and more , for he saved me from unimagined horrors .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 14]: Nor is the debt yet paid in full , '' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 9]: `` Can I speak openly before him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 17]: `` You may trust Fra Pietro , Princess , as you would trust none other . ''
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 8]: `` Yet I have trusted many to-night .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 10]: Now list to me carefully , for time presses .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 21]: Jahangir dies ere daybreak , and there is much to be done by a man who shall risk all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 5]: `` The Emperor dies !
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 11]: Do you mean that he is to be murdered ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 12]: `` Call it what you will , his death is ordained .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 7]: Nay , frown not so ominously .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 7]: 'T is not of my planning .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 13]: Those who wish his downfall are not seeking to avenge my wrongs .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 23]: If they succeed , and I see no reason why they should fail , they aim at placing Khusrow on the throne .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 5]: And who is Khusrow ?
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 5]: A boy of ten !
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 13]: I , a woman , am a mere puppet in their hands .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 7]: That is why I am here .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 17]: You see one who is in the counsels of both parties yet bound to neither . ''
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 26]: She threw back her head , and the circlet of brilliants across her smooth white brow did not send forth brighter gleams than her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 28]: Speaking so freely of treason and dynastic plots , she smiled as though the whole affair were some hoax of which she alone knew the petty secret .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 17]: `` You have met Raja Man Singh and his ally , the Maharaja of Bikanir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 21]: she continued , coolly , before Walter could decide what shape the tumultuous questions trembling on his lips should take .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 22]: `` Yes , '' he answered , `` and they are well aware with what loathing I regard their schemes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 16]: `` It is always possible to change one 's mind , '' she said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 27]: `` I can not , in a few minutes , give you the history of months ; the record of the past few hours must suffice .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 22]: Since it was known that you and the Hathi-sahib were returning to Agra there has been naught but plot and counter-plot .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 33]: First , those who conspire against the Emperor look to you to help them , and are even now awaiting you in the _ baraduri _ at the bottom of the garden .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 24]: Secondly , Jahangir , well aware of their intent , has resolved to ensnare them and you in one cast of the net .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 64]: Hence , the followers of Raja Man Singh and those others who will strike for Khusrow are gathering silently , some within a stone 's throw of the outer walls of the palace , ready to follow their leader in the attack on the fort , where the guard of the Delhi Gate will admit them , the remainder among the trees without .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 29]: But the forces of the Emperor , ten times more numerous , will fall on them at midnight , whereas the revolt is timed for the first hour .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 10]: Already the traitors inside the fort have been secured .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 12]: A few live to delude their friends -- most are dead .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 11]: All this , you may say , concerns you not .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 6]: You are wrong , Mowbray-sahib .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 9]: You are a greater man than you think .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 24]: The conspirators count surely on your assistance and that of Sainton-sahib , whose repute with the common people is worth a whole army .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 21]: Therefore , lest aught miscarried , they came to me and urged me to induce you to head the outbreak .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 23]: Though I am a weak woman , I might not have consented had not the Emperor joined his supplications to theirs . ''
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 5]: `` The Emperor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 7]: cried Walter , with involuntary loudness .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 3]: `` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 9]: The _ baraduri _ is not far distant .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 10]: Yes , Jahangir still favors me with his jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 23]: He does not know that -- that -- you are longing for the sight of some other woman beyond the black seas .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 5]: Do not misunderstand me .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 7]: Jahangir hates me and fears you .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 30]: Kept well informed by his spies of all that was going on , he connived at the scheme which brought you and me to the forefront of the rebellion .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 17]: Thus , when he stamps it out in blood , we shall be the chief victims .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 6]: But that is not all .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 22]: Raja Man Singh and his friends are in no mind to kill Jahangir and clear the way for a foreign intruder .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 12]: They , too , see how we may serve their ends .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 27]: Once the Emperor is dead it will be a fitting excuse to get rid of us on the ground that we conspired against him . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 12]: 'T is a pretty plot , '' said Mowbray , grimly .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 8]: `` Hath it any further twists ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 5]: `` Yes , one .
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 12]: Raja Man Singh , Khusrow , and the rest are doomed .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 9]: Few of them shall see the sun again .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 15]: The man who contrived their fate is far more skilled in intrigue than they .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 13]: Behind Jahangir and his feud with me stands the black robe . ''
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 4]: `` Dom Geronimo !
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 6]: I thought him dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 18]: `` He may be , but he lived to-day , '' was Nur Mahal 's careless answer .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 10]: `` Living or dead , his hour has passed .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 9]: Others , too , can think and plan .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 9]: Not plotters now , but swords are needed .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 7]: I would that Sainton-sahib were here .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 8]: Why did you let him go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 11]: `` He is hard to restrain when set on anything .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 24]: But you would not have him and me , with twenty troopers , fight for our own hand ` gainst all India ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 8]: She came nearer to the listening men .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 23]: In her eagerness she grasped each by an arm and whispered : -- `` Jai Singh is within call with two hundred .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 10]: A few determined men to-night are worth thousands to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 19]: Three hoots of an owl from the wall behind the _ baraduri _ will bring him and them .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 25]: You have the leaders of the revolt gathered in the summer-house , whence they will soon send a messenger to summon you to council .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 10]: They know I am here and await my pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 37]: Above them -- '' and now her voice dropped so low that the words only just reached their ears -- `` you have Jahangir himself and his principal minion , Ibrahim , the Chief Eunuch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 10]: Her eyes blazed with the intensity of her emotion .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 30]: Great though her power of self-control , she quivered slightly , and the action , trivial in itself , told that this woman was the nerve-center of an empire .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 5]: She waited no comment .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 10]: The moment long looked for had come at last .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 12]: India , with all its potentialities , was within her grasp .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 8]: `` Doubt not , but act ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 14]: she murmured , passionately , seeing the incredulity in the men 's faces .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 29]: `` In the roof of the _ baraduri _ there is a secret chamber , contrived there , for their own purposes , by Akbar and my father .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 19]: From it , in fancied security , Jahangir and Ibrahim can see and hear all that passes beneath .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 9]: I took care they should know of it .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 14]: 'T was too good a bait to pass , and they swallowed it .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 54]: What joy can equal the Emperor 's when he hears his enemies plotting with you and me to place us on his throne , knowing full well that ere many minutes have passed we shall be slain or , far better , captured , so that he may glut his vengeance on us ?
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 4]: Come with me !
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 10]: Let a Rajput give the signal to Jai Singh .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 31]: Without any fear of failure , almost without a blow , you will have both Jahangir and Khusrow 's adherents in your power to do with as you will . ''
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 8]: They could not choose but believe her .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 22]: Here was a counter-stroke , worthy indeed of the daughter of one who entered India a pauper and died Prime Minister .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 15]: Walter 's head swam , and Fra Pietro shook as if with a palsy .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 14]: `` There is no other course open , '' she murmured , vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 12]: `` It is your death and mine , or Jahangir 's .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 3]: Decide quickly !
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 8]: Do you flinch from the ordeal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 10]: `` No , '' said Mowbray , recovering himself .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 18]: `` If such be the alternatives , may God prosper those who are in the right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 5]: Nur Mahal released them .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 32]: Walter would have sent for Devi Pershad , and in a few fateful seconds the irrevocable step must be taken which should plunge India into an era of turmoil and bloodshed .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 30]: But a tumult of alarm among the household servants , and the clatter of hurried footsteps in the interior of the house , betokened some new and unforeseen commotion .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 35]: Then the door by which Nur Mahal and Mowbray had entered the room was flung open and Roger appeared , carrying in his left arm the apparently lifeless body of the Countess di Cabota .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 41]: His long sword was dripping blood , and his clothes were rent by cuts and lance thrusts , but his genial face , never downcast when a fight was toward , broke into a broad grin when he saw Walter .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 8]: `` By the cross of Osmotherly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 18]: he roared , `` I have had the devil 's own job to reach thee , lad .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 18]: I have fought every inch of a good mile , and been ambushed times out of count .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 8]: Poor Matilda fainted at the last onset .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 14]: I had to hug her with one arm and slay with the other .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 2]: Gad !
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 5]: it was warm work .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 7]: She is no light weight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 29]: He deposited his inanimate burthen on a _ charpoy _ and cleared his vision of blood and perspiration , for he had been wounded slightly on the forehead .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 8]: Then he set eyes on Nur Mahal .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 13]: `` Oh , ho , my lady , art thou here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 10]: `` Small wonder there were such goings on without !
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 18]: By gad , thou art the herald of storm on land as the petrel is at sea .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 13]: Walter , my lad , give us a grip of thy hand !
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 9]: I 'm main glad to meet thee again .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 5]: But Matilda needs tending .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 8]: Bid this glittering fairy see to her .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 16]: Whether Portugee or Hindee , I suppose women are much alike in such matters ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 11]: CHAPTER XVIII `` Gregory , remember thy swashing blow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 11]: _ Romeo and Juliet _ , Act I , Sc .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 2]: 1 .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 15]: But there were matters of graver import afoot than the Countess 's fainting fit .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 47]: Already the conspirators in the summer-house , alarmed by the commotion , must be devising means to protect themselves , and the Emperor , ensconced in a hiding-place after the fashion invented by Dionysius of Syracuse , was probably doubting the wisdom of his Haroun-al-Raschid escapade .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 34]: For Roger , bursting through the hostile cordons like an infuriated blue-bottle fly caught in the outer strands of a spider 's web , had applied a premature spark to a gunpowder train .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 11]: The silence of the night was jarred into fierce uproar .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 23]: The imperial troops , thinking the revolt had broken out before its appointed hour , were hurriedly closing in around the rebels .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 48]: The latter , strenuously opposing Sainton 's passage up the hill leading to the Garden of Heart 's Delight , communicated a panic for action , which is the next worst thing to a flight , to those of their comrades who knew not what was happening .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 33]: In a word , the left bank of the Jumna was ablaze , and sharp encounters occurred wherever the Emperor 's men met those who fought for his would-be supplanter , Khusrow .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 45]: At the gate Devi Pershad and the Rajputs , manfully aided by the house servants , were even then resisting the efforts of the rebels previously hidden in the wood to break open the door and go to the aid of their leaders within .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 34]: Indeed , Roger had barely ceased speaking , before a sowar , one of his own small escort , ran in and breathlessly announced the desperate nature of the attack on the gateway .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 16]: Sainton , of course , knew nothing of the real cause of all this riot .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 8]: Nor was there time to tell him .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 6]: Mowbray grasped the excited soldier .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 8]: `` Canst hoot like an owl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 24]: `` Aye , sahib , that can I , '' was the reply , for the man guessed the portent of the question .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 7]: `` Come , then , Roger !
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 5]: Thou knowest the summer-house ?
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 7]: Smite any man who leaves it !
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 10]: Nur Mahal , bide you here till I return !
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 15]: Fra Pietro , bolt the doors and open only to me or Roger ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 17]: `` One word , brother , ere thou goest , '' cried the friar in English .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 17]: `` A chosen ruler , be he Christian or heathen , is the Lord 's anointed .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 15]: ` Curse not the King , no , not in thy thought . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 13]: Walter , hurrying forth , darted a single glance at the speaker .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 28]: Somehow , the Franciscan 's words gave ordered sequence to a project which flitted vaguely through his mind as he listened to Nur Mahal 's thrilling recital .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 36]: It seemed to him that this beautiful woman , `` who offered herself twice to no man , '' harbored a certain spite against Jahangir because of the treatment he had meted out to her .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 52]: Once she had vaguely hinted at bygones as between Mowbray and herself ; otherwise her utterances were those of unsated and insatiable ambition , and the style of her raiment alone showed that she had quitted the palace that night prepared to fill the stage in whatsoever part fortune allotted her .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 49]: Now the two Englishmen were in the garden , running towards the summer-house , which , it will be remembered , stood on an island in the midst of a small lake , and was approached by four narrow causeways , each at right angles with its neighbors .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 7]: There never was a darker night .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 32]: It was barely possible to distinguish the tops of the trees against the sky ; beneath , they passed through a blackness so dense that they could not see each other .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 8]: Under such conditions rapid progress was impossible .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 16]: Mowbray called a halt , and bade the Rajput use his skill in imitating owls .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 54]: Thrice the long-drawn ululu vibrated in the scent-laden atmosphere ; at the third screech came an answering hoot , lanterns twinkled of a sudden at the farther end of the lawn , and Jai Singh , with his rabble of swashbucklers , perched expectantly on the wall , tumbled pell-mell into the garden .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 7]: `` We come , sahib ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 6]: they heard his exultant cry .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 12]: `` Every man carries a light and wears a black turban .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 5]: Spare none other ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 4]: `` Ecod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 9]: said Roger , `` that is good talking .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 17]: Jai Singh is thin in the ribs , but he hath the liver of a bull .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 8]: Yet there seemeth no urgence for killing .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 6]: What is toward , Walter ?
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 7]: ` Smite , ' say you .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 9]: ` Spare not , ' yelps Jai Singh .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 8]: Nur Mahal shoots lightning from her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 15]: Even the good friar points a moral with a text on cursing the king .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 5]: Who hath cursed him ?
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 7]: Whose throat is to be cut ?
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 12]: My soul , there 's battle in the very air ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 7]: Sainton was appealing to unheeding ears .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 26]: The _ baraduri _ , being a roofed entablature supported on slight columns , became vaguely silhouetted against the dim glow of the advancing lantern-bearers .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 16]: Walter saw several armed men rushing towards the house along the nearest _ chaussée _ .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 34]: It went against the grain to strike any man who came to him trustingly , no matter what the ultimate intent , and among the foremost he thought he recognized Raja Man Singh .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 6]: `` Back , there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 6]: `` We are for Jahangir !
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 11]: Back to your covert and lay down your arms ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 8]: There could be no mistaking his meaning .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 31]: The conspirators , dumbfounded by the discovery that he whom they reckoned an ally was a declared foe , stopped , hesitated , and then broke , left and right .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 7]: `` They must not escape ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 6]: said Mowbray to his companion .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 8]: `` After them , Jai Singh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 17]: he vociferated to the Rajput , and forthwith there was a scurry in which several fell .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 17]: Nevertheless , two , at least , got away through the trees and scaled the wall .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 22]: Raja Man Singh remained , gasping his life out , but he of Bikanir and one other reached the reinforcements outside .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 24]: Hastily despatching Jai Singh and his followers to defend the main gate , Mowbray retained only two men of his own little troop .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 26]: Equipping them with lanterns , he led Roger to the summer-house and cried in a loud voice : -- `` Come forth , Jahangir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 5]: There was no answer .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 59]: The hollow roof , exquisitely painted with frescoes representing forest life , echoed the command , and the slight scrutiny rendered possible by the weak light of the lamps gave force to Roger 's query : -- `` Dost think to find him , like Mahmoud 's coffin , slung ` twixt heaven and earth , Walter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 14]: But Nur Mahal was to be trusted beyond the credence of eyes alone .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 35]: Unless the Emperor had flown , or changed his mind at the latest moment , he was surely there , for the doorkeeper said two strangers had passed by the watchword `` Safed-Kira . ''
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 11]: And the vital need of hurry made stern measures necessary .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 4]: `` Jahangir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 19]: cried Mowbray again , `` I know that thou art here , thou and thy pimp , Ibrahim .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 17]: Nur Mahal hath sent us to save thy life , and thy throne if need be .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 16]: Descend , therefore , else Sainton-sahib shall pull thee down together with thy lurking-place . ''
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 84]: A moment 's pause brought only the racket of desultory firing in the roadway , the thuds of a battering ram against the iron-studded door , and the yells of assailants and defenders as the high boundary wall was sought to be carried by escalade , for the Maharaja of Bikanir , now that his desperate scheme was unmasked , urged his adherents ere they marched to sack the palace to extirpate the brood of vipers in the Garden of Heart 's Delight .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 26]: `` Roger , '' said Walter , calmly , resolved to be sure of his quarry , `` try thy strength on a pillar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 15]: The summer-house , an elegant hexagon , had a carved pillar at each angle .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 17]: Sainton placed his foot against one , gave a mighty push , and the stones yielded .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 19]: Some fell with a clatter onto the mosaic pavement , others splashed in the water of the lake .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 4]: `` Hold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 10]: came a muffled cry , `` I come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 14]: A fine creeper had entwined its stout tendrils round three of the pillars .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 26]: In one of these , cunningly hidden by the vine , were small holdfasts , by which an active man might climb to the roof .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 36]: Once there , a section of the blue enameled tiles slid back and gave access to a small apartment with a grille floor , the interstices being invisible from beneath owing to the painted foliage .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 11]: Jahangir , followed by Ibrahim , made an undignified descent .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 13]: Obviously , he feared a sword thrust as he neared the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 6]: Yet he was no coward .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 23]: Disdaining to jump he came down slowly , and faced Mowbray without laying hand on the pistol or jeweled tulwar he carried .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 25]: If treachery were intended he could not guard against it , and he was too proud to exhibit his secret thought by useless action .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 7]: `` Have I heard aright ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 7]: he asked , with well-feigned coolness .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 12]: `` Did you say that Nur Mahal had sent you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 14]: How else should I , a stranger , know of your retreat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 14]: `` And neither you nor she are in league with my enemies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 9]: `` Some of them lie in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 6]: You hear the others without .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 14]: Are you man or king enough to help us in repelling them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 5]: Jahangir bowed his head .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 14]: `` God is great , '' he said , as though in self-communion .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 12]: `` Never was mortal more deceived than I have been . ''
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 29]: Ibrahim , Chief Eunuch , somewhat restored from the rare fright of the trembling roof , thought it high time to trim his sails to the new wind .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 39]: `` I always told your Majesty , '' he began ; but Jahangir , for answer , smote him in the face with his clenched fist so heavily that he fell into the lake and lay there insensible .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 41]: He would have been drowned had not a Rajput pulled him out and held him by the heels until a good deal of water came from his mouth and a good many gold pieces from a tuck in his cummerbund .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 38]: Mowbray , whose judgment was cooler and truer in the frenzy of a fight than when a woman 's eyes assailed him , did not forget that where Jai Singh had introduced his hirelings others might follow .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 24]: Nevertheless , with the inadequate force available , it was impossible to conduct an effective defense of a square enclosure containing many acres .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 12]: It was above all else essential to resist the main assault .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 21]: The Eastern fighting man is moved to the madness of heroism by success , and driven to despair by failure .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 7]: The gateway must not be carried .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 37]: He detailed sentries , therefore , to report any hostile move from the flanks or rear , in which case he would fall back on the house , which occupied the exact center of the garden .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 10]: Then he and the others hastened to the gate .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 8]: They were not a moment too soon .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 29]: A huge balk of timber , carried up from the bridge and swung by fifty men against the sturdy door , smashed the panels and dislodged the hinges .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 31]: Through the gap poured a torrent of assailants , all well armed , and the struggle must have resulted in instant victory for the rebels had not Roger faced them .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 6]: There was light in plenty .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 26]: Many carried torches , whilst masses of tow soaked in oil had been placed on the ground to enable the archers and matchlockmen to shoot .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 29]: Luckily the onward rush prevented anything like a volley being fired in that narrow space , or the Emperor and his English supporters must certainly have been hit .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 22]: As it was , the giant had a fair field , steel against steel , and one man against a hundred .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 18]: When Roger was busy there was no standing-room for friends by his side or foes in front .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 12]: His tremendous strength was no less astounding than his tigerish agility .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 80]: His long sword whirled in lightning circles , he sprang back , forth , and sideways with incredible ease , and such was the area he covered , combined with a quick eye to discern and a supple wrist to disconcert every adventurous cut or thrust aimed at him , that , whilst those outside were yelling to the van to press forward , the unlucky wights of the front rank were making a new rampart of their bodies .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 22]: Walter found a corner where Sainton 's sickle did not reach , and Jahangir , fired to emulation , joined him .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 50]: The three practically held the gate , because Jai Singh , with his horde of freebooters , did not quickly regain his self-possession after the stupefying discovery that the Emperor , whom he was actively fighting against , was laying on with a will in behalf of the Englishman .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 22]: Others , too , learned the bewildering fact that here was Jahangir himself in the very hatching ground of the conspiracy .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 34]: The Maharaja of Bikanir saw him , and having missed him twice with a pistol , adopted a new tactic which might easily have involved the monarch and the Englishmen in common ruin .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 45]: Awaiting the rebel leader , to carry him to the fort , was a war elephant , a huge brute , well protected by iron plates , thick knobs of brass , and chain armor , penetrable by no missile short of a cannon-ball .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 47]: The animal was trained to charge any one or anything at the bidding of its _ mahout _ , and the Maharaja , mounting the _ howdah _ with some of his officers , bade the driver launch the elephant at full speed through the gate .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 17]: Among the many physical advantages Roger held over other men not the least was his height .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 37]: While dealing with the present danger he could see that which threatened farther afield , and now , above the heads of the combatants , he caught sight of the great moving mass of shining panoply .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 11]: Such a thunderbolt would rend its way through all opposition .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 47]: Swords and lances were powerless against it , but there lay on the ground , wrenched from its sockets by the battering-ram , the heavy iron bar which the big Yorkshireman had used so effectively on the night that Sher Afghán carried off his unwilling bride .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 10]: None of the others knew of the approaching peril .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 6]: Roger turned to Jai Singh .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 8]: `` Come on , Don Whiskerando ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 12]: `` I thought thou hadst better stomach for a fray ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 10]: Though he spoke English , his look was enough .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 12]: The old Rajput awoke from his trance and rushed forward manfully .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 17]: His levies followed , the rebels yielded a few feet , and Roger secured breathing space .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 42]: He sheathed his reeking sword , picked up the iron bar , and stood on the left of the gateway , balancing the implement over his right shoulder and bracing his feet , set wide apart , firmly against the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 18]: A fiercer yell , a stampede of both parties , announced the oncoming of the new danger .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 35]: Mowbray and Jahangir thought that this was the end until they saw Roger , not smiling now but frowning , whirl the bar lightly as a preliminary to the greatest feat he ever performed .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 20]: For the story lives yet amidst the glorious ruins of the Mogul Empire how the Man-Elephant killed the elephant .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 28]: Trumpeting loudly , rushing through the swaying mass of human beings as a whale cleaves water , the immense brute seemed to enjoy the sensation it created .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 17]: As it entered the gate , with trunk uplifted , the bar crashed across its knees .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 6]: The elephant stumbled and fell .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 22]: Again the iron flail whistled in the air , this time striking the brass-studded boss on the beast 's wide forehead .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 48]: The thick metal disks shivered into fragments , and the monster , with fractured skull , lurched over heavily on its side , throwing the Maharaja of Bikanir and his lieutenants to the ground , where they died quickly at the hands of those nearest to them .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 13]: A great shout went up , a shout of terror and wonder .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 21]: Men ran , throwing away their arms and shrieking incoherent appeals , whether to Allah or Khuda , for protection .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 26]: It was recorded that some went mad , some died from fright , and many dropped from exhaustion miles away from Dilkusha and its magic .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 21]: For never before had one man met a full-grown fighting elephant face to face in single combat and killed it .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 50]: Such deeds were told of lions and tigers , of many-antlered deer and massive bulls , but never of the elephant , which , in the plenitude of its majestic strength , can drag four score men in triumph , let them tug their best at a rope . ''
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 5]: _ Shabash , hathi !
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 5]: _ '' cried Jahangir .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 30]: `` By the soul of my father , Akbar , if I am spared to-night those two strokes shall be writ in history and recorded in stone ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 21]: ` Twill please me better if they remain in your Majesty 's memory , '' was Sainton 's gruff answer .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 11]: Truth to tell , his mighty effort had shaken him .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 11]: In that last almost superhuman blow he had surpassed himself .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 32]: His muscles still twitched from the tension , and he experienced a curious sympathy for the magnificent creature whose dying convulsions alone betokened the abundant life with which it was endowed .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 8]: He leaned wearily on the long bar .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 49]: The slaying of the elephant was the culmination of a day 's toil such as no other man in India could have endured , for many a stout warrior had fallen under his sword ere he carried the Countess di Cabota into the Garden of Heart 's Delight .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 17]: But the Emperor , not to be rebuffed thus curtly , seized him by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 19]: `` Harken , friend , '' said he , `` one lie will poison a river of truth .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 15]: They told me 't was thy intent to tumble my palace about my ears .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 21]: Tomb of the Prophet , what will not a man believe when he lends his wits to women and wine ?
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 39]: Never was king more beholden to stranger than I to thee and thy friend ; canst thou not credit my faith when I say that no recompense you ask shall be too great for me to give ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 10]: Sainton turned and clapped the Emperor on the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 22]: `` I have oft wondered , '' he cried , `` how so good a soldier could be a bad king .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 22]: Now I see 't was a passing fit , which , mayhap , like certain distempers , leaves thee wholesomer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 20]: And that was how Jahangir and Roger began a comradeship which was never marred nor forgotten while either lived .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 28]: Mowbray , though delighted that Sainton 's rough diplomacy had won the Emperor so thoroughly , nevertheless kept a sharp lookout for any recrudescence of the fight .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 9]: But the back of the revolt was broken .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 40]: He who escaped with the Maharaja of Bikanir , riding post-haste for fresh troops , was captured by the imperial forces , and a strong contingent of mounted men arriving at Dilkusha relieved the little garrison of further concern .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 17]: Jahangir despatched several officers with instructions , the exact significance of which Walter failed to grasp .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 15]: He knew it was hopeless to expect clemency for those who fomented the disorders .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 26]: In the East , and indeed elsewhere , rulers had a habit , not wholly lost to-day , of repressing such outbreaks with merciless severity .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 7]: The Emperor quickly completed his arrangements .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 6]: Then he drew Walter aside .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 7]: `` You spoke of Nur Mahal .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 7]: She is here , I know .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 6]: What was her errand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 21]: `` To warn me of the plot of which I was the unconscious figurehead , '' was the ready answer .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 19]: `` Her action is the chief surprise of a night of marvels , '' said Jahangir , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 17]: `` No matter how greatly I was misled by others , I vow she was candid .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 12]: Never did woman belittle a man as Nur Mahal belittled me .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 15]: She said much that was true , and a good deal that was false .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 6]: But her spleen was manifest .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 13]: Had my head rolled at her feet she would have kicked it .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 14]: Why , then , should she risk her life to save me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 12]: `` You must ask her that yourself , your Majesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 6]: There was no other way .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 27]: It was out of the question that Walter should dispel Jahangir 's doubts by hinting a very different motive for Nur Mahal 's visit to Dilkusha .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 24]: Come what might he had dissipated in her mind the mirage of a dynastic struggle in which he would participate as her husband .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 43]: The mere fact that he had so completely thrown in his lot with the Emperor would prove to her , if proof were needed , that the dream of those memorable days which followed their flight from Agra might never be renewed .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 5]: What would she do ?
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 9]: What manner of greeting would she give Jahangir ?
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 4]: Who could tell ?
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 14]: Once before , when expected to marry the Emperor , she reviled him .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 13]: Not half an hour ago she said Jahangir must die before dawn .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 25]: He was not dead , but very much alive , and more firmly seated on his throne than at any time since his accession .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 5]: What would she say ?
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 16]: Mowbray was on thorns as he walked with the Emperor and Roger to the house .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 10]: Fra Pietro unbolted the door at which they knocked .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 24]: Roger , seeing the Countess moving forward , and evidently quite recovered from her faintness , was seized with a spasm of shyness .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 14]: `` All is well , Matilda , '' he said , hanging back .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 15]: `` You had a boisterous journey , but you are in quiet waters now .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 11]: I go to remove some marks of the jaunt . ''
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 20]: He made to sheer off , but she ran after him , brushing the Emperor aside in her eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 8]: `` Nay , my good Roger ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 8]: `` Fra Pietro hath told me all .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 20]: I closed my eyes , and my heart stopped beating when I witnessed that last array of dreadful men .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 25]: And thou didst carry me in thy arms as if I were a child , bearing me hither in safety through a hostile army .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 13]: Oh , Roger , how can I wait to thank thee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 13]: `` Calm thyself , sweet Matilda , '' they heard him growl .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 21]: `` I 'll have no kissing of hands , and I can not kiss thy lips in my present condition .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 2]: Gad !
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 12]: I have more brains on my clothes than in my head .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 12]: Well , if naught else will content thee , there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 49]: In the center of the room stood Nur Mahal , her normally lily-white face with its peachlike bloom wholly devoid of color , and her wondrous eyes gazing fixedly at the tall figure of the Emperor , who hesitated an instant when Mowbray motioned him to enter first .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 9]: Walter 's pulse galloped somewhat during that pause .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 30]: He did not know then that while men were dying in hundreds around the gate and elsewhere , the Franciscan had won a wordy victory behind the locked doors .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 27]: No sooner were the Countess 's senses restored than Fra Pietro engaged the Persian Princess in a discourse which quickly revealed that here were well-matched dialecticians .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 32]: Pride , keen intellect , consciousness of physical charm and mental power , were confronted by gentle insistence on the eternal verities which govern mankind , irrespective of race or climate .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 24]: Neither palliating nor excusing Jahangir 's excesses , the friar did not hesitate to hold a mirror to the girl 's own faults .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 15]: If she had loved the prince why did she profess to hate the king ?
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 45]: If the death of her husband so rankled in her memory that the Emperor , who was indirectly responsible for it , was not to be forgiven , why had she gone back to Agra , instead of pursuing her peaceful voyage to Burdwán ?
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 72]: Ah , yes , he appreciated her belief that other eventualities might happen , but life was constituted of shattered hopes , and the one eternal , wholly satisfying ideal was to so order one 's actions that when called to final account one could truly say : `` This I did and thus I spoke because it seemed to me best for the happiness and well-being of my fellow-creatures . ''
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 80]: To and fro flew the shuttlecock of their argument , until Nur Mahal , astonished and not a little humiliated by the singular knowledge of her inmost feelings displayed by this mild-eyed man of low estate , paced the long room like a caged gazelle , and the Countess di Cabota , half distracted by the distant sounds of murderous conflict , nevertheless found time to wonder what Fra Pietro was saying which made the beautiful Persian so angry .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 23]: The sound of Mowbray 's voice , the sight of Jahangir in his company unattended , drove the passion from her face .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 47]: Her red lips were slightly opened in mute inquiry , her fingers were entwined irresolutely , her whole attitude , so heedless was she of the restraint that cloaks the secret thought , indicated a passive desire to let chance carry her which way it willed .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 34]: But the glory of her loveliness was never more manifest than in this feminine mood , and Jahangir , a man of impulse , was drawn to her as steel to a magnet .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 27]: `` You and I , '' said he , slowly , `` have much to forget , but you alone have a great deal to forgive .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 25]: Nevertheless , on a night when I have won my kingdom I may well be pardoned if I hope to win my queen . ''
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 22]: With that , he unfastened the samite over-cloak he wore , and took from his neck a string of priceless pearls .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 27]: Nur Mahal bent her proud head , and the Emperor , with a laugh of almost boyish glee , adjusted the shimmering ornament around her throat .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 20]: She said something in a low tone , and it was a long time before she looked up again .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 14]: When her eyes first encountered Mowbray 's they were bright with repressed tears .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 39]: Notwithstanding these tender passages , and some amusingly one-sided episodes in the garden between Roger and the Countess , for the lady made him kneel down whilst she washed his face , there was little time for love-making .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 43]: Jahangir , having joyously informed the nearest members of his entourage that Nur Mahal was to be treated as the Empress which she would be created next day in durbar , began to question Mowbray as to the events of the night .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 26]: Walter 's task was rendered more simple by the projected marriage of one whom he suspected to be the real instigator of the whole affair .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 32]: He must perforce twist the narrative to show the prospective Sultana in the best light , and herein , as it happened , a casual reference to Dom Geronimo was helpful .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 13]: `` I mistrusted that man from the first , '' said Jahangir .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 13]: `` Why should he , a European , conspire against his fellows ?
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 17]: No beast of prey , unless it be indeed hard pressed , eats its own kind .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 11]: Howbeit , he will trouble the world no longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 6]: `` What means your Majesty ?
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 14]: I was told he was active in his machinations this very day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 9]: `` Yes , '' was the cool reply .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 11]: `` I made use of him until my patience vanished .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 30]: When you and Sainton-sahib proved him a liar , I sent orders that a cow was to be slain instantly and the black robe sewn in the skin . ''
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 7]: `` Sewn in the skin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 5]: repeated Walter , incredulously .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 9]: He will be dead by the fourth watch .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 41]: Hussain Beg , a traitorous villain from Lahore , whom I caused to be sealed in an ass 's skin , took a day and a night to die , but the hide of a cow dries more speedily . ''
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 24]: Horrified by the fate which had overtaken the arch enemy of his race , Mowbray told Fra Pietro what the Emperor had said .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 13]: The Franciscan at once appealed for mercy in the Jesuit 's behalf .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 15]: `` Forgive him , '' he pleaded , `` as Christ forgave his enemies .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 5]: You can save him .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 6]: Your request will be granted .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 22]: God , who knoweth all hearts , can look into his and turn its stone into the water of repentance . ''
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 43]: It was not yet one o'clock when Walter and Roger , the latter glad of the errand which freed him from Matilda 's embarrassing attentions , rode with a numerous guard to the fort , bearing Jahangir 's reprieve for Dom Geronimo .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 12]: There had been no delay in the execution of the sentence .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 31]: They found the unhappy priest already imprisoned in his terrible environment , and almost insane with the knowledge that the stiffening hide was slowly but surely squeezing him to death .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 40]: With Sher Afghán 's dagger Mowbray cut the stitches of sheep-sinews , and , after drinking some wine and water , the Jesuit fanatic became aware of the identity of the man to whom he owed his life . ''
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 20]: 'T is surely time , '' said Walter , sternly , `` that you and I discharged our reckoning .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 24]: I could have pardoned my father 's death , foul murder though it was , on the score of your youth and zeal .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 31]: But it is unbearable that you , who preach the gospel of Christianity , should pursue with rancor the son of the man you killed with a coward 's blow .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 26]: Now , after the lapse of twenty-four years , I have requited both his untimely loss and your continued malice by saving your wretched life .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 6]: What sayest thou , Geronimo ?
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 6]: Does the feud end ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 8]: `` On my soul , Walter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 16]: cried Sainton , `` I think he is minded to spring at thee now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 24]: But the glazed eyes of the unfortunate bigot were lifted to his rescuer with the non-comprehending glare of stupor rather than unconquerable hatred .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 43]: He murmured some reference to the miraculous statue of San José , to which , lying at the bottom of the bay of Biscay amidst the rotting timbers of a ship bearing the saint 's name , he evidently attributed his escape .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 23]: So they left him , with instructions as to his tendance , and rode back to the Garden of Heart 's Delight .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 5]: All fighting had ceased .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 37]: Some few Samaritans were tending the wounded ; ghouls were robbing the dead ; a mild rain , come after weeks of drought , was refreshing the thirsty earth and washing away the signs of conflict .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 11]: `` What kept thee so long on the road ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 33]: asked Walter , when Roger confessed that the shower was the next most grateful thing to a flagon of wine he did not fail to call for and empty at the palace .

Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 20]: `` Having received Jahangir 's orders , he held by them as if they were verses of the Koran .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 27]: The fat knave was backed by too many arquebusiers to assault him by daylight , so I played fox , and rode off in seeming temper .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 13]: I and the six troopers hid in a nullah until night fell .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 38]: Then we spurred straight to Matilda 's tent , but Fateh Mohammed , to his own undoing , was grossly annoying her , in that very hour , by professing his great admiration for her manifold attractions .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 33]: He was not worth a sword thrust , so what more was there to do than to treat him as my mother treats a fowl which she wants for the spit ? ''

Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 2]: 1 .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 12]: When they reached Dilkusha they yet had much to talk about .

Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 29]: Worn out by fatigue , the Countess di Cabota was sound asleep , but Fra Pietro awaited them , being anxious to learn the fate of his co-religionist .

Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 56]: Then the lively record of the fight at the gate must be imparted , and nothing would suit the friar , late though the hour was , but he must go and see the fallen elephant , which , guarded by a crowd of awe-stricken natives , still cumbered the entrance to the cypress avenue .

Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 11]: `` It might be half-past eight of the clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 74]: You forced your way in and out ; you rode through hundreds of King 's men and rebels , who each in turn sought to bar your path ; you fought here so well that not even this monster could prevail against you ; nevertheless , our worthy Master Mowbray would scoff at the special protection of St. James which I invoked for you in the very hour of your first onset . ''
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 3]: `` Gad !
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 9]: Such a serious speech hath a deep meaning .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 13]: Walter , what 's to do between you and our good friar ?
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 8]: Hast thou been reviling an apostle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 11]: `` Never , on my life , '' laughed Mowbray .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 31]: `` When my ears have lost the sounds of strife , Fra Pietro , you shall lecture me most thoroughly on my seeming lack of faith in that matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 8]: `` By the cross of Osmotherly ! ''

Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 3]: My soul !

Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 26]: Jahangir , wholly taken up in affairs of state and his wedding festivities , did not see his English friends until nearly ten days later .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 63]: Then he astounded Walter with the information that King James of England had sent an Embassy to India , that he , Jahangir , meant to march to Ajmere to meet the Ambassador , and that he would esteem it a favor if Mowbray and Sainton would come with him , the journey being a fair measure of the road to Surat .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 21]: But this first surprise was sent spinning by the discovery that the leader of the Embassy was Sir Thomas Roe .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 14]: `` Does your Majesty know if the Ambassador hath brought his sister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 23]: asked Sainton , for Mowbray scarce knew how to account for the rush of color which bronzed more deeply his well-tanned face .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 12]: `` There is no mention of the lady in my despatches .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 5]: What of her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 4]: inquired the Emperor .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 44]: `` That is a tale for Mowbray-sahib to tell , '' said Roger with a wink , and , indeed , the levity of his manner towards the monarch then , and on many other occasions , greatly scandalized the punctilious court flunkeys .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 19]: Jahangir seemed to be greatly pleased by the fact that Walter regarded Nellie Roe as his future wife .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 23]: Being a devoted husband himself , he naturally told Nur Mahal , and was astonished that she received the news with indifference .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 57]: Of course , Mistress Roe did not accompany her brother , but she sent a very nicely worded acknowledgment of Walter 's letters , together with a small package , which , when opened , disclosed a very beautiful miniature of herself by that same notable artist , Isaac Olliver , who had painted Anna Cave .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 77]: One day , when Jahangir and the Embassy were met in durbar at Ajmere , the conversation turned on this very art of painting on ivory , in which the Delhi artists were highly skilled , and Sir Thomas Roe 's `` Journal '' contains an effective sketch of the assembly to which the pictures of the two fair Englishwomen -LRB- Anna being then secretly married to Roe -RRB- were brought for comparison with native products .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 93]: `` When I came in I found him sitting cross legged on a little throne , all cladd in diamondes , Pearles , and rubyes ; before him a table of gould , on yt about 50 Peeces of gould plate sett all with stones , some very great and extreamly rich , some of lesse valew , but all of them almost couered with small stones ; his Nobilitye about him in their best equipage , whom hee Commanded to drinck froliquely , seuerall wynes standing by in great flagons . ''
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 42]: There was some good-humored dispute as to the ability of the Delhi craftsmen to copy Master Olliver 's work , and a bet was made , which both Roe and Mowbray discreetly lost when the originals were returned with the reproductions .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 46]: Yet , the native artists had achieved a better result than the Englishmen expected , whilst Jahangir was puzzled by his wife 's eagerness to see Nellie Roe 's presentment , although she evinced no curiosity concerning her when first he mentioned the projected marriage .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 26]: But the Emperor , still a wine-bibber it is clear , soon ceased to question the why and the wherefore of Nur Mahal 's actions .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 14]: Each day of his life he fell more and more under her influence .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 14]: Soon he practically made over the government of the state into her hands .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 26]: At that time , especially during Mowbray 's continuance with the court , she exhibited a restless activity which found no sedative save constant movement .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 46]: Devoted to sport , and showing much skill in using a gun which Sir Thomas Roe gave her , she shot many tigers with her own hand , and tigers , even at that distant date , were to be found only in secluded jungles .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 29]: A letter preserved in the Addlestone MS , from Sir Thomas Roe to Sir Thomas Smythe , refers to the Empress 's passion for roaming in remote districts .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 54]: `` I am yet followeing this wandering King , '' he writes , `` ouer Mountaynes and through woodes , so strange and unused wayes that his owne People , who almost know no other God , blaspheame his name and Hers that , it is sayd , Conducts all his actions . ''
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 26]: This same disturbing transition from place to place led to the departure , much against her will , of the Countess di Cabota to Bombay .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 31]: Her ladyship found out , what was oft rumored in India , that the Dowager-Empress , Mariam , mother of Jahangir , was really a Christian woman of Portuguese birth .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 37]: The Countess met her , and spoke to her in her own language , and the incident incensed the Emperor , who feared that his claim to be another Mahomet might be questioned by the imaums .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 35]: Roe , a politic negotiator , took advantage of the hardships and difficulties of baggage-carrying involved by the daily breaking up of the camp , to despatch the Countess to the nearest Portuguese port .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 46]: She took leave of Roger with copious tears , and wrote him long letters he could not read , so that Walter was obliged to order his face as he made known her loving messages , and heard Roger swearing under his breath the while .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 29]: Soon she sailed for Lisbon , and the big man , thinking he would never see her again , did not know whether to be glad or sorry .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 11]: Mowbray naturally rendered the greatest service to the English mission .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 37]: The whole country was thrown open to British trade , special sites were granted for factories , and , indeed , Roe 's embassy undoubtedly planted in India the seeds which have borne such million-fold yield .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 15]: But Walter , to his great relief , found that Nur Mahal avoided him .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 17]: He seldom exchanged a word with her , and then only by way of formal politeness .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 10]: She moved like a star , bright and remote .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 65]: The sole instances of personal favor which she showed him consisted , in the first place , of the redemption of the box of diamonds for money , and , secondly , in urging him and Roger to invest two thirds of their capital in indigo , which , shipped to London , was worth five times what they paid for it in India .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 19]: During an uneventful voyage home , Roger often spoke of his Matilda , and wondered how she fared .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 65]: He was sorry a gale blew them past Lisbon , though it hurried them to the Downs , but his regret merged with other sentiments when he learned , by advices awaiting Walter from his mother , that the Countess di Cabota was arrived in Wensleydale , where she had won much popularity , and was a special favorite of old Mistress Sainton 's .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 4]: `` Ecod ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 21]: roared Roger , when the full effect of this amazing intelligence penetrated his big head , `` that ends it .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 4]: I am undone !
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 48]: Between them they 'll lead me to the kirk wi ' a halter , for my owd mother ever had an eye for t ' brass , and Matilda will have filled her lug wi ' sike a tale that I 'll be tethered for life . ''
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 5]: His prediction was verified .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 11]: The Countess married him a week after he reached Yorkshire .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 19]: But the only halter she used was the chain of turquoises and gold which he himself gave her .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 8]: Never did man have more loving wife .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 49]: Her chief joy was to find some wondering listener while she poured forth the thrilling recital of her husband 's prowess , and her only anxiety was lest his fighting instincts should prove too powerful to keep him at home during the troubled years of the next reign .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 22]: But her wealth , joined to his own very considerable store , made him a rich man and a landed proprietor .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 61]: Several little Saintons , too , promised to be nearly as big as their father , or as pretty as their mother , so Roger stopped at Leyburn to look after them , siding with neither King nor Parliament , but making it widely known that he was yet able to break heads if anyone interfered with him or his .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 24]: Of the wooing of Nellie Roe by her constant lover much might be written of vastly greater interest than many things herein recorded .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 26]: Yet , such a history is neither new nor old , being of the order which shall endure as long as man seeks his mate .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 42]: So they were wed , in the Church of St. Giles , at Cripplegate , and , by one of those pleasant actions which redeem his memory , King James was graciously pleased to forget the contumacy of his long-lost subjects .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 41]: On Roe 's showing that Mowbray had done such good work for England that he well deserved the royal favor , the King bade the newly-married couple invite him to the wedding , to which he came in great state .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 32]: He asked for the Ambassador 's sword , averted his eyes , nearly clipped Walter 's ear with the blade in delivering the accolade , and duly dubbed him a knight .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 10]: Here , also , the English Solomon met Sainton .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 49]: Though his majesty was far too sagacious , in his own estimation , to credit half he was told of the giant 's performances at home and in the domains of the Great Mogul , he nevertheless asked Roger what he considered to be his most remarkable achievement .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 4]: `` Gad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 52]: was the grinning answer , `` though I have lopped heads by the score , and fought wi ' strange beasts of monstrous size and fury , I think the most wonderful thing I ever did was to get off scot free when your Majesty was ill disposed towards me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 6]: James rubbed his nose dubiously .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 12]: He took thought , and found that the retort pleased him .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 34]: So Roger , too , was ordered to kneel , and arose , very red and confused , `` Sir Roger Sainton , of Cabota Hall , in the County of York . ''
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 45]: A great deal of water had flowed under London Bridge , and under the bridge that spanned the Jumna at Agra as well , when Sir Roger rode up the Vale of Ure one day to dine and sup with his friend Sir Walter .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 29]: With him , in a carriage , came Matilda , Lady Sainton , and the special purport of the visit was to hear news lately received from India .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 21]: Fra Pietro had written , as was his yearly custom , giving them the annals of life in far-off Agra .

Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 18]: There , owing to the patronage of Jahangir and Nur Mahal , he established a thriving colony .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 28]: In course of time , by teaching his flock to eschew politics and stick to trade , he made the Franciscans a greater power than the Jesuits .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 22]: Divested of the quaint phraseology and varied spelling then in vogue , some portion of his epistle is worthy of record .

Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 50]: She still retains her habit of going unveiled among all classes , and , indeed , it would be a wise reform were other women of the country to do likewise , for the Creator never intended one half the human race to remain invisible to the other half .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 34]: Herein , however , she has failed , though it is said , as a quip , that were her own features less noteworthy she would not be so free in their exhibition .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 15]: `` Nevertheless , she is the most accomplished woman of her age and clime .
