Parsing [sent. 59 len. 8]: A birthday Gift CHAPTER I. BAD WEATHER .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 13]: It was a gray , windy noon in the beginning of autumn .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 19]: The sky and the sea were almost of the same color , and that not a beautiful one .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 69]: The edge of the horizon where they met was an edge no more , but a bar thick and blurred , across which from the unseen came troops of waves that broke into white crests , the flying manes of speed , as they rushed at , rather than ran towards the shore : in their eagerness came out once more the old enmity between moist and dry .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 39]: The trees and the smoke were greatly troubled , the former because they would fain stand still , the latter because it would fain ascend , while the wind kept tossing the former and beating down the latter .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 44]: Not one of the hundreds of fishing boats belonging to the coast was to be seen ; not a sail even was visible ; not the smoke of a solitary steamer ploughing its own miserable path through the rain-fog to London or Aberdeen .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 65]: It was sad weather and depressing to not a few of the thousands come to Burcliff to enjoy a holiday which , whether of days or of weeks , had looked short to the labor weary when first they came , and was growing shorter and shorter , while the days that composed it grew longer and longer by the frightful vitality of dreariness .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 74]: Especially to those of them who hated work , a day like this , wrapping them in a blanket of fog , whence the water was every now and then squeezed down upon them in the wettest of all rains , seemed a huge bite snatched by that vague enemy against whom the grumbling of the world is continually directed out of the cake that by every right and reason belonged to them .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 22]: For were they not born to be happy , and how was human being to fulfill his destiny in such circumstances ?
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 47]: There are men and women who can be happy in any -- even in such circumstances and worse , but they are rare , and not a little better worth knowing than the common class of mortals -- alas that they _ will _ be common !
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 14]: _ content _ to be common they are not and can not be .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 95]: Among these exceptional mortals I do not count such as , having secured the corner of a couch within the radius of a good fire , forget the world around them by help of the magic lantern of a novel that interests them : such may not be in the least worth knowing for their disposition or moral attainment -- not even although the noise of the waves on the sands , or the storm in the chimney , or the rain on the windows but serves to deepen the calm of their spirits .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 69]: Take the novel away , give the fire a black heart ; let the smells born in a lodging-house kitchen invade the sitting-room , and the person , man or woman , who can then , on such a day , be patient with a patience pleasant to other people , is , I repeat , one worth knowing -- and such there are , though not many .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 32]: Mrs. Raymount , half the head and more than half the heart of a certain family in a certain lodging house in the forefront of Burcliff , was one of such .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 86]: It was not a large family , yet contained perhaps as many varieties of character and temper as some larger ones , with as many several ways of fronting such a misfortune -- for that is what poor creatures , the slaves of the elements , count it -- as rainy weather in a season concerning which all men agree that it ought to be fine , and that something is out of order , giving ground of complaint , if it be not fine .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 90]: The father met it with tolerably good humor ; but he was so busy writing a paper for one of the monthly reviews , that he would have kept the house had the day been as fine as both the church going visitors , and the mammon-worshipping residents with income depending on the reputation of their weather , would have made it if they could , nor once said _ by your leave _ ; therefore he had no credit , and his temper must pass as not proven .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 119]: But if you had taken from the mother her piece of work -- she was busy embroidering a lady 's pinafore in a design for which she had taken colors and arrangement from a peacock 's feather , but was disposing them in the form of a sun which with its rays covered the stomacher , the deeper tints making the shadow between the golden arrows -- had you taken from her this piece of work , I say , and given her nothing to do instead , she would yet have looked and been as peaceful as she now looked , for she was not like Doctor Doddridge 's dog that did not know who made him .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 28]: A longish lad stood in the bow window , leaning his head on the shutter , in a mood of smouldering rebellion against the order of things .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 21]: He was such a mere creature of moods , that individual judgments of his character might well have proved irreconcilable .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 30]: He had not yet begun by the use of his will -- constantly indeed mistaking impulse for will -- to blend the conflicting elements of his nature into one .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 52]: He was therefore a man much as the mass of flour and raisins , etc. , when first put into the bag , is a plum-pudding ; and had to pass through something analogous to boiling to give him a chance of becoming worthy of the name he would have arrogated .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 38]: But in his own estimate of himself he claimed always the virtues of whose presence he was conscious in his good moods letting the bad ones slide , nor taking any account of what was in them .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 22]: He substituted forgetfulness for repudiation , a return of good humor for repentance , and at best a joke for apology .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 34]: Mark , a pale , handsome boy of ten , and Josephine , a rosy girl of seven , sat on the opposite side of the fire , amusing themselves with a puzzle .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 25]: The gusts of wind , and the great splashes of rain on the glass , only made them feel the cosier and more satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 5]: `` Beastly weather ! ''
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 30]: remarked Cornelius , as with an effort half wriggle , half spring , he raised himself perpendicular , and turned towards the room rather than the persons in it .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 32]: `` I 'm sorry you do n't like it , Cornie , '' said his elder sister , who sat beside her mother trimming what promised to be a pretty bonnet .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 28]: A concentrated effort to draw her needle through an accumulation of silken folds seemed to take something off the bloom of the smile with which she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 12]: `` Oh , it 's all very well for girls ! ''
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 3]: returned Cornelius .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 46]: `` You do n't do anything worth doing ; and besides you 've got so many things you like doing , and so much time to do them in , that it 's all one to you whether you go out or stay at home .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 44]: But when a fellow has but a miserable three weeks and then back to a rot of work he cares no more for than a felon for the treadmill , then it is rather hard to have such a hole made in it !
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 29]: Day after day , as sure as the sun rises -- if he does rise -- of weather as abominable as rain and wind can make it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 6]: `` My dear boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 7]: said his mother without looking up .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 7]: `` Oh , yes , mother !
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 3]: I know !
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 14]: You 're so good you would have had Job himself take it coolly .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 7]: But I 'm not like you .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 14]: Only you need n't think me so very -- what you call it !
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 15]: It 's only a breach in the laws of nature I 'm grumbling at .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 10]: I do n't mean anything to offend you . ''
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 30]: `` Perhaps you mean more than you think , '' answered his mother with a deep-drawn breath , which , if not a sigh , was very nearly one .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 30]: `` I should be far more miserable than any weather could make me , not to be able to join in the song of the three holy children . ''
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 42]: `` I 've heard you say that before , mother , '' said the youth , in a tone that roused his sister 's anger ; for much that the mother let pass was by the daughter for her sake resented .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 34]: `` But you see , '' he went on , `` the three holy children , as you call them , had n't much weather of any sort where they sung their song .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 15]: Precious tired one gets of it before the choir 's through with it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 44]: `` They would have been glad enough of some of the weather you call beastly , '' said Hester , again pulling through a stiff needle , this time without any smile , for sometimes that brother was more than she could bear .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 7]: `` Oh , I dare say !
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 52]: But then , you see , they knew , when they got out , they would n't have to go back to a beastly bank , where notes and gold all day went flying about like bats -- nothing but the sight and the figures of it coming their way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 14]: The mother 's face grew very sad as it bent over her work .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 6]: The youth saw her trouble .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 17]: `` Mother , do n't be vexed with a fellow , '' he said more gently .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 10]: `` I was n't made good like you . ''
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 16]: `` I think you were right about the holy children , '' she said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 3]: exclaimed Cornelius .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 18]: `` Mother , I never once before heard you say I was right about any mortal thing !
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 6]: Come , this is pleasant !
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 9]: I begin to think strong ale of myself !
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 9]: I do n't understand it , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 6]: `` Shall I tell you ?
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 10]: Would you care to know what I mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 7]: `` Oh , yes , mother !
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 8]: if you want to tell me . ''
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 44]: `` I think you were right when you implied it was the furnace that made them sing about the world outside of it : one can fancy the idea of the frost and the snow and the ice being particularly pleasant to them .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 39]: And I am afraid , Cornelius , my dear son , you need the furnace to teach you that the will of God , even in weather , is a thing for rejoicing in , not for abusing .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 13]: But I dread the fire for your sake , my boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 18]: `` I should have thought this weather and the bank behind it furnace enough , mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 10]: he answered , trying to laugh off her words .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 16]: `` It does not seem to be , '' she said , with some displeasure .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 26]: `` But then , '' she added with a sigh , `` you have not the same companion that the three holy children had . ''
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 6]: `` Who was that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 17]: rejoined Cornelius , for he had partly forgotten the story he knew well enough in childhood .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 14]: `` We will not talk about him now , '' answered his mother .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 28]: `` He has been knocking at your chamber-door for some time : when he comes to the furnace-door , perhaps you will open that to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 32]: Cornelius returned no answer ; he felt his mother 's seriousness awkward , and said to himself she was unkind ; why could n't she make some allowance for a fellow ?
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 5]: He meant no harm !
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 40]: He was still less patient with his mother 's not very frequent admonitions , since going into the bank , for , much as he disliked it , he considered himself quite a man of the world in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 58]: But he was almost as little capable of slipping like a pebble among other pebbles , the peculiar faculty of the man of the world , as he was of perceiving the kind of thing his mother cared about -- and that not from moral lack alone , but from dullness and want of imagination as well .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 42]: He was like the child so sure he can run alone that he snatches his hand from his mother 's and sets off through dirt and puddles , so to act the part of the great personage he would consider himself .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 48]: With all her peace of soul , the heart of the mother was very anxious about her son , but she said no more to him now : she knew that the shower bath is not the readiest mode of making a child friendly with cold water .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 7]: Just then broke out the sun .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 37]: The wind had at last blown a hole in the clouds , and through that at once , as is his wont , and the wont of a greater light than the sun , he shone .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 3]: `` Come !
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 8]: there 's something almost like sunshine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 15]: said Cornelius , having for a few moments watched the light on the sands .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 38]: `` Before it goes in again , as it 's sure to do in five minutes at the farthest , get on your bonnet , Hester , and let 's have an attempt at a walk . ''
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 14]: Before Hester could answer came a sudden spatter of rain on the window .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 5]: I told you so !
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 6]: That 's always the way !
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 4]: Just my luck !
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 19]: For me to set my heart on a thing is all one with being disappointed of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 14]: `` But if the thing was not worth setting your heart on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 8]: said Hester , speaking with forced gentleness .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 6]: `` What does that signify ?
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 11]: The thing is that your heart is set on it .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 17]: What you think nothing other people may yet be bold enough to take for something . ''
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 28]: `` Well , at least , if I had to be disappointed , I should like it to be in something that would be worth having . ''
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 6]: `` Would you now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 4]: returned Cornelius spitefully .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 10]: `` I hope you may have what you want .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 14]: For my part I do n't desire to be better than my neighbor .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 7]: I think it downright selfish . ''
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 15]: `` Do you want to be as good as your neighbor , Cornie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 12]: said his mother , looking up through a film of tears .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 49]: `` But there is a more important question than that , '' she went on , having waited a moment in vain for an answer , `` and that is , whether you are content with being as good as yourself , or want to be better . ''
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 19]: `` To tell you the truth , mother , I do n't trouble my head about such things .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 20]: Philosophers are agreed that self consciousness is the bane of the present age : I mean to avoid it .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 33]: If you had let me go into the army , I might have had some leisure for what you call thought , but that horrible bank takes everything out of a fellow .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 26]: The only thing it leaves is a burning desire to forget it at any cost till the time comes when you must endure it again .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 22]: If I had n't some amusement in between , I should cut my throat , or take to opium or brandy .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 14]: I wonder how the governor would like to be in my place ! ''
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 17]: Hester rose and left the room , indignant with him for speaking so of his father .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 36]: `` If your father were in your place , Cornelius , '' said his mother with dignity , `` he would perform the duties of it without grumbling , however irksome they might be . ''
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 9]: `` How do you know that , mother ?
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 6]: He was never tried . ''
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 13]: `` I know it because I know him , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 5]: Cornelius gave a grunt .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 78]: `` If you think it hard , '' his mother resumed , `` that you have to follow a way of life not of your own choosing , you must remember that you never could be got to express a preference for one way over another , and that your father had to strain every nerve to send you to college -- to the disadvantage , for a time at least , of others of the family .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 28]: I am sorry to have to remind you also that you did not make it any easier for him by your mode of living while there . ''
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 11]: `` I did n't run up a single bill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 13]: cried Cornelius with indignation ; `` and my father knows it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 31]: `` He does ; but he knows also that your cousin Robert did not spend above two-thirds of what you did , and made more of his time too . ''
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 16]: `` He was in _ rather _ a different set , '' sneered the youth .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 51]: `` And you know , '' his mother went on , `` that his main design in placing you in your uncle 's bank was that you might gain such a knowledge of business as will be necessary to the proper management of the money he will leave behind him .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 22]: When you have gained that knowledge , there will be time to look farther , for you are young yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 30]: Now his father 's money was the continuous occasion of annoyance to Cornelius , for it was no secret from his family how he meant to dispose of it .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 35]: He intended , namely , to leave it under trustees , of whom he wished his son to be one until he married , when it was to be divided equally among his children .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 31]: This arrangement was not agreeable to Cornelius , who could not see , he said , what advantage in that case he had from being the eldest of the family .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 16]: He broke out in a tone of expostulation , ready to swell into indignant complaint .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 32]: `` Now , mother , '' he said `` do you think it fair that I should have to look after the whole family as if they were my own ? ''
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 24]: This was by no means his real cause of complaint , but he chose to use it as his grievance for the present .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 16]: `` You will have the other trustees to advise with , '' said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 11]: `` It need not weigh on you very heavily . ''
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 20]: `` Well , of course , I could do better with it than anybody out of the family . ''
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 17]: `` If you have your father 's love of fair play , Cornelius , you will .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 18]: What you can do to that end now is to make yourself thoroughly acquainted with business . ''
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 21]: `` A bank 's not the place to get the knowledge of business necessary for that sort of thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 14]: `` Your father has reasons for preferring a general to any special knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 8]: The fitness resulting will depend upon yourself .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 17]: And when you marry you will , as you know , be rid of the responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 32]: So far your father and you are of one mind ; he does not think it fair that a married man should be burdened with any family but his own . ''
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 13]: `` What if I should marry before my father 's death ? ''
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 11]: `` I hope , indeed , you will , Cornelius .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 14]: The arrangements your father has made is one of provision against the unlikely .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 21]: When you are married , I do n't doubt he will make another , to meet the new circumstances . ''
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 26]: `` Now , '' said Cornelius to himself , `` I do believe if I was to marry money -- as why should n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 19]: -- my father would divide my share amongst the rest , and not give me a farthing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 15]: Full of the injury of the idea , he rose and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 11]: His mother , poor woman , wept as he vanished .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 51]: She dared not allow herself to ask why she wept -- dared not allow to herself that her first-born was not a lovely thought to her -- dared not ask where he could have got such a mean nature -- so mean that he did not know he was mean .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 87]: Although the ill-humor in which he had been ever since he came was by himself attributed to the weather , and had been expended on the cooking , on the couches , on the beds , and twenty different things that displeased him , he had nevertheless brought it with him ; and her experience gave her the sad doubt that the cause of it might lie in his own conduct -- for the consciousness may be rendered uneasy without much rousing of the conscience proper .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 16]: He had always been fitful and wayward , but had never before behaved so unpleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 11]: Certainly his world had not improved him for his home .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 16]: Yet amongst his companions he bore the character of the best-natured fellow in the world .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 39]: To them he never showed any of the peevishness arising from mental discomfort , but kept it for those who loved him a thousand times better , and would have cheerfully parted with their own happiness for his .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 72]: He was but one of a large herd of youths , possessing no will of their own , yet enjoying the reputation of a strong one ; for moved by liking or any foolish notion , his pettiness made a principle of , he would be obstinate ; and the common philosophy always takes obstinacy for strength of will , even when it springs from utter inability to will against liking .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 12]: Mr. Raymount knew little of the real nature of his son .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 21]: The youth was afraid of his father -- none the less that he spoke of him with so little respect .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 10]: Before him he dared not show his true nature .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 27]: He knew and dreaded the scorn which the least disclosure of his feeling about the intended division of his father 's money would rouse in him .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 53]: He knew also that his mother would not betray him -- he would have counted it betrayal -- to his father ; nor would any one who had ever heard Mr. Raymount give vent to his judgment of any conduct he despised , have wondered at the reticence of either of them .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 43]: Whether in his youth he would have done as well in a position like his son 's as his worshipping wife believed , may be doubtful ; but that he would have done better than his son must seem more than probable .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 3]: CHAPTER II .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 7]: FATHER , MOTHER , AND SON .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 12]: Gerald Raymount was a man of an unusual combination of qualities .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 54]: There were such contradictions in his character as to give ground for the suspicion , in which he certainly himself indulged , that there must be in him at least one strain not far removed from the savage , while on the other hand there were mental conditions apparently presupposing ages of culture .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 37]: At the university he had indulged in large reading outside the hedge of his required studies , and gained thus an acquaintance with and developed a faculty in literature destined to stand him in good stead .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 80]: Inheriting earthly life and a history -- nothing more -- from a long line of ancestors , and a few thousand pounds -- less than twenty -- from his father , who was a country attorney , a gentle , quarrelsome man , who yet never , except upon absolute necessity , carried a case into court , he had found , as his family increased , that his income was not sufficient for their maintenance in accustomed ease .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 29]: With not one expensive personal taste between them , they had neither of them the faculty for saving money -- often but another phrase for doing mean things .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 11]: Neither husband nor wife was capable of _ screwing _ .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 112]: Had the latter been , certainly the free-handedness of the former would have driven her to it ; but while Mrs. Raymount would go without a new bonnet till an outcry arose in the family that its respectability was in danger , she could not offer two shillings a day to a sempstress who thought herself worth half-a-crown ; she could not allow a dish to be set on her table which was not as likely to encourage hunger as allay it ; neither because some richer neighbors gave so little , would she take to herself the spiritual fare provided in church without making a liberal acknowledgment in carnal things .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 66]: The result of this way of life was the deplorable one that Mr. Raymount was compelled to rouse himself , and , from the chair of a somewhat self-indulgent reader of many books , betake himself to his study-table , to prove whether it were not possible for him to become the writer of such as might add to an income showing scantier every quarter .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 69]: Here we may see the natural punishment of liberal habits ; for this man indulging in them , and , instead of checking them in his wife , loving her the more that she indulged in them also , was for this reason condemned to labor -- the worst evil of life in the judgment of both the man about Mayfair and the tramp of the casual ward .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 57]: But there are others who dare not count that labor an evil which helps to bring out the best elements of human nature , not even when the necessity for it outlasts any impulse towards it , and who remember the words of the Lord : `` My Father worketh hitherto , and I work . ''
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 24]: For Gerald Raymount , it made a man of him -- which he is not who is of no service to his generation .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 48]: Doubtless he was driven thereto by necessity ; but the question is not whether a man works upon more or less compulsion , but whether the work he is thus taught to do he makes good honest work for which the world is so much the better .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 14]: In this matter of work there are many first that shall be last .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 30]: The work of a baker for instance must stand higher in the judgment of the universe than that of a brewer , let his ale be ever so good .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 29]: Because the one trade brings more money than the other the judgment of this world counts it more honorable , but there is the other judgment at hand .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 36]: In the exercise of his calling Raymount was compelled to think more carefully than before , and thus not only his mind took a fresh start , but his moral and spiritual nature as well .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 52]: He slid more and more into writing out the necessities and experiences of his own heart and history , and so by degrees gained power of the only true kind -- that , namely , of rousing the will , not merely the passions , or even the aspirations of men .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 37]: The poetry in which he had disported himself at college now came to the service of his prose , and the deeper poetic nature , which is the prophetic in every man , awoke in him .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 43]: Till after they had lived together a good many years the wife did not know the worth of the man she had married , nor indeed was he half the worth when she married him that he had now grown to be .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 37]: The longer they lived the prouder she grew of him and of his work ; nor was she the less the practical wisdom of the house that she looked upon her husband as a great man .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 40]: He was not a great man -- only a growing man ; yet was she nothing the worse for thinking so highly of him ; the object of it was not such that her admiration caused her to deteriorate .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 65]: The daughter of a London barrister , of what is called a good family , she had opportunity of knowing something of what is called life before she married , and from mere dissatisfaction had early begun to withdraw from the show and self-assertion of social life , and seek within herself the door of that quiet chamber whose existence is unknown to most .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 62]: For a time she found thus a measure of quiet -- not worthy of the name of rest ; she had not heeded a certain low knocking as of one who would enter and share it with her ; but now for a long time he who thus knocked had been her companion in the chamber whose walls are the infinite .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 45]: Why is it that men and women will welcome any tale of love , devotion , and sacrifice from one to another of themselves , but turn from the least hint at the existence of a perfect love at the root of it all ?
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 14]: With such a message to them , a man is a maundering prophet .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 39]: Is it not that their natures are yet so far from the ideal , the natural , the true , that the words of the prophet rouse in them no vision , no poorest perception of spiritual fact ?
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 47]: Helen Raymount was now a little woman of fifty , clothed in a sweet dignity , from which the contrast she disliked between her plentiful gray hair , and her great , clear , dark eyes , took nothing ; it was an opposition without discord .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 19]: She had but the two daughters and two sons already introduced , of whom Hester was the eldest .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 47]: Wise as was the mother , and far-seeing as was the father , they had made the mistake common to all but the wisest parents , of putting off to a period more or less too late the moment of beginning to teach their children obedience .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 38]: If this be not commenced at the first possible moment , there is no better reason why it should be begun at any other , except that it will be the harder every hour it is postponed .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 44]: The spiritual loss and injury caused to the child by their waiting till they fancy him fit to reason with , is immense ; yet there is nothing in which parents are more stupid and cowardly , if not stiff-necked , than this .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 54]: I do not speak of those mere animal parents , whose lasting influence over their progeny is not a thing to be greatly desired , but of those who , having a conscience , yet avoid this part of their duty in a manner of which a good motherly cat would be ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 38]: To one who has learned of all things to desire deliverance from himself , a nursery in which the children are humored and scolded and punished instead of being taught obedience , looks like a moral slaughter-house .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 23]: The dawn of reason will doubtless help to develop obedience ; but obedience is yet more necessary to the development of reason .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 31]: To require of a child only what he can understand the reason of , is simply to help him to make himself his own God -- that is a devil .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 35]: That some seem so little injured by their bad training is no argument in presence of the many in whom one can read as in a book the consequences of their parents ' foolishness .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 15]: Cornelius was a youth of good abilities , and with a few good qualities .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 23]: Naturally kind-hearted , yet full of self and its poor importance , he had an admiration of certain easy and showy virtues .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 28]: He was himself not incapable of an unthinking generosity ; felt pity for picturesque suffering ; was tempted to kindness by the prospect of a responsive devotion .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 73]: Unable to bear the sight of suffering , he was yet careless of causing it where he would not see it ; incapable of thwarting himself , he was full of weak indignation at being thwarted ; supremely conceited , he had yet a regard for the habits and judgments of men of a certain stamp which towards a great man would have been veneration , and would have elevated his being .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 27]: But the sole essentials of life as yet discovered by Cornelius were a good carriage , good manners , self-confidence , and seeming carelessness in spending .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 26]: That the spender was greedy after the money he yet scorned to work for , made no important difference in Cornelius 's estimate of him .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 29]: In a word , he fashioned a fine gentleman-god in his foolish brain , and then fell down and worshipped him with what worship was possible between them .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 65]: To all home-excellence he was so far blind that he looked down upon it ; the opinion of father or mother , though they had reared such a son as himself , was not to be compared in authority with that of Reginald Vavasor , who , though so poor as to be one of his fellow-clerks , was heir apparent to an earldom .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 3]: CHAPTER III .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 4]: THE MAGIC LANTERN .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 16]: Cornelius , leaving his mother , took refuge with his anger in his own room .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 31]: Although he had occupied it but a fortnight the top of its chest of drawers was covered with yellow novels -- the sole kind of literature for which Cornelius cared .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 37]: Of this he read largely , if indeed his mode of swallowing could be called reading ; his father would have got more pleasure out of the poorest of them than Cornelius could from a dozen .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 40]: And now in this day 's dreariness , he had not one left unread , and was too lazy or effeminate or prudent to encounter the wind and rain that beset the path betwixt him and the nearest bookshop .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 12]: None of his father 's books had any attraction for him .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 15]: Neither science , philosophy , history , nor poetry held for him any interest .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 25]: A drearier soul in a drearier setting could hardly be imagined than the soul of this youth in that day 's weather at Burcliff .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 16]: Does a reader remark , `` Well , wherein was the poor fellow to blame ?
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 11]: No man can make himself like this or like that !
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 14]: The thing that is a passion to one is a bore to another !
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 12]: Some with both ear and voice have no love for music .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 16]: Most exquisite of sonatas would not to them make up for a game of billiards !
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 12]: They can not help it : they are made so '' ?
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 60]: -- I answer , It is true no one can by an effort of the will care for this or that ; but where a man cares for nothing that is worth caring for , the fault must lie , not in the nature God made , but in the character the man himself has made and is making .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 14]: There is a moral reason why he does not and can not care .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 60]: If Cornelius had begun at any time , without other compulsion than the urging within him , to do something he knew he ought to do , he would not now have been the poor slave of circumstances he was -- at the call and beck of the weather -- such , in fact , as the weather willed .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 67]: When men face a duty , not merely will that duty become at once less unpleasant to them , but life itself will _ immediately _ begin to gather interest ; for in duty , and in duty only , does the individual begin to come into real contact with life ; therein only can he see what life is , and grow fit for it .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 39]: He threw himself on his bed -- for he dared not smoke where his father was -- and dozed away the hours till lunch , then returned and dozed again , with more success , till tea time .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 12]: This was his only resource against the unpleasantness of the day .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 32]: The others were nowise particularly weighed down by it , and the less that Cornelius was so little in the room , haunting the window with his hands in his pockets .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 22]: When tea was over , he rose and sauntered once more to the window , the only outlook he ever frequented .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 4]: `` Hullo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 8]: he cried , turning from it quickly .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 6]: `` I say , Hester !
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 5]: here 's a lark !
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 15]: the sun 's shining as if his grandmother had but just taught him how !
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 17]: The rain 's over , I declare -- at least for a quarter of an hour !
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 8]: Come , let 's have a walk .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 11]: We 'll go and hear the band in the castle-gardens .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 22]: I do n't think there 's any thing going on at the theatre , else I would take you there . ''
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 11]: The sight of the sun revives both men and midges .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 10]: `` I would rather walk , '' said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 12]: `` It is seldom one sees good acting in the provinces .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 8]: At best there is but one star .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 18]: I prefer a jewel to a gem , and a decent play to a fine part . ''
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 24]: `` Hester , '' said Cornelius with reproof , `` I believe you think it a fine thing to be hard to please !
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 12]: I know a fellow that calls it a kind of suicide .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 20]: To allow a spot to spoil your pleasure in a beauty is to be too fond of perfection . ''
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 17]: `` No , Corney , '' answered his sister , `` that is hardly my position .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 33]: What I would say is rather , that one point of excellence is not enough to make a whole beautiful -- a face , or a play -- or a character . ''
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 26]: Hester had a rather severe mode of speaking , especially to this brother , which , if it had an end , failed of it .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 51]: She was the only person in the house who could ever have done any thing with him , and she lost her advantage -- let me use a figure -- by shouting to him from a distance , instead of coming close up to him and speaking in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 24]: But for that she did not love him enough , neither was she yet calm enough in herself to be able for it .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 27]: I doubt much , however , if he would have been in any degree permanently the better for the best she could have done for him .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 8]: He was too self-satisfied for any redemption .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 36]: He was afraid of his father , resented the interference of his mother , was as cross as he pleased with his sister , and cared little whether she was vexed with him or not .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 32]: And he regarded the opinion of any girl , just because she was a girl , too little to imagine any reflection on himself in the remark she had just made .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 10]: While they talked he had been watching the clouds .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 10]: `` Do go , Hester , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 14]: `` I give you my word it will be a fine evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 18]: She went to put on her hat and cloak , and presently they were in the street .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 41]: It was one of those misty clearings in which sometimes the day seems to gather up his careless skirts , that have been sweeping the patient , half-drowned world , as he draws nigh the threshold of the waiting night .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 51]: There was a great lump of orange color half melted up in the watery clouds of the west , but all was dreary and scarce consolable , up to the clear spaces above , stung with the steely stars that began to peep out of the blue hope of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 34]: Thither Hester kept casting up her eyes as they walked , or rather somehow her eyes kept travelling thitherward of themselves , as if indeed they had to do with things up there .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 37]: And the child that cries for the moon is wiser than the man who looks upon the heavens as a mere accident of the earth , with which none but _ unpractical _ men concern themselves .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 34]: But as she walked gazing at `` an azure disc , shield of tranquility , '' over her head , she set her foot down unevenly , and gave her ankle a wrench .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 9]: She could not help uttering a little cry .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 7]: `` There now , Hester ! ''
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 22]: said Cornelius , pulling her up like a horse that stumbled , `` that 's what you get by your star-gazing !
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 14]: You are always coming to grief by looking higher than your head ! ''
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 28]: `` Oh , please , stop a minute , Corney , '' returned Hester , for the fellow would have walked on as if nothing had happened .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 7]: `` My ankle hurts so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 13]: `` I did n't know it was so bad as that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 4]: he answered stopping .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 5]: take my arm . ''
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 20]: `` Now I can go on again , '' she said , after a few moments of silent endurance .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 6]: `` How stupid of me !
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 8]: -- on a plain asphalt pavement ! ''
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 20]: He might have excused her with the remark that just on such was an accidental inequality the more dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 12]: `` What bright , particular star were you worshipping now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 4]: he asked scoffingly .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 9]: `` What do you mean by that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 26]: she rejoined in a tone affected by her suffering , which thence , from his lack of sympathy , he took for one of crossness .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 42]: `` You know quite well , '' he answered roughly , `` that you are always worshipping some paragon or other -- for a while , till you get tired of her , and then throw her away for another ! ''
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 8]: Hester was hurt and made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 9]: There was some apparent ground for the accusation .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 14]: She was ready to think extravagantly of any new acquaintances that pleased her .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 36]: Frank and true and generous , it was but natural she should read others by herself ; just as those in whom is meanness or guile can not help attributing the same to the simplest .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 58]: Nor was the result unnatural either , namely , that , when a brief intercourse had sufficed to reveal a nature on the common level , it sufficed also to chill the feeling that had rushed to the surface to welcome a friend , and send the new-found floating far away on the swift ebb of disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 37]: Any whom she treats thus , called her , of course , fitful and changeable , whereas it was in truth the unchangeableness of her ideal and her faithfulness to it that exposed her to blame .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 42]: She was so true , so much in earnest , and , although gentle , had so little softness to drape the sterner outlines of her character that she was looked upon with dislike by not a few of her acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 34]: `` That again comes of looking too high , and judging with precipitation , '' resumed Cornelius , urged from within to be unpleasant -- and the rather that she did not reply .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 26]: He was always ready to criticise , and it was so much the easier for him that he had not the least bent towards self-criticism .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 25]: For the latter supposes some degree of truth in the inward parts , and that is obstructive to the indulgence of the former tendency .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 65]: As to himself , he would be hand and glove at a moment 's notice with any man who looked a gentleman , and made himself agreeable ; nor whatever he might find him to be , was he , so long as the man was not looked down upon by others , the least inclined to avoid his company because of moral shadiness .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 10]: `` A man can take care of himself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 4]: he would say .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 4]: Hester stopped again .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 14]: `` Corney , '' she said , `` my ankle feels so weak !
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 10]: I am walking in terror of twisting it again .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 8]: You must let me stand a bit .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 10]: I shall be all right in a minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 12]: `` I 'm very sorry , '' rejoined her brother disagreeably .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 15]: `` We must take the first fly we meet , and go home again .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 6]: It 's just my luck !
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 11]: I thought we were going to have some fun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 20]: They stood silent , she looking nowhere , and he staring now in this direction , now in that .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 3]: `` Hullo !
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 5]: what 's this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 12]: he cried , his gaze fixing on a large building opposite .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 6]: `` The Pilgrim 's Progress !
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 5]: The Rake 's Progress !
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 8]: As edifying as amusing , no doubt !
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 13]: I suppose the Pilgrim and the Rake are contrasted with each other .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 6]: But how , I wonder !
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 9]: Is it a lecture or a magic lantern ?
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 6]: Both , I dare say !
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 7]: Let 's go in and see !
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 10]: I ca n't read any more of the bill .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 12]: We may at least sit there till your ankle is better .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 8]: ` Admission -- front seats sixpence . '
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 3]: Come along .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 10]: We may get a good laugh , who knows ?
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 13]: -- a thing cheap at any price -- for our sixpence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 16]: `` I do n't mind , '' said Hester , and they crossed the road .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 67]: It was a large , dingy , dirty , water-stained and somewhat dilapidated hall to which the stone stair , ascending immediately from the door , led them ; and it would have looked considerably worse but for the obscurity belonging to the nature of the entertainment , through which it took some pains to discover the twenty-five or thirty people that formed the company present .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 46]: It was indeed a dim , but not therefore , a very religious light that pervaded rather than overcame the gloom , issuing chiefly from the crude and discordant colors of a luminous picture on a great screen at the farther end of the hall .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 57]: There an ill-proportioned figure , presenting , although his burden was of course gone some time , a still very humpy Christian , was shown extended on the ground , with his sword a yard beyond his reach , and Apollyon straddling across the whole breadth of the way , and taking him in the stride .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 51]: But that huge stride was the fiend 's sole expression of vigor ; for , although he held a flaming dart ready to strike the poor man dead , his own dragon countenance was so feebly demoniacal that it seemed unlikely he would have the heart to drive it home .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 88]: The lantern from which proceeded the picture , was managed by a hidden operator , evidently from his voice , occasionally overheard , a mere boy ; and an old man , like a broken-down clergyman , whose dirty white neckcloth seemed adjusted on a secret understanding of moral obliquity , its knot suggesting a gradual approach to the last position a knot on the neck can assume , kept walking up and down the parti-colored gloom , flaunting a pretense of lecture on the scenes presented .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 22]: Whether he was a little drunk or greatly in his dotage , it was impossible to determine without a nearer acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 33]: If I venture to give a specimen of his mode of lecturing , it will be seen that a few lingering rags of scholastic acquirement , yet fluttered about the poor fellow .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 15]: `` Here you behold the terrible battle between Christian -- or was it Faithful ?
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 16]: -- I used to know , but trouble has played old Hookey with my memory .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 30]: It 's all here , you know '' -- and he tapped the bald table-land of his head -- `` but somehow it ai n't handy as it used !
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 19]: In the morning it flourisheth and groweth up : in the evening it is cut down and withereth .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 33]: Man that is in honor and abideth not , is like the beast that perisheth -- but there 's Christian and Apollyon , right afore you , and better him than me .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 41]: When I was a young one , and that was n't yesterday , I used to think , but that was before I could read , that Apollyon was one and the same with Bonaparty -- Nappoleon , you know .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 39]: And I was n't just so far wrong neither , as I shall readily prove to those of my distinguished audience who have been to college like myself , and learned to read Greek like their mother tongue .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 19]: For what is the very name Apollyon , but an occult prophecy concerning the great conqueror of Europe !
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 5]: nothing can be plainer !
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 25]: Of course the first letter , N , stands for nothing -- a mere veil to cover the prophecy till the time of revealing .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 39]: In all languages it is the sign of negation -- _ no _ , and _ none _ , and _ never _ , and _ nothing _ ; therefore cast it away as the nothing it is .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 10]: Then what have you left but _ apoleon _ !
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 14]: Throw away another letter , and what have you but _ poleon _ !
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 38]: Throw away letter after letter , and what do you get but words -- _ Napoleon , apoleon , poleon , oleon , leon , eon _ , or , if you like , _ on _ !
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 16]: Now these are all Greek words -- and what , pray , do they mean ?
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 43]: I will give you a literal translation , and I challenge any Greek scholar who may be here present to set me right , that is , to show me wrong : Napoleon the destroyer of cities , being a destroying lion !
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 15]: Now I should like to know a more sure word of prophecy than that !
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 9]: Would any one in the company oblige me ?
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 24]: I take that now for an incontrovertible '' -- he stammered over this word -- `` proof of the truth of the Bible .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 46]: But I am wandering from my subject , which error , I pray you , ladies and gentlemen , to excuse , for I am no longer what I was in the prime of youth 's rosy morn -- come , I must get on !
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 12]: Change the slide , boy ; I 'm sick of it .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 7]: I 'm sick of it all .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 11]: I want to get home and go to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 53]: He maundered on in this way , uttering even worse nonsense than I have set down , and mingling with it soiled and dusty commonplaces of religion , every now and then dwelling for a moment or two upon his own mental and physical declension from the admirable being he once was .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 48]: He reached the height of his absurdity in describing the resistance of the two pilgrims to the manifold temptations of Vanity Fair , which he so set forth as to take from Christian and Faithful the smallest possible appearance of merit in turning their backs upon them .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 14]: Cornelius was in fits of laughter , which he scarcely tried to choke .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 48]: When the dreary old soul drew near where he sat , smelling abominably of strong drink , the only thing that kept his merriment within bounds was the dread that the man might address him personally , and so draw upon him the attention of the audience .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 8]: Very different was the mood of Hester .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 21]: To the astonishment of Cornelius , when at last they rose to go , there were tears in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 12]: The misery of the whole thing was too dreadful to her !
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 31]: The lantern itself must , she thought , have been made when the invention was in its infancy , and its pictured slides seemed the remnants of various outworn series .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 17]: Those of the Rake 's Progress were something too hideous and lamentable to be dwelt upon .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 89]: And the ruinous , wretched old man did not merely seem to have taken to this as a last effort , but to have in his dotage turned back upon his life course , and resumed a half-forgotten trade -- or perhaps only an accomplishment of which he had made use for the benefit of his people when he was a clergyman -- to find that the faculty for it he once had , and on which he had reckoned to carry him through , had abandoned him .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 38]: Worst of all to the heart of Hester was the fact that so few people were present , many of them children at half-price , some of whom seemed far from satisfied with the amusement offered them .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 47]: When the hall and the gas -- but that would not be much -- and the advertising were paid for , what would the poor old scrag-end of humanity , with his yellow-white neckcloth knotted hard under his left ear , have over for his supper ?
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 9]: Was there any woman to look after him ?
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 10]: and would she give him anything fit to eat ?
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 48]: Hester was all but crying to think she could do nothing for him -- that he was so far from her and beyond her help , when she remembered the fat woman with curls hanging down her cheeks , who had taken their money at the door .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 13]: Apparently she was his wife -- and seemed to thrive upon it !
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 10]: But alas for the misery of the whole thing !
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 73]: When they came out and breathed again the blue , clean , rain-washed air instead of the musty smells of the hall , involuntarily Hester 's eyes rose to the vault whose only keystone is the will of the Father , whose endless space alone is large enough to picture the heart of God : how was that old man to get up into the high regions and grow clean and wise ?
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 14]: For all the look , he must belong there as well as she !
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 46]: And were there not thousands equally and more miserable in the world -- people wrapped in no tenderness , to whom none ministered , left if not driven -- so it seemed at the moment to Hester -- to fold themselves in their own selfishness ?
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 33]: And was there nothing she , a favored one of the family , could do to help , to comfort , to lift up one such of her own flesh and blood ?
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 11]: -- to rescue a heart from the misery of hopelessness ?
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 22]: -- to make this one or that feel there was a heart of love and refuge at the centre of things ?
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 51]: Hester had a large , though not hitherto entirely active aspiration in her ; and now , the moment she began to flutter her weak wings , she found the whole human family hanging upon her , and that she could not rise except in raising them along with her .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 20]: For the necessities of our deepest nature are such as not to admit of a mere private individual satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 88]: I well remember feeling as a child that I did not care for God to love me if he did not love everybody : the kind of love I needed was love essential to my nature -- the love of me , a man , not of me a person -- the love therefore that all men needed , the love that belonged to their nature as the children of the Father , a love he could not give me except he gave it to all men .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 21]: But this was not the beginning of Hester 's enthusiasm for her kind -- only a crystallizing shock it received .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 30]: Nor was it likely to be the less powerful in the end that now at the age of three and twenty she had but little to show for it .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 42]: She was one of the strong ones that grow slowly ; and she had now for some years been cherishing an idea , and working for its realization , which every sight and sound of misery tended to quicken and strengthen .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 15]: `` There you are again , '' said Cornelius -- `` star-gazing as usual !
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 10]: You 'll be spraining your other ankle presently ! ''
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 30]: `` I had forgotten all about my ankle , Corney dear , '' returned Hester , softened by her sorrowful sympathy ; `` but I will be careful . ''
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 5]: `` You had better .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 14]: Well , I think between us we had the worth of our shilling !
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 11]: Did you ever see such a ridiculous old bloke ! ''
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 34]: `` I wish you would not use that word , Corney , '' said Hester , letting her displeasure fall on the word , where she knew the feeling was entrenched beyond assault .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 9]: `` What 's the matter with the word ?
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 9]: It is the most respectable old Anglo-Saxon . ''
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 11]: Hester said no more , but heaved an inward sigh .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 27]: Of what consequence were the words her brother used , so long as he recognized no dignity in life , never set himself _ to be !
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 21]: _ Why should any one be taught to behave like a gentleman , so long as he is no gentleman ?
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 5]: Cornelius burst out laughing .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 30]: `` To think of those muffs going through the river -- sliding along the bottom , and spreading out their feelers above the water , like two rearing lobsters !
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 16]: And the angels waiting for them on the bank like laundresses with their clean shirts !
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 3]: ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 34]: `` They seemed to me , '' answered Hester , `` very much like the men , and angels too , in that old edition of the Pilgrim papa thinks so much of .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 24]: I could n't for my part , absurd as they were , help feeling a certain pathos in the figures and faces . ''
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 12]: `` That came of the fine interpretation the old -- hm !
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 10]: -- codger gave of their actions and movements ! ''
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 24]: `` It may have come of the pitiful feeling the whole affair gave me -- I can not tell , '' said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 10]: `` That old man made me very sad . ''
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 10]: `` Now you do strand me , Hester ! ''
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 4]: replied her brother .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 27]: `` How you could see anything pathetic , or pitiful as you call it , in that disreputable old humbug , I ca n't even imagine .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 14]: A more ludicrous specimen of tumble-down humanity it would be impossible to find !
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 12]: A drunken old thief -- I 'll lay you any thing !
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 15]: Catch me leaving a sov where he could spy the shine of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 11]: `` And do n't you count that pitiful , Cornelius ?
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 35]: Can you see one of your own kind , with heart and head and hands like your own , so self-abandoned , so low , so hopeless , and feel no pity for him ?
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 21]: Did n't you hear him say to himself as he passed you , ` Come , let 's get on !
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 6]: I 'm sick of it .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 11]: I do n't know what I 'm talking about . '
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 8]: He seemed actually to despise himself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 10]: `` What better or more just could he do ?
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 12]: But never you mind : _ he 's _ all right !
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 11]: Do n't you trouble your head about _ him _ .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 9]: You should see him when he gets home !
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 16]: He 'll have his hot supper and his hot tumbler , do n't you fear !
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 16]: Swear he will too , and fluently , if it 's not waiting him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 44]: `` Now that seems to me the most pitiful of all , '' returned Hester , and was on the point of adding , `` That is just the kind of pity I feel for you , Corney , '' but checked herself .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 24]: `` Is it not most pitiful to see a human being , made in the image of God , sunk so low ? ''
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 11]: `` It 's his own doing , '' returned Cornelius .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 14]: `` And is not that yet the lowest and worst of it all ?
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 42]: If he could not help it , and therefore was not to blame , it would be sad enough ; but to be such , and be to blame for being such , seems to me misery upon misery unbearable . ''
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 13]: `` There I do n't agree with you -- not at all !
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 33]: So long as a fellow has fair play , and nothing happens to him but what he brings upon himself , I do n't see what he has to complain of . ''
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 12]: `` But that is not the question , '' interrupted Hester .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 22]: `` It is not whether he has anything to complain of , but whether he has anything to be pitied for .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 19]: I do n't know what I would n't do to make that old man clean and comfortable ! ''
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 8]: Cornelius again burst into a great laugh .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 13]: No man was anything to him merely because he was a man .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 10]: `` A highly interesting protege you would have ! ''
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 17]: he said ; `` and no doubt your friends would congratulate you when you presented him !
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 19]: But for my part I do n't see the least occasion to trouble your head about such riffraff .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 12]: Every manufacture has its waste , and he 's human waste .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 22]: There 's misery enough in the world without looking out for it , and taking other people 's upon our shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 25]: You remember what one of the fellows in the magic lantern said : ` Every tub must stand on its own bottom ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 5]: Hester held her peace .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 34]: That her own brother 's one mode of relieving the suffering in the world should be to avoid as much as possible adding to his own , was to her sisterly heart humiliating .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 3]: CHAPTER IV .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 3]: HESTER ALONE .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 28]: When the family separated for the night and Hester reached her room , she sat down and fell a thinking , not more earnestly but more continuously .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 60]: She was one of those women -- not few in number , I have good reason to think , though doubtless few comparatively , who from the first dawn of consciousness have all their lives endeavored , with varying success , with frequent failure of strength , and occasional brief collapse of effort , to do the right thing .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 32]: Therein she had but followed in the footsteps of her mother , who , though not so cultivated as she , walked no less steady in the true path of humanity .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 74]: But the very earnestness of Hester 's endeavor along with the small reason she found for considering it successful ; the frequent irritation with herself because of failure ; and the impossibility of satisfying the hard master Self , who , while he flatters some , requires of others more than they can give -- all tended to make her less evenly sympathetic with those about her than her heart 's theory demanded .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 64]: Willing to lay down her life for them , a matchless nurse in sickness , and in trouble revealing a tenderness perfectly lovely , she was yet not the one to whom first either of the children was ready to flee with hurt or sorrow : she was not yet all human , because she was not yet at home with the divine .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 24]: Thousands that are capable of great sacrifices are yet not capable of the little ones which are all that are required of them .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 48]: God seems to take pleasure in working by degrees ; the progress of the truth is as the permeation of leaven , or the growth of a seed : a multitude of successive small sacrifices may work more good in the world than many a large one .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 41]: What would even our Lord 's death on the cross have been , except as the crown of a life in which he died daily , giving himself , soul , body and spirit , to his men and women ?
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 12]: It is the _ Being _ that is the precious thing .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 39]: Being is the mother to all little Doings as well as the grown-up Deeds and the mighty heroic Sacrifice ; and these little Doings , like the good children of the house , make the bliss of it .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 26]: Hester had not had time , neither had she prayed enough to _ be _ quite yet , though she was growing well towards it .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 39]: She was a good way up the hill , and the Lord was coming down to meet her , but they had not quite met yet , so as to go up the rest of the way together .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 24]: In religious politics , Hester was what is called a good churchwoman , which in truth means a good deal of a sectarian .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 78]: She not merely recoiled from such as venerated the more primitive modes of church-government rather than those of later expediency , and preferred far inferior extempore prayers to the best possible prayers in print , going therefore to some chapel instead of the church , but she looked down upon them as from a superior social standing -- that is , with the judgment of this world , and not that of Christ the carpenter 's son .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 31]: In short , she had a repugnance to the whole race of dissenters , and would not have soiled her dress with the dust of one of their school-rooms even .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 34]: She regarded her own conscience as her Lord , but had not therefore any respect for that of another man where it differed from her in the direction of what she counted vulgarity .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 22]: So she was scarcely in the kingdom of heaven yet , any more than thousands who regard themselves as choice Christians .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 48]: I do not say these feelings were very active in her , for little occurred to call them out ; but she did not love her dissenting neighbor , and felt good and condescending when , brought into contact with one , she behaved kindly to him .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 113]: I well know that some of my readers will heartily approve of her in this very thing , and that not a few _ good dissenters _ on the other hand , who are equally and in precisely the same way sectarians , that is bad Christians , will scorn her for it ; but for my part I would rather cut off my right hand than be so cased and stayed in a narrow garment of pride and satisfaction , condemned to keep company with myself instead of the Master as he goes everywhere -- into the poorest companies of them that love each other , and so invite his presence .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 103]: The Lord of truth and beauty has died for us : shall we who , by haunting what we call his courts , have had our sense of beauty , our joy in grace tenfold exalted , gather around us , in the presence of those we count less refined than ourselves , skirts trimmed with the phylacteries of the world 's law , turning up the Pharisaical nose , and forgetting both what painful facts self-criticism has revealed to ourselves , and the eyes upon us of the yet more delicate refinement and the yet gentle breeding of the high countries ?
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 43]: May these not see in us some malgrace which it needs the gentleness of Christ to get over and forget , some savagery of which we are not aware , some _ gaucherie _ that repels though it can not estrange them ?
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 21]: Casting from us our own faults first , let us cast from us and from him our neighbor 's also .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 38]: O gentle man , the common man is yet thy brother , and thy gentleness should make him great , infecting him with thy humility , not rousing in him the echo of a vile unheavenly scorn .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 27]: Wilt thou , with thy lofty condescension , more intrinsically vulgar than even his ugly self-assertion , give him cause too good to hate thy refinement ?
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 54]: It is not thy refinement makes thee despise him ; it is thy own vulgarity ; and if we dare not search ourselves close enough to discover the low breeding , the bad blood in us , it will one day come out plain as the smitten brand of the _ forcat _ .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 18]: That Hester had a tendency to high church had little or nothing to do with the matter .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 76]: Such exclusiveness is simply a form of that pride , justify or explain it as you will , which found its fullest embodiment in the Jewish Pharisee -- the evil thing that Christ came to burn up with his lovely fire , and which yet so many of us who call ourselves by his name keep hugging to our bosoms -- I mean the pride that says , `` I am better than thou . ''
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 42]: If these or those be in any true sense below us , it is of Satan to despise -- of Christ to stoop and lay hold of and lift the sister soul up nearer to the heart of the divine tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 25]: But this tenderness , which has its roots in every human heart , had larger roots in the heart of Hester than in most .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 71]: Whatever her failings , whatever ugly weeds grew in the neglected corners of her nature , the moment she came in contact with any of her kind in whatever condition of sadness or need , the pent-up love of God -- I mean the love that came of God and was divine in her -- would burst its barriers and rush forth , sometimes almost overwhelming herself in its torrent .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 18]: She would then be ready to die , nothing less , to help the poor and miserable .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 46]: She was not yet far enough advanced to pity vulgarity in itself -- perhaps none but Christ is able to do that -- but she could and did pity greatly its associated want and misery , nor was repelled from them by their accompanying degradation .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 54]: The tide of action , in these later years flowing more swiftly in the hearts of women -- whence has resulted so much that is noble , so much that is paltry , according to the nature of the heart in which it swells -- had been rising in that of Hester also .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 7]: She must not waste her life !
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 7]: She must _ do _ something !
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 5]: What should it be ?
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 23]: Her deep sense of the misery around her had of course suggested that it must be something in the way of help .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 9]: But what form was the help to take ?
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 7]: `` I have no money ! ''
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 39]: she said to herself -- for this the last and feeblest of means for the doing of good is always the first to suggest itself to one who has not perceived the mind of God in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 20]: To me it seems that the first thing in regard to money is to prevent it from doing harm .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 35]: The man who sets out to do good with his fortune is like one who would drive a team of tigers through the streets of a city , or hunt the fox with cheetahs .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 61]: I would think of money as Christ thought of it , not otherwise ; for no other way is true , however it may recommend itself to good men ; and neither Christ nor his apostles did anything by means of money ; nay , he who would join them in their labors had to abandon his _ fortune _ .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 51]: This evening , then , the thought of the vulgar , miserable , ruinous old man , with his wretched magic lantern , kept haunting Hester , and made her very pitiful ; and naturally , starting from him , her thoughts went wandering abroad over the universe of misery .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 66]: For was not the world full of men and women who groaned , not merely under poverty and cruelty , weakness and sickness , but under dullness and stupidity , hugged in the paralyzing arms of that devil-fish , The Commonplace , or held fast to the rocks by the crab Custom , while the tide of moral indifference was fast rising to choke them ?
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 15]: Was there no prophet , no redemption , no mediator for such as these ?
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 50]: Were there not thousands of women , born with a trembling impulse towards the true and lovely , in whom it was withering for lack of nurture , and they themselves continuously massing into common clay , a summer-fall of human flowers off the branches of hope and aspiration ?
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 77]: How many young wives , especially linked to the husbands of their choice , and by this very means disenchanted , as they themselves would call it , were doomed to look no more upon life as the antechamber of the infinite , but as the counting-house of the king of the nursery-ballad , where you may , if you can , eat bread and honey , but where you _ must _ count your money !
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 33]: At the windows of the husband-house no more looks out the lover but the man of business , who takes his life to consist in the abundance of the things he possesses !
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 8]: He must make money for his children !
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 13]: -- and would make money if he had nor chick nor child .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 10]: Could she do nothing for such wives at least ?
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 47]: The man who by honest means made people laugh , sent a fire-headed arrow into the ranks of the beleaguering enemy of his race ; he who beguiled from another a genuine tear , made heavenly wind visit his heart with a cool odor of paradise !
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 8]: What was there for her to do ?
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 55]: But possibly Hester might neither have begun nor gone on thinking thus , had it not been for a sense of power within her springing from , or at least associated with , a certain special gift which she had all her life , under the faithful care of her mother , been cultivating .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 17]: Endowed with a passion for music -- what is a true passion but a heavenly hunger ?
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 51]: -- which she indulged ; relieved , strengthened , nor ever sated , by a continuous study of both theoretical and practical music , she approached both piano and organ with eager yet withholding foot , each as a great and effectual door ready to open into regions of delight .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 74]: But she was gifted also with a fine contralto voice , of exceptional scope and flexibility , whose capacity of being educated into an organ of expression was not thrown away upon one who had a world inside her to express -- doubtless as yet not a little chaotic , but in process of assuming form that might demand utterance ; and this angelic instrument had for some years been under careful training .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 69]: And now this night came to Hester , if not for the first time , yet more clearly than ever before , the thought whether she might not in some way make use of this her one gift for the service she desired -- for the comfort , that was , and the uplifting of humanity , especially such humanity as had sunk below even its individual level .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 17]: Thus instinctively she sought relief from sympathetic pain in the alleviation and removal of its cause .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 23]: But pity and instinctive recoil from pain were by no means all the elements of the impulse moving Hester in this direction .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 64]: An honest and active mind such as hers could not have carried her so often to church and for so long a time , whatever might be the nature of the direct teaching she there received , without gaining some glimpses of the mightiest truth of our being , that we belong to God in actual fact of spiritual property and profoundest relationship .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 22]: She had much to learn in this direction yet -- as who has not who is ages in advance of life ?
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 50]: -- but this night came back to her , as it had often already returned , the memory of a sermon she had heard some twelve months before on the text , `` Glorify God in your body , and in your spirit , which are God 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 128]: It was a dull enough sermon , yet not so dull but it enabled her to supply in some degree its own lack ; and when she went out of the dark church into the sunshine , -- and heard the birds singing as if they knew without any St. Francis to tell them that their bodies and their spirits were God 's , a sense awoke in her such as she had not had before , that the grand voice lying like an unborn angel in the chest and throat of her , belonged not to herself but to God , and must be used in some way for the working of his will in the world which as well as the voice he had made .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 16]: She had no real notion yet of what is meant by the glory of God .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 23]: She had not quite learned that simplest of high truths that the glory of God is the beauty of Christ 's face .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 52]: She had a lingering idea -- a hideously frightful one , though its vagueness kept it in great measure from injuring her -- that the One only good , the One only unselfish thought a great deal of himself , and looked strictly after his rights in the way of homage .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 21]: Hence she thought first of devoting the splendor and richness of her voice to swell the song of some church-choir .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 45]: With her notion of God and of her relation to him , how could she yet have escaped the poor pagan fancy -- good for a pagan , but beggarly for a Christian , that church and its goings-on are a serving of God ?
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 44]: She had not begun to ask how these were to do God any good -- or if my reader objects to the phrase , I will use a common one saying the same thing -- how these were to do anything for God .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 58]: She had not begun to see that God is the one great servant of all , and that the only way to serve him is to be a fellow-servant with him -- to be , say , a nurse in his nursery , and tend this or that lonely , this or that rickety child of his .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 46]: She had not yet come to see that it is as absurd to call song and prayer a serving of God , as it would be to say the thief on the cross did something for Christ in consenting to go with him to paradise .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 14]: But now some dim perception of this truth began to wake in her .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 56]: Vaguely she began to feel that perhaps God had given her this voice and this marriage of delight and power in music and song for some reason like that for which he had made the birds the poets of the animal world : what if her part also should be to drive dull care away ?
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 38]: what if she too were intended to be a door-keeper in the house of God , and open or keep open windows in heaven that the air of the high places might reach the low swampy ground ?
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 69]: If while she sang , her soul mounted on the wings of her song till it fluttered against the latticed doors of heaven as a bird flutters against the wires of its cage ; if also God has made of one blood all nations of men -- why , then , surely her song was capable of more than carrying merely herself up into the regions of delight !
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 26]: Nay more , might there not from her throat go forth a trumpet-cry of truth among such as could hear and respond to the cry ?
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 30]: Then , when the humblest servant should receive the reward of his well-doing , she would not be left outside , but enter into the joy of her Lord .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 83]: How specially such work might be done by her she did not yet see , but the truth had drawn nigh her that , to serve God in any true sense , we must serve him where he needs service -- among his children lying in the heart of lack , in sin and pain and sorrow ; and she saw that , if she was to serve at all , it must be with her best , with her special equipment .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 72]: I need not follow the gradations , unmarked of herself , by which she at length came to a sort of conclusion : the immediate practical result was , that she gave herself more than ever to the cultivation of her gift , seeing in the distance the possibility of her becoming , in one mode or another , or in all modes perhaps together , a songstress to her generation .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 8]: CHAPTER V. TRULY THE LIGHT IS SWEET .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 27]: The cry of the human heart in all ages and in every moment is , `` Where is God and how shall I find him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 36]: -- No , friend , I will not accept your testimony to the contrary -- not though you may be as well fitted as ever one of eight hundred millions to come forward with it .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 37]: You take it for granted that you know your own heart because you call it yours , but I say that your heart is a far deeper thing than you know or are capable of knowing .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 8]: Its very nature is hid from you .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 32]: I use but a poor figure when I say that the roots of your heart go down beyond your knowledge -- whole eternities beyond it -- into the heart of God .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 61]: If you have never yet made one discovery in your heart , your testimony concerning it is not worth a tuft of flue ; and if you have made discoveries in it , does not the fact reveal that it is but little known to you , and that there must be discoveries innumerable yet to be made in it ?
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 33]: To him who has been making discoveries in it for fifty years , the depths of his heart are yet a mystery -- a mystery , however , peopled with loveliest hopes .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 22]: I repeat whether the man knows it or not , his heart in its depths is ever crying out for God .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 72]: Where the man does not know it , it is because the unfaithful Self , a would-be monarch , has usurped the consciousness ; the demon-man is uppermost , not Christ-man ; he is down in the crying heart , and the demon-man -- that is the self that worships itself -- is trampling on the heart and smothering it up in the rubbish of ambitions , lusts , and cares .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 19]: If ever its cry reaches that Self , it calls it childish folly , and tramples the harder .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 19]: It does not know that a child crying on God is mightier than a warrior dwelling in steel .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 65]: If we had none but fine weather , the demon-Self would be too much for the divine-Self , and would always keep it down ; but bad weather , misfortune , ill-luck , adversity , or whatever name but punishment or the love of God men may call it , sides with the Christ-self down below , and helps to make its voice heard .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 52]: On the other hand if we had nothing but bad weather , the hope of those in whom the divine Self is slowly rising would grow too faint ; while those in whom the bad weather had not yet begun to work good would settle down into weak , hopeless rebellion .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 7]: Without hope can any man repent ?
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 47]: To the people at Burcliff came at length a lovely morning , with sky and air like the face of a repentant child -- a child who has repented so thoroughly that the sin has passed from him , and he is no longer even ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 46]: The water seemed dancing in the joy of a new birth , and the wind , coming and going in gentle conscious organ-like swells , was at it with them , while the sun kept looking merrily down on the glad commotion his presence caused .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 51]: `` Ah , '' thought the mother , as she looked from her windows ere she began to dress for this new live day , `` how would it be if the Light at the heart of the sun were shining thus on the worlds made in his image ! ''
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 59]: She was thinking of her boy , whom perhaps , in all the world , she only was able to love heartily -- there was so little in the personal being of the lad , that is , in the thing he was to himself , and was making of himself , to help anyone to love him !
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 81]: But in the absolute mere existence is reason for love , and upon that God does love -- so love , that he will suffer and cause suffering for the development of that existence into a thing in its own full nature lovable , namely , an existence in its own will one with the perfect love whence it issued ; and the mother 's heart more than any other God has made is like him in power of loving .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 45]: Alas that she is so seldom like him in wisdom -- so often thwarting the work of God , and rendering more severe his measures with her child by her attempts to shield him from His law , and save him from saving sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 58]: How often from his very infancy -- if she does not , like the very nurse she employs , actively teach him to be selfish -- does she get between him and the right consequences of his conduct , as if with her one feeble loving hand , she would stay the fly-wheel of the holy universe .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 30]: It is the law that the man who does evil shall suffer ; it is the only hope for him , and a hope for the neighbor he wrongs .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 49]: When he forsakes his evil , one by one the dogs of suffering will halt and drop away from his track ; and he will find at last they have but hounded him into the land of his nativity , into the home of his Father in heaven .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 16]: As soon as breakfast was over , the whole family set out for a walk .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 29]: Mr. Raymount seldom left the house till after lunch , but even he , who cared comparatively little for the open air , had grown eager after it .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 18]: Streets , hills and sands were swarming with human beings , all drawn out by the sun .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 22]: `` I sometimes wonder , '' he said , `` that so many people require so little to make them happy .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 22]: Let but the sun break through the clouds , and he sets them all going like ants in an ant-hill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 25]: `` Yes , '' returned his wife , `` but then see how little on the other hand is required to make them miserable !
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 15]: Let the sun hide his head for a day , and they grumble ! ''
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 24]: Making the remark , the good woman never thought of her son Cornelius , the one of her family whose conduct illustrated it .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 17]: At the moment she saw him cheerful , and her love looked upon him as good .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 55]: She was one of the best of women herself : whatever hour she was called , her lamp was sure to have oil in it ; and yet all the time since first he lay in her arms , I doubt if she had ever done anything to help the youth to conquer himself .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 15]: Now it was too late , even had she known what could be done .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 17]: But the others had so far turned out well : why should not this one also ?
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 29]: The moment his bad humors were over , she looked on him as reformed ; and when he uttered worldliness , she persuaded herself he was but jesting .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 3]: But alas !
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 25]: she had no adequate notion -- not a shadow of one -- of the selfishness of the man-child she had given to the world .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 23]: This matter of the black sheep in the white flock is one of the most mysterious of the facts of spiritual generation .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 74]: Sometimes , indeed , the sheep is by no means so black as to the whiter ones he seems ; perhaps neither are they so much whiter as their friends and they themselves think ; for to be altogether respectable is not to be clean ; and the black sheep may be all the better than some of the rest that he looks what he is , and does not dye his wool .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 21]: But on the other hand he may be a great deal worse than some of his own family think him .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 29]: `` Then , '' said Hester , after a longish pause , `` those that need more to make them happy , are less easily made unhappy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 12]: To this question rather than remark , she received no reply .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 21]: Her father and mother both felt it not altogether an easy one to answer : it suggested points requiring consideration .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 21]: To Cornelius , it was a mere girl 's speech , not worth heeding where the girl was his sister .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 33]: He turned up at it a mental nose , the merest of snubs ; and well he might , for he had not the least notion of what it meant or involved .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 15]: As little notion had his father that his son Cornelius was a black sheep .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 52]: He was not what the world would have called a black sheep , but his father , could he have seen into him , would have counted him a very black sheep indeed -- and none the whiter that he recognized in the blackness certain shades that were of paternal origin .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 55]: It was , however , only to the rest of the family that Cornelius showed his blackness : of his father he was afraid ; and that father , being proud of his children , would have found it hard to believe anything bad of them : like his faults they were his own !
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 33]: His faith in his children was in no small measure conceit of that which was his , and blinded him to their faults as it blinded him to some of his own .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 25]: The discovery of any serious fault in one of them would be a sore wound to his vanity , a destruction of his self-content .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 19]: The co-existence of good and evil in the same person is perhaps the most puzzling of all facts .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 62]: What a shock it gives one to hear a woman who loves God , and spends both time and money on the betterment of her kind , call a pauper child a _ brat _ , and see her turn with disgust from the idea of treating any strange child , more especially one of low birth , as her own .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 5]: `` O Christ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 16]: cries the heart , `` is this one of the women that follows thee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 29]: And she _ is _ one of the women that follow him -- only she needs such a lesson as he gave his disciples through the Syrophenician woman .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 29]: Mr. Raymount had such an opinion of himself , that while he never obtruded his opinions upon others , he never imagined them disregarded in his own family .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 20]: It never entered his mind that any member of it might in this or that think differently from himself .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 47]: But both his wife and Hester were able to think , and did think for themselves , as they were bound in the truth of things to do ; and there were considerable divergements of the paths in which they walked from that he had trodden .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 35]: He had indeed always taken too much for granted , and ought to have used more pains to have his notions understood by them , if he laid so much on their intellectual sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 69]: He supposed all the three read what he wrote ; and his wife and daughter did read the most of it ; but what would he think when he came to know that his son not only read next to nothing of it , but read that little with a contempt not altogether unconscious -- for no other reason than that it was his father who wrote it ?
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 19]: Nor was the youth quite without justification -- for was he not himself a production of his father ?
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 14]: But then he looked upon the latter as one of altogether superior quality !
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 66]: It is indeed strange how vulgar minds despise the things they have looked upon and their hands have handled , just because they have looked upon them and their hands have handled them ; is there not in the fact a humiliating lesson , which yet they are unable to read , of the degrading power of their own presence upon themselves and their judgments ?
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 48]: Whether a man is a hero to his valet or the opposite , depends as much on the valet as on the man : The bond , then , between the father and the son , was by no means so strong as the father thought it .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 29]: Indeed the selfishness of Cornelius made him almost look upon his father as his enemy , because of his intentions with regard to the division of his property .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 8]: And selfishness rarely fails of good arguments .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 22]: Nor can anything destroy it but such a turning of things upside down as only he that made them can work .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 3]: CHAPTER VI .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 3]: THE AQUARIUM .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 16]: `` Let 's go and see the people at the aquarium , '' said Cornelius .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 8]: `` Do you mean the fishes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 4]: asked his father .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 20]: `` No , I do n't care about them ; I said the people , '' answered Cornelius stupidly .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 16]: `` The people of an aquarium must surely be fishes , eh , Saffy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 15]: said the father to the bright child , walking hand in hand with him .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 4]: It was Josephine .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 17]: Her eyes were so blue that but for the association he would have called her Sapphira .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 15]: Between the two he contented himself with the pet name of _ Saffy _ .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 33]: `` Ah but , papa , '' said Hester , `` Corney did n't say the people _ of _ the aquarium , but the people _ at _ the aquarium ! ''
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 11]: `` Two of you are too many for me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 5]: returned the father playfully .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 26]: `` Well , then , Saffy , let us go and see the people _ of _ and the people _ at _ the aquarium .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 11]: -- Which do you want to see , Hester ? ''
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 11]: `` Oh , the fishes of course , papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 6]: `` Why of course ? ''
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 28]: `` Because they 're so much more interesting than the people , '' said Hester rebuked in herself as she said it -- before she knew why .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 8]: `` Fishes more interesting than people ! ''
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 4]: exclaimed her father .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 10]: `` They 're so like people , papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 30]: `` Oh , then surely the people must be the more interesting after all , if it is the likeness of the fishes to people that makes them interesting !
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 16]: Which of all the people you love do you see likest a fish now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 6]: `` Oh , papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 13]: is it only people you hate that you see like fishes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 10]: `` I do n't hate anybody , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 60]: `` There 's a way of not caring about people , though -- looking down on them and seeing them like fishes , that 's precious like hating them , '' said Cornelius , who enjoyed a crowd , and putting his sister in the wrong still better : to that end he could easily say a sensible thing .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 19]: `` If you mean me , Corney , I think you do me injustice , '' said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 18]: `` The worst I do is to look at them the wrong way of the telescope . ''
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 15]: `` But why do you never see anyone you love like a fish ? ''
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 4]: persisted her father .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 15]: `` Perhaps because I could not love anybody that was like a fish . ''
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 11]: `` Certainly there is something not beautiful about them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 4]: said Mr. Raymount .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 10]: `` They 're beastly ugly , '' said Cornelius .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 14]: `` Let us look into it a little , '' continued his father .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 10]: `` What is it about them that is ugly ?
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 14]: Their colors are sometimes very beautiful -- and their shapes , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 33]: `` Their heads and faces , '' said Hester , `` are the only parts of them in which they can be like human beings , and those are very ugly . ''
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 24]: `` I 'm not sure that you are right , Hester , '' said the mother , who had not spoken till now .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 59]: `` There must surely be something human in their bodies as well , for now and then I see their ways and motions so like those of men and women , that I felt for a moment almost as if I understood how they were feeling , and were just going to know what they were thinking . ''
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 26]: `` I suspect , '' said Mr. Raymount , `` your mother 's too much of a poet to be trusted alone in an aquarium .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 15]: It would have driven Shelley crazy -- to judge from his Sensitive Plant . ''
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 65]: They had now reached the middle of the descent to the mysteries of the place , when Cornelius , who , with an interest Hester could not understand in him , and which was partly owing to a mere love of transition , had been staring at the ascending faces , uttered a cry of recognition , and darted down to the next landing .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 26]: With a degree of respect he seldom manifested they saw him there accost a gentleman leaning over the balustrade , and shake hands with him .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 32]: He was several years older than Cornelius , not a few inches taller , and much better-looking -- one indeed who could hardly fail to attract notice even in a crowd .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 31]: Corney 's weakest point , next to his heart , was his legs , which perhaps accounted for his worship of Mr. Vavasor 's calves , in themselves nothing remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 38]: He was already glancing stolen looks at these objects of his jealous admiration when the rest reached the landing , and Mr. Raymount , willing to know his son 's friend , desired Corney to introduce him .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 22]: Cornelius had been now eighteen months in the bank , and had never even mentioned the name of a fellow clerk .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 27]: He was one of those youths who take the only possible way for emptiness to make itself of consequence -- that of concealment and affected mystery .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 25]: Not even now but for his father 's request , would he have presented his bank friend to him or any of the family .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 41]: The manners and approach of Mr. Vavasor were such as at once to recommend him to the friendly reception of all , from Mr. Raymount to little Saffy , who had the rare charm of being shy without being rude .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 30]: If not genial , his manners were yet friendly , and his carriage if not graceful was easy ; both were apt to be abrupt where he was familiar .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 23]: It was a kind of company bearing he had , but dashed with indifference , except where he desired to commend himself .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 40]: He shook hands with little Saffy as respectfully as with her mother , but with neither altogether respectfully ; and immediately the pale-faced , cold , loving boy , Mark , unwillingly , therefore almost unconsciously , disliked him .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 25]: He was beyond question handsome , with a Grecian nose nearly perfect , which had its large part in the aristocratic look he bore .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 11]: This was favored also by the simplicity of his dress .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 10]: He turned with them , and re-descended the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 14]: `` Why did n't you tell me you were coming , Mr. Vavasor ?
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 25]: I could have met you , '' said Cornelius , with just a little stretch of the degree of familiarity in use between them .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 15]: `` I did n't know myself till the last minute , '' answered Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 11]: `` It was a sudden resolve of my aunt 's .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 11]: Neither had I the remotest idea you were here . ''
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 9]: `` Have you been seeing the fishes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 19]: asked Hester , at whose side their new acquaintance was walking now they had reached the subterranean level .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 13]: `` I have just passed along their cages , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 18]: `` They are not well kept ; the glass is dirty , and the water , too .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 10]: I fancied they looked unhappy , and came away .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 9]: I ca n't bear to see creatures pining .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 12]: It would be a good deed to poison them all . ''
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 14]: `` Would n't it be better to give them some fresh water ? ''
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 12]: said little Saffy , `` that would make them glad . ''
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 8]: To this wisdom there was no response .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 33]: When they came to the door of the concert-room , Cornelius turned into it , leaving his `` friend '' with his `` people '' to go and look at the fishes .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 11]: Mr. Vavasor kept his place by the side of Hester .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 30]: `` We were just talking , when we had the pleasure of meeting you , about people and fishes -- comparing them in a way , '' said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 21]: `` I ca n't make it clear to myself why I like seeing the fishes better than the people . ''
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 19]: `` I fancy it must be because you call them fishes and not fish , '' replied Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 24]: `` If the fishes were a shoal of herrings or mackerel , I doubt if you would -- at least for many times .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 35]: If , on the other hand , the men and women in the concert-room were as oddly distinguished one from another as these different fishes , you would prefer going with your brother . ''
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 13]: `` I 'm sure I should n't '' said Saffy to Mark .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 12]: `` Phizzes is best on fishes , '' answered Mark sententiously .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 22]: `` I like faces best ; only you do n't _ always _ want to look at what you like best !
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 6]: -- I wonder why . ''
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 35]: `` And yet I suspect , '' said Mrs. Raymount to Vavasor , `` many of the people are as much distinguished from each other in character as the fishes are in form . ''
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 37]: `` Possibly , '' interjected her husband , `` they are as different in their faces also , only we are too much of their kind to be able to read the differences so clearly . ''
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 51]: `` Surely you do not mean , '' said Vavasor respectfully , `` that any two persons in the concert-room can be as much unlike each other as that flounder shuddering along the sandy bottom , and that yard of eel sliding through the water like an embodied wickedness ? ''
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 12]: Hester was greatly struck with the poetic tone of the remark .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 42]: `` I think you may find people as different , '' replied her father , `` if you take into the account the more delicate as well as the more striking differences -- the deeper as well as the surface diversities .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 32]: Now you make me think of it , I begin to doubt whether all these live grotesques may not have been made to the pattern of different developments of humanity . ''
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 18]: `` Look at that dog-fish , '' said Vavasor , pointing to the largest in the tank .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 5]: `` What a brute !
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 10]: Do n't you hate him , Miss Raymount ? ''
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 47]: `` I am not willing to hate any live thing , '' answered Hester with a smile , '' -- from selfish motives , perhaps ; I feel as if it would be to my own loss , causing me some kind of irreparable hurt . ''
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 16]: `` But you would kill such a creature as that -- would you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 3]: he rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 23]: `` In possible circumstances , '' she answered ; `` but killing and hating have nothing necessarily to do with each other .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 18]: He that hates his brother is always a murderer , not always he that kills him . ''
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 15]: `` This is another sort of girl from any I 've met yet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 5]: said Vavasor to himself .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 10]: `` I wonder what she 's really like ! ''
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 43]: He did not know that what she was really like was just what he , with all his fancied knowledge of women both in life and literature , was incapable of seeing -- so different was she in kind from poor-gentleman Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 16]: `` But just look at the head , eyes and mouth of the fiend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 3]: he persisted .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 17]: Hester , forcing herself a little , did regard the animal for two or three minutes .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 15]: Then a slight shudder passed through her , and she turned away her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 12]: `` I see you 've caught the look of him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 3]: said Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 8]: `` Is he not a horror ? ''
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 4]: `` He is .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 28]: But that was not what made me turn away : I found if I looked a moment longer I should hate him in spite of myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 9]: `` And why should n't you hate him ?
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 9]: You would be doing the wretch no wrong .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 15]: Even if he knew it , it would be only what he deserved . ''
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 29]: `` That you can not tell except you knew all about his nature , and every point of his history from the beginning of the creation till now .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 8]: I dare not judge even a dog-fish .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 22]: And whatever his deserts , I do n't choose to hate him , because I do n't choose to hate . ''
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 15]: She turned away , and Vavasor saw she wanted no more of the dog-fish .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 16]: cried Saffy , with a face of terror , `` look , look , mamma !
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 7]: It 's staring at me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 18]: The child hid her face in her mother 's gown , yet turned immediately to look again .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 20]: Mr. Raymount looked also , following her gaze , and was fascinated by the sight that met his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 72]: Through the glass , high above his head , and not far from the surface , he saw a huge thornback , bending toward them and seeming to look down on them , as it flew slowly through the water -- the action of the two sides of its body fringed with fins , and its consequent motion , were much more like the act of flying than that of swimming .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 22]: Behind him floated his long tail , making him yet more resemble the hideously imagined kite which he at once suggested .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 20]: But the terrible thing about him was the death 's - head look of the upper part of him .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 40]: His white belly was of course toward them , and his eyes were on the other side , but there were nostrils that looked exactly like the empty sockets of eyes , and below them was a hideous mouth .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 16]: These made the face that seemed to Saffy to be hovering over and watching them .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 9]: `` Like an infernal angel of death ! ''
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 20]: thought Mr. Raymount , but would not rouse yet more the imagination of the little one by saying it .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 10]: Hester gazed with steadfast mien at the floating spectre .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 14]: `` You seem in no danger from that one , '' said Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 13]: `` I do n't think I understand you , '' said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 12]: `` What danger can there be from any of them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 8]: `` I mean of hating him . ''
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 17]: `` You are right ; I do not feel the smallest inclination to hate him . ''
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 12]: `` Yet the ray is even uglier than the dog-fish . ''
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 15]: `` That may be -- I think not -- but who hates for ugliness ?
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 4]: I never should .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 7]: Ugliness only moves my pity . ''
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 9]: `` Then what do you hate for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 4]: asked Vavasor . ''
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 11]: -- But I beg your pardon : you never hate !
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 19]: Let me ask then , what is it that makes you feel as if you might hate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 31]: `` If you will look again at the dog-fish , and tell me the expression of its mouth , I may be able to answer you , '' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 35]: `` I will , '' said Vavasor ; and , betaking himself to a farther portion of the tank , he stood there watching a little shoal of those sharks of the northern seas .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 8]: While he was gone Cornelius rejoined them .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 18]: `` I wish I knew why God made such ugly creatures , '' said Saffy to Mark .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 20]: The boy gave a curious half-sad smile , without turning his eyes from the thornback , and said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 13]: `` Do you know why God made any creatures , pet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 3]: said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 7]: `` No , I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 7]: Why did he , Hessy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 8]: `` I am almost afraid to guess .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 21]: But if you do n't know why he made any , why should you wonder that he made those ? ''
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 7]: `` Because they are so ugly .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 10]: -- Do tell me why he made them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 4]: she added coaxingly .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 8]: `` You had better ask mamma . ''
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 14]: `` But , Hessy , I do n't like to ask mamma . ''
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 15]: `` Why do n't you like to ask mamma , you little goose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 35]: `` Because , '' said Saffy , who was all the time holding her mother 's hand , and knew she was hearing her , `` mamma might n't know what to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 20]: Hester thought with herself , `` I am sometimes afraid to pray lest I should have no answer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 11]: The mother 's face turned down toward her little one .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 15]: `` And what if I should n't know what to say , darling ? ''
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 22]: `` I feel so awkward when Miss Merton asks me a question I ca n't answer , '' said the child .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 11]: `` And you are afraid of making mamma feel awkward ?
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 4]: You pet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 3]: said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 24]: Cornelius burst into a great laugh , and Saffy into silent tears , for she thought she had made a fool of herself .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 23]: She was not a priggish child , and did not deserve the mockery with which her barbarian brother invaded her little temple .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 36]: She was such a true child that her mother was her neighbor , and present to all her being -- not her eyes only or her brain , but her heart and spirit as well .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 28]: The mother led her aside to a seat , saying , `` Come , darling ; we must look into this , and try to understand it .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 13]: Let me see -- what is it we have got to understand ?
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 55]: I think it is this -- why you should be ashamed when you can not answer the questions of one who knows so much more than you , and I should not be ashamed when I can not answer the questions of my own little girl who knows so much less that I do .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 5]: Is that it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 10]: `` I do n't know , '' sobbed Saffy .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 15]: `` You should n't laugh at her , Corney : it hurts her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 3]: said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 5]: `` The little fool !
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 6]: How could that hurt her ?
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 7]: It 's nothing but temper ! ''
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 5]: said Cornelius with vexation .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 17]: He was not vexed that he had made her cry , but vexed that she cried .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 18]: `` You should have a little more sympathy with childhood , Cornelius , '' said his father .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 14]: `` You used to be angry enough when you were laughed at . ''
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 9]: `` I was a fool then myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 4]: answered Cornelius sulkily .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 16]: He said no more , and his father put the best interpretation upon his speech .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 34]: `` Do you remember , Hester , '' he said , `` how you were always ready to cry when I told you I did not know something you had asked me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 20]: `` Quite well , papa , '' replied Hester ; `` and I think I could explain it now .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 9]: I did not know then why I cried .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 17]: I think now it was because it seemed to bring you down nearer to my level .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 10]: My heaven of wisdom sank and grew less . ''
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 28]: `` I hope that is not what Saffy is feeling now ; your mother must be telling her she does n't know why God made the animals .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 3]: But no !
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 12]: She is looking up in her face with hers radiant ! ''
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 17]: And yet her mother had told her she did not know why God made the animals !
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 49]: She had at the same time , however , made her own confessed ignorance a step on which to set the child nearer to the knowledge of God ; for she told her it did not matter that she did not know , so long as God knew .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 42]: The child could see that her mother 's ignorance did not trouble her ; and also that she who confessed ignorance was yet in close communication with him who knew all about everything , and delighted in making his children understand .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 11]: And now came Vavasor from his study of the dog-fish .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 31]: His nature was a poetic one , though much choked with the weeds of the conventional and commonplace , and he had seen and felt something of what Hester intended .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 10]: But he was not alive enough to understand hate .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 8]: He was able to hate and laugh .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 24]: He could not feel the danger of hate as Hester , for hate is death , and it needs life to know death .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 16]: `` He is cruel , and the very incarnation of selfishness , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 12]: `` I should like to set my heel on him . ''
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 26]: `` If I were to allow myself to hate him , '' returned Hester , `` I should hate him too much to kill him .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 25]: I should let him live on in his ugliness , and hold back my hate lest it should wither him in the cool water .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 15]: To let him live would be my revenge , the worst I should know .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 19]: I must not look at him , for it makes me feel as wicked as he looks . ''
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 5]: She glanced at Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 7]: His eyes were fixed on her .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 15]: She turned away uncomfortable : could it be that he was like the dog-fish ?
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 5]: `` I declare . ''
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 15]: said Cornelius , coming between them , `` there 's no knowing you girls !
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 31]: Would you believe it , Mr. Vavasor -- that young woman was crying her eyes out last night over the meanest humbug of a Chadband I ever set mine on !
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 15]: There ai n't one of those fishes comes within sight of him for ugliness .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 20]: And she would have it he was to be pitied -- sorrowed over -- loved , I suppose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 14]: The last words of his speech he whined out in a lackadaisical tone .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 7]: Hester flushed , but said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 11]: She was not going to defend herself before a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 10]: She would rather remain misrepresented -- even be misunderstood .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 21]: But Vavasor had no such opinion of the brother as to take any notion of the sister from his mirror .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 46]: When she turned from Cornelius next , in which movement lay all the expression she chose to give to her indignation , he passed behind him to the other side of Hester , and there stood apparently absorbed in the contemplation of a huge crustacean .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 13]: Had Cornelius been sensitive , he must have felt he was omitted .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 8]: `` Why , can it be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 34]: she said -- to herself , but audibly -- after a moment of silence , during which she also had been apparently absorbed in the contemplation of some inhabitant of the watery cage .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 51]: But she had in truth been thinking of nothing immediately before her eyes , though they had rested first upon a huge crayfish , balancing himself on stilts innumerable , then turned to one descending a rocky incline -- just as a Swiss horse descends a stair in a mountain-path .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 25]: `` Yes , the fellow bristles with _ whys _ , '' said Vavasor , whose gaze was still fixed on one of them .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 15]: `` Every leg seems to ask ` Why am I a leg ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 15]: `` I should have thought it was asking rather , ` What am I ?
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 10]: Am I a leg or a failure ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 3]: rejoined Hester .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 10]: `` But I was not thinking of the crayfish .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 12]: He is odd , but there is no harm in him .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 8]: He looks , indeed , highly respectable .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 10]: See with what a dignity he fans himself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 35]: `` And for the same reason , '' remarked her father , who had come up and stood behind them , `` as the finest lady at the ball : he wants more air .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 14]: I wonder whether the poor fellow knows he is in a cage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 20]: `` I think he does , '' said Saffy , `` else he would run away from us . ''
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 10]: `` Are you thinking of the dog-fish still ? ''
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 3]: asked Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 60]: The strangeness , as it seemed to him , of the handsome girl 's absorption , for such it veritably appeared , in questions of no interest in themselves -- so he judged them -- attracted him even more than her beauty , for he did not like to feel himself unpossessed of the entree to such a house .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 51]: Also he was a writer of society verses -- not so good as they might have been , but in their way not altogether despicable -- and had already begun to turn it over in his mind whether something might not be made of -- what shall I call it ?
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 4]: -- the situation ?
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 34]: `` I _ was _ thinking of him , '' Hester answered , but only as a type of the great difficulty -- why there should be evil or ugliness in the world .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 8]: There must be an answer to it !
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 13]: Is it possible it should be one we would not like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 14]: `` I do n't believe there is any answer , '' said Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 12]: `` The ugly things are ugly just because they are ugly .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 12]: It is a child 's answer , but not therefore unphilosophical .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 9]: We must take things as we find them .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 14]: We are ourselves just what we are , and can not help it .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 11]: We do this or that because it is in us .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 6]: We are made so . ''
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 15]: `` You do not believe in free will , then , Mr. Vavasor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 4]: said Hester coldly .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 10]: `` I see no ground for believing in it .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 13]: We are but forces -- bottled up forces -- charged Leyden jars .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 16]: Every one does just what is in him -- acts as he is capable . ''
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 40]: He was not given to metaphysics , and , indeed , had few or no opinions in that department of inquiry ; but the odd girl interested him , and he was ready to meet her on any ground .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 14]: He had uttered his own practical unbelief , however , with considerable accuracy .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 6]: Hester 's eyes flashed angrily .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 7]: `` I say _ no _ .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 20]: Every one is capable of acting better than he does , '' she replied ; and her face flushed .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 8]: `` Why does he not then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 3]: asked Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 6]: `` Ah , why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 3]: she responded .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 16]: `` How can he be made for it if he does not do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 3]: insisted Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 4]: `` How indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 9]: That is the puzzle , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 12]: `` If he were not capable there would be none . ''
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 18]: `` I should do better , I am sure , if I could , '' said Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 16]: Had he known himself , he ought to have added , `` without trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 28]: `` Then you think we are all just like the dog-fish -- except that destiny has made none of us quite so ugly , '' rejoined Hester .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 9]: `` Or so selfish , '' implemented Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 11]: `` That I ca n't see , '' returned Hester .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 28]: `` If we are merely borne helpless hither and thither on the tide of impulse , we can be neither more nor less selfish than the dog-fish .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 11]: We are , in fact , neither selfish nor unselfish .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 14]: We are pure nothings , concerning which speculation is not worth the trouble .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 19]: But the very word _ selfish _ implies a contrary judgment on the part of humanity itself . ''
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 16]: `` Then you believe we can make ourselves different from what we are made ? ''
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 12]: `` Yes ; we are made with the power to change .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 12]: We are meant to take a share in our own making .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 43]: We are made so and so , it is true , but not made so and so only ; we are made with a power in ourselves beside -- a power that can lay hold on the original power that made us .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 10]: We are not made to remain as we are .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 7]: We are bound to grow . ''
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 20]: She spoke rapidly , with glowing eyes , the fire of her utterance consuming every shadow of the didactic .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 21]: `` You are too much of a philosopher for me , Miss Raymount , '' said Vavasor with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 8]: `` But just answer me one question .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 11]: What if a man is too weak to change ? ''
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 9]: `` He must change , '' said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 13]: Then first Vavasor began to feel the conversation getting quite too serious .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 6]: `` Ah , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 19]: `` But do n't you think this is rather -- ah -- rather -- do n't you know ?
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 6]: -- for an aquarium ? ''
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 5]: Hester did not reply .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 10]: Nothing was too serious for her in any place .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 19]: She was indeed a peculiar girl -- the more the pity for the many that made her so !
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 13]: `` Let us go and see the octopus , '' said Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 10]: They went , and Mr. Raymount slowly followed them .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 11]: He had not heard the last turn of their conversation .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 41]: `` You two have set me thinking , '' he said , when he joined them ; `` and brought to my mind an observation I had made -- how seldom you find art succeed in representing the hatefully ugly !
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 17]: The painter can accumulate ugliness , but I do not remember a demon worth the name .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 52]: The picture I can best recall with demons in it is one of Raphael 's -- a St. Michael slaying the dragon -- from the Purgatorio , I think , but I am not sure ; not one of the demons in that picture is half so ugly as your dog-fish .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 15]: -- What if it be necessary that we should have lessons in ugliness ? ''
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 5]: `` But why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 3]: said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 9]: `` Is not the ugly better let alone ?
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 14]: You have always taught that ugliness is the natural embodiment of evil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 27]: `` Because we have chosen what is bad , and do not know how ugly it is -- that is why , '' answered her father .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 13]: `` Is n't that rather hard on the fish , though ? ''
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 3]: said Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 12]: `` How can innocent creatures be an embodiment of evil ? ''
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 12]: `` But what do you mean by _ innocent _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 4]: returned Mr. Raymount .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 26]: `` The nature of an animal may be low and even hateful , and its looks correspondent , while no conscience accuses it of evil .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 33]: I have known half a dozen cows , in a shed large enough for a score , and abundantly provisioned , unite to keep the rest of the herd out of it .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 19]: Many a man is a far lower and worse creature in his nature that his conscience tells him .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 27]: It is the conscience educated by strife and failure and success that is severe upon the man , demanding of him the all but unattainable . ''
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 8]: Talk worse and worse for an aquarium !
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 12]: But happily they had now reached the tank of the octopods .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 26]: Alas , there had been some mismanagement of the pipes , and the poor devil-fishes had been boiled , or at least heated to death !
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 24]: One small , wretched , skinny thing , hardly distinguishable from a discolored clout , was all that was left of a dozen .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 9]: Cornelius laughed heartily when informed of the mischance .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 17]: `` It 's a pity it was n't the devil himself instead of his fish ! ''
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 40]: `` Would n't it be a jolly lark , Mr. Vavasor , if some of the rascals down below were to heat that furnace too hot , and rid us of the whole potful at one fell swoop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 11]: `` What is that you are saying , Corney ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 11]: said his mother , who had but just rejoined them .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 25]: `` I was only uttering the pious wish that the devil was dead , '' answered Cornelius ; '' -- boiled like an octopus !
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 3]: ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 8]: `` What good would that do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 4]: said his father .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 17]: `` The human devils would be no better , and the place would soon be re-occupied .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 12]: The population of the pit must be kept up by immigration .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 27]: There may be babies born in heaven , for any thing I know , but certain I am there can be none in the other place .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 16]: This world of ours is the nursery of devils as well as of saints . ''
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 11]: `` And what becomes of those that are neither ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 3]: asked Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 15]: `` It were hard to say , '' replied Mr. Raymount with some seriousness .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 7]: `` A confoundedly peculiar family ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 5]: said Vavasor to himself .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 11]: `` There 's a bee in every bonnet of them !
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 24]: An odd , irreverent way the old fellow has with him -- for an old fellow pretending to believe what he says ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 60]: Vavasor was not one of the _ advanced _ of the age ; he did not deny there was a God : he thought that the worse form that it was common in the bank ; the fellows he associated with never took the trouble to deny him ; they took their own way , and asked no questions .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 28]: When a man has not the slightest intention that the answer shall influence his conduct , why should he inquire whether there be a God or not ?
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 23]: Vavasor cared more about the top of his cane than the God whose being he did not take the trouble to deny .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 63]: He believed a little less than the maiden aunt with whom he lived ; she believed less than her mother , and her mother had believed less than hers ; so that for generations the faith , so called , of the family had been dying down , simply because all that time it had sent out no fresh root of obedience .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 13]: It had in truth been no faith at all , only assent .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 31]: Miss Vavasor went to church because it was the right thing to do : God was one of the heads of society , and his drawing-rooms had to be attended .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 77]: Certain objections not altogether unreasonable might be urged against doing so : several fictions were more or less countenanced in them -- such as equality , love of your neighbor , and forgiveness of your enemy , but then nobody really heeded them : religion had worked its way up to a respectable position , and no longer required the support of the unwashed -- that is , those outside the circle whose center is May-fair .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 24]: As to her personal religion , why , God had heard her prayers , and might again : he did show favor occasionally .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 32]: That she should come out of it all as well as other people when this life of family and incomes and match-making was over , she saw no reason to doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 24]: Ranters and canters might talk as they pleased , but God knew better than make the existence of thoroughly respectable people quite unendurable !
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 31]: She was kind-hearted , and treated her maid like an equal up to the moment of offense -- then like a dog of the east up to that of atonement .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 42]: She had the power of keeping her temper even in family differences , and hence was regarded as a very model of wisdom , prudence and _ tact _ , the last far the first in the consideration of her judges .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 76]: The young of her acquaintance fled to her for help in need , and she gave them no hard words , but generally more counsel than comfort -- always , however , the best she had , which was of Polonius ' kind , an essence of wise selfishness , so far as selfishness can be wise , with a strong dash of self-respect , nowise the more sparing that it was independent of desert .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 51]: The good man would find it rather difficult to respect himself were he to try ; his gaze is upward to the one good ; but had it been possible for such a distinction to enter Miss Vavasor 's house , it would have been only to be straightway dismissed .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 22]: She was devoted to her nephew , as she counted devotion , but would see that he made a correspondent return .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 69]: When Vavasor reached their encampment in the Imperial Hotel , he went to his own room , got out his Russia-leather despatch-box , half-filled with songs and occasional verses , which he never travelled without , and set himself to see what he could do with the dog-fish -- in what kind of poetic jelly , that is , he could enclose his shark-like mouth and evil look .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 37]: But prejudiced as he always was in favor of whatever issued from his own brain -- as yet nothing had come from his heart -- he was anything but satisfied with the result of his endeavor .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 31]: It was , in fact , an utter failure so far as the dog-fish was concerned , for he was there unnamed , a mere indistinguishable presence among many monsters .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 39]: But notwithstanding the gravity of this defect , and the distance between his idea and its outcome , he yet concluded the homage to Hester which it embodied of a value to justify the presentation of the verses .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 17]: And poor as they were they were nearly as good as anything he had done hitherto .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 38]: Here they are : To H.R. Lo , Beauty climbs the watery steep , Sets foot on many a slimy stair ; Treads on the monsters of the deep , And rising seeks the earth and air .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 34]: On every form she sets her foot , She lifts it straight and passes on ; With flowers and trees she takes no root , This , that caresses , and is gone .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 30]: Imperfect , poorly lovely things On all sides round she sighing sees ; She flies , nor for her flying wings Finds any refuge , rest , or ease !
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 31]: At last , at last , on Burcliff 's shore , She spies a thoughtful wanderer ; She speeds -- she lights for evermore , Incorporated , one with her !
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 3]: CHAPTER VII .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 3]: AMY AMBER .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 28]: Some gentle crisis must have arrived in the history of Hester , for in these days her heart was more sensitive and more sympathetic than ever before .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 20]: The circumvolant troubles of humanity caught upon it as it it had been a thorn-bush , and hung there .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 52]: It was not greatly troubled , neither was its air murky , but its very repose was like a mother 's sleep which is no obstacle between the cries of her children and her sheltering soul : it was ready to wake at every moan of the human sea around her .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 36]: Unlike most women , she had not needed marriage and motherhood to open the great gate of her heart to her kind : I do not mean there are not many like her in this .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 39]: Why the tide of human affection should have begun to rise so rapidly in her just at this time , there is no need for conjecturing : much of every history must for the long present remain inexplicable .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 31]: No man creates his history any more than he creates himself ; he only modifies it -- sometimes awfully ; gathers to him swift help , or makes intervention necessary .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 19]: But the tide of which I speak flowed yet more swiftly from the night of the magic lantern .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 24]: That experience had been as a mirror in which she saw the misery of the low of her kind , including , alas !
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 4]: her brother Cornelius .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 48]: He had never before so plainly revealed to her his heartlessness , and the painful consequence of the revelation was , that now , with all her swelling love for human beings , she felt her heart shrink from him as if he were of another nature .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 60]: She could never indeed have loved him as she did but that , being several years his elder , she had had a good deal to do with him as baby and child : the infant motherhood of her heart had gathered about him , and not an eternity of difference could after that destroy the relation between them .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 31]: But as he grew up , the boy had undermined and weakened her affection , though hardly her devotion ; and now the youth had given it a rude shock .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 52]: So far was she , however , from yielding to this decay of feeling that it did not merely cause her much pain but gave rise in her to much useless endeavor ; while every day she grew more anxious and careful to carry herself toward him as a sister ought .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 57]: The Raymounts could not afford one of the best lodgings in Burcliff , and were well contented with a floor in an old house in an unfashionable part of the town , looking across the red roofs of the port , and out over the flocks of Neptune 's white sheep on the blue-gray German ocean .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 98]: It was kept by two old maids whose hearts had got flattened under the pressure of poverty -- no , I am wrong , it was not poverty , but _ care _ ; pure poverty never flattened any heart ; it is the care which poverty is supposed to justify that does the mischief ; it gets inside it and burrows , as well as lies on the top of it ; of mere outside poverty a heart can bear a mountainous weight without the smallest injury , yea with inestimable result of the only riches .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 30]: Our Lord never mentions poverty as one of the obstructions to his kingdom , neither has it ever proved such ; riches , cares and desires he does mention .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 52]: The sisters Witherspin had never yet suffered from the lack of a single necessary ; not the less they frayed their mornings , wore out their afternoons , scorched their evenings , and consumed their nights , in scraping together provision for an old age they were destined never to see .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 14]: They were a small meager pair , with hardly a smile between them .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 7]: One waited and the other cooked .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 36]: The one that waited had generally her chin tied up with a silk handkerchief , as if she had come to life again , but not quite , and could not do without the handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 26]: The other was rarely seen , but her existence was all day testified by the odors that ascended from the Tartarus of her ever-recurrent labors .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 19]: It was a marvel how from a region of such fumes could ascend the good dinners she provided .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 44]: The poor things of course had their weight on the mind of Hester , for , had they tried , they could not have hidden the fact that they lived to save : every movement almost , and certainly every tone betrayed it .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 28]: And yet , unlike so many lodging-house keepers , resembling more the lion-ant than any other of the symbolic world of insects , they were strictly honest .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 41]: Had they not been , I doubt if Hester would have been able , though they would then have needed more , to give them so much pity as she did , for she had a great scorn of dishonesty .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 37]: Her heart , which was full of compassion for the yielding , the weak , the erring , was not yet able to spend much on the actively vicious -- the dishonest and lying and traitorous .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 29]: The honor she paid the honesty of these women helped her much to pity the sunlessness of their existence , and the poor end for which they lived .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 46]: It looked as if God had forgotten them -- toiling for so little all day long , while the fact was they forgot God , and were thus miserable and oppressed because they would not have him interfere as he would so gladly have done .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 57]: Instead of seeking the kingdom of heaven , and trusting him for old age while they did their work with their might , they exhausted their spiritual resources in sending out armies of ravens with hardly a dove among them , to find and secure a future still submerged in the waves of a friendly deluge .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 26]: Nor was Hester 's own faith in God so vital yet as to propagate itself by division in the minds she came in contact with .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 12]: She could only be sorry for them and kind to them .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 38]: The morning after the visit to the aquarium , woeful Miss Witherspin , as Mark had epitheted her , entered to remove the ruins of breakfast with a more sad and injured expression of countenance than usual .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 17]: It was a glorious day , and she was like a live shadow in the sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 21]: Most of the Raymounts were already in the open air , and Hester was the only one in the room .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 60]: The small , round-shouldered , cadaverous creature went moving about the table with a motion that suggested bed as fitter than labor , though she was strong enough to get through her work without more than occasional suffering : if she could only have left pitying herself and let God love her she would have got on well enough .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 57]: Hester , who had her own share of the same kind of fault , was rather moodily trimming her mother 's bonnet with a new ribbon , glancing up from which she at once perceived that something in particular must have exceeded in wrongness the general wrongness of things in the poor little gnome 's world .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 23]: Her appearance was usually that of one with a headache ; her expression this morning suggested a mild indeed but all-pervading toothache .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 10]: `` Is anything the matter , Miss Witherspin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 3]: asked Hester .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 26]: `` Indeed , miss , there never come nothing to sister and me but it 's matter , and now it 's a sore matter .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 25]: But it 's the Lord 's will and we ca n't help it ; and what are we here for but to have patience ?
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 22]: That 's what I keep saying to my sister , but it do n't seem to do her much good . ''
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 40]: She ended with a great sigh ; and Hester thought if the unseen sister required the comfort of the one before her , whose evangel just uttered was as gloomy as herself , how very unhappy she must be .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 28]: `` No doubt we are here to learn patience , '' said Hester ; `` but I can hardly think patience is what we are made for .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 13]: Is there any fresh trouble -- if you will excuse me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 33]: `` Well , I do n't know , miss , as trouble can anyhow be called fresh -- leastways to us it 's stale enough ; we 're that sick of it !
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 17]: I declare to you , miss , I 'm clean worn out with havin ' patience !
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 49]: An ' now there 's my sister gone after her husband an ' left her girl , brought up in her own way an ' every other luxury , an ' there she 's come on our hands , an ' us to take the charge of her !
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 12]: It 's a responsibility will be the death of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 9]: `` Is there no provision for her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 9]: `` Oh , yes , there 's provision !
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 54]: Her mother kep a shop for fancy goods at Keswick -- after John 's death , that is -- an ' scraped together a good bit o ' money , they do say ; but that 's under trustees -- not a penny to be touched till the girl come of age ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 15]: `` But the trustees must make you a proper allowance for bringing her up !
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 9]: And anyhow you can refuse the charge . ''
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 10]: `` No , miss , that we ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 29]: It was always John 's wish when he lay a dyin ' , that if anything was to happen to Sarah , the child should come to us .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 41]: It 's the trouble of the young thing , the responsibility -- havin ' to keep your eyes upon her every blessed moment for fear she do the thing she ought not to -- that 's what weighs upon me .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 14]: Oh , yes , they 'll pay so much a quarter for her !
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 5]: it 's not that .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 34]: But to be always at the heels of a young , sly puss after mischief -- it 's more 'n I 'm equal to , I do assure you , Miss Raymount . ''
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 9]: `` When did you see her last ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 3]: inquired Hester .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 17]: `` Not once have I set eyes on her since she was three years old ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 17]: answered Miss Witherspin , and her tone seemed to imply in the fact yet additional wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 15]: `` Then perhaps she may be wiser by this time , '' Hester suggested .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 8]: `` How old is she now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 4]: `` Sixteen out .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 8]: It 's awful to think of ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 12]: `` But how do you know she will be so troublesome ?
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 10]: She may n't want the looking after you dread .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 10]: You have n't seen her for thirteen years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 7]: `` I 'm sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 7]: I know the breed , miss !
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 14]: She 's took after her mother , you may take your mortal oath !
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 9]: The sly way she got round our John !
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 19]: -- an ' all to take him right away from his own family as bore and bred him !
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 9]: You would n't believe it , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 13]: `` Girls are not always like their mothers , '' said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 12]: `` I 'm not half as good as my mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 6]: `` Bless you , miss !
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 17]: if she ai n't half as bad as hers -- the Lord have mercy upon us !
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 28]: How I 'm to attend to my lodgers and look after her , it 's more than I know how to think of it with patience . ''
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 7]: `` When is she coming ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 19]: `` She 'll be here this blessed day as I 'm speakin ' to you , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 19]: `` Perhaps , your house being full , you may find her a help instead of a trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 14]: It wo n't be as if she had nothing to employ her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 18]: `` There 's no good to mortal creature i ' the bones or blood of her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 16]: sighed Miss Witherspin , as she put the tablecloth on the top of the breakfast-things .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 31]: That blessed day the girl did arrive -- sprang into the house like a rather loud sunbeam -- loud for a sunbeam , not for a young woman of sixteen .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 89]: She was small , and bright , and gay , with large black eyes which sparkled like little ones as well as gleamed like great ones , and a miniature Greek face , containing a neat nose and a mouth the most changeable ever seen -- now a mere negation in red , and now long enough for sorrow to couch on at her ease -- only there was no sorrow near it , nor in its motions and changes much of any other expression than mere life .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 44]: Her hair was a dead brown , mistakable for black , with a burnt quality in it , and so curly , in parts so obstinately crinkly , as to suggest wool -- and negro blood from some far fount of tropic ardor .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 24]: Her figure was , if not essentially graceful yet thoroughly symmetrical , and her head , hands and feet were small and well-shaped .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 50]: Almost brought up in her mother 's shop , one much haunted by holiday-makers in the town , she had as little shyness as forwardness , being at once fearless and modest , gentle and merry , noiseless and swift -- a pleasure to eyes , nerves and mind .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 29]: The sudden apparition of her in a rose-bud print , to wait upon the Raymounts the next morning at breakfast , startled them all with a sweet surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 31]: Every time she left the room the talk about her broke out afresh , and Hester 's information concerning her was a welcome sop to the Cerberus of their astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 22]: A more striking contrast than that between her and her two aunts could hardly have been found in the whole island .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 12]: She was like a star between two gray clouds of twilight .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 20]: But she had not so much share in her own cheerfulness as her poor aunts had in their misery .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 9]: She so lived because she was so made .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 28]: She was a joy to others as well as to herself , but as yet she had no merit in her own peace or its rippling gladness .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 57]: So strong was the life in her that , although she cried every night over the loss of her mother , she was fresh as a daisy in the morning , opening like that to the sun of life , and ready not merely to give smile for smile , but to give smile for frown .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 44]: In a word she was one of those lovely natures that need but to recognize the eternal to fly to it straight ; but on the other hand such natures are in general very hard to wake to a recognition of the unseen .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 22]: They assent to every thing good , but for a long time seem unaware of the need of a perfect Father .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 18]: To have their minds opened to the truth , they must suffer like other mortals less amiable .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 26]: Suffering alone can develop in such any spiritual insight , or cause them to care that there should be a live God caring about them .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 12]: She was soon a favorite with every one of the family .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 7]: Mrs. Raymount often talked to her .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 71]: And on her side Amy Amber , which name , being neither crisp nor sparkling , but soft and mellow , did not seem quite to suit her , was so much drawn to Hester that she never lost an opportunity of waiting on her , and never once missed going to her room , to see if she wanted anything , last of all before she went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 22]: The only one of the family that professed not to `` think much of her , '' was the contemptuous Cornelius .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 51]: Even Vavasor , who soon became a frequent caller , if he chanced to utter some admiring word concerning the pretty deft creature that had just flitted from the room like a dark butterfly , would not in reply draw from him more than a grunt and a half sneer .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 29]: Yet now and then he might have been caught glowering at her , and would sometimes , seemingly in spite of himself , smile on her sudden appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 3]: CHAPTER VIII .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 4]: CORNELIUS AND VAVASOR .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 74]: From what I have written of him it may well seem as if such a cub were hardly worth writing about ; but if my reader had chanced to meet him first in other company than that of his own family , on every one of whom he looked down with a contempt which although slight was not altogether mild , he would have taken him for at least an agreeable young man .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 135]: He would then have perceived little or nothing of the look of doggedness and opposition he wore at home ; that would have been , all unconsciously , masked in a just unblown smile of general complaisance , ready to burst into full blossom for anyone who should address him ; while the rubbish he would then talk to ladies had a certain grace about it -- such as absolutely astonished Hester once she happened to overhear some of it , and set her wondering how the phenomenon was to be accounted for of the home-cactus blossoming into such a sweet company-flower -- wondering also which was the real Cornelius , he of the seamy side turned always to his own people , or he of the silken flowers and arabesques presented to strangers .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 43]: Analysis of anything he said would have certified little or nothing in it ; but that little or nothing was pleasantly uttered , and served perhaps as well as something cleverer to pass a faint electric flash between common mind and mind .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 53]: The slouch , the hands-in-pocket mood , the toe-and-heel oscillation upon the hearth-rug -- those flying signals that self was at home to nobody but himself , had for the time vanished ; desire to please had tied up the black dog in his kennel , and let the white one out .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 18]: By keeping close in the protective shadow of the fashion , he always managed to be well-dressed .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 37]: Ever since he went to the same tailor as Vavasor his coats had been irreproachable ; and why should not any youth pay just twice as much for his coats as his father does for his ?
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 29]: His shirt-studs were simplicity itself -- single pearls ; and he was very particular about both the quantity and the quality of the linen showing beyond his coat-cuffs .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 12]: Altogether he was nicely got up and pleasant to look upon .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 41]: Stupid as the conventional European dress is , its trimness and clear contrast of white and black tends to level up all to the appearance of gentlemen , and I suspect this may be the real cause of its popularity .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 30]: But I beg my reader to reflect before he sets Cornelius down as an exceptionally disagreeable young man because of the difference between his behavior at home and abroad .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 37]: I admit that his was a bad case , but in how many a family , the members of which are far from despising each other , does it not seem judged unnecessary to cultivate courtesy !
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 21]: Surely this could not be if a tender conscience of the persons and spiritual rights of others were not wanting .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 38]: If there be any real significance in politeness , if it be not a mere empty and therefore altogether hypocritical congeries of customs , it ought to have its birth , cultivation and chief exercise at home .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 24]: Of course there are the manners suitable to strangers and those suitable to intimates , but politeness is the one essential of both .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 14]: I would not let the smallest child stroke his father 's beard roughly .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 22]: Watch a child and when he begins to grow rough you will see an evil spirit looking out of his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 14]: It is a mean and bad thing to be ungentle with our own .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 10]: Politeness is either a true face or a mask .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 16]: If worn at one place and not at another , which of them is it ?
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 14]: And there were no mask if there ought not to be a face .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 10]: Neither is politeness at all inconsistent with thorough familiarity .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 21]: I will go farther and say , that no true , or certainly no profound familiarity is attainable without it .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 11]: The soul will not come forth to be roughly used .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 25]: And where truth reigns familiarity only makes the manners strike deeper root in the being , and take a larger share in its regeneration .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 26]: Amongst the other small gifts over which Cornelius was too tender to exhibit them at home , was a certain very small one of song .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 39]: How he had developed it would have been to the home-circle a mystery , but they did not even know that he possessed it , and the thought that they did not was a pleasant one to him .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 31]: For all his life he had loved vulgar mystery -- mystery , that is , without any mystery in it except what appearance of it may come of barren concealment .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 25]: He never came out with anything at home as to where he had been or what he was going to do or had done .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 30]: And he gloried specially in the thought that he could and did this or that of which neither the governor , the mater , nor Hester knew his capability .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 10]: He felt large and powerful and wise in consequence !
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 24]: and if he was only the more of a fool , what did it matter so long as he did not know it ?
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 46]: Rather let me ask what better was he , either for the accomplishment or the concealment of it , so long as it did nothing to uncover to him the one important fact , that its possessor was neither more nor less than a fool ?
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 66]: He had been now some eighteen months in the bank , and from the first Mr. Vavasor , himself not the profoundest of men , had been taken with the easy manners of the youth combined with his evident worship of himself , and having no small proclivity towards patronage , had allowed the aspirant to his favor to enter by degrees its charmed circle .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 30]: Gathering a certain liking for him , he began to make him an occasional companion for the evening , and at length would sometimes take him home with him .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 35]: There Cornelius at once laid himself out to please Miss Vavasor , and flattery went a long way with that lady , because she had begun to suspect herself no longer young or beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 19]: Her house was a dingy little hut in Mayfair , full of worthless pictures and fine old-fashioned furniture .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 57]: Any piece of this she would for a long time gladly have exchanged for a new one in the fashion , but as soon as she found such things themselves the fashion , her appreciation of them rose to such fervor that she professed an unchangeable preference for them over things of any modern style whatever .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 66]: Cornelius soon learned what he must admire and what despise if he would be in tune with Miss Vavasor , to the false importance of being one of whose courtiers he was so much alive that he counted it one of the most precious of his secrets ; none of his family had heard of Mr. Vavasor even , before the encounter at the aquarium .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 53]: From Miss Vavasor 's Cornelius had been invited to several other houses , and the consequence was that he looked from an ever growing height upon his own people , judging not one of them fit for the grand company to which his merits , unappreciated at home , had introduced him .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 72]: He began to take private lessons in dancing and singing , and as he possessed a certain natural grace , invisible when he was out of humor , but always appearing when he wanted to please , and a certain facility of imitation as well , he was soon able to dance excellently , and sing with more or less dullness a few songs of the sort fashionable at the time .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 33]: But he took so little delight in music or singing for its own sake that in any allusion to his sister 's practicing he would call it _ an infernal row _ .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 38]: He was not a little astonished , was perhaps a little annoyed at the impression made by his family in general , and Hester in particular , upon one in whose judgment he had placed unquestioning confidence .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 45]: Nor did he conceal from Vavasor his dissent from his opinion of them , for he felt that his friend 's admiration gave him an advantage -- not as member of such a family , but as the pooh-pooher of what his friend admired .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 36]: For did not his superiority to the admiration to which his friend yielded , stamp him in that one thing at least the superior of him who was his superior in so many other things ?
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 17]: To be able to look down where he looked up -- what was it but superiority ?
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 42]: `` My mother 's the best of the lot , '' he said : '' -- she 's the best woman in the world , I do believe ; but she 's nobody except at home -- do n't you know ?
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 8]: Look at her and your aunt together !
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 2]: Pooh !
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 19]: Because she 's my mother , that 's no reason why I should think royalty of her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 8]: `` What a cub it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 38]: said Vavasor to himself , almost using a worse epithet of the same number of letters , and straightway read him a lecture , well meant and shallow , on what was good form in a woman .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 30]: According to him , not the cub 's mother only , but Hester also possessed the qualities that went to the composition of this strange virtue in eminent degrees .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 32]: Cornelius continued his opposition , but modified it , for he could not help feeling flattered , and began to think a little more of his mother and of Hester too .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 32]: `` She 's a very good girl -- of her sort -- is Hester , '' he said ; `` I do n't require to be taught that , Mr. Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 7]: But she 's too awfully serious .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 14]: She 's in such earnest about everything -- you have n't an idea !
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 23]: One half-hour of her in one of her moods is enough to destroy a poor beggar 's peace of mind for ever .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 13]: And there 's no saying when the fit may take her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 3]: Vavasor laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 22]: But he said to himself `` there was stuff in her : what a woman might be made of her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 21]: To him she seemed fit -- with a little developing aid -- to grace the best society in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 51]: It was not polish she needed but experience and insight , thought Vavasor , who would have her learn to look on the world and its affairs as they saw them who by long practice had disqualified themselves for seeing them in any other than the artificial light of fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 60]: Thus early did Vavasor conceive the ambition of having a hand in the worldly education of this young woman , such a hand that by his means she should come to shine as she deserved in the only circle in which he thought shining worth any one 's while ; his reward should be to see her so shine .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 12]: Through his aunt he could gain her entrance where he pleased .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 18]: In relation to her and her people he seemed to himself a man of power and influence .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 11]: I wonder how Jesus Christ would carry himself in Mayfair .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 7]: Perhaps he would not enter it .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 30]: Perhaps he would only call to his own to come out of it , and turn away to go down among the money-lenders and sinners of the east end .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 5]: I am only wondering .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 17]: Hester took to Vavasor from the first , in an external , meet-and-part sort of fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 31]: His bearing was so dignified yet his manner so pleasing , that she , whose instinct was a little repellent , showed him nothing of that phase of her nature .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 17]: He roused none of that inclination to oppose which poor foolish Corney always roused in her .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 55]: He could talk well about music and pictures and novels and plays , and she not only let him talk freely , but was inclined to put a favorable interpretation upon things he said which she did not altogether like , trying to see only humor where another might have found heartlessness or cynicism .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 31]: For Vavasor , being in his own eyes the model of an honorable and well-behaved gentleman , had of course only the world 's way of regarding and judging things .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 59]: Had he been a man of fortune he would have given to charities with some freedom ; but , his salary being very moderate , and his aunt just a little stingy as he thought , he would not have denied himself the smallest luxury his means could compass , for the highest betterment of a human soul .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 39]: He would give a half-worn pair of gloves to a poor woman in the street , but not the price of the new pair he was on his way to buy to get her a pair of shoes .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 52]: It would have enlightened Hester a little about him to watch him for half an hour where he stood behind the counter of the bank : there he was the least courteous of proverbially discourteous bank-clerks , whose manners are about of the same breed with those of hotel-clerks in America .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 27]: It ought to be mentioned , however , that he treated those of his own social position in precisely the same way as less distinguished callers .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 62]: But he never forgot to take up his manners with his umbrella as he left the bank , and his airy , cheerful way of talking , which was more natural to him than his rudeness , coming from the same source that afforded the rimes he delighted in , sparkling pleasantly against the more somber texture of Hester 's consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 30]: She suspected he was no profound , but that was no reason why she should not be pleasant to him , and allow him to be pleasant to her .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 31]: So by the time Vavasor had spent three evenings with the Raymounts , Hester and he were on a standing of external intimacy , if there be such a relation .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 3]: CHAPTER IX .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 4]: SONGS AND SINGERS .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 26]: The evening before the return of Cornelius to London and the durance vile of the bank , Vavasor presented himself at the hour of family-tea .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 22]: Mr. Raymount 's work admitting of no late dinner , the evening of the rest of the family was the freer .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 33]: They occupied a tolerably large drawing-room , and as they had hired for the time a tolerably good piano , to it , when tea was over , Hester generally betook herself .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 56]: But this time Cornelius , walking up to it with his hands in his pockets , dropped on the piano-stool as if he had taken a fancy to it for a seat , and began to let his hands run over the keys as if to give the idea he could play if he would .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 38]: Amy Amber was taking away the tea-things and the rest were here and there about the room , Mr. Raymount and Vavasor talking on the hearth-rug -- for a moment ere the former withdrew to his study .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 15]: `` What a rose-diamond you have to wait on you , Mr. Raymount ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 3]: said Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 15]: `` If I were a painter I would have her sit to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 11]: `` And ruin the poor thing for any life-sitting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 18]: remarked Mr. Raymount rather gruffly , for he found that the easier way of speaking the truth .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 27]: He had thus gained a character for uncompromising severity , whereas it was but that a certain sort of cowardice made him creep into spiky armor .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 17]: He was a good man , who saw some truths clearly , and used them blunderingly .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 28]: `` I do n't see why that should follow , '' said Vavasor , in a softly drawling tone , the very reverse of his host 's .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 15]: Its calmness gave the impression of a wisdom behind it that had no existence .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 27]: `` If the girl is handsome , why should n't she derive some advantage from it -- and the rest of the world as well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 14]: `` Because , I say , she at least would derive only ruin .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 17]: She would immediately assume to herself the credit of what was offered only to her beauty .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 16]: It takes a lifetime , Mr. Vavasor , to learn where to pay our taxes .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 33]: If the penny with the image and superscription of Caesar has to be paid to Caesar , where has a face and figure like that of Amy Amber to be paid ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 18]: Vavasor did not reply : Mr. Raymount 's utterance may perhaps seem obscure to a better thinker .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 17]: He concluded merely that his host was talking for talk 's sake , so talking rubbish .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 11]: The girl came in again , and the conversation dropped .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 12]: Mr. Raymount went to his writing , Vavasor toward the piano .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 25]: Willing to please Cornelius , whom he almost regarded with a little respect now that he had turned out brother to such a sister .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 19]: `` Sing the song you gave us the other night at our house , '' he said carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 7]: Hester could hardly credit her hearing .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 17]: Still more astonished was she when Cornelius actually struck a few chords and began to sing .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 29]: The song was one of those common drawing-room ones more like the remnants of a trifle the day after a party than any other dish for human use .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 77]: But there was one mercy in it : the words and the music went together in a perfect concord of weak worthlessness ; and Hester had not to listen , with the miserable feeling that rude hands were pulling at the modest garments of her soul , to a true poem set to the music of a scrannel pipe of wretched straw , whose every tone and phrase choked the divine bird caged in the verse .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 22]: Cornelius sang like a would-be singer , a song written by a would-be poet , and set by a would-be musician .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 10]: Verve was there none in the whole ephemeral embodiment .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 28]: When it died a natural death , if that be possible where never had been any life , Vavasor said , `` Thank you , Raymount . ''
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 43]: But Hester , who had been standing with her teeth clenched under the fiery rain of discords , wrong notes , and dislocated rhythm , rushed to the piano with glowing cheeks and tear-filled eyes , and pushed Cornelius off the stool .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 30]: The poor weak fellow thought she was acting the sentimental over the sudden outburst of his unsuspected talent , and recovering himself stood smiling at her with affected protest .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 4]: `` Corney ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 20]: she cried -- and the faces of the two were a contrast worth seeing -- `` you disgrace yourself !
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 18]: any one who can sing at all should be ashamed to sing no better than that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 39]: Then feeling that she ought not to be thus carried away , or quench with such a fierce lack of sympathy the smoking flax of any endowment , she threw her arms round his neck and kissed him .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 35]: He received her embrace like the bear he was ; the sole recognition he showed was a comically appealing look to Vavasor intended to say , `` You see how the women use me !
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 9]: They trouble me , but I submit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 6]: `` You naughty boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 53]: Hester went on , much excited , and speaking with great rapidity , `` you never let me suspect you could sing any more than a frog -- toad , I mean , for a frog does sing after his own rather monotonous fashion , and you do n't sing much better !
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 18]: Listen to me , and I will show you how the song ought to have been sung .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 37]: It 's not worth a straw , and it 's a shame to sing it , but if it be sung at all , it might as well be sung as well as it might ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 9]: So saying she seated herself at the piano .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 26]: This convulsion was in Hester 's being a phenomenon altogether new , for never before had she been beside herself in the presence of another .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 37]: She gazed for a moment at the song on the rest before her , then summoned as with a command the chords which Corney had seemed to pick up from among his feet , and began .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 28]: The affect of her singing upon the song was as if the few poor shivering plants in the garden of March had every one blossomed at once .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 114]: The words and music both were in truth as worthless as she had said ; but they were words , and it was music , and words have always some meaning , and tones have always some sweetness ; all the meaning and all the sweetness in the song Hester laid hold of , drew out , made the best of ; while all the feeble element of the dramatic in it she forced , giving it an expression far beyond what could have been in the mind of the writer capable of such inadequate utterance -- with the result that it was a different song altogether from that which Cornelius had sung .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 60]: She gave the song such a second birth , indeed , that a tolerable judge might have taken it , so hearing it for the first time , for what it was not -- a song with some existence of its own , some distinction from a thousand other wax flowers dipped in sugar-water for the humming-birds of society .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 21]: The moment she ended , she rose ashamed , and going to the window looked out over the darkening sea .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 8]: Vavasor had not heard her sing before .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 74]: He did not even know she cared for music ; for Hester , who did not regard her faculty as an accomplishment but as a gift , treated it as a treasure to be hidden for the day of the Lord rather than a flag to be flaunted in a civic procession -- was jealously shy over it , as a thing it would be profanation to show to any but loving eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 52]: To utter herself in song to any but the right persons , except indeed it was for some further and higher end justifying the sacrifice , appeared to her a kind of immodesty , a taking of her heart from its case , and holding it out at arm 's length .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 8]: He was astonished and yet more delighted .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 9]: He was in the presence of a power !
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 10]: But all he knew of power was in society-relations .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 29]: It was not a spirit of might he recognized , for the opening of minds and the strengthening of hearts , but an influence of pleasing for self-aggrandizement .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 34]: Feeling it upon himself , he thought of it in its operation upon others , and was filled with a respect rising almost to the height of what reverence he was capable of .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 26]: He followed her swiftly to the window , and through the gathering shadows of the evening she saw his eyes shine as he addressed her .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 38]: `` I hardly know what I am about , Miss Raymount , '' he said , `` except that I hear my own voice daring to address the finest non-professional singer I have ever yet heard . ''
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 70]: Hester , to her own disgust and annoyance , felt her head give itself a toss she had never intended ; but it was a true toss nevertheless , for she neither liked having attracted his admiration by such a song , nor the stress he laid on the word _ non-professional _ : did it not imply that she was not songstress enough for the profession of song ?
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 20]: `` Excuse me , Mr. Vavasor , but how do you know I am not a professional singer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 6]: she said with some haughtiness .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 24]: `` Had you been , '' answered Vavasor with concealed caution , `` I should have learned the fact from your brother . ''
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 14]: `` Have you learned from him that I could sing at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 16]: `` To confess the strange truth , he never told me you were musical . ''
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 5]: `` Very well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 7]: `` I beg your pardon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 17]: `` I mean , how then do you know I am not a professional singer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 9]: `` All London would have known it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 39]: This second reply , better conceived , soothed Hester 's vanity -- of which she had more than was good for her , seeing the least speck of it in the noblest is a fly in the cream .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 49]: `` What would you say , '' she rejoined , `` if Corney were to tell to you that the reason of his silence was that , while I was in training , we judged it more prudent , with possible failure ahead , to be silent ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 38]: `` I should say you cherished a grand ambition , and one in which you could not fail of success , '' replied Vavasor , who began to think she was leading him gently to the truth .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 15]: But Hester was in a wayward mood , and inclined to _ prospect _ .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 39]: `` Suppose such was not really Corney 's reason , '' she resumed , `` but that he thought it degraded him to be the brother of an intended professional -- what would you say to that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 10]: `` I should tell him he was a fool .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 33]: He can not know his Burke , '' he added laughingly , `` to be ignorant of the not inconsiderable proportion of professional blood mixed with the blue in our country . ''
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 16]: It was not in Vavasor 's usual taste : he had forgotten his best manners .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 28]: But in truth he never had any best manners : comparatively few have anything but second-best , as the court of the universe will one day reveal .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 18]: Hester did not like the remark , and he fancied from her look she had misunderstood him .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 21]: `` Many a singer and actress too has married a duke or a marquis , '' he supplemented in explanation .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 10]: `` What sort of a duke or marquis ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 9]: asked Hester , in a studiedly wooden way .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 13]: `` It was the more shame to them , '' she added .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 4]: `` Pardon me .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 34]: I can not allow that it would be any shame to the best of our nobility -- '' `` I beg your pardon -- I meant to the professionals , '' interrupted Hester .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 4]: Vavasor was posed .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 19]: To her other eccentricities it seemed Miss Raymount added radicalism -- and that not of the palest pink !
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 27]: But happily for him , Cornelius , who had been all the time making noises on the piano , at this point appeared at the window .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 14]: `` Come , Hetty , '' he said , `` sing that again .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 10]: I shall sing it ever so much better after !
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 9]: Come , I will play the accompaniment . ''
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 7]: `` It 's not worth singing .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 13]: It would choke me -- poor , vapid , vulgar thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 6]: `` Hullo , sis ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 22]: cried Cornelius ; `` it 's hardly civil to use such words about any song a fellow cares to sing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 33]: Hester 's sole answer was a smile , in which , and I am afraid it was really there , Vavasor read contempt , and liked her none the worse for it .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 48]: Cornelius turned in offense , went back to the piano , and sang the song again -- not one hair better -- in just the same nerveless , indifferent fashion as before ; for how shall one who has no soul , put soul into a song ?
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 11]: Mrs. Raymount was sitting at the fireside with her embroidery .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 27]: She had not spoken since tea , but now she called Hester , and said to her quietly -- `` Do n't provoke him , Hester .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 17]: I am more than delighted to find he has begun to take an interest in music .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 10]: It is a taste that will grow upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 20]: Coax him to let you teach him -- and bear with him if he should sing out of tune .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 7]: -- It is nothing wicked ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 6]: she added with a mother-smile .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 4]: Hester was silent .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 9]: Her conscience rebuked her more than her heart .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 23]: She went up to him and said -- `` Corney , dear , let me find you a song worth singing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 10]: `` A girl ca n't choose for a man .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 17]: You 're sure to fix on some sentimental stuff or other not fit to sing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 7]: `` My goodness , Corney ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 17]: cried Hester , `` what do you call the song you 've just been singing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 16]: In the days when my heart was aching Like the shell of an overtuned lyre .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 3]: `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 3]: ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 44]: She laughed prettily , not scornfully , then striking an attitude of the mock heroic , added , on the spur of the moment -- `` And the oven was burning , not baking , The tarts of my soul 's desire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 34]: -- for at the moment one of those fumes the kitchen was constantly firing at the drawing-room , came storming up as if a door had been suddenly opened in yet lower regions .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 33]: Cornelius was too much offended and self-occupied to be amused , but both Mrs. Raymount and Vavasor laughed , the latter recognizing in Hester 's extemporization a vein similar to his own .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 24]: But Hester was already searching , and presently found a song to her mind -- one , that was , fit for Cornelius .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 26]: `` Come now , Corney , '' she said ; `` here is a song I should like you to be able to sing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 64]: With that she turned to the keys , and sang a spirited ballad , of which the following was the first stanza : This blow is for my brother : You lied away his life ; This for his weeping mother , This for your own sweet wife ; For you told that lie of another To pierce her heart with its knife .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 28]: And now indeed the singer was manifest ; genius was plainly the soul of her art , and her art the obedient body to the informing genius .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 25]: Vavasor was utterly enchanted , but too world-eaten to recognize the soul she almost waked in him for any other than the old one .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 13]: Her mother thought she had never heard her sing so splendidly before .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 49]: The ballad was of a battle between two knights , a good and a bad -- something like Browning 's _ Count Gismond _ : the last two lines of it were -- So the lie went up in the face of heaven And melted in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 23]: When Hester had sung these , she rose at once , her face white , her mouth set and her eyes gleaming .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 42]: Vavasor felt _ almost _ as if he were no longer master of himself , _ almost _ as if he would have fallen down to kiss the hem of her garment , had he but dared to go near her .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 22]: But she walked from the room vexed with the emotion she was unable to control , and did not again appear .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 11]: The best thing in Vavasor was his love of music .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 40]: He had cultivated not a little what gift he had , but it was only a small power , not of production , but of mere reproduction like that of Cornelius , though both finer and stronger in quality .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 18]: He did not really believe in music -- he did not really believe in anything except himself .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 52]: He professed to adore it , and imagined he did , because his greatest pleasure lay in hearing his own verses well sung by a pretty girl who would now and then steal , or try to steal , a glance at the poet from under her eyelids as she sang .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 69]: On his way home he brooded over the delight of having his best songs sung by such a singer as Hester ; and from that night fancied he had received a new revelation of what music was and could do , confessing to himself that a similar experience within the next fortnight would send him over head and ears in love with Hester -- which must not be !
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 38]: Cornelius went half way with him , and to his questions arising from what Miss Raymount had said about the professional , assured him , ` pon honor , that that was all Hester 's nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 10]: _ She _ in training for a public singer !
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 21]: -- But there 's nothing she likes better than taking a rise out of a fellow , '' said Cornelius .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 22]: `` She would as soon think of singing in public as of taking a bar-maid 's place in a public-house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 20]: `` But why did you never tell me your sister was such an awful swell of a singer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 3]: asked Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 6]: `` Do you think so ?
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 8]: She ought to feel very much flattered !
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 7]: Why I did n't tell you ?
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 8]: -- Oh , I do n't know !
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 9]: I never heard her sing like that before .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 7]: Upon my word I never did .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 9]: I suppose it was because you were there .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 11]: A brother 's nobody , do n't you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 10]: This flattered Vavasor , as how should it not ?
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 45]: and without the least idea of whither the spirit in the feet of his spirit was leading him , he went as often to the Raymounts ' lodging as for very shame of intrusion he dared -- that is , all but every night .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 47]: But having , as he thought , discovered and learned thoroughly to understand her special vein , as he called it , he was careful not to bring any of his own slight windy things of leaf-blowing songs under Hester 's notice -- not , alas !
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 39]: that he thought them such , but that he judged it prudent to postpone the pleasure : she would require no small amount of training before she could quite enter into the spirit and special merit of them !
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 115]: In the meantime as he knew a good song sometimes when he saw it , always when he heard her sing it , never actually displeased her with any he did bring under her notice , had himself a very tolerable voice , and was capable of managing it with taste and judgment , also of climbing upon the note itself to its summit , and of setting right with facility any fault explained to him , it came about by a scale of very natural degrees , that he found himself by and by , not a little to his satisfaction , in the relation to her of a pupil to a teacher .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 47]: Hester in truth gave herself a good deal of trouble with him , in the endeavor , by no means an unsuccessful one , to improve the quality of his singing -- his style , his expression , and even his way of modeling his tones .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 44]: The relation between them became therefore one which , had it then lasted , might have soon led to something like genuine intimacy -- at least to some truer notion on the part of each of the kind of being the other was .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 58]: But the day of separation arrived first ; and it was only on his way back to London that Vavasor began to discover what a hold the sister of his fellow-clerk had taken of his thoughts and indeed of his heart -- of the existence of which organ he had never before had any very convincing proof .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 15]: All the time he had not once brought his aunt and the Raymounts together .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 6]: CHAPTER X. HESTER AND AMY .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 22]: Hester did not miss Vavasor quite so much as he hoped she might , or as perhaps he believed she did .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 36]: She had been interested in him mainly because she found him both receptive and capable of development in the matter of music -- ready to understand , that is , and willing to be taught .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 64]: To have such a man listen with respect to every word she said , never denying , defending or justifying what she might point out as a fault , but setting himself at once to the correction of the same , and in general with some measure of immediate success , could not fail to be not merely pleasant but flattering to her .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 78]: Brothers , I suspect , have a good deal to answer for in the estimation of men by their sisters ; their behavior at home leads them to prize the civilities of other men more highly than they deserve ; brothers , I imagine , have therefore more to do than they will like to learn , with the making of those inferior men acceptable to their sisters , whose very presence is to themselves an annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 12]: Women so seldom see a noble style of behavior at home !
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 30]: -- so few are capable of distinguishing between ceremony and courtesy between familiarity and rudeness -- of dismissing ceremony and retaining courtesy , of using familiarity and banishing rudeness !
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 36]: The nearer persons come to each other , the greater is the room and the more are the occasions for courtesy ; but just in proportion to their approach the gentleness of most men diminishes .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 40]: Some will make the poor defense that it is unmanly to show one 's feelings : it is unmanly , because conceited and cowardly to hide them , if , indeed , such persons have anything precious to hide .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 28]: Other some will say , `` Must I weigh my words with my familiar friend as if I had been but that moment presented to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 41]: I answer , It were small labor well spent to see that your coarse-grained evil self , doomed to perdition , shall not come between your friend and your true , noble , humble self , fore-ordained to eternal life .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 56]: The Father can not bear rudeness in his children any more than wrong : -- my comparison is unfit , for rudeness is a great and profound wrong , and that to the noblest part of the human being , while a mere show of indifference is sometimes almost as bad as the rudest words .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 24]: And these are of those faults of which the more guilty a man is , the less is he conscious of the same .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 9]: Vavasor did not move the deepest in Hester .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 4]: How should he ?
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 9]: With that deepest he had no developed relation .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 28]: There were worlds of thought and feeling already in motion in Hester 's universe , while the vaporous mass in him had hardly yet begun to stir .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 78]: To use another simile , he was living on the surface of his being , the more exposed to earthquake and volcanic eruption that he had never yet suspected the existence of the depths profound whence they rise , while she was already a discoverer in the abysses of the nature gradually yet swiftly unfolding in her -- every discovery attended with fresh light for the will , and a new sense of power in the consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 14]: When Vavasor was gone she turned with greater diligence to her musical studies .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 25]: Amy Amber continued devoted to her , and when she was practicing would hover about her as often and as long as she could .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 11]: Her singing especially seemed to enchant and fascinate the girl .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 12]: But a change had already begun to show itself in her .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 27]: The shadow of an unseen cloud was occasionally visible on her forehead , and unmistakable pools were left in her eyes by the ebb-tide of tears .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 16]: In her service , notwithstanding , she was nowise less willing , scarcely less cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 18]: The signs of her discomfort grew deeper , and showed themselves oftener as the days went on .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 18]: She moved about her work with less elasticity , and her smile did not come so quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 16]: Both Hester and her mother saw the change , and marked even an occasional frown .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 26]: In the morning , when she was always the first up , she was generally cheerful , but as the day passed the clouds came .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 10]: Happily , however , her diligence did not relax .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 20]: Sound in health , and by nature as active as cheerful , she took a positive delight in work .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 12]: Doing was to her as natural as singing to the birds .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 24]: In a household with truth at the heart of it she would have been invaluable , and happy as the day was long .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 13]: As it was , she was growing daily less and less happy .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 15]: One night she appeared in Hester 's room as usual before going to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 25]: The small , neat face had lost for the time a great part of its beauty , and was dark as a little thunder-cloud .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 30]: Its black , shadowy brows were drawn together over its luminous black eyes ; its red lips were large and pouting , and their likeness to a rosebud gone .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 29]: Its cheeks were swollen , and its whole aspect revealed the spirit of wrath roused at last , and the fire alight in the furnace of the bosom .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 19]: She tried to smile , but what came was the smile of a wound rather than a mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 5]: `` My poor Amy !
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 6]: what is the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 20]: cried Hester , sorry , but hardly surprised ; for plainly things had been going from bad to worse .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 10]: The girl burst into a passionate fit of weeping .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 46]: She threw herself in wild abandonment on the floor , and sobbed ; then , as if to keep herself from screaming aloud , stuffed her handkerchief into her mouth , kicked with her little feet , and beat her little hands on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 25]: She was like a child in a paroxysm of rage -- only that with her its extravagance came of the effort to overcome it .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 12]: `` Amy , dear , you must n't be naughty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 14]: said Hester , kneeling down beside her and taking hold of her arm .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 25]: `` I 'm not naughty , miss -- at least I am doing all I can to get over it , '' she sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 73]: Thereupon she ceased suddenly , and sitting up on the floor , her legs doubled under her in eastern fashion , looked straight at Hester , and said thoughtfully , as if the question had just come , with force to make her forget the suffering she was in -- `` I _ should _ like to know how you would do in my place -- that I should , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 24]: The words spoken , her eyes fell , and she sat still as a statue , seeming steadfastly to regard her own lap .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 27]: `` I am afraid , if I were in your place , I should do nothing so well as you , Amy , '' said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 11]: `` But come , tell me what is the matter .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 9]: What puts you in such a misery ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 16]: `` Oh , it 's not one thing nor two things nor twenty things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 12]: answered Amy , looking sullen with the feeling of heaped-up wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 14]: `` What _ would _ my mother say to see me served so !
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 11]: _ She _ used to trust me everywhere and always !
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 23]: I do n't understand how those two prying suspicious old maids _ can _ be _ my _ mother 's sisters ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 11]: She spoke slowly and sadly , without raising her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 14]: `` Do n't they behave well to you , my poor child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 3]: said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 98]: `` It 's not , '' returned Amy , `` that they watch every bit I put in my mouth -- I do n't complain of that , for they 're poor -- at least they 're always saying so , and of course they want to make the most of me ; but not to be trusted one moment out of their sight except they know exactly where I am -- to be always suspected , and followed and watched , and me working my hardest -- that 's what drives me wild , Miss Raymount .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 30]: I 'm afraid they 'll make me hate them out and out -- and them my own flesh and blood , too , which ca n't but be wicked !
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 17]: I bore it very well for a while , for at first it only amused me .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 14]: I said to myself , ` They 'll soon know me better ! '
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 44]: But when I found they only got worse , I got tired of it altogether ; and when I got tired of it I got cross , and grew more and more cross , till now I ca n't _ bear _ it .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 20]: I 'm not used to be cross , and my own crossness is much harder to bear than theirs .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 35]: If I could have kept the good temper people used to praise me for to my mother , I should n't mind ; but it _ is _ hard to lose it this way !
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 11]: I do n't know how to get on without it !
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 22]: If there do n't come a change somehow soon , I shall run away -- I shall indeed , Miss Raymount .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 19]: There are many would be glad enough to have me for the work I can get through . ''
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 32]: She jumped to her feet , gave a little laugh , merry-sad , and before Hester could answer her , said -- `` You 're going away so soon , miss !
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 7]: Let me do your hair to-night .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 12]: I want to brush it every night till you go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 11]: `` But you are tired , my poor child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 4]: said Hester compassionately .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 32]: `` Not too tired for that : it will rest me , and bring back my good temper , It will come to me again through your hair , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 24]: `` No , no , Amy , '' said Hester , a little conscience-stricken , `` you ca n't have any of mine .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 6]: I have none to spare .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 10]: You will rather brush some into me , Amy .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 10]: But do what you like with my hair . ''
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 46]: As Amy lovingly combed and brushed the long , wavy overflow of Hester 's beauty , Hester tried to make her understand that she must not think of good-temper and crossness merely as things that could be put into her and taken out of her .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 84]: She tried to make her see that nothing really our own can ever be taken from us by any will or behavior of another ; that Amy had had a large supply of good-temper laid ready to her hand , but that it was not hers until she had made it her own by choosing and willing to be good-tempered when she was disinclined -- holding it fast with the hand of determination when the hand of wrong would snatch it from her .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 118]: `` Because I have a book on my shelves , '' she said , `` it is not therefore mine ; when I have read and understood it , then it is a little mine ; when I love it and do what it tells me , then it is altogether mine : it is like that with a good temper : if you have it sometimes , and other times not , then it is not yours ; it lies in you like that book on my table -- a thing priceless were it your own , but as it is , a thing you ca n't keep even against your poor weak old aunts . ''
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 17]: As she said all this , Hester felt like a hypocrite , remembering her own sins .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 23]: Amy Amber listened quietly , brushing steadily all the time , but scarcely a shadow of Hester 's meaning crossed her mind .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 33]: If she was in a good temper , she was in a good temper ; if she was in a bad temper , why there she was , she and her temper !
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 43]: She had not a notion of the possibility of having a hand in the making of her own temper -- not a notion that she was in any manner or measure accountable in regard to the temper she might find herself in .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 35]: Could she have been persuaded to attempt to overcome it , the moment she failed , as of course every one will many times , Amy would have concluded the thing required an impossibility .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 23]: Yet the effort she made , and with success , to restrain the show of her anger , was far from slight .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 26]: But for this , there would , long ere now , have been rain and wind , thunder and lightning between her and her aunts .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 49]: She was alive without the law , not knowing what mental conflict was ; the moment she recognized that she was bound to conquer herself , she would die in conscious helplessness , until strength and hope were given her from the well of the one pure will .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 19]: Hester kissed her , and though she had not understood , she went to bed a little comforted .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 24]: When the Raymounts departed , two or three days after , they left her at the top of the cliff-stair , weeping bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 3]: CHAPTER XI .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 3]: AT HOME .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 30]: When the Raymounts reached London , hardly taking time to unpack her box , Hester went to see her music-mistress , and make arrangement for re-commencing study with her .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 41]: Miss Dasomma was one of God 's angels ; for if he makes his angels winds , and his ministers a flaming fire , much more are those live fountains which carry his gifts to their thirsting fellows his angels .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 45]: Meeting not very rarely with vulgar behavior in such as regarded her from the heights of rank or money , she was the more devoted to a pupil who looked up to her as she deserved , recognizing in her a power of creation .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 46]: Of Italian descent , of English birth , and of German training , she had lived in intimacy with some of the greatest composers of her day , but the enthusiasm for her art which possessed her was mainly the outcome of her own genius .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 32]: Hence it was natural that she should exercise a forming influence on every pupil at all worthy of her , and without her Hester could never have become what she was .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 67]: For not merely had she opened her eyes to a vision of Music in something of her essential glory , but , herself capable of the hardest and truest work , had taught her the absolute necessity of labor to one who would genuinely enjoy , not to say cause others to enjoy , what the masters in the art had brought out of the infinite .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 34]: Hester had doubtless heard and accepted the commonplaces so common concerning the dignity and duty of labor -- as if labor mere were anything irrespective of its character , its object and end !
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 105]: but without Miss Dasomma she would not have learned that Labor is grand officer in the palace of Art ; that at the root of all ease lies slow , and , for long , profitless-seeming labor , as at the root of all grace lies strength ; that ease is the lovely result of forgotten toil , sunk into the spirit , and making it strong and ready ; that never worthy improvisation flowed from brain of poet or musician unused to perfect his work with honest labor ; that the very disappearance of toil is by the immolating hand of toil itself .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 34]: He only who bears his own burden can bear the burden of another ; he only who has labored shall dwell at ease , or help others from the mire to the rock .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 29]: Miss Dasomma was ready to begin at once , and Hester gradually increased her hours of practice , till her mother interfered lest she should injure her health .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 41]: But there was in truth little danger , for Hester was forcing nothing -- only indulging to the full her inclination , eager to perfect her own delight , and the more eager that she was preparing delight for others .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 44]: They had not been home more than a week , when one Sunday morning , that is at four o'clock in the afternoon , Mr. Vavasor called -- which was not quite agreeable to Mrs. Raymount , who liked their Sundays kept quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 9]: He was shown to Mr. Raymount 's study .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 38]: `` I am sorry , '' he said , `` to call on a Sunday , but I am not so enviably situated as you , Mr. Raymount ; I have not my time at my command .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 7]: When other people make their calls .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 6]: I am a prisoner . ''
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 21]: He spoke as if his were an exceptional case , and the whole happy world beside reveled in morning calls .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 25]: Mr. Raymount was pleased with him afresh , for he spoke modestly , with implicit acknowledgment of the superior position of the elder man .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 32]: They fell to talking of the prominent question of the day , and Mr. Raymount was yet more pleased when he found the young aristocrat ready to receive enlightenment upon it .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 56]: But the fact was that Vavasor cared very little about the matter , and had a facility for following where he was led ; and , always preferring to make himself agreeable where there was no restraining reason , why should he not gratify the writer of articles by falling in with what he advanced ?
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 45]: He had a light , easy way of touching on things , as if all his concessions , conclusions , and concurrences were merest matter of course ; and thus making himself appear master of the situation over which he merely skimmed on insect-wing .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 46]: Mr. Raymount took him not merely for a man of thought but one of some originality even -- capable at least of forming an opinion of his own , as is , he was in the habit of averring , not one in ten thousand .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 36]: In relation to the wider circle of the country , Mr. Vavasor was so entirely a nobody , that the acquaintance of a writer even so partially known as Mr. Raymount was something to him .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 59]: There is a tinselly halo about the writer of books that affects many minds the most _ practical _ , so called ; they take it to indicate power , which , with most , means ability in the direction of one 's own way , or his party 's , and so his own in the end .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 59]: Since his return he had instituted inquiries concerning Mr. Raymount , and finding both him and his family in good repute , complained of indeed as exclusive , he had told his aunt as much concerning them as he judged prudent , hinting it would give him pleasure if she should see fit to call upon Mrs. Raymount .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 26]: Miss Vavasor being , however , naturally jealous of the judgment of young men , pledged herself to nothing , and made inquiries for herself .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 95]: Learning thereby at length , after much resultless questioning -- for her world but just touched in its course the orbit of that of the Raymounts -- that there was rather a distinguished-looking girl in the family , and having her own ideas for the nephew whose interests she had , for the sake of the impending title made her own , she delayed and put off and talked the thing over , and at last let it rest ; while he went the oftener to see the people she thus declined calling upon .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 21]: On this his first visit he stayed the evening , and was afresh installed as a friend of the family .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 78]: Although it was Sunday , and her ideas also a little strict as to religious proprieties , Hester received him cordially where her mother received him but kindly ; and falling into the old ways , he took his part in the hymns , anthems , and what other forms of sacred music followed the family-tea : and so the evening passed without irksomeness -- nor the less enjoyably that Cornelius was spending it with a friend .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 15]: The tone , expression , and power of Hester 's voice astonished Vavasor afresh .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 28]: He was convinced , and told her so , that even in the short time since he heard it last , it had improved in all directions .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 85]: And when , after they had had enough of singing , she sat down and extemporized in a sacred strain , turning the piano almost into an organ with the sympathy of her touch , and weaving holy airs without end into the unrolling web of her own thought , Vavasor was so moved as to feel more kindly disposed toward religion -- by which he meant `` going to church , and all that sort of thing , do n't you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 8]: -- than ever in his life before .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 38]: He did not call the next Sunday , but came on the Saturday ; and the only one present who was not pleased with him was Miss Dasomma , who happened also to spend the evening there .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 23]: I have already represented Hester 's indebtedness to her teacher as such that therein she would be making discoveries all her life .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 50]: Devout as well as enthusiastic , human as well as artistic , she was not an angel of music only , but had for many years been a power in the family for good -- as indeed in every family in which she counted herself doing anything worth doing .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 30]: Much too generous and helpful to have saved money , she was now , in middle age , working as hard as she had ever worked in her youth .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 49]: Not a little experienced in the ways of the world , and possessing a high ideal in the memories of a precious friendship , against which to compare the ways of smaller mortals , she did not find her atmosphere gladdened by the presence of Mr. Vavasor 's .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 27]: With tact enough to take his cue from the family , he treated her with studious politeness ; but Miss Dasomma did not like Mr. Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 39]: She had to think before she could tell why , for there is a spiritual instinct also , which often takes the lead of the understanding , and has to search and analyze itself for its own explanation .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 64]: But the question once roused , she prosecuted it , and in the shadow of a curtain , while Hester was playing , watched his countenance , trying to read it -- to read , that is , what the owner of that face never meant to write , but could no more help writing there than he could help having a face .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 27]: What a man is lies as certainly upon his countenance as in his heart , though none of his acquaintance may be able to read it .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 12]: Their very intercourse with him may have rendered it more difficult .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 21]: Miss Dasomma 's conclusion was , that Vavasor was a man of good instincts -- as perhaps who is not ?
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 42]: -- but without moral development , pleased with himself , and not undesirous of pleasing others consistently with his idea of dignity -- at present more than moderately desirous of pleasing Hester Raymount , therefore showing to the best possible advantage .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 23]: `` But , '' thought Miss Dasomma , `` if this be his best , what may not his worst be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 50]: That he had no small capacity for music was plain , but if , as she judged , the faculty was unassociated in him with truth of nature , that was so much to the other side of his account , inasmuch as it rendered him the more dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 33]: For , at Hester 's feet in the rare atmosphere and faint twilight of music , how could he fail to impress her with an opinion of himself more favorable than just ?
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 49]: To interfere , however , where was no solid ground , would be to waste the power that might be of use ; but she was confident that if for a moment Hester saw him as she did , she could no more look on him with favor .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 41]: At the same time she did not think he could be meaning more than the mere passing of his time agreeably ; she knew well the character of his aunt , and the relation in which he stood to her .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 20]: In any case she could for the present only keep a gentle watch over the mind of her pupil .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 15]: But that pupil had a better protection in the sacred ambition stirring in her .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 19]: Concerning that she had not as yet held communication even with the one best able to understand it .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 24]: For Hester had already had sufficient experience to know that it is a killing thing to talk about what you mean to do .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 31]: It is to let the wind in upon a delicate plant , requiring a long childhood under glass , open to sun and air , closed to wind and frost .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 3]: CHAPTER XII .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 3]: A BEGINNING .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 43]: The Raymounts lived in no fashionable or pseudo-fashionable part of London , but in a somewhat peculiar house , though by no means such outwardly , in an old square in the dingy , smoky , convenient , healthy district of Bloomsbury .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 44]: One of the advantages of this position to a family with soul in it , that strange essence which _ will _ go out after its kind , was , that on two sides at least it was closely pressed by poor neighbors .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 24]: Artisans , small tradespeople , out-door servants , poor actors and actresses lived in the narrow streets thickly branching away in certain directions .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 73]: Hence , most happily for her , Hester had grown up with none of that uncomfortable feeling so many have when brought even into such mere contact with the poor as comes of passing through their streets on foot -- a feeling often in part composed of fear , often in part of a false sense of natural superiority , engendered of being better dressed , better housed , and better educated .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 36]: It was in a measure owing to her having been from childhood used to the sight of such , that her sympathies were so soon and so thoroughly waked on the side of suffering humanity .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 112]: With parents like hers she had never been in danger of having her feelings or her insight blunted by the assumption of such a relation to the poor as that of spiritual police-agent , one who arrogates the right of walking into their houses without introduction , and with at best but faint apology : to show respect if you have it , is the quickest way to teach reverence ; if you do not show respect , do not at least complain should the recoil of your own behavior be more powerful than pleasant : if you will shout on the mountain side in spring , look out for avalanches .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 28]: Those who would do good to the poor must attempt it in the way in which best they could do good to people of their own standing .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 7]: They must make their acquaintance first .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 24]: They must know something of the kind of the person they would help , to learn if help be possible from their hands .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 21]: Only man can help man ; money without man can do little or nothing , most likely less than nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 41]: As our Lord redeemed the world by being a man , the true Son of the true Father , so the only way for a man to help men is to be a true man to this neighbor and that .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 37]: But to seek acquaintance with design is a perilous thing , nor unlikely to result in disappointment , and the widening of the gulf both between the individuals , and the classes to which they belong .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 42]: It seems to me that , in humble acceptance of common ways , we must follow the leadings of providence , and make acquaintance in the so-called lower classes by the natural working of the social laws that bring men together .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 55]: What is the divine intent in the many needs of humanity , and the consequent dependence of the rich on the poor , even greater than that of the poor on the rich , but to bring men together , that in far-off ways at first they may be compelled to know each other ?
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 39]: The man who treats his fellow as a mere mean for the supply of his wants , and not as a human being with whom he has to do , is an obstructing clot in the human circulation .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 9]: Does any one ask for rules of procedure ?
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 19]: I answer , there are none to be had ; such must be discovered by each for himself .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 19]: The only way to learn the rules of any thing practical is to begin to do the thing .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 33]: We have enough of knowledge in us -- call it insight , call it instinct , call it inspiration , call it natural law , to begin any thing required of us .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 39]: The sole way to deal with the profoundest mystery that is yet not too profound to draw us , is to begin to do some duty revealed by the light from the golden fringe of its cloudy vast .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 15]: If it reveal nothing to be done , there is nothing there for us .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 41]: No man can turn his attention in the mere direction of a thing , without already knowing enough of that thing to carry him further in the knowledge of it by the performance of what it involves of natural action .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 40]: Let every simplest relation towards human being , if it be embodied but in the act of buying a reel of cotton or a knife , be recognized as a relation with , a meeting of that human soul .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 13]: In its poor degree let its outcome be in truth and friendliness .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 14]: Allow nature her course , and next time let the relation go farther .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 23]: To follow such a path is the way to find both the persons to help and the real modes of helping them .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 17]: In fact , to be true to a man in any way is to help him .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 23]: He who goes out of common paths to look for opportunity , leaves his own door and misses that of his neighbor .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 16]: It is by following the path we are in that we shall first reach somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 34]: He who does as I say will find his acquaintance widen and widen with growing rapidity ; his heart will fill with the care of humanity , and his hands with its help .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 20]: Such care will be death to one 's own cares , such help balm to one 's own wounds .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 32]: In a word , he must cultivate , after a simple human manner , the acquaintance of his neighbors , who would be a neighbor where a neighbor may be wanted .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 23]: So shall he fulfil the part left behind of the work of the Master , which He desires to finish through him .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 11]: Of course I do not imagine that Hester understood this .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 19]: She had no theory of carriage towards the poor , neither confined her hope of helping to them .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 32]: There are as many in every other class needing help as among the poor , and the need , although it wear different dresses , is essentially the same in all .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 40]: To make the light go up in the heart of a rich man , if a more difficult task , is just as good a deed as to make it go up in the heart of a poor man .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 66]: But with her strong desire to carry help where it was needed , with her genuine feeling of the blood relationship of all human beings , with her instinctive sense that one could never begin too soon to do that which had to be done , she was in the right position to begin ; and from such a one opportunity will not be withheld .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 21]: She went one morning into a small shop in Steevens 's Road , to buy a few sheets of music-paper .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 21]: The woman who kept it had been an acquaintance almost from the first day of their abode in the neighborhood .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 55]: In the course of their talk Mrs. Baldwin mentioned that she was in some anxiety about a woman in the house who was far from well , and in whom she thought Mrs. Raymount would be interested , `` Mamma is always ready , '' said Hester , `` to help where she can .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 6]: Tell me about her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 221]: `` Well , you see , miss , '' replied Mrs. Baldwin , `` we 're not in the way of having to do with such people , for my husband 's rather particular about who he lets the top rooms to ; only let them we must to one or another , for times is hard an ' children is many , an ' it 's all as we can do to pay our way an ' nothing over ; only thank God we 've done it up to this present ; an ' the man looked so decent , as well as the woman , an ' that pitiful-like -- more than she did -- that I could n't have the heart to send them away such a night as it was , bein ' a sort o ' drizzly an ' as cold as charity , an ' the poor woman plainly not in a state to go wanderin ' about seekin ' a place to lay her head ; though to be sure there 's plenty o ' places for such like , only as the poor man said himself , they did want to get into a decent place , which it was n't easy to get e'er a one as would take them in .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 60]: They had three children with them , the smallest o ' them pickaback on the biggest ; an ' it 's strange , miss -- I never could compass it , though I atten ' chapel reg ` lar -- how it goes to yer heart I mean , to see one human bein ' lookin ' arter another !
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 115]: But my husban ' , as was natural , he bein ' a householder , an ' so many of his own , was shy o ' children ; for children , you know , miss , ` cep ' they be yer own , ai n't nice things about a house ; an ' them poor things would n't be a credit nowheres , for they 're ragged enough -- an ' a good deal more than enough -- only they were pretty clean , as poor children go , an ' there was nothing , as I said to him , in the top-rooms , as they could do much harm to .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 150]: The man said theirs were n't like other children , for they had been brought up to do the thing as they were told , an ' to remember that things that belonged to other people was to be handled as sich ; an ' , said he , they were always too busy earnin ' their bread to be up to tricks , an ' in fact were always too tired to have much spare powder to let off ; so the long an ' short on it was , we took 'em in , an ' they 've turned out as quiet an ' well-behaved a family as you could desire ; an ' if they ai n't got jest the most respectable way o ' earnin ' their livelihood , that may be as much their misfortin as their fault , as my husband he said .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 47]: An ' I 'm sure it 's not lettin ' lodgin 's to sich I ever thought I should come to -- though , for the matter o ' that , I never could rightly understand what made one thing respectable an ' another not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 8]: `` What is their employment then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 3]: asked Hester .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 21]: `` Something or other in the circus-way , as far as I can make out from what they tell me .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 27]: Anyway they did n't seem to have no engagement when they come to the door , but they paid the first week down afore they entered .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 56]: You see , miss , the poor woman she give me a kind of a look up into the face that reminded me of my Susie , as I lost , you know , miss , a year ago -- it was that as made me feel to hate the thought of sending her away .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 17]: Oh , miss , ai n't it a mercy everybody ai n't so like your own !
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 16]: We 'd have to ruin ourselves for them -- we could n't help it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 29]: `` It will come to that one day , though , '' said Hester to herself , `` and then we sha 'n' t he ruined either . ''
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 5]: `` So then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 28]: Mrs. Baldwin went on , `` the very next day as was , the doctor had to be sent for , an ' there was a babby !
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 39]: The doctor he come from the ` ospital , as nice a gentleman as you 'd wish to see , miss , an ' waited on her as if she 'd been the first duchess in the land .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 50]: ` I 'm sure , ' said my good husban ' to me , ` it 's a lesson to all of us to see how he do look after her as 'll never pay him a penny for the care as he 's takin ' of her ! '
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 24]: But my husban ' he 's that soft hearted , miss , where anything i ' the baby-line 's a goin ' on !
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 42]: an ' now the poor thing 's not at all strong , an ' ai n't a-gettin ' back of her stre n'th though we do what we can with her , an ' send her up what we can spare .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 18]: You see they pay for their house-room , an ' then ai n't got much over ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 10]: added the good woman in excuse of her goodness .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 27]: `` But I fancy it 's more from anxiety as to what 's to come to them , than that anything 's gone wrong with her .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 44]: They 're not out o ' money yet quite , I 'm glad to say , though he do n't seem to ha ' got nothing to do yet , so far as I can make out ; they 're rather close like .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 19]: That sort o ' trade , ye see , miss , the demand 's not steady in it .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 62]: It 's not like skilled labor , as my husban ' says ; though to see what them young ones has to go through , it 's labor enough an ' to spare ; an ' if it ai n't just what they call skilled , it 's what no one out o ' the trade can make a mark at .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 18]: Would you mind goin ' up an ' havin ' a look at her , miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 16]: Hester begged Mrs. Baldwin to lead the way , and followed her up the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 25]: The top-rooms were two poor enough garret ones , nowise too good , it seemed to Hester , for the poorest of human kind .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 34]: In the largest , the ceiling sloped to the floor till there was but just height enough left for the small chest of drawers of painted deal to stand back to the wall .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 11]: A similar washstand and a low bed completed the furniture .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 29]: The last was immediately behind the door , and there lay the woman , with a bolster heightened by a thin petticoat and threadbare cloak under her head .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 19]: Hester saw a pale , patient , worn face , with eyes large , thoughtful , and troubled .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 14]: `` Here 's a kind lady come to see you , Mrs. ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 4]: said her landlady .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 5]: This speech annoyed Hester .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 29]: She hated to be called kind , and perhaps spoke the more kindly to the poor woman that she was displeased with Mrs. Baldwin 's patronizing of her .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 28]: `` It 's dreary for you to lie here alone , I 'm afraid , '' she said , and stroked the thin hand on the coverlid .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 10]: `` May I sit a few minutes beside you ?
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 16]: I was once in bed for a whole month , and found it very wearisome .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 6]: I was at school then .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 13]: I do n't mind being ill when I have my mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 17]: The woman gazed up at her with eyes that looked like the dry wells of tears .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 11]: `` It 's very kind of you , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 11]: `` It 's a long stair to come up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 10]: She lay and gazed , and said nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 11]: Her life was of a negative sort just at present .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 39]: Her child lay asleep on her arm , a poor little washed-out rag of humanity , but evidently dear from the way she now and then tried to look at it , which was not easy to her .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 36]: Hester sat down and tried to talk , but partly from the fear of tiring one too weak to answer more than a word now and then , she found it hard to get on .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 7]: Religion she could not talk off-hand .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 26]: Once in her life she had , from a notion of duty , made the attempt , with the consequence of feeling like a hypocrite .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 29]: For she found herself speaking so of the things she fed on in her heart as to make them look to herself the merest commonplaces in the world !
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 17]: Could she believe in them , and speak of them , with such dull dogmatic stupidity ?
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 27]: She came to the conclusion that she had spoken without a message , and since then she had taken care not to commit the offence again .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 5]: A dead silence came .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 18]: `` What can be the good of a common creature like me going to visit people ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 5]: she said to herself .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 23]: `` I have nothing to say -- feel nothing in me -- but a dull love that would bless if it could !
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 11]: And what would words be if I had them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 15]: For a few moments she sat thus silent , growing more and more uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 15]: But just ere the silent became unendurable , a thought appeared in the void .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 8]: `` What a fool I am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 6]: she said again to herself .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 28]: `` I am like little Mark when he cried because he had only a shilling and saw a boy spend a penny on a lovely spotted horse !
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 35]: Here have I been all my life wanting to give my fellow-creatures a large share of my big cake , and the first time I have an opportunity , I forget all about it !
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 17]: Here it lies locked in my chest , like a dead bird in its cage ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 16]: A few more moments she sat silent but no longer embarrassed thinking how to begin .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 8]: The baby woke and began to whimper .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 65]: The mother , who rarely let him off her arm , because then she was not able to take him till help came , drew him to her , and began to nurse him ; and the heart of the young , strong woman was pierced to the quick at sight of how ill fitted was the mother for what she had to do .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 7]: `` Can God be love ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 5]: she said to herself .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 7]: `` If I could help her !
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 15]: It will go on like this for weeks and months , I suppose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 57]: She had yet to learn that the love of God is so deep he can be satisfied with nothing less than getting as near as it is possible for the Father to draw nigh to his children -- and that is into absolute contact of heart with heart , love with love , being with being .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 53]: And as that must be wrought out from the deepest inside , divine law working itself up through our nature into our consciousness and will , and claiming us as divine , who can tell by what slow certainties of approach God is drawing nigh to the most suffering of his creatures ?
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 43]: Only , if we so comfort ourselves with such thoughts as to do nothing , we , when God and they meet , shall find ourselves out in the cold -- cold infinitely worse than any trouble this world has to show .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 43]: The baby made no complaint against the slow fountain of his life , but made the best he could of it , while his mother every now and then peered down on him as lovingly as ever happy mother on her first-born .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 29]: The same God is at the heart of all mothers , and all sins against children are against the one Father of children , against the Life itself .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 15]: A few moments only , and Hester began to sing -- low and soft .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 38]: Having no song sought out for the occasion , she took a common hymn , sung in all churches and chapels , with little thought or feeling in it , the only one she could think of .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 34]: I need not say she put into it as much of sweetness and smoothing strength as she could make the sounds hold , and so perhaps made up a little for its lack .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 16]: It is a curious question why sacred song should so often be dull and commonplace .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 20]: With a trembling voice she sang , and with more anxiety and shyness than she remembered having ever felt .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 30]: It was neither a well-instructed nor critically disposed audience she had , but the reason was that never before had she been so anxious for some measure of success .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 33]: Not daring to look up , she sat like one rebuked , with the music flowing over her lips like the slow water from the urn of some naiad of stone fountain .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 31]: She had her reward ; for when the hymn was done , and she at length ventured to raise her eyes , she saw both mother and babe fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 14]: Her heart ascended on a wave of thanks to the giver of song .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 23]: She rose softly , crept from the house , and hastened home to tell her mother what she had heard and seen .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 20]: The same afternoon a basket of nice things arrived at the shop for the poor lodger in the top-room .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 47]: The care of the Raymounts did not relax till she was fairly on her feet again ; neither till then did a day pass on which Hester did not see her , and scarcely one on which she did not sing to her and her baby .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 14]: Several times she dressed the child , singing to him all the time .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 20]: It was generally in the morning she went , because then she was almost sure to find them alone .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 10]: Of the father she had seen next to nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 33]: On the few occasions when he happened to be at home , the moment she entered he crept out , with a shy , humble salutation , as if ashamed of himself .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 30]: All she had ever had time to see was that he was a man of middle height , with a strong face and frame , dressed like a workman .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 46]: The moment he rose to go , his three boys rose also , and following him from the room seemed to imitate his salutation as they passed her -- all but the youngest , who made her a profound bow accompanied by a wonderful smile .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 14]: The eldest was about the age of twelve , the youngest about seven .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 14]: They were rather sickly looking , but had intelligent faces and inoffensive expressions .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 10]: Mrs. Baldwin continued to bear the family good witness .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 27]: She confessed they never seemed to have much to eat , but said they paid their lodgings regularly , and she had nothing to complain of .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 46]: The place had indeed been untidy , not to say dirty , at first , but as soon as the mother was about again , it began to amend , and now , really , for people in their position , it was wonderfully well .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIII .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 4]: A PRIVATE EXHIBITION .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 12]: Hester had not been near them for two or three days .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 27]: It was getting dusk , but she would just run across the square and down the street , and look in upon them for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 16]: She had not been brought up to fear putting her foot out of doors unaccompanied .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 18]: It was but a few steps , and she knew almost every house she had to pass .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 32]: To-morrow was Sunday , and she felt as if she could not go to church without having once more seen the little flock committed in a measure to her humble charge .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 44]: Not that she imagined anything sole in her relation towards them ; for she had already begun to see that we have to take care of _ parts _ of each other , those parts , namely , which we can best help .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 26]: From the ambition both of men and women to lord it over individuals have arisen worse evils perhaps than from a wider love of empery .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 27]: When a man desires personal influence or power over any one , he is of the thieves and robbers who enter not in by the door .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 25]: But the right and privilege of ministering belongs to every one who has the grace to claim it and be a fellow-worker with God .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 22]: Hester found Mrs. Baldwin busy in the shop , and with a nod passed her , and went up the stair .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 40]: But when she opened the door , she stood for a moment hesitating whether to enter , or close it again with an apology and return , for it seemed as if preparations for a party had been made .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 38]: The bed was pushed to the back of the room , and the floor was empty , except for a cushion or two , like those of an easy chair , lying in the middle of it .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 21]: The father and the three boys were standing together near the fire , like gentlemen on the hearth-rug expecting visitors .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 9]: She glanced round in search of the mother .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 58]: Some one was bending over the bed in the farther corner ; the place was lighted with but a single candle , and she thought it was she , stooping over her baby ; but a moment 's gaze made it plain that the back was that of a man : could it be the doctor again ?
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 6]: Was the poor woman worse ?
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 39]: She entered and approached the father , who then first seeing who it was that had knocked and looked in , pulled off the cap he invariably wore , and came forward with a bashful yet eager courtesy .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 13]: `` I hope your wife is not worse , '' said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 10]: `` No ' , miss , I hope not .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 7]: She 's took a bit bad .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 13]: We ca n't always avoid it in our profession , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 16]: `` I do n't understand you , '' she answered , feeling a little uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 14]: -- Were there horrors to be revealed of which she had surmised nothing ?
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 37]: `` If you will do us the honor to take a seat , miss , we shall be only too happy to show you as much as you may please to look upon with favor . ''
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 8]: Hester shuddered involuntarily , but mastered herself .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 9]: The man saw her hesitate , and resumed .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 12]: `` You see , miss , this is how it was .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 115]: Dr. Christopher -- that 's the gentleman there , a lookin ' after mother -- he 's been that kind to her an ' me an ' all on us in our trouble , an ' never a crown-piece to offer him -- which I 'm sure no lady in the land could ha ' been better attended to than she 've been -- twixt him an ' you , miss -- so we thought as how we 'd do our best for him , an ' try an ' see whether amongst us we could n't give him a pleasant evenin ' as it were , just to show as we was grateful .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 99]: So we axed him to tea , an ' he come , like the gen ` leman he be , an ' so we shoved the bed aside an ' was showin ' him a bit on our craft , just a trick or two , miss -- me an ' the boys here -- stan ' forward , Robert an ' the rest of you an ' make your bows to the distinguished company as honors you with their presence to cast an eye on you an ' see what you can show yourselves capable of . ''
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 30]: Here Mr. Christopher -- Hester had not now heard his name for the first time , though she had never seen him before -- turned , and approached them .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 18]: `` She 'll be all right in a minute or two , Franks , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 16]: `` You told her , doctor , the boy ai n't got the smallest hurt ?
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 20]: It ` ud break my heart nigh as soon as hers to see the Sarpint come to grief . ''
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 33]: `` She knows that well enough ; only , you see , we ca n't always help letting the looks of things get a hold of us in spite of the facts .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 14]: That 's how so many people come to go out of their wits .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 15]: But I think for the present it will be better to drop it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 7]: Franks turned to Hester to explain .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 49]: `` One of the boys , miss -- that 's him -- not much of him -- the young Sarpint of the Prairie , we call him in the trade -- he do n't seem to ha ' much amiss with him , do he now , miss ?
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 30]: -- he had a bit of a fall -- only on them pads -- a few minutes ago , the more shame to the Sarpint , the rascal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 19]: Here he pretended to hit the Sarpint , who never moved a coil in consequence , only smiled .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 24]: `` But he ai n't the worse , never a hair -- or a scale I should rather say , to be kensistent .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 19]: Bless you , we all knows how to fall equally as well 's how to get up again !
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 99]: Only it 's the most remarkable thing , an ' you would hardly believe it of any woman , miss , though she 's been married fourteen years come next Candlemas , an ' use they say 's a second natur ' , it 's never proved no second nor no third natur ' with her , for she 's got no more used to seein ' the children , if it 's nothin ' but standin ' on their heads , than if it was the first time she 'd ever heard o ' sich a thing .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 108]: An ' for standin ' on my head -- I do n't mean me standin ' on my own head , that she do n't mind no more 'n if it was a pin standin ' on its head , which it 's less the natur ' of a pin to do , as that 's the way she first made acquaintance with me , seein ' me for the first time in her life upside down , which I think sometimes it would be the better way for women to choose their husbands in general , miss , for it 's a bad lot we are !
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 57]: But as to seein ' of her own flesh an ' blood , that 's them boys , all on 'em , miss , a standin ' on my head , or it might be one on my head an ' the other two on my shoulders , that she never come to look at fair .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 8]: She ca n't abide it , miss .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 53]: By some strange okylar delusion she takes me somehow for somewheres about the height of St. Paul 's , which if you was to fall off the ball , or even the dome of the same , you _ might _ break your neck an ' a few bones besides , miss .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 38]: But bless you , there ai n't no danger , an ' she knows too , there ai n't , only , as the doctor says , she ca n't abide the look o ' the thing .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 25]: You see , miss , we 're all too much taken wi ' the appearance o ' things -- the doctor 's right there !
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 51]: -- an ' if it war n't for that , there 's never a juggler could get on with his tricks , for it 's when you 're so taken up with what he wants you to see , that he does the thing he wants you not to see .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 38]: But as the doctor thinks it better to drop it , it 's drop it we will , an ' wait till a more convenient time -- that is , when mother 'll be a bit stronger .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 50]: For I hope neither you , miss , nor the doctor , wo n't give us up quite , seem ' as how we have a kind of a claim upon you -- an ' no offense , miss , to you , or Mr. Christopher , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 31]: Hester , from whose presence the man had hitherto always hastened to disappear , was astonished at this outpouring ; but Franks was emboldened by the presence of the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 30]: The moment , however , that his wife heard him give up thus their little private exhibition in honor of the doctor , she raised herself on her elbow .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 15]: `` Now , you 'll do no such a thing , John Franks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 6]: she said with effort . ''
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 57]: It 's ill it would become me , for my whims , as I ca n't help , no more nor the child there , to prewent you from showin ' sich a small attention to the gentleman as helped me through my trouble -- God bless him , for it ca n't be no pleasure !
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 19]: So I 'm not agoin ' to put on no airs as if I was a fine lady .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 21]: I 've got to get used to ` t -- that 's the short an ' the long of it !
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 9]: -- Only I 'm slow at it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 14]: she added with a sigh , `` Up you go , Moxy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 6]: Franks looked at the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 45]: The doctor nodded his head as much as to say , `` You had better do as she wishes ; '' but Hester saw that the eyes of the young man were all the time more watchful of the woman than of the performance .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 12]: Immediately Franks , with a stage-bow , offered Hester a chair .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 56]: She hesitated a moment , for she felt shy of Mr. Christopher : but as she had more fear of not behaving as she ought to the people she was visiting , she sat down , and became for the first time in her life a spectator of the feats of a family of acrobats .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 72]: There might have seemed little remarkable in the display to one in the occasional habit of seeing such things , and no doubt to Mr. Christopher it had not much that was new ; but to Hester what each and all of them were capable of was astonishing -- more astonishing than pleasant , for she was haunted for some time after with a vague idea of prevailing distortion and dislocation .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 37]: It was satisfactory nevertheless to know that much labor of a very thorough and persevering sort must have been expended upon their training before they could have come within sight of the proficiency they had gained .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 45]: She believed this proficiency bore strong witness to some kind of moral excellence in them , and that theirs might well be a nobler way of life than many in which money is made more rapidly , and which are regarded as more respectable .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 59]: There were but two things in the performance she found really painful : one , that the youngest seemed hardly equal to the physical effort required in those tricks , especially which he had as yet mastered but imperfectly : and it was very plain this was the chief source of trial to the nerves of the mother .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 23]: He was a sweet-looking boy , with a pale interesting face , bent on learning his part , but finding it difficult .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 49]: The other thing that pained Hester , was , that the moment they began to perform , the manner of the father toward his children changed ; his appearance also , and the very quality of his voice changed , so that he seemed hardly the same man .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 48]: Just as some men alter their tone and speak roughly when they address a horse , so the moment Franks assumed the teacher , he assumed the tyrant , and spoke in a voice between the bark of a dog and the growl of a brown bear .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 54]: But the roughness had in it nothing cruel , coming in part of his having had to teach other boys than his own , whom he found this mode of utterance assist him in compelling to give heed to his commands ; in part from his idea of the natural embodiment of authority .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 25]: He ordered his boys about with sternness , sometimes even fiercely , swore at them indeed occasionally , and made Hester feel very uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 8]: `` Come , come , Franks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 10]: said Mr. Christopher , on one of these outbreaks .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 42]: The man stood silent for a moment `` like one forbid , '' then turning to Miss Raymount first , and next to his wife , said , taking of his cap , `` I humbly beg your pardon , ladies .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 8]: I forgot what company I was in .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 10]: But bless you , I mean nothing by it !
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 6]: It 's only my way .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 15]: Ai n't it now , mates -- you as knows the old man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 29]: `` Yes , father ; ` tai n't nothin ' more 'n a way you 've got , '' responded the boys all , the little one loudest .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 26]: `` You do n't mind it , do you -- knowin ' as it 's only to make you mind what you 're about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 13]: `` No , father , _ we _ do n't mind it .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 10]: Go ahead , father , '' said the eldest .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 45]: `` But , '' said Franks , and here interjected an imprecation , vulgarly called an oath , `` if ever I hear one o ' you a usin ' of sich improper words , I 'll break every bone in his carcase . ''
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 67]: `` Yes , father , '' answered the boys with one accord , `` It 's all very well for fathers , '' he went on ; `` an ' when you 're fathers yourselves , an ' able to thrash me -- not as I think you 'd want to , kids -- I sha ` nt ha ' no call to meddle with you .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 5]: So here goes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 52]: Casting a timid glance at Hester , in the assurance that he had set himself thoroughly right with her , showing himself as regardful of his boys ' manners as could justly be expected of any parent , he proceeded with his lesson from the point where he had left off .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 42]: As to breaking the boys ' bones , there hardly seemed any bones in them to break ; gelatine at best seemed to be what was inside their muscles , so wonderful were their feats , and their pranks so strange .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 81]: But their evident anxiety to please , their glances full of question as to their success in making their offering acceptable , their unconscious efforts to supply the lacking excitement of the public gaze , and , more than all , the occasional appearance amidst the marvels of their performance , in which their bodies seemed mere india-rubber in response to their wills , of a strangely mingled touch of pathos , prevailed chiefly to interest Hester in their endeavor .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 79]: This last would appear in the occasional suffering it caused Moxy , the youngest , to do as his father required , but oftener in the incongruity between the lovely expression of the boy 's face , and the oddity of it when it became the field of certain comicalities required of him -- especially when , stuck through between his feet , it had to grin like a demon carved on the folding seat of a choir-stall .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 33]: Its sweet innocence , and the veil of suffering cast over its best grin , suggesting one of Raphael 's cherubs attempting to play the imp , Hester found almost discordantly pathetic .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 13]: She could have caught the child to her bosom , but alas !
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 5]: she had no right .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 45]: She was already beginning to become aware of the difficulty of the question as to when or how much you may interfere with the outward conditions of men , or help them save through the channels of the circumstance in which you find them .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 27]: The gentle suffering face seemed far from its own sphere , that of a stray boy-angel come to give her a lesson in the heavenly patience .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 44]: His mother , whose yellow hair and clear gray eyes were just like his , covered her eyes with her hand , though she could not well see him from where she lay , every time he had to do anything by himself .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 63]: All at once the master of the ceremonies drew ` himself up , and wiping his forehead , gave a deep sigh , as much as to say , `` I have done my best , and if I have not pleased you , the more is my loss , for I have tried hard , '' and the performance was over .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 62]: The doctor rose , and in a manly voice , whose tones were more pleasing to Hester than the look of the man , which she did not find attractive , proceeded to point out to Franks one or two precautions which his knowledge of anatomy enabled him to suggest , with regard to the training especially of the little Moxy .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 49]: At the same time he expressed himself greatly pleased with what his host had been so kind as to show him , remarking that the power to do such things implied labor more continuous and severe than would have sufficed to the learning of two or three trades .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 61]: In reply , Franks , mistaking the drift of the remark , and supposing it a gentle remonstrance with what the doctor counted a waste of labor , said , in a tone that sounded sad in the ears of Hester , `` What 's a fellow to do , sir , when he ` ai n't got no dinner ?
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 11]: He must take to the work as takes to him .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 9]: There was no other trade handy for me .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 22]: My father he was a poor laborer , an ' died early , o ' hard work an ' many mouths .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 23]: My mother lived but a year after him an ' I had to do for the kids whatever came first to hand .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 72]: There was two on 'em dead ` atwixt me an ' the next alive , so I was a long way ahead o ' the rest , an ' I could n't ha ' seen them goin ' to the dogs for want o ' bread while I was learnin ' a trade , even if I had had one in my mind more than another , which I never had .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 93]: I always was a lively lad , an ' for want of anything better to do , for my father would n't have us go to work till we was strong enough , he said -- an ' for that matter it turned out well when the hard time came -- I used to amuse myself an ' the rest by standin ' on my head an ' twistin ' of my body into all sorts o ' shapes -- more 'n it could well ha ' been meant for to take .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 62]: An ' when the circus come round , I would make friends wi ' the men , helpin ' of 'em to look after their horses , an ' they would sometimes , jest to amuse theirselves , teach me tricks I was glad enough to learn ; an ' they did say for a clod-hopper I got on very well .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 63]: But that , you see , sir , set my monkey up , an ' I took a hoath to myself I would do what none o ' them could do afore I died -- an ' some thinks , sir , '' he added modestly , `` as how I 've done it -- but that 's neither here nor there .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 47]: The p ` int is , that , when my mother followed my father , an ' the rest come upon my hands , I was able at once , goin ' about an ' showin ' off , to gather a few coppers for 'em .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 29]: But I soon found it was precious little I could get , no matter what I could do so long as my clothes war n't the right thing .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 40]: So long as I did n't look my trade , they regarded my best as nothing but a clumsy imitation of my betters , an ' laughed at what circus Joe said he could n't do no better hisself .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 65]: So I plucks up heart an ' goes to Longstreet , as was the next market-town , an ' into a draper 's shop , an ' tells 'em what I wanted , an ' what it was for , promisin ' to pay part out o ' the first money I got , an ' the rest as soon after as I could .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 146]: The chaps in the shop , all but one on em ' , larfed at me ; there 's always one , or two p ` raps , leastways sech as has been my expearence , sir an ' miss , as is better 'n most o ' the rest , though it 's a good thing everybody 's not so soft-hearted as my wife there , or the world would soon be turned topsy turvey , an ' the rogues have all the money out o ' the good folk 's pockets , an ' them turned beggars in their turn , an ' then the rogues would n't give them nothink , an ' so the good ones would die out , an ' the world be full o ' nothing but damned rascals -- I beg your pard ` n , miss .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 79]: But as I was sayin ' , though I fared no better at the next shop nor the next , there was one good woman I come to in a little shop in a back street , an ' she was a resemblin ' of yourself , miss , an ' she took an ' set me up in my trade , a givin ' of me a few remnants o ' colored calico , God bless her !
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 52]: I set to with my needle , an ' I dressed myself as like a proper clown as I could , an ' painted my face beautiful , an ' from that time till they was able to do some'at for theirselves , I managed to keep the kids in life .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 20]: It was n't much more , you see , but life 's life though it bea n't tip-top style .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 42]: An ' if they 're none o ' them doin ' jest so well as they might , there 's none o ' them been in pris 'n yet , an ' that 's a comfort as long as it lasts .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 77]: An ' when folk tells me I 'm a doin ' o ' nothink o ' no good , an ' my trade 's o ' no use to nobody , I says to them , says I , ` Beggin ' your pardon , sir , or ma'am , but do you call it nothink to fill -- leastways to _ nigh _ fill four hungry little bellies at home afore I wur fifteen ? '
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 26]: An ' after that , they ai n't in general said nothink ; an ' one gen ` leman he give me ` alf-a-crown . ''
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 17]: `` The best possible answer you could have given , Franks , '' rejoined Mr. Christopher .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 15]: `` But I think perhaps you hardly understood what such objectors meant to say .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 88]: They might have gone on to explain , only they had n't the heart after what you told them , that most trades did something on both sides -- not only fed the little ones at home , but did good to the persons for whom the work was done ; that the man , for instance , who cobbled shoes , gave a pair of dry feet to some old man at the same time that he filled his own child 's hungry little stomach . ''
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 9]: Franks was silent for a moment , thinking .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 11]: `` I understand you , sir , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 32]: `` But I think I knows trades as makes a deal o ' money , an ' them they makes it out on 's the worse an ' not the better .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 32]: It 's better to stand on a fellow 's own head than to sell gin ; an ' I ` most think it 's as good as the fire-work trade . ''
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 19]: `` You are quite right : there 's not a doubt of it , '' answered Mr. Christopher .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 30]: `` But mind you , '' he went on , `` I do n't for a moment agree with those who tell you your trade is of no use .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 28]: I was only explaining to you what they meant ; for it 's always best to know what people mean , even where they are wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 11]: `` Surely , sir , and I thank you kindly .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 7]: Everybody 's not so fair . ''
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 20]: Here he broke into a quiet laugh , so pleased was he to have the doctor take his part .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 25]: `` I think , '' Mr. Christopher went on , `` to amuse people innocently is often the only good you can do them .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 13]: When done lovingly and honestly , it is a Christian service . ''
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 11]: This rather shocked Hester : -- acrobatics a Christian service .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 12]: With her grand dawning idea mingled yet some foolish notional remnants .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 33]: She still felt as if going to church and there fixing your thoughts on the prayers and the lessons and the hymns and the sermon was the _ serving _ of God .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 47]: She turned rather sharply towards the doctor , with a feeling that honesty called on her to speak ; but not a word came to her lips , for the best of reasons -- that not a thought had arisen in answer to his bold assertion .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 15]: She was one of the few who know when they have nothing to say .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 9]: But Christopher had observed the movement of dissent .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 52]: `` Suppose , '' he went on , but without addressing her more than before , still turning himself almost exclusively to Franks -- `` Suppose somebody walking along Oxford Street , brooding over an injury , and thinking how to serve the man out that had done it to him .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 24]: All the numberless persons and things pass him on both sides and he sees none of them -- takes no notice of anything .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 63]: But he spies a man in Berners Street , in the middle of a small crowd , showing them some tricks -- we wo n't say so good as yours , Mr. Franks , but he stops , and stares , and forgets for a moment or two that there is one brother-man he hates and would kill if he could . ''
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 37]: Here Hester found words , and said , though all but inaudibly , `` He would only go away as soon as he had had enough of it , and hate him all the same ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 81]: `` I know very well , '' answered Christopher , turning now to her , `` it would not make a good man of him : but , except the ways of the world , its best ways and all , are to go for nothing in God 's plans , it must be something to have the bad mood in a man stopped for a moment , just as it is something to a life to check a fever .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 20]: It gives the godlike in the man , feeble , perhaps nearly exhausted , a fresh opportunity of revival .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 19]: For the moment at least , the man is open to influences from another source than his hate .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 47]: If the devil may catch a man at unawares when he is in an evil or unthinking mood , why should not the good Power take his opportunity when the evil spirit is asleep through the harping of a David or the feats of a Franks ?
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 44]: I sometimes find , as I come from a theatre where I have been occupied with the interests of a stirring play , that , with a sudden rush of intelligence , I understand the things best worth understanding better than before . ''
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 70]: The illustration would have pleased Hester much had he said `` coming out of a concert-room , '' for she was not able to think of God being in a theatre : perhaps that had some relation to her inability to tell Saffy why God made the animals : she could have found her a reason why he made the dogs , but not why he made the monkeys .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 32]: We are surrounded with things difficult to understand , and the way most people take is not to look at them lest they should find out they have to understand them .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 25]: Hester suspected scepticism under the remarks of the doctor : most doctors , she believed , had more than a leaning in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 37]: But she had herself begun to have a true notion of serving _ man _ at least ; therefore there was no fear of her not coming to see by and by what serving God meant .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 37]: She did serve him , therefore she could not fail of finding out the word that belonged to the act : no one who does not serve him ever can find out what serving him means .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 97]: Some people are constantly rubbing at their skylights , but if they do not keep their other windows clean also , there will not be much light in the house : God , like his body , the light , is all about us , and prefers to shine in upon us sideways : we could not endure the power of his vertical glory ; no mortal man can see God and live ; and he who loveth not his brother whom he hath seen , shall not love his God whom he hath not seen .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 28]: He will come to us in the morning through the eyes of a child , when we have been gazing all night at the stars in vain .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 3]: Hester rose .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 14]: She was a little frightened at the very peculiar man and his talk .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 38]: She had made several attempts in the dull light , but without much success , to see him as he watched the contortions of the acrobats , which apparently he enjoyed more than to her seemed reasonable .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 77]: But , as with herself , it was the boy Moxy that chiefly attracted him , though the show of physical prowess was far from uninteresting to him ; and although what she saw through the smoky illumination of the dip was not attractive to her , the question remains whether it was really the man himself she saw , or only an appearance made up of candle gleam and gloom , complemented by her imagination .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 12]: I will write what she saw , or thought she saw .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 87]: A rather thick-set man about thirty , in a rough shooting-coat of a brownish gray with many pockets , a striped shirt , and a black necktie -- if tie it could be called that had so little tie in it ; a big head , with rather thick and long straggling hair ; a large forehead , and large gray eyes ; the remaining features well-formed -- but rather fat , like the rest of his not elegant person ; and a complexion rather pale .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 38]: She thought he had quite a careless , if not a slightly rakish look ; but I believe a man , even in that light , would have seen in him something manly and far from unattractive .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 23]: He had a rather gruff but not unmusical voice , with what some might have thought a thread of pathos in it .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 21]: He always reminded certain of his friends of the portrait of Jean Paul in the Paris edition of his works .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 38]: He was hardly above the middle height , and , I am sorry to say , wore his hat on the back of his head , which would have given Solon or Socrates himself a foolish look .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 39]: Hester , however , as she declined his offer to see her home , did not then become aware of this peculiarity , which , to say the least , would have made her like him no better .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 25]: The next time she went to see the Frankses , which was not for four or five days , she found they were gone .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 51]: They had told Mrs. Baldwin that they were sorry to leave , but they must look for a cheaper lodging -- a better they could not hope to find ; and as the Baldwins had just had an application for the rooms , they felt they must let them go .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 73]: Hester was disappointed not to have seen them once more , and made them a little present as she had intended ; and in after times the memory of them was naturally the more interesting that on Mrs. Franks she had first made experiment in the hope of her calling , and in virtue of her special gift had not once nor twice given sleep and rest to her and her babe .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 64]: And if it is a fine thing to thrill with delight the audience of a concert-room -- well-dined , well-dressed people , surely it was not a little thing to hand God 's gift of sleep to a poor woman weary with the lot of women , and having so little , as Hester thought , to make life a pleasure to her !
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 30]: Mrs. Franks would doubtless have differed from Hester in this judgment of her worldly condition , on the ground that she had a good husband , and good children .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 36]: Some are always thinking others better off than themselves : others feel as if the lot of many about them must be absolutely unbearable , because they themselves could never bear it , they think .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 18]: But things are unbearable just until we have them to bear ; their possibility comes with them .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 11]: For we are not the roots of our own being .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIV .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 4]: VAVASOR AND HESTER .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 12]: The visits of Vavasor , in reality to Hester , continued .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 13]: For a time they were more frequent , and he stayed longer .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 66]: Hester 's more immediate friends , namely her mother and Miss Dasomma , noted also , and with some increase of anxiety , that he began to appear at the church they attended , a dull enough place , without any possible attraction of its own for a man like Vavasor : they could but believe he went thither for the sake of seeing Hester .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 25]: Two or three Sundays and he began to join them as they came out , and walk part of the way home with them .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 20]: Next he went all the way , was asked to go in , and invited to stay to lunch .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 133]: It may well seem strange that Mrs. Raymount , anxious as to the result , should allow things to go on thus ; but , in the first place , she had such thorough confidence in Hester as not to think it possible she should fall in love with such a man as Vavasor ; and , in the second place , it is wonderful what weakness may co-exist with what strength , what worldliness stand side by side with what spirituality -- for a time , that is , till the one , for one must , overcome the other ; Mrs. Raymount was pleased with the idea of a possible marriage of such distinction for her daughter , which would give her just the position she counted her fit for .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 17]: These mutually destructive considerations were , with whatever logical inconsistency , both certainly operative in her .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 11]: Then again , they knew nothing against the young man !
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 11]: He made himself agreeable to every one in the house .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 21]: In Addison Square he showed scarce the faintest shadow of the manner which made him at the bank almost hated .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 52]: In the square not only was he on his good behavior as in a private house , but his heart , and his self-respect , as he would have called his self-admiration , were equally concerned in his looking his best -- which always means looking better than one 's best .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 47]: Then in Hester 's company his best was always uppermost , and humility being no part of this best , he not merely felt comfortable and kindly disposed -- which he was -- but good in himself and considerate of others -- which he was not .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 35]: There was that in Hester and his feeling towards her which had upon him what elevating influence he was yet capable of receiving , and this fact said more for him than anything else .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 23]: She seemed gaining a power over him that could not be for other than good with any man who submitted to it .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 28]: It had begun to bring out and cherish what was best in a disposition far from unamiable , although nearly ruined by evil influences on all sides .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 21]: Both glad and proud to see her daughter thus potent , how , thought Mrs. Raymount , could she interfere ?
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 7]: It was plain he was improving .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 15]: Not once now did they ever hear him jest on anything belonging to church !
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 22]: -- As to anything belonging to religion , he scarcely knew enough in that province to have any material for jesting .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 38]: -- If Vavasor was falling in love with Hester , the danger was for him -- lest she , who to her mother appeared colder than any lady she knew , should not respond with like affection .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 6]: Miss Dasomma was more awake .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 25]: She knew better than Mrs. Raymount the kind of soil in which this human plant had been reared , and saw more danger ahead .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 58]: She feared the young man was but amusing himself , or at best enjoying Hester 's company as some wary winged thing enjoys the flame , courting a few singes , not quite avoiding even a slight plumous conflagration , but careful not to turn a delightful imagination into a consuming reality , beyond retreat and self-recovery .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 48]: She could not believe him as careless of himself as of her , but judged he was what he would to himself call flirting with her -- which had the more danger for Hester that there was not in her mind the idea corresponding to the phrase .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 42]: I believe he declined asking himself whither the enjoyment of the hour was leading ; and I fancy he found it more easy to set aside the question because of the difference between his social position and that of the lady .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 95]: Possibly he regarded himself as honoring the low neighborhood of Addison Square by the frequency of his shining presence ; but I think he was at the same time feeling the good influences of which I have spoken more than he knew , or would have liked to acknowledge to himself ; for he had never turned his mind in the direction of good ; and it was far more from circumstance than refusal that he was not yet the more hurtful member of society which his no-principles were surely working to make him .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 9]: Hester was of course greatly interested in him .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 39]: She had been but little in society , had not in the least studied men , and could not help being pleased with the power she plainly had over him , and which as plainly went on increasing .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 20]: Even Corney , not very observant or penetrating , remarked on the gentleness of his behavior in their house .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 40]: He followed every word of Hester 's about his singing , and showed himself even anxious to win her approbation by the pains he took and the amount of practice he went through to approach her idea of song .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 72]: He had not only ceased to bring forward his heathenish notions as to human helplessness and fate , but allowed what at first she let fall as mere hints concerning the individual mission of every human being to blossom in little outbursts concerning duty without show of opposition , listening with a manner almost humble , and seeming on the way to allow there might be some reality in such things .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 48]: Whether any desire of betterment was now awake in him through the power of her spiritual presence , I can not tell ; but had Mrs. Raymount seen as much of him as Hester , she would have been yet better justified in her hope of him .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 32]: For Hester , she thought first , and for some time , only of doing him good , nor until she imagined some success , did the danger to her begin .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 26]: After that , with every fresh encouragement the danger grew -- for just so much grew the danger of selfcoming in and getting the upper-hand .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 26]: I do not suppose that Vavasor once consciously laid himself out to deceive her , or make her think him better than he thought himself .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 35]: With a woman of Hester 's instincts , there might have been less danger if he had ; she also would then perhaps have been aware of the present untruth , and have recoiled .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 33]: But if he had any he had but the most rudimentary notion of truth in the inward parts , and could deceive the better that he did not know he was deceiving .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 45]: As little notion had he of the nature of the person he was dealing with , or the reality to her of the things of which she spoke ; -- belief was to him at most the mere difference between decided and undecided opinion .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 43]: Nay , she spoke the language of a world whose existence he was incapable at present of recognizing , for he had never obeyed one of its demands , which language therefore meant to him nothing like what it meant to her .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 45]: His natural inborn proclivities to the light had , through his so seldom doing the deeds of the light , become so weak , that he hardly knew such a thing as reform was required of , possible to , or desirable in him .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 12]: Nothing seemed to him to matter except `` good form . ''
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 24]: To see and hear him for a few minutes after leaving her and entering his club , would have been safety to Hester .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 35]: I do not mean that he was of the baser sort there , but whatever came up there , he would meet on its own grounds , and respond to in its own kind .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 16]: He was certainly falling more and more into what most people call _ love _ .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 41]: How little regard there may be in that for the other apart from the self I will not now inquire , but what I may call the passionate side of the spiritual was more affected in him than ever previously .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 11]: As to what he meant he did not himself know .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 39]: When intoxicated with the idea of her , that is when thinking what a sensation she would make in his grand little circle , he felt it impossible to live without her : some way must be found !
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 13]: it could not be his fate to see another triumph in her !
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 19]: -- He called his world a circle rightly enough : it was no globe , nothing but surface .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 27]: -- Whether or not she Would accept him he never asked himself ; almost awed in her presence , he never when alone doubted she would .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 28]: Had he had anything worthy the name of property coming with the title , he would have proposed to her at once , he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 18]: But who with only the most beautiful wife in the world , would encounter a naked earldom !
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 15]: The thing would be raging madness -- as unjust to Hester as to himself !
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 19]: How just , how love-careful he was not to ask her -- considerate for her more than himself !
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 9]: But perhaps _ she _ might have expectations !
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 22]: That could hardly be : no one with anything would slave as her governor did , morning , noon and night !
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 26]: True his own governor was her uncle -- there was money in the family ; but people never left their money to their poor relations !
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 67]: To marry her would be to live on his salary , in a small house in St. John 's wood , or Park Village -- perhaps even in Camden Town , ride home in the omnibus every night like one of a tin of sardines , wear half-crown gloves , cotton socks , and ten-and-six-penny hats : the prospect was too hideous to be ludicrous even !
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 16]: Would the sweetness of the hand that darned the socks make his over-filled shoe comfortable ?
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 17]: And when the awful family began to come on , she would begin to go off !
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 28]: A woman like her , living in ease and able to dress well -- by Jove , she might keep her best points till she was fifty !
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 26]: If there was such a providence as Hester so dutifully referred to , it certainly did not make the best things the easiest to get !
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 19]: How could it care for a fellow 's happiness , or even for his leading a correct life !
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 14]: Would he not be a much better man if allowed to have Hester !
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 43]: -- whereas in all probability she would fall to the lot of some quill-driver like her father -- a man that made a livelihood by drumming his notions into the ears of people that did not care a brass farthing about them !
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 20]: -- Thus would Vavasor 's love-fits work themselves off -- declining from cold noon to a drizzly mephitic twilight .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 19]: It was not soon that he risked an attempt to please her with a song of his own .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 17]: There was just enough unconscious truth in him to make him a little afraid of Hester .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 30]: Commonplace as were in the most thorough sense the channels in which his thoughts ran , he would not for less than a fortune have risked encountering her scorn .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 45]: For he believed , and therein he was right , that she was capable of scorn , and that of no ordinarily withering quality : Hester had not yet gathered the sweet gentleness that comes of long breathing the air of the high countries .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 20]: It is generally many years before a strong character learns to think of itself as it ought to think .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 37]: While there is left in us the possibility of scorn we know not quite the spirit we are of -- still less if we imagine we may keep this or that little shadow of a fault .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 19]: But Hester was far less ready to scorn on her own account than on the part of another .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 56]: And if she had fairly seen into the mind interesting her so much , seen how poverty-stricken it was , and with how little motion towards the better , she would indeed have felt a great rush of scorn , but chiefly against herself for being taken in after such a fool 's - fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 98]: But he had come to understand Hester 's taste so far as to know certain qualities she would not like in a song ; he could even be sure she would like this one or that ; and although of many he could not be certain , having never reached the grounds of her judgment , he had not yet offended her with any he brought her -- and so by degrees he had generated the resolve to venture something himself in the hope of pleasing her : he flattered himself he knew her _ style _ !
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 35]: He was very fond of the word , and had an idea that all writers , to be of any account , must fashion their style after that of this or the other master .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 34]: How the master got it , or whether it might not be well to go back to the seed and propagate no more by cutting , it never occurred to him to ask .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 103]: In the prospect of one day reaching the bloom of humanity in the conservatory of the upper house , he already at odd moments cultivated his style by reading aloud the speeches of parliamentary orators ; but the thought never came to him that there was no such thing _ per se _ as _ speaking well _ , that there was no cause of its existence except _ thinking well _ , were the grandfather , and _ something to say _ the father of if -- something so well worth saying that it gave natural utterance to its own shape .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 41]: If you had told him this , and he had , as he thought , perceived the truth of it , he would immediately have desired some fine thing to say , in order that he might say it well !
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 34]: He could not have been persuaded that , if one has nothing worth saying , the best possible style for him is just the most halting utterance that ever issued from empty skull .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 10]: To make a good speech was the grand thing !
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 19]: what side it was on , the right or the wrong , was a point unthinkable with him .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 48]: Even whether the speaker believed what he said was of no consequence -- except that , if he did not , his speech would be the more admirable , as the greater _ tour de force _ , and himself the more admirable as the cleverer fellow .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 30]: Knowing that Hester was fond of a good ballad , he thought at first to try his hand on one : it could not be difficult , he thought !
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 48]: But he found that , like everything else , a ballad was easy enough if you could do it , and more than difficult enough if you could not : after several attempts he wisely yielded the ambition ; his gift did not lie in that direction !
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 40]: He had , however , been so long in the habit of writing drawing-room verses that he had better ground for hoping he might produce something in that kind which the too severe taste of Hester could yet admire !
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 30]: It would be a great stroke towards placing him in a right position towards her -- one , namely , in which his intellectual faculty would be more manifest !
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 36]: It should be a love song , and he would present it as one he had written long ago : as such it would say the more for him while it would not commit him .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 91]: So one evening as he stood by her piano , he said all at once : `` By the bye , Miss Raymount , last night , as I was turning over some songs I wrote many years ago , I came upon one I thought I should like you just to look at -- not the music -- that is worth nothing , though I was proud enough of it then and thought it an achievement ; but the words I still think are not so bad -- considering .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 25]: They are so far from me now that I am able to speak of them as if they were not mine at all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 8]: `` Do let me see them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 29]: said Hester , hiding none of the interest she felt , though fearing a little she might not have to praise them so much as she would like .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 18]: He took the song from his pocket , and smoothed it out before her on the piano .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 12]: `` Read it to me , please , '' said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 33]: `` No ; excuse me , '' he answered with a little shyness , the rarest of phenomena in his spiritual atmosphere ; `` I _ could _ not read it aloud .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 26]: But do not let it bore you if -- '' He did not finish his sentence , and Hester was already busy with his manuscript .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 42]: Here is the song : If thou lov ` st I dare not ask thee , Lest thou say , `` Not thee ; '' Prythee , then , in coldness mask thee , That it _ may _ be me .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 29]: If thou lov ` st me do not tell me , Joy would make me rave , And the bells of gladness knell me To the silent grave .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 23]: If thou lovest not thy lover , Neither veil thine eyes , Nor to his poor heart discover What behind them lies .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 25]: Be not cruel , be not tender ; Grant me twilight hope ; Neither would I die of splendor , Nor in darkness mope .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 24]: I entreat thee for no favor , Smallest nothingness ; I will hoard thy dropt glove 's savor , Wafture of thy dress .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 7]: So my love shall daring linger !
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 19]: Moth-like round thy flame ; Move not , pray , forbidden finger -- Death to me thy blame .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 17]: Vavasor had gone half-way towards Mrs. Raymount , then turned , and now stood watching Hester .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 15]: So long was her head bent over his paper that he grew uncomfortably anxious .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 24]: At length , without lifting her eyes , she placed it on the stand before her , and began to try its music .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 42]: Then Vavasor went to her hurriedly , for he felt convinced that if she was not quite pleased with the verses , it would fare worse with the music , and begged she would not trouble herself with anything so childish .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 13]: Even now he knew less about music than poetry , he said .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 34]: `` I wanted you to see the verses , and the manuscript being almost illegible I had to copy it ; so , in a mechanical mood , I copied the music also .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 7]: Please let me have them again .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 9]: I feared they were not worth your notice !
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 6]: I know it now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 75]: Hester , however , would not yield the paper , but began again to read it : Vavasor 's writing , out of the bank , was one of those irritating hands that wrong not only with the absence of legibility but with the show of its presence , and she had not yet got so clear a notion of his verses as a mere glance of them in print would have given her .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 21]: Why she did not quite like them she did not yet know , and was anxious not to be unfair .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 35]: That they were clever she did not doubt ; they had for one thing his own air of unassumed ease , and she could not but feel they had some claim to literary art .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 30]: This added a little to her hesitation , not in pronouncing on them -- she was far from that yet -- but in recognizing what she felt about them .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 40]: Had she had a suspicion of the lie he had told her , and that they were the work of yesterday , it would at once have put leagues between them , and made the verses hateful to her .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 41]: As it was , the more she read and thought , the farther she seemed from a conclusion , and the time Vavasor stood there waiting , appeared to both of them three times as long as it really was .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 12]: At last he felt he was pounded and must try back .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 22]: `` You have discovered , '' he said , `` that the song is an imitation of Sir John Suckling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 11]: He had never thought of the man while writing it .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 16]: `` I do n't know anything of him , '' answered Hester , looking up .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 15]: Vavasor knew nothing was more unlikely than that she should know anything of him .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 7]: `` When did he write ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 15]: `` In the reign of Charles I. , I believe , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 24]: `` But tell me , '' said Hester , `` where is the good of imitating anyone -- even the best of writers .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 14]: Our own original , however poor , must be the thing for us !
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 10]: To imitate is to repudiate our own being . ''
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 40]: `` That I admit , '' answered Vavasor , who never did anything original except when he followed his instincts ; `` but for a mere trial of skill an imitation is admissible -- do n't you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 33]: `` Oh , surely , '' replied Hester ; `` only it seems to me a waste of time -- especially with such a gift as you have of your own ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 29]: `` At all events , '' said Vavasor , hiding his gratification with false humility , `` there was no great presumption in a shy at Suckling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 13]: `` There may have been the more waste , '' returned Hester .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 13]: `` I would sooner imitate Bach or even Handel than Verdi . ''
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 19]: Vavasor could stand a good deal of censure if mingled with some praise -- which he called appreciation .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 26]: Of this Hester had given him enough to restore his spirits , and had also suggested a subject on which he found he could talk .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 37]: `` But , '' he said , `` how can it be worse for me to imitate this or that writer , than for you to play over and over music you could easily excel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 20]: `` I never practice music , '' answered Hester , `` not infinitely better than I could write myself .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 10]: But playing is a different thing altogether from writing .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 13]: I play as I eat my dinner -- because I am hungry .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 17]: My hunger I could never satisfy with any amount of composition or extemporization of my own .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 15]: My land would not grow corn enough , or good enough for my necessity .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 26]: My playing merely corresponds to your reading of your favorite poets -- especially if you have the habit of reading aloud like my father . ''
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 36]: `` They do not seem to me quite parallel , '' rejoined Vavasor , who had learned that he lost nothing with Hester by opposing her -- so long as no moral difference was involved .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 55]: In questions of right and wrong he always agreed with her so far as he dared expression where he understood so little , and for that very reason , in dread of seeming to have no opinion of his own , made a point of differing from her where he had a safe chance .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 25]: `` One may read both poetry and music at sight , but you would never count such reading of music a reproduction of it .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 22]: That requires study and labor , as well as genius and an art _ like _ those which produce it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 38]: `` I am equally sure you can never read anything worth reading , '' returned Hester , `` as it ought to be read , until you understand it at least as well as the poet himself .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 32]: To do a poem justice , the reader must so have pondered phrase and word as to reproduce meaning and music in all the inextricable play of their lights and shades .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 24]: I never came near doing the kind of thing I mean with any music till I had first learned it thoroughly by heart .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 18]: And that too is the only way in which I can get to understand some poetry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 16]: `` But is it not one of the excellences of poetry to be easy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 15]: `` Yes , surely , when what the poet has to say is easy .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 16]: But what if the thoughts themselves be of a kind hard to put into shape ?
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 5]: There 's Browning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 46]: Of Browning Vavasor knew only that in his circle he was laughed at -- for in it a man who had made a feeble attempt or two to understand him , and had failed as he deserved , was the sole representative of his readers .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 33]: That he was hard to understand Hester knew , for she understood enough of him to believe that where she did not understand him he was perhaps only the better worth understanding .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 38]: She knew how , lover of music as she was , she did not at first care for Bach ; and how in the process of learning to play what he wrote she came to understand him .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 14]: To her reference to Browning then , Vavasor did not venture a reply .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 15]: None of the poetry indeed by him cultivated was of any sort requiring study .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 30]: The difficulty Hester found in his song came of her trying to see more than was there ; her eyes made holes in it , and saw the less .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 37]: Vavasor 's mental condition was much like that of one living in a vacuum or sphere of nothing , in which the sole objects must be such as he was creator enough to project from himself .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 27]: He had no feeling that he was in the heart of a crowded universe , between all whose great verities moved countless small and smaller truths .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 26]: Little notion had he that to learn these after the measure of their importance , was his business , with eternity to do it in !
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 22]: He made of himself but a cock , set for a while on the world 's heap to scratch and pick .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 45]: When he was gone , leaving his manuscript behind him , Hester set to it again , and trying the music over , was by it so far enlightened that she despaired of finding anything in it , and felt a good deal disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 23]: For she was continuing to gather interest in Vavasor , though slowly , as was natural with a girl of her character .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 41]: But she had no suspicion _ how _ empty he was , for it was scarcely possible for her to imagine a person indifferent to the truth of things , or without interest in his own character and its growth .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 26]: Being all of a piece herself , she had no conception of a nature all in pieces -- with no unity but that of selfishness .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 40]: Her nature did now and then receive from his a jar and shock , but she generally succeeded in accounting for such as arising from his lack of development -- a development which her influence over him would favor .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 21]: If she felt some special pleasure in the possession of that influence , who will blame her for the weakness ?
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 17]: Women are being constantly misled by the fancy and hope of being the saviours of men !
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 19]: It is natural to goodness and innocence , but not the less is the error a disastrous one .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 23]: There ought surely at least to be of success some probability as well founded as rare , to justify the sacrifices involved .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 21]: Is it well that a life of supreme suffering should be gone through for nothing but an increase of guilt ?
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 27]: It will be said that patience reaps its reward ; but I fear too many patiences fail , and the number of resultant saints is small .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 33]: The thing once done , the step no longer retrievable , fresh duty is born , and divine good will result from what suffering may arise in the fulfillment of the same .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 20]: The conceit or ambition itself which led to the fault , may have to be cured by its consequences .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 22]: But it may well be that a woman does more to redeem a man by declining than by encouraging his attentions .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 56]: I dare not say how much a woman is not to do for the redemption of a man ; but I think one who obeys God will scarcely imagine herself free to lay her person in the arms , and her happiness in the bosom of a man whose being is a denial of him .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 31]: Good Christians not Christians enough to understand this , may have to be taught by the change of what they took for love into what they know to be disgust .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 22]: It is very hard for the woman to know whether her influence has any real _ power _ over the man .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 28]: It is very hard for the man himself to know ; for the passion having in itself a betterment , may deceive him as well as her .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 25]: It might be well that a woman asked herself whether moral laxity or genuine self-devotion was the more persuasive in her to the sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 25]: If her best hope be to restrain the man within certain bounds , she is not one to imagine capable of any noble anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 23]: God cares nothing about keeping a man respectable ; he will give his very self to make of him a true man .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 13]: But that needs God ; a woman is not enough for it .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 12]: This can not be God 's way of saving bad men .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 3]: CHAPTER XV .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 4]: A SMALL FAILURE .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 47]: Vavasor at length found he must not continue to visit Hester so often , while not ready to go further ; and that , much as he was in love -- proportionately , that is , to his faculty for loving -- he dare not do .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 16]: But for the unconventionality of the Raymounts he would have reached the point long before .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 21]: He began , therefore , to lessen the number , and shorten the length of his appearances in Addison Square .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 40]: But so doing he became the more aware of the influence she had been exercising upon him -- found that he had come to feel differently about certain things -- that her opinion was a power on his consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 26]: He had nowise begun to change his way ; he had but been inoculated , and was therefore a little infected , with her goodness .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 21]: In his ignorance he took the alteration for one of great moral significance , and was wonderfully pleased with himself .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 24]: His natural kindness , for instance , towards the poor and suffering -- such at least as were not offensive -- was quickened .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 34]: He took no additional jot of trouble about them , only gave a more frequent penny to such as begged of him , and had more than a pennorth of relief in return .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 38]: It was a good thing , and rooted in a better , that his heart should require such relief , but it did not indicate any advanced stage of goodness , or one inconsistent with profoundest unselfishness .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 37]: He prided himself on one occasion that he had walked home to give his last shilling to a poor woman , whereas in truth he walked home because he found he had given her his last .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 35]: Yet there was a little more movement of the sap of his nature , as even his behavior in the bank would have testified , had there been any one interested in observing him .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 27]: Hester was annoyed to find herself disappointed when he did not appear , and betook herself to a yet more diligent exercise of her growing vocation .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 44]: The question suggested itself whether it might not further her plans to be associated with a sisterhood , but her family relations made it undesirable , and she felt that the angle of her calling could ill consent to be under foreign rule .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 43]: She began , however , to widen her sphere a little by going about with a friend belonging to a sisterhood -- not in her own quarter , for she did not wish her special work to be crossed by any prejudices .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 78]: There she always went alone , and seldom entered a house without singing in several of its rooms before she came away -- often having to sing some old song before her audience would listen to anything new , and finding the old song generally counted the best thing in her visit -- except by the children , to whom she would frequently tell a fairy tale , singing the little rhymes she made come into it .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 29]: She had of course to encounter rudeness , but she set herself to get used to it , and learn not to resent it but let it pass .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 58]: One coming upon her surrounded by a child audience , might have concluded her insensible of what was owing to herself ; but the feeling of what was owing to her fellows , who had to go such a long unknown way to get back to the image of God , made her strive to forget herself .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 41]: It is well that so many who lightly try this kind of work meet with so little encouragement ; if it had the result they desire , they would be ruined themselves by it , whatever became of their poor .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 74]: Hester 's chief difficulty was in getting the kind of song fit for her purpose ; and from it she gained the advantage of reading , or at least looking into , with more or less of reading as many of the religious poets recognized in our history as she could lay her hands upon ; where she failed in finding the thing she wanted , she yet often found what was welcome .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 42]: She would stop at nearly every book-stall she passed , and book-stalls were plentiful in her neighborhood , searching for old hymn-books and collections of poetry , every one of which is sure to have something the searcher never saw before .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 85]: About this time , in connection with a fresh and noble endeavor after bettering the homes of the poor originated , I had almost said _ of course _ , by a woman , the experiment was in several places made of gathering small assemblies of the poor in the neighborhood of their own dwellings , that the ladies in charge of the houses in which they lived might , with the help of friends , give them an unambitious but honestly attempted concert .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 21]: At one of these concerts Hester was invited to assist , and went gladly , prepared to do her best .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 89]: It had , however , been arranged that any of the audience who would like to sing , should be allowed to make their contributions also to the enjoyment of the evening ; and it soon became evident that the company cared for no singing but that of their own acquaintance ; and they , for their part , were so bent on singing , and so supported and called for each other , that it seemed at length the better way to abandon the platform to them .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 51]: There was nothing very objectionable in the character of any of the songs sung -- their substance in the main was flaunting sentiment -- but the singing was for the most part atrociously bad , and the resulting influence hardly what the projectors of the entertainment had had in view .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 48]: It might be well that they should enjoy themselves so ; it might be well that they should have provided for them something better than they could produce ; but , to judge from the experiment , it seemed useless to attempt the combination of the two .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 54]: Hester , having listened through a half-hour of their singing , was not a little relieved to learn that she would not be called upon to fulfil her engagement , and the company of benefactors went home foiled but not too much disappointed for a good laugh over their fiasco before they parted .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 28]: The affair set Hester thinking ; and before morning she was ready with a scheme to which she begged her mother to gain her father 's consent .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVI .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 4]: THE CONCERT ROOM .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 42]: The house in which they lived , and which was their own , was a somewhat remarkable one -- I do not mean because it retained almost all the old-fashionedness of a hundred and fifty years , but for other reasons .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 28]: Beside the ordinary accommodation of a good-sized London house with three drawing-rooms on the first floor it had a quite unusual provision for the receiving of guests .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 61]: At the top of the first landing , rather more than half-way up the stair , that is , there was a door through the original wall of the house to a long gallery , which led to a large and lofty room , apparently , from the little orchestra half-way up one of the walls , intended for dancing .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 33]: Since they had owned the house it had been used only as a playroom for the children ; Mr. Raymount always intended to furnish it , but had not yet done so .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 21]: The house itself was indeed a larger one than they required , but he had a great love of room .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 32]: It had been in the market for some time when , hearing it was to be had at a low price , he stretched more than a point to secure it .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 51]: Beneath the concert-room was another of the same area , but so low , being but the height of the first landing of the stairs , that it was difficult to discover any use that could be made of it , and it continued even more neglected than the other .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 18]: Below this again were cellars of alarming extent and obscurity , reached by a long vaulted passage .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 45]: What they could have been intended for beyond ministering to the dryness of the rooms above , I can not imagine ; they would have held coal and wood and wine , everything natural to a cellar , enough for one generation at least .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 8]: The history of the house was unknown .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 48]: There was a nailed-up door in the second of the rooms I have mentioned which was said to lead into the next house ; but as the widow who lived there took every opportunity of making herself disagreeable , they had not ventured to propose an investigation .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 28]: There was no garden , for the whole of the space corresponding to the gardens on each side was occupied with this addition to the original house .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 32]: The great room was now haunting Hester 's brain and heart ; if only her father would allow her to give in it a concert to her lowly friends and acquaintance !
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 64]: Questions concerning the condition of the poor in our large towns had , from the distance of speculation and the press , been of late occupying a good deal of Mr. Raymount 's attention , and he believed that he was enlightening the world on those most important perhaps of all the social questions of our day , their wrongs and their rights .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 26]: He little suspected that his daughter was doing more for the poor , almost without knowing it , than he with all his conscious wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 58]: She could not , however , have made her request at a more auspicious moment , for he was just then feeling specially benignant towards them , an article in which he had , as he believed , uttered himself with power on their behalf , having come forth to the light of eyes that very day .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 57]: Besides , though far from unprejudiced , he had a horror of prejudice , and the moment he suspected a prejudice , hunted it almost as uncompromisingly in himself as in another : most people surmising a fault in themselves rouse every individual bristle of their nature to defend and retain the thing that degrades them !
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 17]: He therefore speedily overcame his first reluctance , and agreed to his daughter 's strange proposal .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 21]: He was willing to make as much of an attempt towards the establishment of relations with the class he befriended .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 46]: It was an approach which , if not quite clear of condescension , was not therefore less than kindly meant ; and had his guests behaved as well as he , they would from that day have found him a friend as progressive as steady .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 12]: Hester was greatly delighted with his ready compliance with her request .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 15]: From that day for nearly a fortnight there were busy doings in the house .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 88]: At once a couple of charwomen were turned loose in the great room for a thorough cleaning , but they had made little progress with what might have been done , ere Mr. Raymount perceived that no amount of their cleaning could take away its dirty look , and countermanding and postponing their proceedings , committed the dingy place to painters and paperhangers , under whose hands it was wonderful to see how gradually it put on a gracious look fit to welcome the human race withal .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 39]: Although no white was left about it except in the ceiling for the sake of the light , scarce in that atmosphere , it looked as if twice the number of windows had been opened in its walls .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 37]: The place also looked larger , for in its new harmonies of color , one part led to another , introducing it , and by division the eye was enabled to measure and appreciate the space .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 20]: To Saffy and Mark their playroom seemed transformed into a temple ; they were almost afraid to enter it .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 19]: Every noise in it sounded twice as loud as before , and every muddy shoe made a print .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 48]: The day for the concert was at length fixed a week off , and Hester began to invite her poorer friends and neighbors to spend its evening at her father 's house , when her mother would give them tea , and she would sing to them .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 22]: The married women were to bring their husbands if they would come , and each young woman might bring a friend .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 28]: Most of the men , as a matter of course , turned up their noses at the invitation , but were nevertheless from curiosity inclined to go .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 15]: Some declared it impossible any house in that square should hold the number invited .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 13]: Some spoke doubtfully ; they _ might _ be able to go !
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 5]: they were not sure !
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 14]: and seemed to regard consent as a favor , if not a condescension .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 25]: Of these , however , two or three were hampered by the uncertainty as to the redemption of their best clothes from the pawnbroker .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 38]: In requesting the presence of some of the small tradespeople , Hester asked it as a favor : she begged their assistance to entertain their poorer neighbors ; and so put , the invitation was heartily accepted .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 36]: In one case at least , however , she forgot this precaution ; and the consequence was that the wife of a certain small furniture-broker began to fume on recognition of some in her presence .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 14]: While she was drinking her second cup of tea her eyes kept roving .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 58]: As she set it down , she caught sight of Long Tim , but a fortnight out of prison , rose at once , made her way out fanning herself vigorously , and hurried home boiling over with wrath -- severely scalding her poor husband who had staid from his burial-club that she might leave the shop .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 17]: The woman was not at all of a bad sort , only her dignity was hurt .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 34]: The hall and gallery were brilliantly lighted , and the room itself looked charming -- at least in the eyes of those who had been so long watching the process of its resurrection .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 25]: Tea was ready before the company began to arrive -- in great cans with taps , and was handed round by ladies and gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 13]: The meal went off well , with a good buzz of conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 88]: The only unpleasant thing was , that several of the guests , mindful like other dams of their cubs at home , slipped large pieces of cake into their pockets for their behoof ; but this must not be judged without a just regard to their ways of thinking , and was not a tenth part so bad as many of the ways in which well-bred persons appropriate slices of other people 's cakes without once suspecting the category in which they are doomed to find themselves .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 84]: When the huge urns and the remnants of food were at length removed , and the windows had been opened for a minute to change the air , a curtain rose suddenly at the end of the room , and revealed a small stage decorated with green branches and artificial flowers , in the center of it a piano , on the piano music , and at the piano Hester , now first seen , having reserved her strength for her special duty .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 20]: When the assembly caught sight of her turning over the leaves of her music , a great silence fell .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 12]: The moment she began to play , all began to talk .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 12]: With the first tone of her voice , every other ceased .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 45]: She had chosen a ballad with a sudden and powerfully dramatic opening , and , a little anxious , a little irritated also with their talking while she played , began in a style that would have compelled attention from a herd of cattle .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 32]: But the ballad was a little too long for them , and by the time it was half sung they had begun to talk again , and exchange opinions concerning it .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 29]: All agreed that Miss Raymount had a splendid voice , but several of those who were there by second-hand invitation could find a woman to beat her easily !
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 15]: Their criticisms were , nevertheless , not unfriendly -- in general condescending and patronizing .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 15]: I believe most of this class regarded their presence as a favor granted her .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 17]: Had they not come that she might show off to them , and receive their approbation !
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 34]: Amongst the poor the most refined and the coarsest-grained natures are to be met side by side -- egg-china and drain-tubing in the same shop -- just as in _ respectable _ circles .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 42]: The rudeness of the cream of society is more like that of the unwashed than that of any intermediate class ; while often the manners of the well-behaved poor are equalled by those only of the best bred in the country .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVII .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 4]: AN UNINVITED GUEST .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 8]: Vavasor had not heard of the gathering .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 23]: In part from doubt of his sympathy , in part from dislike of talking about doing , Hester had not mentioned it .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 47]: When she lifted her eyes at the close of her ballad , not a little depressed at having failed to secure the interest of her audience , it was with a great gush of pleasure that she saw near the door the face of her friend .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 16]: She concluded that he had heard of her purpose and had come to help her .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 28]: Even at that distance she could see that he was looking very uncomfortable , annoyed , she did not doubt , by the behavior of her guests .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 13]: A rush of new strength and courage went from heart to brain .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 28]: She rose and advancing to the front of the little stage , called out , in a clear voice that rang across the buzz and stilled it .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 12]: `` Mr. Vavasor , will you come and help me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 14]: Now Vavasor was in reality not a little disgusted at what he beheld .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 47]: He had called without a notion of what was going on , and seeing the row of lights along the gallery as he was making for the drawing-room , had changed his direction and followed it , knowing nothing of the room to which it led .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 62]: Blinded by the glare , and a little bewildered by the unexpectedness of the sight , he did not at first discern the kind of company he had entered ; but the state of the atmosphere was unaccountable , and for a moment it seemed as if , thinking to enter Paradise , he had mistaken and opened the left-hand door .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 24]: Presently his eyes coming to themselves , confirmed the fact that he was in the midst of a notable number of the unwashed .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 23]: He had often talked with Hester about the poor , and could not help knowing that she had great sympathy with them .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 35]: He was ready indeed as they were now a not unfashionable subject in some of the minor circles of the world 's elect , to talk about them with any one he might meet .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 71]: But in the poor themselves he could hardly be said to have the most rudimentary interest ; and that a lady should degrade herself by sending her voice into such ears , and coming into actual contact with such persons and their attendant disgusts -- except indeed it were for electioneering purposes -- exposing both voice and person to their abominable remarks , was to him a thing simply incomprehensible .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 49]: The admission of such people to a respectable house , and the entertainment of them as at a music hall , could have its origin only in some wild semi-political scheme of the old fellow , who had more crotchets in his head than brain could well hold !
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 9]: It was a proceeding as disgraceful as extraordinary !
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 2]: Puh !
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 11]: Could the tenth part of the air present be oxygen ?
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 13]: To think of the woman he worshipped being in such a hell !
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 38]: The woman he could honor little by any worship he gave her , was far more secure from evil eyes and evil thoughts in that company than she would have been in any drawing-room of his world .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 10]: Her angel would rather see her where she was .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 77]: But the glorious tones ceased , the ballad was at an end , and the next moment , to his dismay , the voice which in its poetry he had delighted to imagine thrilling the listeners in a great Belgravian drawing-room came to him in prose across the fumes of that Bloomsbury music hall , clear and brave and quiet , asking him , the future earl of Gartley , to come and help the singer !
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 5]: Was she in trouble ?
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 15]: Had her father forced her into the false position in which she found herself ?
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 14]: And did she seek refuge with him the moment he made his appearance ?
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 10]: Certainly such was not the tone of her appeal !
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 19]: But these reflections flashing through his brain , caused not a moment 's delay in Vavasor 's response .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 60]: With the perfect command of that portion of his being turned towards the public on which every man like him prides himself , and with no shadow of expression on his countenance beyond that of a perfect equanimity , he was instantly on his way to her , shouldering a path in the gentlest manner through the malodorous air .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 40]: `` This comes , '' he said to himself as he went , `` of her foolish parents ' receiving so little company that for the free exercise of her great talent she is driven to such as this !
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 9]: For song must have audience , however unfit !
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 6]: There was Orpheus with his !
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 5]: Genius was always eccentric !
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 41]: If he could but be her protection against that political father , that Puritan mother , and that idiotic brother of hers , and put an end to this sort of thing before it came to be talked about ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 25]: He grew bitter as with smiling face but shrinking soul he made his way through that crowd of his fellow-creatures whose contact was defilement .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 33]: He would have lost them all rather than a song of Hester 's -- and yet that he would on occasion have lost for a good rubber of whist with certain players !
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 14]: He sprang on the stage , and made her a rather low bow .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 29]: `` Come and sing a duet with me , '' she said , and indicated one on the piano before her which they had several times sung together .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 18]: He smiled what he meant to look his sweetest smile , and almost immediately their duet began .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 34]: They sang well , and the assembly , from whatever reason -- I fancy simply because there were two singing instead of one , was a little more of an audience than hitherto .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 22]: But it was plain that , had there been another rondo of the duet , most would have been talking again .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 19]: Hester next requested Vavasor to sing a certain ballad which she knew was a great favorite with him .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 32]: Inwardly protesting and that with vehemence against the profanation , he obeyed , rendering it so as could not have failed to please any one with a true notion of song .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 30]: His singing was , I confess , a little wooden , as was everything Vavasor did : being such himself , how could he help his work being wooden ?
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 16]: but it was true , his mode good , his expression in the right direction .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 10]: They were nevertheless all talking before he had ended .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 19]: After a brief pause , Hester invited a gentleman prepared for the occasion to sing them something patriotic .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 15]: He responded with Campbell 's magnificent song , `` Ye Mariners of England ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 7]: which was received with hearty cheers .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 39]: He was followed by another who , well acquainted with the predilections of his audience , gave them a specially sentimental song about a chair , which was not only heard in silence but followed by tremendous cheering .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 42]: Possibly it was a luxury to some who had no longer any grandfather to kick , to cry over his chair ; but , like the most part of their brethren , the poor greatly enjoy having their feelings gently troubled .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 27]: Thus the muse of the occasion was gradually sinking to the intellectual level of the company -- with a consequence unforeseen , therefore not provided against .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVIII .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 2]: CATASTROPHE .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 39]: For the tail of the music-kite -- the car of the music-balloon rather , having thus descended near enough to the earth to be a temptation to some of the walkers afoot , they must catch at it !
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 31]: The moment the last-mentioned song was ended , almost before its death-note had left the lips of the singer , one of the friends ' friends was on his feet .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 52]: Without a word of apology , without the shadow of a request for permission , he called out in a loud voice , knocking with his chair on the floor , `` Ladies an ' gen ` lemen , Mr. William Blaney will now favor the company with a song . ''
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 45]: Thereupon immediately a pale pock-marked man , of diminutive height , with high retreating forehead , and long thin hair , rose , and at once proceeded to make his way through the crowd : he would sing from the stage , of course !
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 24]: Hester and Vavasor looked at each other , and one whisper passed between them , after which they waited the result in silence .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 21]: The countenance approaching , kindled by conscious power and anticipated triumph , showed a white glow through its unblushing paleness .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 32]: After the singing one sometimes hears in drawing-rooms , there is little space for surprise that some of less education should think themselves more capable of fine things than they are .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 50]: Scrambling with knee and hand upon the stage , for the poor fellow was feeble , the moment he got himself erect with his face to the audience , he plunged into his song , if song it could be called , executed in a cracked and strained falsetto .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 32]: The result , enhanced by the nature of the song , which was extremely pathetic and dubiously moral , must have been excruciation to every good ear and every sensitive nature .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 26]: Long before the relief of its close arrived Hester had made up her mind that it was her part to protect her guests from such .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 72]: It was compensation no doubt to some present to watch the grotesque contortions of the singer squeezing out of him the precious pathos of his song -- in which he screwed his eyes together like the man in Browning 's `` Christmas Eve , '' and opened his mouth in a long ellipse in the middle of one cheek ; but neither was that the kind of entertainment she had purposed .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 38]: She sat ready , against the moment when he should end , to let loose the most thunderous music in her mental _ repertoire _ , annoyed that she had but her small piano on the stage .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 77]: Vanity , however , is as suspicious of vanity as hate is of hate , and Mr. Blaney , stopping abruptly in the middle of the long last note , and in doing so changing the word , with ludicrous result , from a song to a spoken one , screeched aloud , ere she could strike the first chord , `` I will now favor the company with a song of my own composure . ''
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 37]: But ere he had got his mouth into its singing place in his left cheek , Hester had risen and begun to speak : when she knew what had to be done , she never hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 34]: Mr. Blaney started , and his mouth , after a moment of elliptic suspense , slowly closed , and returned , as he listened , to a more symmetrical position in his face .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 30]: `` I am sorry to have to interfere , '' said Hester , `` but my friends are in my house , and I am accountable for their entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 21]: Mr. Blaney must excuse me if I insist on keeping the management of the evening in my own hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 10]: The vanity of the would-be singer was sorely hurt .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 37]: As he was too selfish for the briefest comparison of himself with others , it had outgrown all ordinary human proportion , and was the more unendurable that no social consideration had ever suggested its concealment .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 17]: Equal arrogance is rarely met save in a mad-house : there conceit reigns universal and rampant .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 32]: `` The friends as knows me , and what I can do , '' returned Mr. Blaney with calmness , the moment Hester had ended , `` will back me up .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 18]: I have no right to be treated as if I did n't know what I was about .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 13]: I can warrant the song home-made , and of the best quality .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 5]: So here goes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 28]: Vavasor made a stride towards him , but scarcely was the ugly mouth half screwed into singing-place , when Mr. Raymount spoke from somewhere near the door .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 23]: `` Come out of that , '' he shouted , and made his way through the company as fast as he could .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 12]: Vavasor drew back , and stood like a sentinel on guard .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 8]: Hester resumed her seat at the piano .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 42]: Blaney , fancying he had gained his point , and that , if he began before Mr. Raymount reached him , he would be allowed to end in peace , again got his mouth into position , and began to howl .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 48]: But his host jumping on the stage from behind , reached him at his third note , took him by the back of the neck , shoved him down , and walked him through the crowd and out of the room before him like a naughty boy .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 44]: Propelling him thus to the door of the house , he pushed him out , closed it behind him , and re-entering the concert-room , was greeted by a great clapping of hands , as if he had performed a deed of valor .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 39]: But , notwithstanding the miserable vanity and impudence of the man , it had gone to Hester 's heart to see him , with his low visage and puny form , in the mighty clutch of her father .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 26]: That which would have made most despise the poor creature the more , his physical inferiority , made her pity him , even to pain !
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 36]: The moment silence was restored , up rose a burly , honest-looking bricklayer , and said , `` I beg your pardon , miss , but will you allow me to make one remark ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 10]: `` Certainly , Mr. Jones , '' answered Hester .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 71]: `` It seems to me , miss , '' said Jones , `` as it 's only fair play on my part as brought Blaney here , as I 'm sorry to find behave himself so improper , to say for him that I know he never would ha ' done it , if he had n't have had a drop as we come along to this ` ere tea-party .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 28]: That was the cause , miss , an ' I hope as it 'll be taken into account , an ' considered a lucidation of his conduct .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 28]: It takes but very little , I 'm sorry to say , miss , to upset his behavior -- not more 'n a pint at the outside .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 7]: -- But it do n't last !
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 9]: bless you , it do n't last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 32]: he added , in a tone of extreme deprecation ; `` there 's not a morsel of harm in him , poor fellow -- though I says it as should n't !
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 21]: Not as the guv ` nor do anything more 'n his duty in puttin ' of him out -- nowise !
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 34]: I know him well , bein ' my wife 's brother -- leastways half-brother -- for I do n't want to take more o ' the blame nor by rights belong to me .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 30]: When he 've got a drop in his nob , it 's always for singin ' he is -- an ' that 's the worst of _ him _ .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 7]: Thank you kindly , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 13]: `` Thank _ you _ , Mr. Jones , '' returned Hester .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 10]: `` We 'll think no more of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 35]: Loud applause followed , and Jones sat down , well satisfied : he had done what he ought in acknowledging the culprit for his wife 's sake , and the act had been appreciated .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 24]: The order of the evening was resumed , but the harmony of the assembly once disturbed , all hope of quiet was gone .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 8]: They had now something to talk about !
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 21]: Everyone that knew Blaney felt himself of importance : had he not a superior right of opinion upon his behavior ?
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 8]: Nor was he without a few sympathizers .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 9]: Was he not the same flesh and blood ?
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 3]: they said .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 22]: After the swells had had it all their own way so long , why should n't poor Blaney have his turn ?
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 17]: But those who knew Hester , especially the women of them , were indignant with him .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 16]: Hester sang again and again , but no song would go quite to her mind .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 46]: Vavasor also sung several times -- as often , that is , as Hester asked him ; but inwardly he was disgusted with the whole affair -- as was natural , for could any fish have found itself more out of the water than he ?
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 22]: Everything annoyed him -- most of all that the lady of his thoughts should have addressed herself to such an assembly .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 12]: Why did she not leave it to him or her father !
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 20]: If it was not degrading enough to appear before such a canaille , surely to sing to them was !
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 23]: How could a woman of refinement , justifiable as was her desire for appreciation , seek it from such a repulsive assemblage !
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 34]: But Vavasor would have been better able to understand Hester , and would have met the distastes of the evening with far less discomposure , if he had never been in worse company .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 48]: One main test of our dealings in the world is whether the men and women we associate with are the better or the worse for it : Vavasor had often been where at least he was the worse , and no one the better for his presence .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 15]: For days a cloud hung over the fair image of Hester in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 27]: He called on the first possible opportunity to inquire how she was after her exertions , but avoided farther allusion to the events of the evening .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 29]: She thanked him for the help he had given her , but was so far from satisfied with her experiment , that she too let the subject rest .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 34]: Mr. Raymount was so disgusted , that he said nothing of the kind should ever again take place in his house : he had not bought it to make a music-hall of it !
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 20]: If any change was about to appear in Vavasor a change in the fortunes of the Raymounts prevented it .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 24]: What the common judgment calls _ luck _ seems to have odd predilections and prejudices with regard to families as well as individuals .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 37]: Some seem invariably successful , whatever they take in hand ; others go on , generation after generation , struggling without a ray of success ; while on the surface appears no reason for the inequality .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 25]: But there is one thing in which pre-eminently I do not believe -- that same luck , namely , or chance , or fortune .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 14]: The Father of families looks after his families -- and his children too .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIX .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 4]: LIGHT AND SHADE .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 19]: Light and shade , sunshine and shadow pursue each other over the moral as over the material world .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 24]: Every soul has a landscape that changes with the wind that sweeps its sky , with the clouds that return after its rain .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 8]: It was now the month of March .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 21]: The middle day of it had been dreary all over England , dreariest of all , perhaps , in London .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 37]: Great blasts had gone careering under a sky whose miles-thick vault of clouds they never touched , but instead hunted and drove and dashed earth-clouds of dust into all unwelcoming places , throats and eyes included .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 47]: Now and then a few drops would fall on the stones as if the day 's fierce misery were about to yield to sadness ; but it did not so yield ; up rose again a great blundering gust , and repentance was lost in rage .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 14]: The sun went down on its wrath , and its night was tempestuous .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 29]: But the next morning rose bright and glad , looking as if it would make up for its father 's wildness by a gentler treatment of the world .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 25]: The wind was still high , but the hate seemed to have gone out of it , and given place to a laborious jollity .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 44]: It swept huge clouds over the sky , granting never a pause , never a respite of motion ; but the sky was blue and the clouds were white , and the dungeon-vault of the world was broken up and being carted away .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 38]: Everything in the room where the Raymounts were one by one assembling to break their fast , was discolored and dark , whether with age or smoke it would have needed more than a glance to say .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 21]: The reds had grown brown , and the blues a dirty slate-color , while an impression of drab was prevalent .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 54]: But the fire was burning as if it had been at it all night and was glorying in having at length routed the darkness ; and in the middle of the table on the white cloth , stood a shallow piece of red pottery full of crocuses , the earnest of the spring .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 58]: People think these creatures come out of the earth , but there are a few in every place , and in this house Mark was one of such , who are aware that they come out of the world of thought , the spirit-land , in order to manifest themselves to those that are of that land .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 26]: Mr. Raymount was very silent , seemed almost a little gloomy , and the face of his wife was a shade less peaceful in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 15]: There was nothing the matter , only he had not yet learned to radiate .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 12]: It is hard for some natures to let their light shine .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 20]: Mr. Raymount had some light ; he let it shine mostly in reviews , not much in the house .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 13]: He did not lift up the light of his countenance on any .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 18]: The children were rosy , fresh from their baths , and ready to eat like breakfast-loving English .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 50]: Cornelius was half his breakfast ahead of the rest , for he had daily to endure the hardship of being at the bank by nine o'clock , and made the best of it by claiming in consequence an utter immunity from the _ petite norale _ of the breakfast-table .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 10]: Never did he lose a moment in helping anybody .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 39]: Even the little Saffy he allowed with perfect frigidity to stretch out a very long arm after the butter -- except indeed it happened to cross his plate , when he would sharply rebuke her breach of manners .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 31]: It would have been all the same if he had not been going till noon , but now he had hurry and business to rampart his laziness and selfishness withal .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 17]: Mark would sooner have gone without salt to his egg than ask Corney to pass it .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 26]: This morning the pale boy sat staring at the crocuses -- things like them peeping out of the spring-mould of his spirit to greet them .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 14]: `` Why do n't you eat your breakfast , Mark , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 4]: said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 12]: `` I 'm not hungry , mamma , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 9]: The mother looked at him a little anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 33]: He was not a very vigorous boy in corporeal matters ; but , unlike his father 's , his light was almost always shining , and making the faces about him shine .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 29]: After a few minutes , he said , as if unconsciously , his eyes fixed on the crocuses , `` I ca n't think how they come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 5]: `` They grow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 3]: said Saffy .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 25]: Said her father , willing to set them thinking , `` Did n't you see Hester make the paper flowers for her party ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 27]: `` Yes , '' replied Saffy , `` but it would take such a time to make all the flowers in the world that way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 24]: `` So it would ; but if a great many angels took it in hand , I suppose they could do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 8]: `` That ca n't be how ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 29]: said Saffy , laughing ; `` for you know they come up out of the earth , and there ai n't room to cut them out there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 17]: `` I think they must be cut out and put together before they are made ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 8]: said Mark , very slowly and thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 13]: The supposition was greeted with a great burst of laughter from Cornelius .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 32]: In the midst of a refined family he was the one vulgar , and behaved as the blind and stupid generally behave to those who see what they can not see .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 14]: Mockery is the share they choose in the motions of the life eternal !
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 8]: `` Stop , stop , Cornelius ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 4]: said his father .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 17]: `` I suspect we have a young philosopher where you see only a silly little brother .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 21]: He has , I fancy , got a glimpse of something he does not yet know how to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 33]: `` In that case , do n't you think , sir , '' said Cornelius , `` he had better hold his tongue till he does know how to say it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 28]: It was not often he dared speak so to his father , but he was growing less afraid of him , though not through increase of love .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 20]: His father looked at him a moment ere he replied , and his mother looked anxiously at her husband .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 23]: `` It _ would _ be better , '' he answered quietly , `` were he not among _ friends _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 11]: The emphasis with which he spoke was lost on Cornelius .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 12]: `` They take everything for clever the little idiot says ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 5]: he remarked to himself .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 17]: `` Nobody made anything of _ me _ when _ I _ was his age ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 6]: The letters were brought in .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 13]: Amongst them was one for Mr. Raymount with a broad black border .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 6]: He looked at the postmark .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 13]: `` This must be the announcement of cousin Strafford 's death ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 12]: `` Some one told me she was not expected to live .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 10]: I wonder how she has left the property ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 11]: `` You did not tell me she was ill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 4]: said his wife .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 8]: `` It went out of my head .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 20]: It is so many years since I had the least communication with her , or heard anything of her !
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 8]: She was a strange old soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 16]: `` You used to be intimate with her -- did you not , papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 3]: said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 7]: `` Yes , at one time .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 12]: But we differed so entirely it was impossible it should last .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 39]: She would take up the oddest notions as to what I thought , and meant , and wanted to do , and then fall out upon me as advocating things I hated quite as much as she did .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 8]: But that is much the way generally .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 20]: People seldom know what they mean themselves , and can hardly be expected to know what other people mean .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 21]: Only the amount of mental and moral force wasted on hating and talking down the non-existent is a pity . ''
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 19]: `` I ca n't understand why people should quarrel so about their opinions , '' said Mrs. Raymount .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 56]: `` A great part of it comes of indignation at not being understood and another great part from despair of being understood -- and that while all the time the person thus indignant and despairing takes not the smallest pains to understand the neighbor whose misunderstanding of himself makes him so sick and sore . ''
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 9]: `` What is to be done then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 3]: asked Hester .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 27]: `` Nothing , '' answered her father with something of a cynical smile , born of this same frustrated anxiety to impress his opinions on others .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 22]: He took up his letter , slowly broke the large black seal which adorned it , and began to read it .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 20]: His wife sat looking at him , and waiting , in expectation sufficiently mild , to hear its contents .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 32]: He had scarcely read half the first page when she saw his countenance change a little , then flush a little , then grow a little fixed , and quite inscrutable .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 21]: He folded the letter , laid it down by the side of his plate , and began to eat again .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 6]: `` Well , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 4]: said his wife .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 32]: `` It is not quite what I thought , '' he answered , with a curious smile , and said nothing more , but ate his toast in a brooding silence .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 36]: Never in the habit of _ making _ secrets , like his puny son , he had a strong dislike to showing his feelings , and from his wife even was inclined to veil them .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 17]: He was besides too proud to manifest his interest in the special contents of this letter .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 41]: The poor , but , because of its hopelessness , hardly indulged ambition of Mr. Raymount 's life , was to possess a portion , however small , of the earth 's surface -- if only an acre or two .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 25]: He came of families both possessing such property , but none of it had come near him except that belonging to the cousin mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 33]: He was her nearest relation , but had never had much hope of inheriting from her , and after a final quarrel put an end to their quarelling , had had none .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 18]: Even for Mammon 's sake Mr. Raymount was not the man to hide or mask his opinions .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 11]: He worshipped his opinions indeed as most men do Mammon .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 16]: For many years in consequence there had not been the slightest communication between the cousins .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 53]: But in the course of those years all the other relatives of the old lady had died , and , as the letter he now held informed him , he was after all heir to her property , a small estate in a lovely spot among the roots of the Cumberland hills .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 12]: It was attended by not a few thousands in government securities .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 44]: But while Mr. Raymount was not a money-lover in any notable sense -- the men are rare indeed of whom it might be said absolutely they do not love money -- his delight in having land of his own was almost beyond utterance .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 60]: This delight had nothing to do with the money value of the property ; he scarcely thought of that : it came in large part of a new sense of room and freedom ; the estate was an extension of his body and limbs -- and such an extension as any lover of the picturesque would have delighted in .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 13]: It made him so glad he could hardly get his toast down .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 29]: Mrs. Raymount was by this time tolerably familiar with her husband 's moods , but she had never before seen him look just so , and was puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 49]: The fact was he had never before had such a pleasant surprise , and sat absorbed in a foretaste of bliss , of which the ray of March sun that lighted up the delicate transparencies of the veined crocuses purple and golden , might seem the announcing angel .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 8]: Presently he rose and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 5]: His wife followed him .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 17]: The moment she entered his study behind him he turned and took her in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 8]: `` Here 's news , wifie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 13]: `` You 'll be just as glad of it as I am .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 6]: Yrndale is ours after all !
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 16]: -- at least so my old friend Heron says , and he ought to know !
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 6]: Cousin Strafford left no will .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 7]: He is certain there is none .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 32]: She persistently put off making one , with the full intention , he believes , that the property shall come to me , her heir at law and next of kin .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 16]: He thinks she had not the heart to leave it away from her old friend .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 3]: Thank God !
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 6]: It is a lovely place .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 11]: Nothing could have happened to give me more pleassure . ''
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 24]: `` I am indeed glad , Raymount , '' said his wife -- who called him by his family name on important occasions .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 15]: `` You always had a fancy for playing the squire , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 30]: `` A great fancy for a little room , rather , '' replied her husband -- `` not much , I fear , for the duties of a squire .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 20]: I know little of them ; and happily we shall not be dependent on the result of my management .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 21]: There is money as well , I am glad to say -- enough to keep the place up anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 23]: `` It would be a poor property , '' replied his wife with a smile , that could not keep itself up .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 15]: I have no doubt you will develop into a model farmer and landlord . ''
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 23]: `` You must take the business part -- at least till Corney is fit to look after it , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 19]: But his wife 's main thought was what influence would the change have on the prospects of Hester .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 24]: In her heart she abjured the notion of property having anything to do with marriage -- yet this was almost her first thought !
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 18]: Inside us are played more fantastic tricks than any we play in the face of the world .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 9]: `` Are the children to be told ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 5]: `` I suppose so .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 14]: It would be a shame not to let them share in our gladness .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 16]: And yet one hates to think of their talking about it as children will . ''
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 14]: `` I am not afraid of the children , '' returned his wife .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 9]: `` I have but to tell them not .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 11]: I am sure of Mark as if he were fifty .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 13]: Saffy might forget , but Mark will keep her in mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 19]: When she returned to the dining-room Cornelius was gone , but the rest were still at the table .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 24]: She told them that God had given them a beautiful house in the country , with hills and woods and a swift-flowing river .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 14]: Saffy clapped her hands , cried , `` Oh , mam_mah _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 13]: and could hardly sit on her chair till she had done speaking .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 11]: Mark was perfectly still , his eyes looking like ears .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 17]: The moment her mother ceased , Saffy jumped down and made a rush for the door .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 11]: `` Saffy , Saffy , where are you going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 4]: cried her mother .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 9]: `` To tell Sarah , '' answered Saffy .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 8]: `` Come back , my child . ''
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 11]: `` Oh , do let me run and tell Sarah !
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 9]: I will come back _ instantly _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 9]: `` Come here , '' insisted the mother .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 20]: `` Your papa and I wish you to say nothing whatever about it to _ any _ one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 4]: `` O-oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 22]: returned Saffy ; and both her look and her tone said , `` Where is the good of it then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 12]: as she stood by her mother 's side in momentary check .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 22]: Not a word did Mark utter , but his face shone as if it had been heaven he was going to .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 19]: No color , only light came to the surface of it , and broke in the loveliest smile .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 11]: When Mark smiled , his whole body and being smiled .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 11]: He turned and kissed Saffy , but still said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 11]: Hester 's face flushed a `` celestial rosy red . ''
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 17]: Her first thought was of the lovely things of the country and the joy of them .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 32]: Like Moses on mount Pisgah , she looked back on the desert of a London winter , and forth from the heart of a blustering spring into a land of promise .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 21]: Her next thought was of her poor : `` Now I shall be able to do something for them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 19]: too swiftly followed the conviction that now she would be able to do less than ever for them .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 6]: Yrndale was far from London !
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 30]: They could not come to her , and she could not go to them , except for an occasional visit , perhaps too short even to see them all .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 12]: If only her father and mother would let her stay behind !
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 13]: but that she dared hardly hope -- ought not perhaps to wish !
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 18]: It might be God 's will to remove her because she was doing more harm than good !
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 10]: She had never been allowed to succeed in anything !
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 10]: And now her endeavor would be at an end !
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 7]: So her pleasure was speedily damped .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 16]: The celestial red yielded to earthly pale , and the tears came in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 14]: `` You do n't like the thought of leaving London , Hester ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 14]: said her mother with concern : she thought it was because of Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 17]: `` I am very glad for you and papa , mother dear , '' answered Hester .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 18]: `` I was thinking of my poor people , and what they would do without me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 25]: `` Wait my child , '' returned her mother , `` I have sometimes found the very things I dreaded most serve me best .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 18]: I do n't mean because I got used to them , or because they did me good .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 12]: I mean they furthered what I thought they would ruin . ''
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 17]: `` Thank you , dear mother , you can always comfort me , '' rejoined Hester .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 11]: `` For myself I could not imagine anything more pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 7]: If only it were near London !
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 30]: -- or , '' she added , smiling through her tears , `` if one had n't a troublesome heart and conscience playing into each other 's hands ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 15]: She was still thinking of her poor , but her mother was in doubt .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 32]: * * * * * `` I suppose , father , '' said Cornelius , `` there will be no occasion for me to go to the bank any more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 29]: `` There will be more occasion than ever , '' answered his father : `` will there not be the more to look after when I am gone ?
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 12]: What do you imagine you could employ yourself with down there ?
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 21]: You have never taken to study , else , as you know , I would have sent you to Oxford .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 28]: When you leave the bank it will be to learn farming and the management of an estate -- after which you will be welcome to Yrndale . ''
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 5]: Cornelius made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 8]: His father 's words deeply offended him .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 26]: He was hardly good at anything except taking offense , and he looked on the estate as his nearly as much as his father 's .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 26]: True the father had not spoken so kindly as he might , but had he known his son , he would often have spoken severely .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 44]: From the habit of seeking clear and forcible expression in writing , he had got into a way of using stronger vocal utterances than was necessary , and what would have been but a blow from another , was a stab from him .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 18]: But the feelings of Cornelius in no case _ deserved _ consideration -- they were so selfish .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 15]: And now he considered that mighty self of his insulted as well as wronged .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 30]: What right had his father to keep from him -- from him alone , who had the first right -- a share in the good fortunes of the family ?
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 81]: He left the study almost hating his father because of what he counted his injustice ; and , notwithstanding his request that he would say nothing of the matter until things were riper , made not even an effort to obey him , but , too sore for silence , and filled with what seemed to him righteous indignation , took the first opportunity of pouring out everything to Vavasor , in a torrent of complaint against the fresh wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 59]: His friend responded to the communication very sensibly , trying , without exactly saying it , and without a shadow of success , to make him see what a fool he was , and congratulating him all the more warmly on his good fortune that a vague hope went up in him of a share in the same .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 133]: For Cornelius had not failed to use large words in making mention of the estate and the fortune accompanying it ; and in the higher position , as Vavasor considered it , which Mr. Raymount would henceforth occupy as one of the proprietors of England , therefore as a man of influence in his country and its politics , he saw something like an approximative movement in the edges of the gulf that divided him from Hester : she would not unlikely come in for a personal share in this large fortune ; and if he could but see a possibility of existence without his aunt 's money , he would , he _ almost _ said to himself , marry Hester , and take the risk of his aunt 's displeasure .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 24]: At the same time she would doubtless now look with more favor on his preference -- he must not yet say _ choice !
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 24]: _ There could be nothing insuperably offensive to her pride at least in his proposing to marry the daughter of a country squire .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 35]: If she were the heiress of a rich brewer , that is , of a brewer rich enough , his aunt would , like the rest of them , get over it fast enough !
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 33]: In the meantime he would , as Cornelius , after the first burst of his rage was over , had begged him , be careful to make no illusion to the matter .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 26]: Mr. Raymount went to look at his property , and returned more delighted with house , land , and landscape , than he had expected .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 27]: He seldom spoke of his good fortune , however , except to his wife , or betrayed his pleasure except by a glistening of the eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 35]: As soon as the warm weather came they would migrate , and immediately began their preparations -- the young ones by packing and unpacking several times a day a most heterogeneous assemblage of things .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 19]: The house was to be left in charge of old Sarah , who would also wait on Cornelius .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 3]: CHAPTER XX .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 3]: THE JOURNEY .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 10]: It was a lovely morning when they left London .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 34]: The trains did not then travel so fast as now , and it was late in the afternoon when they reached the station at which they must leave the railway for the road .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 29]: Before that the weather had changed , or they had changed their weather , for the sky was one mass of cloud , and rain was falling persistently .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 39]: They had been for some time in the abode of the hills , but those they were passing through , though not without wonder and strange interest , were but an inferior clan , neither lofty nor lovely .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 12]: Through the rain and the mist they looked lost and drear .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 37]: They were mostly bare , save of a little grass , and broken with huge brown and yellow gulleys , worn by such little torrents as were now rushing along them straight from the clouded heavens .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 20]: It was a vague sorrowful region of tears , whence the streams in the valleys below were forever fed .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 30]: This part of the journey Saffy had been sound asleep , but Mark had been standing at the window of the railway-carriage , gazing out on an awful world .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 14]: What would he do , he thought , if he were lost there ?
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 22]: Would he be able to sit still all night without being frightened , waiting for God to come and take him ?
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 39]: As they rushed along , it was not through the brain alone of the child the panorama flitted , but through his mind and heart as well , and there , like a glacier it scored its passage .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 24]: Or rather , it left its ghosts behind it , ever shifting forms and shadows , each atmosphered in its own ethereal mood .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 14]: Hardly thoughts were they , but strange other consciousnesses of life and being .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 50]: Hills and woods and valleys and plains and rivers and seas , entering by the gates of sight into the live mirror of the human , are transformed to another nature , to a living wonder , a joy , a pain , a breathless marvel as they pass .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 22]: Nothing can receive another thing , not even a glass can take into its depth a face , without altering it .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 29]: In the mirror of man , things become thoughts , feelings , life , and send their streams down the cheeks , or their sunshine over the countenance .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 41]: Before Mark reached the end of that journey , there was gathered in the bottom of his heart a great mass of fuel , there stored for the future consumption of thinking , and for reproduction in forms of power .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 6]: He knew nothing of it .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 5]: He took nothing consciously .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 7]: The things kept sinking into him .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 25]: The sole sign of his reception was an occasional sigh -- of which he could not have told either the cause or the meaning .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 10]: They got into their own carriage at the station .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 38]: The drive was a long and a tedious one , for the roads were rough and muddy and often steep , and Mr. Raymount repeatedly expressed his dissatisfaction , that they had not put four horses to .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 68]: For some time they drove along the side of a hill , and could see next to nothing except in one direction ; and when at length the road ran into a valley , and along the course of the swollen river , it was getting so dark , and the rain was coming down so fast , that they could see next to nothing at all .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 37]: Long before they reached their new home , Saffy and Mark were sound asleep , Hester was sunk in her own thoughts , and the father and mother sat in unbroken silence , hand in hand .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 46]: It was pitch-dark ere they arrived ; and save what she learned from the thousand musics of the swollen river along which they had been driving for the last hour , Hester knew nothing of the country for which she had left the man-swarming city .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 5]: Ah , that city !
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 5]: so full of fellow-creatures !
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 7]: so many of them her friends !
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 10]: and struggling in the toils of so many foes !
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 42]: Many sorrows had entered in at Hester 's ears ; tongues that had never known how to give trouble shape , had grown eloquent in pouring the tale -- of oppression oftener than want , into the bosom of her sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 32]: I do not say many tongues -- only many sorrows ; she knew from the spray that reached her on its borders , how that human sea tossed and raged afar .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 36]: Reading and interpreting the looks of faces and the meanings of actions around her by what she had heard , she could not doubt she had received but a too true sample of experiences innumerable .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 38]: One result was , that , young as was Hester , she no longer shrank from the thought of that invisible , intangible solvent in which the generations of man vanish from the eyes of their fellows .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 22]: She said to herself what a blessed thing was death for countless human myriads -- yea doubtless for the whole race !
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 43]: It looked sad enough for an end ; but then it was not the end ; while but for the thought of the change to some other mode of life , the idea of this world would have been unendurable to her .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 11]: `` Surely they are now receiving their evil things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 28]: Alas , but even now she felt as if the gulf of death separated her from those to whom it had been her painful delight to minister !
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 37]: The weeping wind and the moaning rush of the river , through which they were slowly moving toward their earthly paradise , were an orchestral part as of hautboys in the wailing harmony of her mood .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 23]: They turned and went through a gate , then passed through trees and trees that made yet darker pieces of the night .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 20]: By and by appeared the faint lights of the house , with blotchy pallors thinning the mist and darkness .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 5]: Presently the carriage stopped .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 14]: Both the children continued dead asleep , and were carried off to bed .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 19]: The father and mother knew the house of old time , and revived for each other old memories .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 39]: But to Hester all was strange , and what with the long journey , the weariness , the sadness , and the strangeness , it was as if walking in a dream that she entered the old hall .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 58]: It had a quiet , dull , dignified look , as if it expected nobody ; as if it was here itself because it could not help it , and would rather not be here ; as if it had seen so many generations come and go that it had ceased to care much about new faces .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 40]: Every thing in the house looked somber and solemn , as if it had not forgotten its old mistress , who had been so many years in it , and was such a little while gone out of it .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 36]: They had supper in a long , low room , with furniture almost black , against whose windows heavy roses every now and then softly patted , caught in the fringes of the rain gusts .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 70]: The dusky room , the perfect stillness within , the low mingled sounds of swaying trees and pattering rain without , the sense of the great darkness folding in its bosom the beauty so near and the moaning city miles upon miles away -- all grew together into one possessing mood , which rose and sank , like the water in a sea-cave , in the mind of Hester .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 35]: But who by words can fix the mood that comes and goes unbidden , like a ghost whose acquaintance is lost with his vanishing , whom we know not when we do not see ?
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 49]: A single happy phrase , the sound of a wind , the odor of the mere earth may avail to send us into some lonely , dusky realm of being ; but how shall we take our brother with us , or send him thither when we would ?
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 19]: I doubt if even the poet ever works just what he means on the mind of his fellow .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 12]: Sisters , brothers , we can not meet save in God .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 49]: But the nearest mediator of feeling , the most potent , the most delicate , the most general , the least articulate , the farthest from thought , yet perhaps the likest to the breath moving upon the soft face of the waters of chaos , is music .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 55]: It rose like a soft irrepressible tide in the heart of Hester ; it mingled and became one with her mood ; together swelling they beat at the gates of silence ; for life 's sake they must rush , embodied and born in sound , into the outer world where utterance meets utterance !
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 26]: She looked around her for such an instrument as hitherto had been always within her reach -- rose and walked around the shadowy room searching .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 23]: But there was no creature amongst the aged furniture -- nothing with a brain to it which her soul might briefly inhabit .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 16]: She returned and sat again at the table , and the mood vanished in weariness .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 8]: But they did not linger there long .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 15]: Fatigue made the ladies glad to be shown to the rooms prepared for them .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 25]: The housekeeper , the ancient authority of the place , in every motion and tone expressing herself wronged by their intrusion , conducted them .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 26]: Every spot they passed was plainly far more hers than theirs ; only law was a tyrant , and she dared not assert her rights !
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 14]: But she had allotted their rooms well , and they approved her judgment .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 21]: Weary as she was , Hester was charmed with hers , and the more charmed the more she surveyed it .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 21]: I will not spend time or space in describing it , but remember how wearisome and useless descriptions often are .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 53]: I will but say it was old-fashioned to her heart 's content ; that it seemed full of shadowy histories , as if each succeeding occupant had left behind an ethereal phantasmic record , a memorial imprint of presence on walls and furniture -- to which she now was to add hers .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 14]: But the old sleep must have the precedence of all the new things .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 45]: In weary haste she undressed , and ascending with some difficulty the high four-post bed which stood waiting for her like an altar of sleep for its sacrifice , was presently as still and straight and white as alabaster lady lying upon ancient tomb .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXI .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 4]: MOTHER AND DAUGHTER .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 21]: When she woke it was to a blaze of sunlight , but caught in the net of her closed curtains .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 14]: The night had passed and carried the tears of the day with it .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 16]: Ah , how much is done in the night when we sleep and know nothing !
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 4]: Things never stop .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 13]: The sun was shining as if he too had wept and repented .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 31]: All the earth beneath him was like the face of a child who has ceased to weep and begun to smile , but has not yet wiped away his tears .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 3]: Raindrops everywhere !
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 6]: millions upon millions of them !
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 10]: every one of them with a sun in it ?
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 16]: For Hester had sprung from her bed , and opened the eyes of her room .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 17]: How different was the sight from what she saw when she looked out in Addison square !
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 41]: If heaven be as different from this earth , and as much better than it , we shall be happy children -- except indeed we be but fit to stand in a corner , with our backs to the blessedness .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 81]: On each side she saw green , undulating lawn , with trees and meadows beyond ; but just in front the ground sloped rapidly , still in grass , grew steep , and fell into the swift river -- which , swollen almost to unwieldiness , went rolling and sliding brown and heavy towards the far off sea ; when its swelling and tumult were over it would sing ; now it tumbled along with a roaring muffled in sullenness .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 11]: Beyond the river the bank rose into a wooded hill .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 35]: She could see walks winding through the wood , here appearing , there vanishing , and , a little way up the valley , the rails of a rustic bridge that led to them .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 5]: It was a paradise !
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 42]: For the roar of London along Oxford street , there was the sound of the river ; for the cries of rough human voices , the soprano of birds , and the soft mellow bass of the cattle in the meadows .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 33]: The only harsh sound in this new world was the cry of the peacock , but that had somehow got the color of his tail in it , and was not unpleasant .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 7]: The sky was a shining blue .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 10]: Not a cloud was to be seen upon it .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 28]: Quietly it looked down , as if saying to the world over which it stood vaulted , `` Yes , you are welcome to it all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 17]: She thanked God for the country , but soon was praying to him for the town .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 60]: The neighborly offer of the country to console her for the loss of the town she received with alarm , hastening to bethink herself that God cared more for one miserable , selfish , wife-and-donkey-beating costermonger of unsavory Shoreditch , than for all the hills and dales of Cumberland , yea and all the starry things of his heavens .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 20]: She would care only as God cared , and from all this beauty gather strength to give to sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 12]: She dressed quickly , and went to her mother 's room .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 17]: Her father was already out of doors , but her mother was having breakfast in bed .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 13]: They greeted each other with such smiles as made words almost unnecessary .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 12]: `` What a _ lovely _ place it is , mamma !
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 13]: You did not say half enough about it , '' exclaimed Hester .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 16]: `` Was n't it better to let you discover for yourself , my child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 4]: answered her mother .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 24]: `` You were so sorry to leave London , that I would not praise Yrndale for fear of prejudicing you against it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 32]: `` Mother , '' said Hester , with something in her throat , `` I did not want to change ; I was content , and had my work to do !
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 11]: I never was one to turn easily to new things .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 30]: And perhaps I need hardly tell you that the conviction has been growing upon me for years and years that my calling is among my fellow-creatures in London ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 23]: She had never yet , even to her mother , spoken out plainly concerning the things most occupying her heart and mind .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 27]: Every one of the family , except Saffy , found it difficult to communicate -- and perhaps to Saffy it might become so as she grew .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 8]: Hester trembled as if confessing a fault .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 17]: What if to her mother the mere idea of having a calling should seem a presumption !
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 26]: `` Two things must go , I think , to make up a call , '' said her mother , greatly to Hester 's relief .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 39]: `` You must not imagine , my child , that because you have never opened your mind to me , I have not known what you were thinking , or have left you to think alone about it .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 14]: Mother and daughter are too near not to hear each other without words .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 24]: There is between you and me a constant undercurrent of communion , and occasionally a passing of almost definite thought , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 21]: We may not be aware of it at the time , but none the less it has its result . ''
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 5]: `` O mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 23]: cried Hester , overjoyed to find she thought them thus near to each other , `` I am _ so _ glad !
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 10]: Please tell me the two things you mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 23]: `` To make up a _ call _ , I think both impulse and possibility are wanted , '' replied Mrs. Raymount .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 15]: `` The first you know well ; but have you sufficiently considered the second ?
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 16]: One whose impulse or desire was continually thwarted could scarcely go on believing herself called .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 11]: The half that lies in an open door is wanting .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 21]: If a call come to a man in prison it will be by an angel who can let him out .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 7]: Neither does inclination always determine fitness .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 28]: When your father was an editor , he was astonished at the bad verse he received from some who had a genuine delight in good verse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 45]: `` I ca n't believe , mamma , '' returned Hester , `` that God gives any special gift , particularly when accompanied by a special desire to use it , and that for a special purpose , without intending it should be used .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 16]: That would be to mock his creature in the very act of making her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 18]: `` You must allow there are some who never find a use for their special gifts . ''
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 31]: `` Yes ; but may not that be that they have not sufficiently cultivated their gifts , or that they have not done their best to bring them into use ?
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 20]: Or may they not have wanted to use them for ends of their own and not of God 's ?
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 19]: I feel as if I must stand up against every difficulty lest God should be disappointed in me .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 20]: Surely any frustration of the ends to which their very being points must be the person 's own fault ?
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 25]: May it not be because they have not yielded to the calling voice that they are all their life a prey to unsatisfied longings ?
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 13]: They may have gone picking and choosing , instead of obeying . ''
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 24]: `` There must be truth in what you say , Hester , but I am pretty sure it does not reach every case .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 10]: At what point would you pronounce a calling frustrated ?
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 22]: You think yours is to help your poor friends : you are not with them now : is your calling frustrated ?
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 8]: Surely there may be delay without frustration !
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 15]: Or , is it for you to say when you are _ ready _ ?
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 5]: Willingness is not everything .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 13]: Might not one fancy her hour come when it was not come ?
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 16]: May not part of the preparation for work be the mental discipline of imagined postponements ?
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 46]: And then , Hester -- now I think I have found my answer -- you do not surely imagine such a breach in the continuity of our existence , that our gifts and training here have nothing to do with our life beyond the grave .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 15]: All good old people will tell you they feel this life but a beginning .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 34]: Cultivating your gift , and waiting the indubitable call , you may be in active preparation for the work in the coming life for which God intended you when he made you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 6]: Hester gave a great sigh .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 10]: Postponement indefinite is terrible to the young and eager .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 13]: `` That is a dreary thought , mother , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 8]: `` Is it , my child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 4]: returned her mother .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 24]: `` Painful the will of God may be -- that I well know , as who that cares anything about it does not !
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 7]: but _ dreary _ , no !
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 6]: Have patience , my love .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 48]: Your heart 's deepest desire must be the will of God , for he can not have made you so that your heart should run counter to his will ; let him but have his own way with you , and your desire he will give you .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 6]: To that goes his path .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 30]: He delights in his children ; so soon as they can be indulged without ruin , he will heap upon them their desires ; they are his too . ''
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 41]: I confess I have , chiefly by compression , put the utterance both of mother and of daughter into rather better logical form than they gave it ; but the substance of it is thus only the more correctly rendered .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 12]: Hester was astonished at the grasp and power of her mother .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 48]: The child may for many years have but little idea of the thought and life within the form and face he knows and loves better than any ; but at last the predestined moment arrives , the two minds meet , and the child understands the parent .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 17]: Hester threw herself on her knees , and buried her face in her mother 's lap .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 25]: The same moment she began to discover that she had been proud , imagining herself more awake to duty than the rest around her .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 20]: She began , too , to understand that if God has called , he will also open the door .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 19]: She kissed her mother as she had never kissed her before , and went to her own room .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXII .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 2]: GLADNESS .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 49]: Scarcely had she reached it , however , when the voices of the children came shouting along some corridor , on their way to find their breakfast : she must go and minister , postponing meditation on the large and distant for action in the small and present .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 32]: But the sight of the exuberance , the foaming overflow of life and gladness in Saffy , and of the quieter , deeper joy of Mark , were an immediate reward .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 29]: They could hardly be prevented from bolting their breakfast like puppies , in their eagerness to rush into the new creation , the garden of Eden around them .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 25]: But Hester thought of the river flowing turbid and swift at the foot of the lawn : she must not let them go loose !
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 10]: She told them they must not go without her .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 12]: Their faces fell , and even Mark began a gentle expostulation .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 36]: A conscientious elder sister has to bear a good many hard thoughts from the younger ones on whom , without a parent 's authority and reverence , she has to exercise a parent 's restraint .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 26]: Well for her if she come out of the trial without having gathered some needless severity , some seeming hardness , some tendency to peevishness !
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 23]: These weak evils are so apt to gather around a sense at once of the need and of the lack of power !
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 18]: `` No , Mark , '' she said , `` I can not let you go alone .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 17]: You are like two kittens , and might be in mischief or danger before you knew .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 17]: But I wo n't keep you waiting ; I will get my parasol at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 15]: I will attempt no description of the beauties that met them at every turn .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 14]: But the joy of those three may well have a word or two .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 20]: I doubt if some of the children in heaven are always happier than Saffy and Mark were that day .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 19]: Hester had thoughts which kept her from being so happy as they , but she was more blessed .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 21]: Glorious as is the child 's delight , the child-heart in the grown woman is capable of tenfold the bliss .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 24]: Saffy pounced on a flower like a wild beast on its prey ; she never stood and gazed at one , like Mark .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 24]: Hester would gaze till the tears came in her eyes ; There are consciousnesses of lack which carry more bliss than any possession .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 16]: Mark was in many things an exception -- a curious mixture of child and youth .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 12]: He had never been strong , and had always been thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 31]: When very small he used to have a sacred rite of his own -- I would not have called it a rite but that he made a temple for it .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 25]: Many children like to play at church , but I doubt if that be good : Mark 's rite was neither play nor church .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 35]: He would set two chairs in the recess of a window -- `` one for Mark and one for God '' -- then draw the window-curtains around and sit in silence for a space .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 20]: When a little child sets a chair for God , does God take the chair or does he not ?
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 15]: God is the God of little children , and is at home with them .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 19]: For Saffy , she was a thing of smiles and of tears just as they chose to come .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 27]: She had not a suspicion yet that the exercise of any operative power on herself was possible to her -- not to say required of her .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 34]: Many men and women are in the same condition who have grown cold and hard in it ; she was soft and warm , on the way to awake and distinguish and act .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 31]: Even now when a good thought came she would give it a stranger 's welcome ; but the first appeal to her senses would drive it out of doors again .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 52]: Before their ramble was over , what with the sweet twilight gladness of Mark , the merry noonday brightness of Saffy , and the loveliness all around , the heart of Hester was quiet and hopeful as a still mere that waits in the blue night the rising of the moon .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 20]: She had some things to trouble her , but none of them had touched the quick of her being .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 19]: Thoughtful , therefore in a measure troubled , by nature , she did not know what heart-sickness was .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 41]: Nor would she ever know it as many must , for her heart went up to the heart of her heart , and there unconsciously laid up store against the evil hours that might be on their way to her .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 27]: And this day her thoughts kept rising to Him whose thought was the meaning of all she saw , the center and citadel of its loveliness .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 40]: For if once the suspicion wake that God never meant the things that go to and fro in us as we gaze on the world , that moment is the universe worthless as a doll to a childless mother .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 15]: If God be not , then steam-engine and flower are in the same category .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 29]: No ; the steam-engine is the better thing , for it has the soul of a man in it , and the flower has no soul at all .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 10]: It can not mean if it is not meant .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 22]: It is God that means everything as we read it , however poor or mingled with mistake our reading may be .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 37]: And the soothing of his presence in what we call nature , was beginning to work on Hester , helping her toward that quietness of spirit without which the will of God can scarce be perceived .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIII .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 4]: DOWN THE HILL .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 45]: When Franks , the acrobat , and his family left Mrs. Baldwin 's garret to go to another yet poorer lodging , it was with heavy hearts : they crept silent away , to go down yet a step of the world 's stair .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 42]: I have read somewhere in Jean Paul of a curiously contrived stair , on which while you thought you were going down you were really ascending : I think it was so with the Frankses and the stair they were upon .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 34]: But to many the world is but a treadmill , on which while they seem to be going up and up , they are only serving to keep things going round and round .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 23]: I think God has more to do with the fortunes of the poor a thousand fold than with those of the rich .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 28]: In the fortunes of the poor there are many more changes , and they are of greater import as coming closer to the heart of their condition .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 45]: To careless and purblind eyes these fortunes appear on an almost dead level of toil and privation ; but they have more variations of weather , more chequers of sunshine and shade , more storms and calms , than lives passed on airier slopes .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 40]: Who could think of God as a God like Christ -- and other than such he were not Godand imagine he would not care as much for the family of John Franks as for the family of Gerald Raymount ?
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 19]: It is impossible to believe that he loves such as Cornelius or Vavasor as he loves a Christopher .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 6]: There must be a difference !
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 19]: The God of truth can not love the unlovely in the same way as he loves the lovely .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 41]: The one he loves for what he is and what he has begun to be ; the other he loves because he sorely needs love -- as sorely as the other , and must begin to grow lovely one day .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 26]: Nor dare we forget that the celestial human thing is in itself lovely as made by God , and pitiably lovely as spoiled by man .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 29]: That is the Christ-thing which is the root of every man , created in his image -- that which , when he enters the men , he possesses .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 29]: The true earthly father must always love those children more who are obedient and loving -- but he will not neglect one bad one for twenty good ones .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 37]: `` The Father himself loveth you because ye have loved me ; '' but `` There is more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth than over ninety and nine that need no repentance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 19]: The great joy is the first rush of love in the new-opened channel for its issue and entrance .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 23]: The Frankses were on the down-going side of the hill Difficulty , and down they must go , unable to help themselves .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 34]: They had found a cheaper lodging , but entered it with misgiving ; their gains had been very moderate since their arrival in London , and their expenses greater than in the country .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 20]: Also Franks was beginning to feel or to fancy his strength and elasticity not quite what they had been .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 27]: The first suspicion of the approach of old age and the beginning of that weakness whose end is sure , may well be a startling one .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 40]: The man has begun to be a nobody in the world 's race -- is henceforth himself but the course of the race between age and death -- a race in which the victor is known ere the start .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 19]: Life with its self-discipline withdraws itself thenceforth more to the inside , and goes on with greater vigor .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 10]: The man has now to trust and yield constantly .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 26]: He is coming to know the fact that he was never his own strength , had never the smallest power in himself at his strongest .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 36]: But he is learning also that he is as safe as ever in the time when he gloried in his might -- yea , as safe as then he imagined himself on his false foundation .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 17]: He lays hold of the true strength , makes it his by laying hold of it .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 44]: He trusts in the unchangeable thing at the root of all his strength , which gave it all the truth it had -- a truth far deeper than he knew , a reality unfathomable , though not of the nature he then fancied .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 24]: Strength has ever to be made perfect in weakness , and old age is one of the weaknesses in which it is perfected .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 31]: Poor Franks had not got so far yet as to see this , and the feeling of the approach of old age helped to relax the springs of his hopefulness .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 12]: Also his wife had not yet got over her last confinement .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 8]: The baby , too , was sickly .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 35]: And there was not much popular receptivity for acrobatics in the streets ; coppers came in slowly ; the outlay was heavy ; and the outlook altogether was of the gray without the gold .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 22]: But his wife 's words were always cheerful , though the tone of them had not a little of the mournful .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 15]: Their tone came of temperament , the words themselves of love and its courage .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 41]: The daughter of a gamekeeper , the neighbors regarded her as throwing herself away when she married Franks ; but she had got an honest and brave husband , and never when life was hardest repented giving herself to him .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 13]: For a few weeks they did pretty well in their new lodging .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 33]: They managed to pay their way , and had food enough -- though not quite so good as husband and wife wished each for the other , and both for their children .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 10]: The boys had a good enough time of it .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 11]: They had not yet in London exhausted their own wonder .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 29]: The constant changes around made of their lives a continuous novel -- nay , a romance , and being happy they could eat anything and thrive on it .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 33]: The lives of the father and mother over-vault the lives of the children , shutting out all care if not all sorrow , and every change is welcomed as a new delight .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 24]: Their parents , where positive cruelty has not installed fear and cast out love , are the divinities of even the most neglected .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 36]: They feel towards them much the same , I fancy , as the children of ordinary parents in the middle class -- love them more than children given over to nurses and governesses love theirs .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 66]: Nor do I feel certain that the position of the children of the poor , in all its oppression , is not more favorable to the development of the higher qualities of the human mind , such as make the least show , than many of those more pleasant places for which some religious moralists would have us give the thanks of the specially favored .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 61]: I suspect , for instance , that imagination , fancy , perception , insight into character , the faculty of fitting means to ends , the sense of adventure , and many other powers and feelings are more likely to be active in the children of the poor , to the greater joy of their existence , than in others .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 21]: These Frankses , too , had a strict rule over them , and that increases much the capacity for enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 79]: The father , according to his lights , was , as we have seen , a careful and conscientious parent , and his boys were strongly attached to him , never thought of shirking their work , and endured a good deal of hardness and fatigue without grumbling : their mother had opened their eyes to the fact that their father took his full share in all he required of them , and did his best for them .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 118]: They were greatly proud of their father one and all believing him not only the first man in his profession , but the best man that ever was in the world ; and to believe so of one 's parent is a stronger aid to righteousness than all things else whatever , until the day-star of the knowledge of the great Father goes up in the heart , to know whom , in like but better fashion , as the best more than man and the perfect Father of men , is the only thing to redeem us from misery and wrong , and lift us into the glorious liberty of the sons and daughters of God .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 16]: They were now reduced to one room , and the boys slept on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 25]: This was no hardship , now that summer was nigh , only the parents found it interfered a little with their freedom of speech .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 27]: Nor did it mend the matter to send them early to bed , for the earlier they went the longer were they in going to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 38]: At the same time they had few things to talk of which they minded their hearing , and to the mother at least it was a pleasure to have all her chickens in the nest with her .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 16]: One evening after the boys were in bed , the father and mother sat talking .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 31]: They had a pint of beer on the table between them , of which the woman tasted now and then that the man might imagine himself sharing it with her .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 7]: Silence had lasted for some time .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 11]: The mother was busy rough-patching a garment of Moxy 's .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 16]: The man 's work for the day was over , but not the woman 's !
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 7]: `` Well , I dunnow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 9]: he said at last , and there ceased .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 9]: `` What don ye know , John ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 26]: asked his wife , in a tone she would have tried to make cheerful had she but suspected it half as mournful as it was .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 13]: `` There 's that Mr. Christopher as was such a friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 20]: he said : '' -- you do n't disremember what he used to say about the Almighty and that ?
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 51]: You remember as how he used to say a man could no more get out o ' the sight o ' them eyes o ' hisn than a child could get out o ' sight o ' the eyes on his mother as was a watchin ' of him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 55]: `` Yes , John , I do remember all that very well , and a great comfort it was to me at the time to hear him say so , an ' has been many 's the time since , when I had no other -- leastways none but you an ' the children .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 42]: I often think over what he said to you an ' me then when I was down , an ' not able to hold my head up , nor feelin ' as if I should ever lift it no more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 7]: `` Well , I dunnow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 7]: said Franks , and paused again .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 80]: But this time he resumed , `` What troubles me is this : -- if that there mother as was a lookin ' arter her child , was to see him doin ' no better 'n you an ' me , an ' day by day gettin ' furder on the wrong way , I should say she wa n't much of a mother to let us go on in that ` ere way as I speak on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 35]: `` She might ha ' got her reasons for it , John , '' returned his wife , in some fear lest the hope she cherished was going to give way in her husband .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 27]: `` P ` r ` aps she might see , you know , that the child might go a little farther and fare none the worse .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 27]: When the children want their dinner very bad , I ha ' heerd you say to them sometimes , ` Now kids , ha ' patience .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 6]: Patience is a fine thing .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 17]: What if ye do be hungry , you ai n't a dyin ' o ' hunger .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 9]: You 'll wear a bit longer yet ! '
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 20]: Ai n't I heerd you say that John -- more 'n once , or twice , or thrice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 18]: `` There ai n't no need to put me to my oath like that , old woman !
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 11]: I ai n't a goin ' for to deny it !
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 32]: You need n't go to put it to me as if I was the pris ` ner at the bar , or a witness as wanted to speak up for him !
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 20]: -- But you must allow this is a drivin ' of it jest a _ leetle _ too far !
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 99]: Here we be come up to Lon ` on a thinkin ' to better ourselves -- not wantin ' no great things -- sich we do n't look for to get -- but jest thinkin ' as how it wur time ' -- as th ' parson is allus a tellin ' his prishioners , to lay by a shillin ' or two to keep us out o ' th ' workus , when ' t come on to rain , an ' let us die i ' the open like , where a poor body can breathe !
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 9]: -- that 's all as we was after !
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 45]: an ' here , sin ' ever we come , fust one shillin ' goes , an ' then another shillin ' goes as we brought with us , till we ` ai n't got one , as I may almost say , left !
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 8]: An ' there ai n't no luck !
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 48]: I ` stead o ' gitting more we git less , an ' that wi ' harder work , as is a wearin ' out me an ' the b ` ys ; an ' -- '' Here he was interrupted by a cry from the bed .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 15]: It was the voice of little Moxy , the Sarpint o ' the Prairies .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 9]: `` I ai n't wore out , father !
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 8]: I 'm good for another go . ''
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 10]: `` I ai n't neither , gov ` nor .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 10]: I got a lot more work in me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 11]: `` No , nor me , '' cried the third .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 5]: `` I likes London .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 24]: I can stand on my head twice as long as Tommy Blake , an he 's a year older 'n I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 26]: `` Hold your tongues , you rascals , an ' go to sleep , '' growled the father , pretending to be angry with them .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 25]: `` What right have you to be awake at this time o ' the night -- an ' i ' Lon ` on too ?
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 13]: It 's not like the country , as you very well know .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 18]: I ' the country you can do much as you like , but not in the town !
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 18]: There 's police , an ' them 's there for boys to mind what they 're about .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 33]: You 've no call to be awake when your father an ' mother want to be by theirselves -- a listenin ' to what they 've got to say to one another !
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 13]: Us two was man an ' wife afore you was born ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 10]: `` We was n't a listenin ' , father .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 11]: We was only hearin ' 'cause we was n't asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 14]: An ' you did n't speak down as if it was secrets ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 62]: `` Well , you know , b ` ys , there 's things as fathers and mothers can understand an ' talk about , as no b ` y 's fit to see to the end on , an ' so they better go to sleep , an ' wait till their turn comes to be fathers an ' mothers theirselves .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 19]: -- Go to sleep direc ` ly , or I 'll break every bone in your bodies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 8]: `` Yes , father , yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 40]: they answered together , nowise terrified by the awful threat -- which was not a little weakened by the fact that they had heard it every day of their lives , and not yet known it carried into execution .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 44]: But having been thus advised that his children were awake , the father , without the least hypocrisy , conscious or unconscious , changed his tone : in the presence of his children he preferred looking at the other side of the argument .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 120]: After a few moments ' silence he began again thus : -- `` Yes , as you was sayin ' , wife , an ' I knows as you 're always in the right , if the right be anyhows to be got at -- as you was sayin ' , I say , there 's no sayin ' when that same as we was a speakin ' of -- the Almighty is the man I mean -- no sayin ' , I say , when he may come to see as we have , as I may say , had enough on it , an ' turn an ' let us have a taste o ' luck again !
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 67]: Luck 's sweet ; an ' some likes , an ' it may be as he likes to give his childer a taste o ' sweets now an ' again , just as you and me , that is when we can afford it , an ' that 's not often , likes to give ourn a bull 's - eye or a suck of toffy .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 37]: I do n't doubt _ he _ likes to see us enj ` yin ' of ourselves just as well as we like to see our little uns enj ` yin ' o ' _ theirselves !
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 14]: _ -- It stands to reason , wife -- do n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 11]: `` So it do seem to me , John ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 4]: answered the mother .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 54]: `` Well , '' said Franks , apparently , now that he had taken up the defence of the ways of the Supreme with men , warming to his subject , `` I dessay he do the best he can , an ' give us as much luck as is good for us .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 12]: Leastways that 's how the rest of us do , wife !
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 34]: We ca n't allus do as well as we would like for to do for our little uns , but we _ always _ , in general , does the best we can .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 36]: It may take time -- it may take time even with all the infl ` ence _ he _ has , to get the better o ' things as stands in _ his _ way !
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 19]: We 'll suppose yet a while , anyhow , as how he 's a lookin ' arter us .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 21]: It ca n't be for nothink as he counts the hairs on our heads -- as the sayin ' is !
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 16]: -- though for my part I never could see what good there was in it .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 30]: But if it ai n't for somethink , why it 's no more good than the census , which is a countin ' o ' the heads theirselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 75]: There are , or there used to be when I was a boy , who , in their reverence for the name of the Most High , would have shown horror at the idea that he could not do anything or everything in a moment as it pleased him , but would not have been shocked at all at the idea that he might not please to give this or that man any help .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 24]: In their eyes power was a grander thing than love , though it is nowhere said in the Book that God is omnipotence .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 34]: Such , because they are told that he is omnipotent , call him Omnipotence ; when told that he is Love , do not care to argue that he must then be loving ?
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 21]: But as to doing what he wills with a word -- see what it cost him to redeem the world !
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 19]: He did not find that easy , or to be done in a moment without pain or toil .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 7]: Yea , awfully omnipotent is God .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 45]: For he wills , effects and perfects the thing which , because of the bad in us , he has to carry out in suffering and sorrow , his own and his Son 's Evil is a hard thing for God himself to overcome .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 29]: Yet thoroughly and altogether and triumphantly will he overcome it ; and that not by crushing it underfoot -- any god of man 's idea could do that !
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 19]: -- but by conquest of heart over heart , of life in life , of life over death .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 27]: Nothing shall be too hard for the God that fears not pain , but will deliver and make true and blessed at his own severest cost .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 40]: For a time , then , the Frankses went on , with food to eat and money to pay their way , but going slowly down the hill , and finding it harder and harder to keep their footing .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 11]: By and by the baby grew worse , pining visibly .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 20]: They sought help at the hospital , but saw no Mr. Christopher , and the baby did not improve .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 16]: Still they kept on , and every day the husband brought home a little money .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 44]: Several times they seemed on the point of an engagement , but as often something came between , until at length Franks almost ceased to hope , and grew more and more silent , until at last he might well have appeared morose .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 23]: The wonder to me is that any such as do not hope in a Power loving to perfection , should escape moroseness .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 27]: Under the poisonous influences of anxiety , a loving man may become unkind , even cruel to the very persons for whose sake he is anxious .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 35]: In good sooth what we too often count righteous care , but our Lord calls the care of the world , consumes the life of the heart as surely as the love of money .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 8]: At the root they are the same .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 56]: Yet evil thing as anxiety is , it were a more evil thing to be delivered from it by anything but the faith of the Son of God -- that is faith in his Father and our Father ; it would be but another and worse , because more comfortable form of the same slavery .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 36]: Poor Franks , however , with but a little philosophy , had much affection , which is indeed the present God in a man -- and so did not go far in the evil direction .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 52]: The worse sign of his degenerating temper was the more frequently muttered oath of impatience with his boys -- never with his wife ; and not one of them was a moment uneasy in consequence -- only when the _ gov ` nor _ was n't jolly , neither were they .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 69]: The mind of Franks , so it appears to me , was mainly a slow sullen stream of subthought , a something neither thought nor feeling but partaking of the character of both , a something more than either , namely , the substance of which both are formed -- the undeveloped elemental life , risen a little way , and but a little way , towards consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 23]: The swifter flow of this stream is passion , the gleams of it where it ripples into the light , are thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 11]: This sort of nature can endure much without being unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 13]: What would crush a swift-thinking man is upborne by the denser tide .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 13]: Its conditions are gloomier , and it consorts more easily with gloom .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 15]: But light and motion and a grand future are waiting for such as he .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 37]: All their sluggish half-slumberous being will be roused and wrought into conscious life -- nor the unconscious whence it arises be therein exhausted , for that will be ever supplied and upheld by the indwelling Deity .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 49]: In his own way Franks was in conflict with the problems of life ; neither was he very able to encounter them ; but on the other hand he was one to whom wonders might safely be shown , for he would use them not speculatively but practically .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 31]: `` Nothing almost sees miracles but misery , '' perhaps because to misery alone , save it be to the great unselfish joy , is it safe to show miracles .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 33]: Those who must see ere they will believe , may have to be brought to the verge of the infinite grave that a condition fit for seeing may be effected in them .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 14]: `` Blessed are they who have not seen and yet have believed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIV .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 5]: OUT OF THE FRYING-PAN .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 26]: There is another person in my narrative whom the tide of her destiny seemed now to have caught and to be bearing more swiftly somewhither .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 94]: Unable , as she concluded , any longer to endure a life bounded by the espionage , distrust , and ill-tempered rebuke of the two wretched dragons whose misery was their best friend -- saving them from foreboded want by killing them while yet they had something to live upon -- Amy Amber did at last as she had threatened , and one morning when , in amazement that she was so late , they called her , they received no answer , neither could find her in or out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 26]: She had applied to a friend in London , and following her advice , had taken the cheap train overnight , and gone to her .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 54]: She met her , took her home ; and helped her in seeking a situation -- with the result that , before many days were over , her appearance and manners being altogether in her favor , she obtained her desire -- a place behind a counter in one of the largest shops .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 38]: There she was kept hard at work , and the hours of business were long ; but the labor was by no means too much for the fine health and spirits which now blossomed in her threefold .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 73]: Her aunts raised an outcry of horror and dismay first , then of reprobation , accusing her of many things , and among the rest of those faults of which they were in reality themselves guilty toward her ; for as to the gratitude and affection we are so ready to claim and so slow to pay , the debt was great on their part , and very small indeed on hers .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 69]: They wrote to her guardians of course to acquaint them with the shocking fact of her flight , but dwelt far more upon the badness of her behavior to them from the first , the rapidity with which she had deteriorated , and the ghastliness of their convictions as to the depth of the degradation she had preferred to the shelter of their -- very moth-eaten -- wings .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 22]: The younger of the two guardians was a man of business , and at once took proper measures for discovering her .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 16]: It was not , however , before the lapse of several months that he succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 51]: By that time her employers were so well satisfied with her , that after an interview with them , followed by one with the girl herself , he was convinced that she was much better where she was than with her aunts , whose dispositions were not unknown to him .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 7]: So he left her in peace .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 34]: Knowing nothing of London , interested in all she saw , and much occupied with her new way of life , Amy did not at once go to find her friend Miss Raymount .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 35]: She often recalled her kindness , often dreamed of the beautiful lady who had let her brush her hair , and always intended to seek her as soon as she could feel at leisure .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 13]: But the time wore away , and still she had not gone .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 37]: She continued a well behaved girl , went regularly to church on Sundays , had many friends but few intimates , and lived with the girl who had been her friend before her mother 's death .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 65]: Her new way of life was , no doubt , from its lack of home-ties , and of the restraining if not always elevating influences of older people , dangerous : no kite can soar without the pull of the string ; but danger is less often ruin than some people think ; and the propt house is not the safest in the row .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 44]: He who can walk without falling , will learn to walk the better that his road is not always of the smoothest ; and , as Sir Philip Sidney says , `` The journey of high honor lies not in plain ways . ''
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 18]: Such were the respective conditions of Amy Amber and the Frankses , when the Raymounts left London .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 19]: The shades were gathering around the family ; the girl had passed from the shadow into the shine .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 18]: Hester knew nothing of the state of either , nor had they ever belonged to her flock .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 37]: It was not at all for them she was troubled in the midst of the peace and rest of her new life when she felt like a shepherd compelled to leave his sheep in the wilderness .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 52]: Amid the sweet delights of sunshine , room , air , grass , trees , flowers , music , and the precious stores of an old library , every now and then she would all at once imagine herself a herald that had turned aside into the garden of the enchantress .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 16]: Were not her poor friends the more sorely tried that she was dwelling at ease ?
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 5]: Could it be right ?
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 13]: Yet for the present she could see no way of reaching them .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 28]: All she could do for them was to cultivate her gifts , in the hope of one day returning to them the more valuable for the separation .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 26]: One good thing that came of the change was that she and her father were drawn in the quiet of this country life closer together .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 32]: When Mr. Raymount 's hours of writing were over , he missed the more busy life into which he had been able to turn at will , and needed a companion .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 25]: His wife not being able to go with him , he naturally turned to his daughter , and they took their walks abroad together .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 6]: In these Hester learned much .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 23]: Her father was not chiefly occupied with the best things , but he was both of a learning and a teaching nature .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 43]: There are few that in any true sense can be said to be alive : of Mr. Raymount it might be said that he was coming alive ; and it was no small consolation to Hester to get thus nearer to him .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 58]: Like the rest of his children she had been a little afraid of him , and fear , though it may dig deeper the foundations of love , chokes its passages ; she was astonished to find before a month was over , how much of companions as well as friends they had become to each other .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 13]: Most fathers know little of their sons and less of their daughters .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 33]: Because familiar with every feature of their faces , every movement of their bodies , and the character of their every habitual pose , they take it for granted they know them !
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 32]: Doubtless knowledge of the person does through the body pass into the beholder , but there are few parents who might not make discoveries in their children which would surprise them .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 11]: Some such discoveries Mr. Raymount began to make in Hester .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 20]: She kept up a steady correspondence with Miss Dasomma , and that also was a great help to her .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 17]: She had a note now and then from Mr. Vavasor , and that was no help .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 10]: A little present of music was generally its pretext .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 50]: He dared not trust himself to write to her about anything else -- not from the fear of saying more than was prudent , but because , not even yet feeling to know what she would think about this or that , he was afraid of encountering her disapprobation .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 18]: In music he thought he did understand her , but was in truth far from understanding her .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 22]: For to understand a person in any one thing , we must at least be capable of understanding him in everything .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 39]: Even the bits of news he ventured to send her , all concerned the musical world -- except when he referred now and then to Cornelius he never omitted to mention his having been to his aunt 's .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 82]: Hester was always glad when she saw his writing , and always disappointed with the letter -- she could hardly have said why , for she never expected it to go beyond the surfaces of things : he was not yet sufficiently at home with her , she thought , to lay open the stores of his heart and mind -- as he would doubtless have been able to do more readily had he had a sister to draw him out !
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 65]: Vavasor found himself in her absence haunted with her face , her form , her voice , her song , her music , -- sometimes with the peace and power of her presence , and the uplifting influence she exercised upon him , It is possible for a man to fall in love with a woman he is centuries from being able to understand .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 21]: But how the form of such a woman must be dwarfed in the camera of such a man 's mind !
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 18]: It is the falsehood of the silliest poetry to say he defies the image of his beloved .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 11]: He is but a telescope turned wrong end upon her .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 42]: If such a man could see such a woman after her true proportions , and not as the puppet he imagines her , thinking his own small great-things of her , he would not be able to love her at all .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 63]: To see how he sees her -- to get a glimpse of the shrunken creature he has to make of her ere , through his proud door , he can get her into the straightened cellar of his poor , pinched heart , would be enough to secure any such woman from the possibility of falling in love with such a man .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 43]: Hester knew that in some directions he was much undeveloped ; but she thought she could help him ; and had he thoroughly believed in and loved her , which he was not capable of doing , she could have helped him .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 45]: But a vision of the kind of creature he was capable of loving -- therefore the kind of creature he imagined her in loving her , would have been -- to use a low but expressive phrase -- _ a sickener to her _ .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 55]: At length , in one of his brief communications , he mentioned that his yearly resurrection was at hand -- his butterfly-month he called it -- when he ceased for the time to be a caterpillar , and became a creature of the upper world , reveling in the light and air of summer .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 22]: He must go northward , he said ; he wanted not a little bracing for the heats of the autumnal city .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 19]: The memories of Burcliff drew him potently thither , but would be too sadly met by its realities .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 15]: He had an invitation to the opposite coast which he thought he would accept .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 38]: He did not know exactly where Paradise lay , but if he found it within accessible distance , he hoped her parents would allow him to call some morning and be happy for an hour or two .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 35]: Hester answered that her father and mother would be glad to see him , and if he were inclined to spend a day or two , there was a beautiful country to show him .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 18]: If his holiday happened again to coincide with Corney 's , perhaps they would come down together .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 19]: If he cared for sketching , there was no end of picturesque spots as well as fine landscapes .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 10]: Of music or singing she said not a word .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 9]: By return of post came a grateful acceptance .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 22]: About a week after , they heard from Cornelius that his holiday was not to make its appearance before vile November .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 22]: He did not inform them that he sought an exchange with a clerk whose holiday fell in the said undesirable month .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXV .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 6]: WAS IT INTO THE FIRE ?
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 38]: One lovely evening in the beginning of June , when her turn had come to get away a little earlier , Amy Amber thought with herself she would at last make an effort to find Miss Raymount .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 38]: In the hurry of escaping from Burcliff she left her address behind , but had long since learned it from a directory , and was now sufficiently acquainted with London to know how to reach Addison square .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 87]: Having dressed herself therefore in becoming style , for dress was one of the instincts of the girl -- an unacquirable gift , not necessarily associated with anything noble -- in the daintiest , brightest little bonnet , a well-made , rather gay print , boots just a little too _ auffallend _ , and gloves that clung closer to the small short hand than they had to cling to the bodies of the rodents from which they came , she set out for her visit .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 13]: In every motion and feeling , Amy Amber was a little lady .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 6]: She had not much experience .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 24]: She could not fail to show ignorance of some of the small ways and customs of the next higher of the social strata .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 20]: But such knowledge is not essential to ladyhood , though half-ladies think themselves whole ladies because they have it .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 20]: To become ladies indeed they have to learn what those things and the knowledge of them are really worth .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 44]: And there was another thing in which Amy was unlike many who would on the ground of mere social position have counted themselves immeasurably her superiors : she was incapable of being disagreeable , and from the thing in itself ill-bred recoiled instinctively .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 18]: Without knowing it , she held the main secret of all good manners : she was simple .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 15]: Many a one imitates simplicity , but Amy was simple -- _ one-fold _ .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 18]: She never put anything on , never wished to appear anything , never tried to look pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 20]: When cross , which she was sometimes , though very rarely , she tried to _ be _ pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 35]: If I could convey the idea of her , with her peaceful temperament and her sunshiny summer-atmosphere , most of my readers would allow she must have been an engaging and lovable little lady .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 18]: She got into an omnibus , and all the way distinguished herself by readiness to make room .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 22]: Can it be that the rarity of this virtue in England has to do with our living in a straitened island ?
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 11]: It _ ought _ to work in the contrary direction !
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 16]: The British lady , the British gentleman too , seems to cultivate a natural repellence .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 12]: Amy 's hospitable nature welcomed a fellow-creature even into an omnibus .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 11]: She found Addison square , and the house she sought .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 25]: It looked dingy and dull , for many of its shutters were closed , and there was an indescribable air of departure about it .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 10]: She knocked nevertheless , and the door was opened .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 9]: She asked if Miss Raymount was at home .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 28]: Now Sarah , with most of the good qualities of an old trustworthy family-servant , had all the faults as well , and one or two besides .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 26]: She had not been to Burcliff , consequently did not know Amy , else certainly she would not have behaved to her as she ought .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 27]: Many householders have not an idea how abominably the servants they count patterns of excellence comport themselves to those even to whom special attention is owing .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 24]: `` They are all out of town , miss , '' replied Sarah , '' -- except Mr. Cornelius , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 41]: At that moment Mr. Cornelius , on his way to go out , stepped on the landing of the stair , and stood for an instant looking down into the hall , wondering who it might be at the door .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 48]: From his position he could not see Amy 's face , and had he seen it , I doubt if he would have recognized her , but the moment he heard her voice he knew it , and hurried down his face in a glow of pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 30]: But as he drew near , the change in her seemed to him so great that he could hardly believe with his eyes what his ears had told him .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 31]: From the first , Corney , like every one else of the family , was taken with Amy , and Amy was not less than a little taken with him .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 13]: The former fact is not wonderful , the latter not altogether inexplicable .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 32]: No man needs flatter his _ vanity _ much on the ground of being liked by women , for there never yet was man but some woman was pleased with him .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 19]: Corney was good-looking , and , except with his own people , ready enough to make himself agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 63]: Troubled with no modesty and very little false shame , and having a perfect persuasion of the power of his intellect and the felicity of his utterance , he never lost the chance of saying a good thing from the fear of saying a foolish one ; neither having said a foolish one , did he ever perceive that such it was .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 19]: With a few of his own kind he had the repute of one who said very good things .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 46]: Amy , on her side , was ready to be pleased with whatever could be regarded as pleasant -- most of all with things intended to please , and was prejudiced in Corney 's favor through knowing less of him and more of his family .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 22]: Her face beamed with pleasure at sight of him , and almost involuntarily she stepped within the door to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 3]: `` Amy !
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 9]: Who would have thought of seeing you here ?
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 8]: When did you come to town ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 9]: he said , and shook hands with her .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 14]: `` I have been in London a long time , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 9]: Corney thought she looked as if she had .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 8]: `` How deuced pretty she is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 5]: he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 7]: Quite lady-like , by Jove . ''
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 17]: `` Come up-stairs , '' he said , `` and tell me all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 7]: He turned and led the way .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 9]: Without a second thought , Amy followed him .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 26]: Sarah stood for a moment with a stare , wondering who the lady could be : Mr. Cornelius was so much at home with her !
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 10]: and she had never been to the house before !
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 15]: `` A cousin from Australia , '' she concluded : they had cousins there .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 25]: Cornelius went into the drawing-room , Amy after him , and opened the shutters of a window , congratulating himself on his good luck .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 12]: Not often did anything so pleasant enter the stupid old place !
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 26]: He made her sit on the sofa in the half-dark , sat down beside her , and in a few minutes had all her story .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 37]: Moved by her sweet bright face and pretty manners , pleased with the deference , amounting to respect , which she showed him , he began to think her the nicest girl he had ever known .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 24]: For her behavior made him feel a large person with power over her , in which power she seemed pleased to find herself .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 12]: After a conversation of about half an hour , she rose .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 13]: said Corney , `` you 're not going already , Amy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 17]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied Amy , `` I think I had better go .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 10]: I am so sorry not to see Miss Raymount !
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 8]: She was very kind to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 11]: `` You must n't go yet , '' said Corney .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 8]: `` Sit down and rest a little .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 30]: Come -- you used to like music : I will sing to you , and you shall tell me whether I have improved since you heard me last . ''
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 12]: He went to the piano , and Amy sat down again .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 20]: He sang with his usual inferiority -- which was not so inferior that he failed of pleasing simple Amy .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 5]: She expressed herself delighted .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 32]: He sang half a dozen songs , then showed her a book of photographs , chiefly portraits of the more famous actresses of the day , and told her about them .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 36]: With one thing and another he kept her -- until Sarah grew fidgety , and was on the point of stalking up from the kitchen to the drawing-room , when she heard them coming down .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 15]: Cornelius took his hat and stick , and said he would walk with her .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 36]: Amy made no objection ; she was pleased to have his company ; he went with her all the way to the lodging she shared with her friend in a quiet little street in Kensington .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 56]: Before they parted , her manner and behavior , her sweetness , and the prettiness which would have been beauty had it been on a larger scale , had begun to fill what little there was of Corney 's imagination ; and he left her with a feeling that he knew where a treasure lay .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 39]: He walked with an enlargement of strut as he went home through the park , and swung his cane with the air of a man who had made a conquest of which he had reason to be proud .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVI .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 4]: WAITING A PURPOSE .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 10]: The hot dreamy days rose and sank in Yrndale .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 31]: Hester would wake in the morning oppressed with the feeling that there was something she ought to have begun long ago , and must positively set about this new day .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 22]: Then as her inner day cleared , she would afresh recognize her duty as that of those who stand and wait .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 50]: She had no great work to do -- only the common family duties of the day , and her own education for what might be the will of Him who , having made her for something , would see that the possibility of that something should not be wanting .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 49]: In the heat of the day she would seek a shady spot with a book for her companion -- generally some favorite book , for she was not one of those who say of one book as of another -- `` Oh , I 've read that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 34]: It was some time before she came to like any particular spot : so many drew her , and the spirit of exploration in that which was her own was strong in her .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 63]: Under the shadow of some rock , the tent-roof of some umbrageous beech , or the solemn gloom of some pine-grove , the brooding spirit of the summer would day after day find her when the sun was on the height of his great bridge , and fill her with the sense of that repose in which alone she herself can work .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 35]: Then would such a quiescence pervade Hester 's spirit , such a sweet spiritual sleep creep over her , that nothing seemed required of her but to live ; mere existence was conscious well-being .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 7]: But the feeling never lasted long .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 32]: All at once would start awake in her the dread that she was forsaking the way , inasmuch as she was more willing to be idle , and rest in inaction .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 21]: Then would faith rouse herself and say : `` But God will take care of you in this thing too .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 22]: You have not to watch lest He should forget , but to be ready when He gives you the lightest call .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 7]: You have to keep listening . ''
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 97]: And the ever returning corrective to such mood came with the evening ; for , regularly as she went to bed at night and left it in the morning , she went from the tea-table in the afternoon to her piano , and there , through all the sweet evening movements and atmospheric changes of the brain -- for the brain has its morning and evening , its summer and winter as well as the day and the year -- would meditate aloud , or brood aloud over the musical meditations of some master in harmony .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 64]: And oftener than she knew , especially in the twilight , when the days had grown shorter , and his mother feared for him the falling dew , would Mark be somewhere in the dusk listening to her , a lurking cherub , feeding on her music -- sometimes ascending on its upward torrent to a solitude where only God could find him .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 32]: At such time the thought of Vavasor would come , and for a while remain ; but it was chiefly as one who would be a welcome helper in her work .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 47]: When for the time she had had enough of music , softly as she would have covered a child , she would close her piano , then glide like a bat into the night , and wander hither and thither through the gloom without conscious choice .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 86]: Then most would she think what it would be to have a man for a friend , one who would strengthen her heart and make her bold to do what was needful and right ; and if then the thoughts of the maiden would fall to the natural architecture of maidens , and build one or two of the airy castles into which no man has looked or can look , and if through them went flitting the form of Vavasor , who will wonder !
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 33]: It is not the building of castles in the steepest heights of air that is to be blamed , but the building of such as inspector conscience is not invited to enter .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 62]: To cherish the ideal of a man with whom to walk on her way through the world , is as right for a woman as it was for God to make them male and female ; and to the wise virgin it will ever be a solemn thought , lovelily dwelt upon , and never mockingly , when most playfully handled .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 17]: For there is a play even with most serious things that has in it no offense .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 19]: Humor has its share even in religion -- but oh , how few seem to understand its laws !
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 22]: I confess to a kind of foreboding shudder when even a clergyman begins to jest upon the borders of sacred things .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 18]: It is not humor that is irreverent , but the mind that gives it the wrong turn .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 17]: As we may be angry and not sin , so may we jest and not sin .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 26]: But there is a poor ambition to be married , which is , I fear , the thought most present with too many young women .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 37]: They feel as if their worth remained unacknowledged , as if there were for them no place they could call their own in society , until they find a man to take them under his wing .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 9]: She degrades womanhood who thinks thus of herself .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 44]: It says ill for the relation of father and mother if the young women of a family recoil from the thought of being married , but it says ill for the relation of parents and children if they are longing to be married .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 126]: One evening towards the end of July , when the summer is at its heat , and makes the world feel as if there never had been , and never ought to be anything but summer ; and when the wind of its nights comes to us from the land where the sun is not , to tell human souls that , dear as is the sunlight to their eyes , there are sweeter things far with which the sun has little to do -- Hester was sitting under a fir-tree on the gathered leaves of numberless years , pine-odors filling the air around her , as if they , too , stole out with the things of the night when the sun was gone .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 36]: It happened that a man came late in the day to tune her piano , and she had left him at his work , and wandered up the hill in the last of the sunlight .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 40]: All at once the wind awoke , and began to sing the strange , thin , monotonous Elysian ghost-song of the pine-wood -- for she sat in a little grove of pines , and they were all around her .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 10]: The sweet melancholy of the hour moved her spirit .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 40]: So close was her heart to that of nature that , when alone with it , she seldom or never longed for her piano ; she _ had _ the music , and did not need to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 15]: When we are very near to God , we do not desire the Bible .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 15]: When we feel far from him , we may well make haste to it .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 15]: Most people , I fear , wait till they are inclined to seek him .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 40]: They do not stir themselves up to lay hold on God ; they breathe the dark airs of the tomb till the morning break , instead of rising at once and setting out on their journey to meet it .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 35]: As she sat in music-haunted reverie , she heard a slight rustle on the dry carpet around her feet , and the next moment saw dark in the gloom the form of a man .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 13]: She was startled , but he spoke instantly ; it was Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 12]: She was still , and could not answer for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 10]: `` I am so sorry I frightened you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 9]: `` It is nothing , '' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 9]: `` Why ca n't one help being silly ?
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 15]: I do n't see why ladies should ever be frightened more than gentlemen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 25]: `` Men are quite as easily startled as ladies , '' he answered , `` though perhaps they come to themselves a little quicker .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 18]: Nothing is more startling than to find some one near when you thought you were alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 19]: `` Except , '' said Hester , `` finding yourself alone when you thought some one was near .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 8]: But how did you find me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 14]: `` They told me at the house you were somewhere in this direction .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 8]: Mark had followed you apparently some distance .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 17]: So I ventured to come and look for you , and -- something led me right .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 16]: But all the time I seem going to lose myself instead of finding you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 28]: `` It might be both , '' returned Hester ; `` for I do n't at all know my way with certainty , especially in the dusk .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 14]: We are on the shady side of the hill , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 27]: `` I can not have lost myself if I have found you , '' rejoined Vavasor , but did not venture to carry the speech farther .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 23]: `` It is time we were moving , '' said Hester , `` seeing we are both so uncertain of the way .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 10]: Who knows when we may reach the house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 15]: `` Do let us risk it a few minutes longer , '' said Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 5]: `` This is delicious .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 19]: Just think a moment : this my first burst from the dungeon-land of London for a whole year !
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 4]: This is paradise !
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 9]: I could fancy I was dreaming of fairyland !
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 30]: But it is such an age since you left London , that I fear you must be getting used to it , and will scarcely understand my delight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 23]: `` It is only the false fairyland of mechanical inventors , '' replied Hester , `` that children ever get tired of .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 56]: And yet I do n't know , '' she added , correcting herself ; `` it is true the things that delight Saffy are a contempt to Mark ; but I am sorry to say the things Mark delights in , Saffy says are so dull ; there is hardly a giant in them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 13]: As they talked Vavasor had seated himself on the fir-spoil beside her .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 36]: She asked him about his journey and about Cornelius ; then told him how she came to be there instead of at her piano , `` The tuner must have finished by this time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 13]: she said ; `` let us go and try his work ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 13]: So saying she rose , and was on her feet before Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 19]: The way seemed to reveal itself to her as they went , and they were soon at home .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 8]: The next fortnight Vavasor spent at Yrndale .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 22]: In those days Nature had the best chance with him she had yet had since first he came into her dominions .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 28]: For a man is a man , however he may have been `` dragged up , '' and however much injured he may be by the dragging .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 33]: Society may have sought to substitute herself for both God and Nature , and may have had a horrible amount of success : the rout of Comus see no beast-faces among them .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 20]: Yet , I repeat , man is potentially a man , however far he may be from actual manhood .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 14]: What one man has , every man has , however hidden and unrecognizable .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 11]: Who knows what may not sometimes be awakened in him !
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 33]: The most heartless scoffer may be suddenly surprised by emotion in a way to him unaccountable ; of all its approaches and all the preparation for it he has been profoundly unaware .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 33]: During that fortnight , Vavasor developed not merely elements of which he had had no previous consciousness , but elements in whose existence he could not be said to have really believed .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 30]: He believed in them the less in fact that he had affected their existence in himself , and thought he possessed what there was of them to be possessed .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 54]: The most remarkable event at once of his inner and outer history , and the only one that must have seemed almost incredible to those who knew him best , was , that one morning he got up in time to see , and for the purpose of seeing , the sun rise .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 12]: I hardly expect to be believed when I tell the fact !
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 15]: I am not so much surprised that he formed the resolution the night before .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 10]: Something Hester said is enough to account for that .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 43]: But that a man like him should already have got on so far as , in the sleepiness of the morning , to keep the resolve he had come to in the wakefulness of the preceding night , fills me with astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 7]: It was a great stride forward .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 10]: Nor was this all : he really enjoyed it !
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 66]: I do not merely mean that , as a victorious man , he enjoyed the conquest of himself when the struggle was over , attributing to it more heroism than it could rightly claim ; nor yet that , as any young human animal may , he enjoyed the clear invigorating clean air that filled his lungs like a new gift of life and strength .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 58]: He had poetry enough to feel something of the indwelling greatness that belonged to the vision itself -- for a vision and a prophecy it is , as much as when first it rose on the wondering gaze of human spirit , to every soul that through its eyes can see what those eyes can not see .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 37]: He felt a power of some kind present to his soul in the sight -- though he but set it down to poetic feeling , which he never imagined to have anything to do with fact .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 30]: It was in the so-called Christian the mere rudiment of that worship of the truth which in the old Guebers was developed into adoration of it in its symbol .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 30]: It was the drawing of the eternal Nature in him towards the naturing Eternal , whom he was made to understand , but of whom he knew so little .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 41]: When the evening came , after almost a surfeit of music , if one dare , un-self-accused , employ such a word concerning a holy thing , they went out to wander a little about the house in the twilight .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 45]: `` In such a still soft negative of life , '' he said , `` as such an evening gives us , really one could almost doubt whether there was indeed such a constantly recurring phenomenon in nature as I saw this morning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 9]: `` What did you see this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 5]: asked Hester , wondering .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 11]: `` I saw the sun rise , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 5]: `` Did you really ?
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 5]: I 'm so glad !
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 21]: That is a sight rarely seen in London -- at least if I may judge by my own experience . ''
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 12]: `` One goes to bed so late and so tired ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 4]: he replied simply .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 3]: `` True !
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 17]: and even if one be up in time , where could you see it from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 29]: `` I _ have _ seen it rise coming home from a dance ; but then somehow you do n't seem to have anything to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 17]: I have , however , often smelt the hay in the streets in the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 51]: Hester was checked by this mention of the hay -- as if the sun was something that belonged to the country , like the grass he withered ; but ere she had time to explain to herself what she felt , the next thing he said got her over it .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 16]: `` I assure you I felt as if I had never seen the sun before .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 13]: His way of getting up was a new thing to me altogether .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 14]: He seemed to mean shining -- and somehow I felt that he did .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 31]: In London he always looks indifferent -- just as if he had got it to do , and could n't help it , like everybody else in the horrible place .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 20]: Who is it that says -- ` God made the country , and man made the town ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 17]: `` I think it was Cowper , but I 'm not sure , '' answered Hester .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 9]: `` It ca n't be quite true though .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 16]: I suspect man has more to do with the unmaking than the making of either .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 25]: We have reason to be glad he has not come near enough to us yet to destroy either our river or our atmosphere . ''
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 8]: `` He is creeping on , though .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 12]: The quarries are not very far from you even now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 9]: `` The quarries do little or no harm .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 19]: There are a great many things man may do that only make nature show her beauty the more .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 42]: I have been thinking a good deal about it lately : it is the rubbish that makes all the difficulty -- the refuse of the mills and the pits and the iron-works and the potteries that does all the mischief . ''
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 5]: `` So it is !
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 30]: and worst of all the human rubbish -- especially that which gathers in our great cities , and gives so much labor in vain to clergyman and philanthropist ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 53]: Hester smiled -- not that she was pleased with the way Vavasor spoke , for she could not but believe he would in his _ rubbish _ include many of her dear people , but that she was amused at his sympathetic tone towards the clergy as generally concerned in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 82]: For she had had a little experience , and had listened to much testimony from such as knew , and firmly believed that the clergy were very near the root of the evil ; and that not with the hoe and weeder , but with the watering pot and artificial manure , helping largely to convert the poor -- into beggars , and the lawless into hypocrites , heaping cairn upon cairn on the grave of their poor prostrate buried souls .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 24]: But thank God , it is by the few , but fast increasing exceptions , that she knew what the rest were doing !
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 13]: But perhaps he meant only the wicked when he used the word .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 14]: `` What do you mean by the human rubbish , Mr. Vavasor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 13]: He saw he must be careful , and would fence a little .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 33]: `` Do n't you think , '' he said slowly , and measuring his words , `` that in the body politic there is something analogous to the waste in matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 24]: `` Certainly , '' she answered , `` only we might differ as to the persons who were to be classed in it .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 18]: I think we should be careful of our judgment as to when that state has been reached .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 18]: I fancy that is just the one thing the human faculty is least able to cope with .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 13]: None but God can read in a man what he really is .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 39]: It ca n't be a safe thing to call human beings , our own kith and kin , born into the same world with us , and under the same laws of existence , _ rubbish _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 13]: `` I see what you mean , '' said Vavasor to Hester .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 10]: But to himself said , `` Good heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 72]: `` You see , '' Hester went on -- they were walking in the dark dusk , she before him in a narrow path among the trees , whence she was able both to think and speak more freely than if they had been looking in each other 's face in the broad daylight -- `` you see , rubbish with life in it is an awkward thing to deal with .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 47]: Rubbish proper is that out of which the life , so far at least as we can see , is gone ; and this loss of life has rendered it useless , so that it can not even help the growth of life in other things .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 108]: But suppose , on the one hand , this rubbish , say that which lies about the mouth of a coal-pit , could be by some process made to produce the most lovely flowers , or that , on the other hand , if neglected , it would bring out the most horrible weeds of poison ; infecting the air , or say horrible creeping things , then the word _ rubbish _ would mean either too much or too little ; for it means what can be put to no use , and what is noxious by its mere presence , its ugliness and immediate defilement .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 20]: You see , Mr. Vavasor , I have been thinking a great deal about all this kind of thing .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 9]: It is my business in a way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 19]: `` But would you not allow that the time comes when nothing can be done with them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 29]: `` I will not allow it of any I have to do with , at least before I can say with confidence I have done all I can .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 10]: After that another may be able to do more .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 30]: And who shall say when God can do no more -- God who takes no care of himself , and is laboriously working to get his children home . ''
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 28]: `` I confess , '' said Vavasor , `` the condition of our poor in our large towns is the great question of the day . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 22]: -- which every one is waking up to _ talk _ about , '' said Hester , and said no more .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 81]: For , as one who tried to do something , she did not like to go on and say that if all who found the question interesting , would instead of talking about it do what they could , not to its solution but to its removal , they would at least make their mark on the _ rubbish _ - heap , of which not all the wind of words would in ten thousand years blow away a spadeful .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 14]: And yet is talk a less evil than the mischief of mere experimenters .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 15]: It is well there is the talk to keep many from doing positive harm .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 48]: It is not those who , regarding the horrors around them as a nuisance , are bent upon their destruction , who will work any salvation in the earth , but those who see the wrongs of the poor , and strive to give them their own .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 75]: Not those who desire a good report among men , nor those who seek an antidote against the tedium of a selfish existence , but those who , loving their own flesh and blood , and willing not merely to spend but to be spent for them , draw nigh them , being to being , will cause the light to rise upon such as now sit in darkness and the shadow of death .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 34]: Love , and love alone , as from the first it is the source of all life , love alone , wise at once and foolish as a child , can work redemption .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 21]: It is life drawing nigh to life , person to person , the human to human , that conquers death .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 20]: This -- therefore urges people to combine , seeking the strength of men , not the strength of God .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 12]: The result is as he would have it -- inevitable quarreling .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 11]: The unfit brought in for strength are weakness and destruction .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 21]: They want their own poor way , and destroy the work of their hands by the sound of their tongues .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 28]: Combinations should be for passing necessities , and only between those who can each do good work alone , and will do it with or without combination .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 23]: Whoever depends on combinations is a weakness to any association , society or church to which he may imagine himself to belong .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 11]: The more easily any such can be dissolved the better .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 19]: It is always by single individual communication that the truth has passed in power from soul to soul .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 22]: Love alone , and the obligation thereto between the members of Christ 's body , is the one eternal unbreakable bond .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 12]: It is only where love is not that law must go .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 27]: Law is indeed necessary , but woe to the community where love does not cast out -- where at least love is not casting out law .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 27]: Not all the laws in the universe can save a man from poverty , not to say from sin , not to say from conscious misery .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 10]: Work on , ye who can not see this .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 4]: Do your best .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 9]: You will be rewarded according to your honesty .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 55]: You will be saved by the fire that will destroy your work , and will one day come to see that Christ 's way , and no other whatever , can either redeem your own life , or render the condition of the poorest or the richest wretch such as would justify his creation .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 64]: If by the passing of this or that more or less wise law , you could , in the person of his descendant of the third or fourth generation , make a _ well-to-do _ man of him , he would probably be a good deal farther from the kingdom of heaven than the beggar or the thief over whom you now lament .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 28]: The criminal classes , to use your phrase , are not made up of quite the same persons in the eyes of the Supreme as in yours .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 37]: Vavasor began to think that if ever the day came when he might approach Hester `` as a suitor for her hand , '' he must be very careful over what he called her philanthropic craze .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 39]: But if ever he should in earnest set about winning her , he had full confidence in the artillery he could bring to the siege : he had not yet made any real effort to gain her affections .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 26]: Neither had he a doubt that , having succeeded , all would be easy , and he could do with her much as he pleased .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 10]: He had no anxiety concerning the philanthropic craze thereafter .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 33]: His wife , once introduced to such society as would then be her right , would speedily be cured of any such extravagance or enthusiasm as gave it the character of folly .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 51]: Under the influence of the lovely place , of the lovely weather , and of his admiration for Hester , the latent poetry of his nature awoke with increasing rapidity ; and , this reacting on its partial occasion , he was growing more and more in love with Hester .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 71]: He was now , to use the phrase with which he confessed the fact to himself , `` over head and ears in love with her , '' and notwithstanding the difficulties in his way , it was a pleasant experience to him : like most who have gone through the same , he was at this time nearer knowing what bliss may be than he had ever been before .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 40]: Most men have the gates once thus opened to them a little way , that they may have what poor suggestion may be given them , by their closing again , of how far off they are from them .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 3]: Very hard !
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 3]: Is it ?
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 18]: Then why in the name of God , will you not go up to them and enter ?
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 7]: You do not like the conditions ?
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 11]: But the conditions are the only natural possibilities of entrance .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 26]: Enter as you are and you would but see the desert you think to leave behind you , not a glimpse of a promised land .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 13]: The false can not inherit the true nor the unclean the lovely .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 35]: And it began to grow plain to him that now his aunt could no longer look upon the idea of such an alliance , as she must _ naturally _ have regarded it before .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 103]: It was a very different thing to see her in the midst of such grounds and in such a house , with all the old-fashioned comforts and luxuries of an ancient and prosperous family around her , and in that of a toiling _ litterateur _ in the dingy region of Bloomsbury , where everything was -- of course respectable in a way , but that way a very inferior and -- well , snuffy kind of way -- where indeed you could not dissociate the idea of smoke and brokers ' shops from the newest bonnet on Hester 's queenly head !
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 43]: If he could get his aunt to see her in the midst of these surroundings , then her beauty would have a chance of working its natural effect upon her , tuned here to `` its right praise and true perfection . ''
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 43]: She was not a jealous woman , and was ready to admire where she could , but not the less would keep even beauty at arm 's length when prudence recommended : here , thought Vavasor , prudence would hold her peace .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 13]: He would at least himself stand amid no small amount of justification .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 33]: By degrees , and without any transition marked of Hester , emboldened mainly by the influences of the soft dusky twilight , he came to speak with more warmth and nearer approach .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 24]: His heart was tuned above its ordinary pitch , and he was borne a captive slave in the triumph of Nature 's hour .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 77]: `` How strangely this loveliness seems to sink into the soul , '' he said one evening , when the bats were coming and going like thoughts that refuse to take shape and be shared , and when with intensest listening you could not be sure whether it was a general murmur of nature you heard , low in her sleep , or only the strained nerves of your own being imitating that which was not .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 46]: `` For the moment , '' he went on , `` you seem to be the soul of that which is around you , yet oppressed with the weight of its vastness , and unable to account for what is going on in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 11]: `` I think I understand you , '' returned Hester .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 28]: `` It is strange to feel at once so large and so small ; but I presume that is how all true feeling seems to itself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 42]: `` You are right , '' responded Vavasor ; `` for when one loves , how it exalts his whole being , yet in the presence of the woman he worships , how small he feels , and how unworthy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 20]: In the human being humility and greatness are not only correlative , but are one and the same condition .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 6]: But this was beyond Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 22]: For the first time in her life Hester felt , nor knew what it was , a vague pang of jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 47]: Whatever certain others may think , there are women who , having had their minds constantly filled with true and earnest things , have come for years to woman 's full dignity , without having even speculated on what it may be to be in love .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 36]: Such therefore are somewhat in the dark when first it begins to show itself within themselves : that it should be within them , they having never invited its presence , adds to their perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 25]: She was silent , and Vavasor , whose experience was scarcely so valuable as her ignorance , judged he might venture a little farther .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 33]: But with all his experience in the manufacture of compliments and in high-flown poetry , he was now at a loss ; he had no fine theories of love to talk from !
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 52]: Love was with him , _ at its best _ , the something that preceded marriage -- after which , whatever boys and girls might think , and although , of course , to a beautiful wife like Hester he could never imagine himself false , it must take its chance .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 68]: But as he sat beside God 's loveliest idea , exposed to the mightiest enchantment of life , little imagining it an essential heavenly decree for the redemption of the souls of men , he saw , for broken moments , and with half-dazed glimpses , into the eternal , and spoke as one in a gracious dream : `` If one might sit forever thus ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 20]: he said , almost in a whisper , -- `` forever and ever , needing nothing , desiring nothing !
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 8]: lost in perfect , in absolute bliss !
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 16]: so peacefully glad that you do not want to know what other joy lies behind !
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 32]: so content , that , if you were told there was no other bliss , you would but say , ' I am the more glad ; I want no other !
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 5]: I refuse all else !
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 11]: let the universe hear , and trouble me with none !
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 13]: This and nought else ought ever to be -- on and on !
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 5]: to the far-away end .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 23]: The very soul of me is music , and needs not the softest sound of earth to keep it alive . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 41]: At that moment came a sigh of the night-wind , and bore to their ears the whispered moan of the stream away in the hollow , as it broke its being into voice over the pebbly troubles of its course .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 26]: It came with a swell , and a faint sigh through the pines , and they woke and answered it with yet more ethereal voice .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 3]: `` Still !
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 3]: still ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 24]: said Vavasor , apostrophizing the river as if it were a live thing and understood him ; `` do not speak to me .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 10]: I can not attend even to your watery murmur .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 18]: A sweeter music , born of the motions of my own spirit , fills my whole hearing .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 14]: Be content with thy flowing , as I am content with my being .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 16]: Would that God in the mercy of a God would make this moment eternal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 7]: He ceased , and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 48]: Hester could not help being thrilled by the rhythm , moved by the poetic phrase , and penetrated by the air of poetic thought that pervaded the utterance -- which would doubtless indeed have entranced many a smaller woman than herself , yet was not altogether pleased .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 26]: Never yet had she reached anything like a moment concerning which even in transient mood she could pray , `` Let it last forever ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 24]: Nor was the present within sight of any reason why she should not wish it to make way for a better behind it .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 58]: But the show of such feeling in Vavasor , was at least the unveiling of a soul of song in him , of such a nature , such a relation to upper things that he must one day come to feel the highest , and know a bliss beyond all feeble delights of the mere human imagination .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 43]: She must not be captious and contrary with the poor fellow , she thought -- that would be as bad as to throw aside her poor people : he was afflicted with the same poverty that gave all the sting to theirs .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 21]: To be a true woman she must help all she could help -- rich or poor , nor show favor .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 13]: `` Thou shalt not countenance a poor man in his cause . ''
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 14]: `` I do not _ quite _ understand you , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 28]: `` I can scarcely imagine the time should ever come when I should wish it , or even be content that it should last for ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 9]: `` Have you had so little happiness ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 4]: he asked sympathetically .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 11]: `` I do not mean that , '' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 21]: `` Indeed I have had a great deal -- more than all but a very few , I should imagine .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 9]: But I do not think much of happiness .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 23]: Perhaps that is a sign -- I daresay it is -- that I have not had much of what is not happiness .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 20]: But no amount of happiness that I have known yet would make me wish the time to stand still .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 27]: I want to be always growing -- and while one is growing Time can not stand if he would : you drag him on with you !
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 25]: I want , if you would like it better put in that way , to be always becoming more and more capable of happiness .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 19]: Whether I have it or not , I must be and ought to be capable of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 14]: returned Vavasor , `` you are as usual out of sight beyond me .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 47]: You must take pity on me and carry me with you , else you will leave me miles behind , and I shall never look on you again ; and what eternity would be to me without your face to look at , God only knows .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 24]: There will be no punishment necessary for me but to know that there is a gulf I can not pass between us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 9]: `` But why should it be so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 5]: answered Hester almost tenderly .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 9]: `` Our fate is in our own hands .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 13]: It is ours to determine the direction in which we shall go .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 24]: I do n't want to preach to you , dear Mr. Vavasor , but so much surely one friend may say to another !
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 52]: Why should not every one be reasonable enough to seek the one best thing , and then there would be no parting ; whereas all the love and friendship in the world would not suffice to keep people together if they were inwardly parted by such difference as you imply . ''
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 81]: Vavasor 's heart was touched in two ways by this simple speech -- first , in the best way in which it was at the moment capable of being touched ; for he could not help thinking for a moment what a blessed thing it must be to feel good and have no weight upon you -- as this lovely girl plainly did , and live like her in perfect fearlessness of whatever might be going to happen to you .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 16]: Religion would be better than endurable in the company of such an embodiment of it !
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 14]: He might even qualify for some distinction in it with such a teacher !
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 25]: -- Second , in the way of self-satisfaction ; for clearly she was not disinclined to be on terms of closer intimacy with him .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 30]: And as she made the advance why should he not accept , if not the help , yet the offer of the help she had _ almost _ made ?
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 9]: That would and could bind him to nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 23]: He understood her well enough to have no slightest suspicion of any coquetry such as a fool like Cornelius would have imagined .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 15]: He was nevertheless a fool , also , only of another and deeper sort .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 9]: It needs brains to be a real fool !
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 27]: From that night he placed himself more than ever in the position of a pupil towards her , hoping in the natural effect of the intimacy .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 38]: To keep up and deepen the relation , he would go on imagining himself in this and that difficulty , such as he was never really in , or even quite knew that he was not in .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 24]: He was no conscious hypocrite in the matter -- only his intellect alone was concerned where he talked as if his being was .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 25]: No answer he could have had would have had the smallest effect on the man -- Vavasor only determined what he would say next .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 60]: Hester kept trying to meet him as simply and directly as she could , although to meet these supposed difficulties she was unconsciously compelled to transform them , in order to get a hold of them at all , into something the nearest like them that she understood -- still something very different from anything in Vavasor 's thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 19]: But what she said made no difference to him , so long as she would talk to him .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 20]: And talk she did , sometimes with an affectionate fervor of whose very possibility he had had no idea .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 35]: So long as she would talk , he cared not a straw whether she understood what he had said ; and with all her misconception , she understood it better than he did himself .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 48]: Thus her growing desire to wake in him the better life , brought herself into relations with him which had an earthly side , as everything heavenly of necessity has ; for this life also is God 's , and the hairs of our heads are numbered .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVII .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 4]: MAJOR H.G. MARVEL .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 109]: One afternoon when Vavasor was in his room , writing a letter to his aunt , in which he described in not too glowing terms , for he knew exaggeration would only give her a handle , the loveliness of the retreat among the hills where he was spending his holiday -- when her father was in his study , her mother in her own room , and the children out of doors , a gentleman was shown in upon her as she sat alone in the drawing-room at her piano , not playing but looking over some books of old music she had found in the house .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 11]: The servant apologized , saying he thought she was out .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 40]: The visitor being already in the room , the glance she threw on the card the man had given her had had time to teach her little or nothing with regard to him when she advanced to receive him .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 12]: The name on the card was _ Major H.G. Marvel _ .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 28]: She vaguely thought she had heard it , but in the suddenness of the meeting was unable to recall a single idea concerning the owner of it .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 26]: She saw before her a man whose decidedly podgy figure yet bore a military air , and was not without a certain grace of confidence .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 36]: For his bearing was even _ marked _ by the total absence of any embarrassment , anxiety , or any even of that air of apology which one individual seems almost to owe to another .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 18]: At the same time there was not a suspicion of truculence or even repulse in his carriage .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 16]: There was self-assertion , but not of the antagonistic -- solely of the inviting sort .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 6]: His person beamed with friendship .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 43]: Notably above the middle height , the impression of his stature was reduced by a too great development of valor in the front of his person , which must always have met the enemy considerably in advance of the rest of him .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 85]: On the top of rather asthmatic-looking shoulders was perched a head that looked small for the base from which it rose , and the smaller that it was an evident proof of the derivation of the word _ bald _ , by Chaucer spelled _ balled _ ; it was round and smooth and shining like ivory , and the face upon it was brought by the help of the razor into as close a resemblance with the rest of the ball as possible .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 102]: The said face was a pleasant one to look at -- of features altogether irregular -- a retreating and narrow forehead over keen gray eyes that sparkled with intelligence and fun , prominent cheek-bones , a nose thick in the base and considerably elevated at the point , a large mouth always ready to show a set of white , regular , serviceable teeth -- the only regular arrangement in the whole facial economy -- and a chin whose original character was rendered doubtful by its _ duplicity _ -- physical , I mean , with no hint at the moral .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 5]: `` Cousin Hester ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 11]: he said , advancing , and holding out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 6]: Mechanically she gave him hers .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 30]: The voice that addressed her was at once a little husky , and very cheery ; the hand that took hers was small and soft and kind and firm .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 14]: A merry , friendly smile lighted up eyes and face as he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 18]: Hester could not help liking him at first sight -- yet felt a little shy of him .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 27]: She thought she had heard her mother speak of a cousin somewhere abroad : this must be he -- if indeed she did remember any such !
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 62]: `` You do n't remember me , '' he said , `` seeing you were not in this world , wherever else you may have been , for a year or two after I left the country : and , to tell the truth , had I been asked , I should have objected to your appearance on any terms . ''
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 19]: As this speech did not seem to carry much enlightenment with it , he went on to explain .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 28]: `` The fact is , my dear young lady , that I left the country because your mother and I were too much of one mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 6]: `` Of one mind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 5]: said Hester , bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 9]: `` Ah , you do n't understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 20]: said the major , who was all the time standing before her with the most polite though confident bearing .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 38]: The thing you see , was this : I liked your mother better than myself , and so did she ; and without any jealousy of one another , it was not an arrangement for my happiness .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 37]: I had the choice between two things , stopping at home and breaking my heart by seeing her the wife of another man , and going away and getting over it the best way I could .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 31]: So you see I must by nature be your sworn enemy , only it 's of no use , for I 've fallen in love with you at first sight .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 35]: So now , if you will ask me to sit down , I will swear to let bygones be bygones , and be your true knight and devoted servant as long as I live .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 20]: How you do remind me of your mother , only by Jove , you 're twice as handsome . ''
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 47]: `` Do pray sit down , Mr. Marley -- '' `` Marvel , if you please , '' interrupted the major ; `` and I 'm sure it 's a great marvel if not a great man I am , after what I 've come through !
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 24]: But do n't you marvel at me too much , for I 'm a very good sort of fellow when you know me .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 32]: And if you could let me have a glass of water , with a little sherry just to take the taste off it , I should be greatly obliged to you .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 34]: I have had to walk farther for the sight of you than on such a day as this I find altogether refreshing : it 's as hot as the tropics , by George !
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 12]: But I am well repaid -- even without the sherry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 17]: As he spoke he was wiping his round head all over with a red silk handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 26]: `` I will get it at once , and let my mother know you are here , '' said Hester , turning to the door .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 20]: `` No , no , never mind your mother ; I daresay she is busy , or lying down .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 37]: She always went to lie down at this time of the day ; she was never very strong you know , though I do n't doubt it was quite as much to get rid of me .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 13]: I should n't wonder if she thought me troublesome in those days .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 15]: But I bear no malice now , and I hope she does n't either .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 6]: Tell her I say so .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 23]: It 's more than five and twenty years ago , though to me it do n't seem more than so many weeks .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 9]: Do n't disturb your mother , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 30]: But if you insist on doing so , tell her old Harry is come to see her -- very much improved since she turned him about his business . ''
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 26]: Hester told a servant to take the sherry and the water to the drawing-room , and , much amused , ran to find her mother .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 15]: `` There 's the strangest gentleman down-stairs , mamma , calling himself old Harry .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 11]: He 's having some sherry and water in the drawing-room !
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 9]: I never saw such an odd man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 9]: Her mother laughed -- a pleased little laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 17]: `` Go to him , Hester dear , and say I shall be down directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 10]: `` Is he really a cousin , mamma ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 9]: `` To be sure -- my second cousin !
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 9]: He was very fond of me once . ''
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 12]: `` Oh , he has told me all about that already .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 10]: He says you sent him about his business . ''
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 16]: `` If that means that I would n't marry him , it is true enough .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 15]: But he does n't know what I went through for always taking his part .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 16]: I always stood up for him , though I never could bear him near me .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 9]: He was such an odd , good-natured bear !
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 7]: such a rough sort of creature !
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 18]: always saying the thing he ought not to , and making everybody , ladies especially , uncomfortable !
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 14]: He never meant any harm , but never saw where fun should stop .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 15]: You would n't believe the vulgar things Harry would say out of pure fun !
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 25]: -- especially if he got hold of a very stiff old maid ; he would tease her till he got her in a passion .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 24]: But if she began to cry , then Harry had the worst of it , and was as penitent as any good child .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 11]: I daresay he 's much improved by this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 10]: `` He told me to tell you he was .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 15]: But if he is much improved -- well , what he must have been !
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 16]: I like him though , mamma -- I suppose because you liked him a little .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 21]: So take care you are not too hard upon him ; I 'm going to take him up now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 44]: `` I make over my interest in him , and have no doubt he will be pleased enough with the change , for a man ca n't enjoy finding an old woman where he had all the time been imagining a young one .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 42]: But I must warn you , Hester , as he seems to have made a conquest of you already , that he has in the meantime been married to a black -- or at least a very brown Hindoo woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 15]: `` That 's nothing to his discredit with you , mamma , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 12]: Has he brought her home with him , I wonder . ''
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 11]: `` She has been dead now for some ten years .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 20]: I believe he had a large fortune with her , which he has since by judicious management increased considerably .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 30]: He is really a good-hearted fellow , and was kind to every one of his own relations as long as there was one left to be kind to . ''
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 55]: `` Well , I shall go back to him , mamma , and tell him you are coming as soon as you have got your wig and your newest lace-cap on , and your cheeks rouged and pearl-powdered , to look as like the lady that would none of him as you can . ''
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 14]: Her mother laughed merrily , and pretended to box her daughter 's ears .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 42]: It was not often any mood like this rose between them ; for not only were they serious in heart , but from temperament , and history , and modes and direction of thought , their ways were serious as well .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 51]: Yet who may so well break out in childlike merriment as those whose life has in it no moth-eaten Mammon-pits , who have no fear , no greed , and live with a will -- rising like the sun to fill the day with the work given them to do !
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 30]: `` Look what I have brought you , cousin , '' said major Marvel , the moment Hester re-entered the room , holding out to her a small necklace .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 14]: `` You need n't mind taking them from an old fellow like me .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 23]: It do n't mean that I want to marry you off-hand before I know what sort of a temper you 've got .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 4]: Take them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 10]: Hester drew near , and looked at the necklace .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 10]: `` Take it , '' said the major again .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 7]: `` How strangely beautiful it is !
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 18]: -- all red , pear-shaped , dull , scratched-looking stones , hanging from a savage-looking gold chain !
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 8]: What are they , Mr. Marvel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 10]: `` You have described it like a book ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 23]: `` It is a barbarous native necklace -- but they are fine rubies -- only rough -- neither cut nor polished . ''
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 9]: `` It is beautiful , '' repeated Hester .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 10]: `` Did you really mean it for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 7]: `` Of course I did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 12]: `` I will ask mamma if I may keep it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 8]: `` Where 's the good of that ?
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 10]: I hope you do n't think I stole it ?
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 18]: Though faith there 's a good deal that 's like stealing goes on where that comes from !
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 7]: -- But here comes the mother !
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 14]: -- Helen , I 'm so glad to see you once more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 29]: Hester slipped away with the necklace in her hand , and left her mother to welcome her old admirer before she would trouble her about the offered gift .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 64]: They met like trusting friends whom years had done nothing to separate , and while they were yet talking of bygone times , Mr. Raymount entered , received him cordially , and insisted on his remaining with them as long as he could ; they were old friends , although rivals , and there never had been any ground for bitterness between them .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 21]: The major agreed ; Mr. Raymount sent to the station for his luggage , and showed him to a room .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVIII .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 5]: THE MAJOR AND VAVASOR .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 40]: As major Marvel , for all the rebuffs he had met with , had not yet learned to entertain the smallest doubt as to his personal acceptability , so he was on his part most catholic in his receptivity .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 22]: But there were persons whom from the first glance he disliked , and then his dislike was little short of loathing .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 19]: I suspect they were such as found the heel of his all but invulnerable vanity and wounded it .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 16]: Not accustomed to be hurt , it resented hurt when it came the more sorely .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 40]: He was in one sense , and that not a slight one , a true man : there was no discrepancy , no unfittingness between his mental conditions and the clothing in which those conditions presented themselves to others .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 22]: His words , looks , manners , tones , and everything that goes to express man to man , expressed him .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 7]: What he felt that he showed .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 13]: I almost think he was unaware of the possibility of doing otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 39]: At the same time , he had very little insight into the feelings of others , and almost no sense of the possibility that the things he was saying might affect his listeners otherwise than they affected him .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 41]: If he boasted , he meant to boast , and would scorn to look as if he did not know it was a good thing he was telling of himself : why not of himself as well as of another ?
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 55]: He had no very ready sympathy with other people , especially in any suffering he had never himself experienced , but he was scrupulously fair in what he said or did in regard of them , and nothing was so ready to make him angry as any appearance of injustice or show of deception .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 40]: He would have said that a man 's first business was to take care of himself , as so many think who have not the courage to say it ; and so many more who do not think it .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 15]: But the Major 's conduct went far to cast contempt upon his selfish opinion .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 21]: During dinner he took the greater part of the conversation upon himself , and evidently expected to be listened to .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 8]: But that was nearly all he wanted .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 18]: Let him talk , and hear you laugh when he was funny , and he was satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 14]: He seemed to have no inordinate desire for admiration or even for approbation .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 75]: He was fond of telling tales of adventure , some wonderful , some absurd , some having nothing in them but his own presence , and occasionally , while the detail was good the point for the sake of which it had been introduced would be missing ; but he was just as willing to tell one , the joke of which turned against himself , as one amusing at the expense of another .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 58]: Like many of his day who had spent their freshest years in India , he was full of the amusements and sports with which so much otherwise idle time is passed by Englishmen in the East , and seemed to think nothing connected with the habits of their countrymen there could fail to interest those at home .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 19]: Every now and then throughout the dinner he would say , `` Oh , that reminds me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 82]: and then he would tell something that happened when he was at such and such a place , when So-and-So `` of our regiment '' was out tiger-shooting , or pig-sticking , or whatever the sport might be ; `` and if Mr. Raymount will take a glass of wine with me , I will tell him the story '' -- for he was constantly drinking wine , after the old fashion , with this or that one of the company .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 43]: When he and Vavasor were introduced to each other , he glanced at him , drew his eyebrows together , made his military bow , and included him among the listeners to his tales of exploit and adventure by sea and land .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 54]: Vavasor was annoyed at his presence -- not that he much minded a little boring in such good company , or forgot that everything against another man was so much in his own favor ; but he could not help thinking , `` What would my aunt say to such a relative ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 71]: So while he retained the blandest expression , and was ready to drink as many glasses of wine with the new comer as he wished , he set him down in his own mind not only as an ill-bred man and a boaster , in which there was some truth , but as a liar and a vulgar-minded man as well , in which there was little or no truth .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 65]: Now although major Marvel had not much ordinary insight into character , the defect arose mainly from his not feeling a deep enough interest in his neighbor ; and if his suspicion or dislike was roused in respect of one , he was just as likely as any other ever is to arrive at a correct judgment concerning a man he does not love .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 12]: He had been relating a thrilling adventure with a man-eating tiger .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 27]: He saw , as they listened , the eyes of little Mark and Saffy had almost surpassed the use of eyes and become ears as well .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 42]: He saw Hester also , who was still child enough to prefer a story of adventure to a love-tale fixed as if , but for the way it was bound over to sobriety , her hair would have stood on end .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 71]: But at one moment he caught also -- surprised indeed a certain expression on the face of Vavasor , which that experienced man of the world never certainly intended to be so surprised , only at the moment he was annoyed to see the absorption of Hester 's listening ; she seemed to have eyes for no one but the man who shot tigers as Vavasor would have shot grouse .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 75]: The major , who upon fitting occasion and good cause , was quarrelsome as any turkey-cock , swallowed something that was neither good , nor good for food , and said , but not quite so carelessly as he had intended : `` Ha , ha , I see by your eyes , Mr. Passover , you think I 'm drawing the long bow -- drawing the arrow to the head , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 9]: `` No , ` pon my word ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 11]: said Vavasor earnestly , `` nothing farther from my thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 33]: I was only admiring the coolness of the man who would actually creep into the mouth of the -- the -- the jungle after a -- what-you-call-him -- a man-eating tiger . ''
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 19]: `` Well , you see , what was a fellow to do , '' returned the major suspiciously .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 8]: `` The fellow would n't come out !
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 14]: and by Jove I was n't the only fellow that wanted him out !
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 19]: Besides I did n't creep in ; I only looked in to see whether he was really there .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 12]: That I could tell by the shining eyes of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 14]: `` But is not a man-eating tiger a something tremendous , you know ?
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 25]: When he once takes to that kind of diet , do n't you know -- they say he likes nothing else half so well !
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 19]: Good beef and mutton will no longer serve his turn , I 've been told at the club .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 12]: A man must be a very Munchausen to venture it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 53]: `` I do n't know the gentleman -- never heard of him , '' said the major : for Vavasor had pronounced the name German-fashion , and none of the listeners recognized that of the king of liars ; `` but you are quite mistaken in the character of the man-eating tiger .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 36]: It is true he does not care for other food after once getting a passion for the more delicate ; but it does not follow that the indulgence increases either his courage or his fierceness .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 9]: The fact is it ruins his moral nature .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 42]: He does not get many Englishmen to eat ; and it would seem as if the flesh of women and children and poor cowardly natives , he devours , took its revenge upon him by undermining and destroying his natural courage .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 11]: The fact is , he is well-known for a sneak .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 28]: I sometimes ca n't help thinking the ruffian knows he is a rebel against the law of his Maker , and a traitor to his natural master .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 13]: The man-eating tiger and the rogue-elephant are the devils of their kind .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 15]: The others leave you alone except you attack them ; then they show fight .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 23]: These attack you -- but run -- at least the tiger , not the elephant , when you go out after him .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 41]: From the top of your elephant you may catch sight of him sneaking off with his tail tucked between his legs from cover to cover of the jungle , while they are beating up his quarters to drive him out .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 10]: You can never get any sport out of him .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 23]: _ He _ will never fly at your elephant , or climb a tree , or take to the water after you !
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 15]: If there 's a creature on earth I hate it 's a coward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 4]: concluded the major .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 13]: Said Vavasor to himself , `` The man is a coward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 13]: `` But _ why _ should you hate a coward so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 27]: asked Hester , feeling at the moment , with the vision of a man-eating tiger before her , that she must herself come under the category .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 13]: `` How can a poor creature made without courage help being one ?
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 9]: You can neither learn nor buy courage ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 10]: `` I am not so sure about the learning .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 17]: But such as you mean , I would n't call cowards , '' returned the major .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 20]: `` Nobody thinks worse of the hare , or even the fox , for going away before the hounds .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 33]: Men whose business it is to fight go away before the enemy when they have not a chance , and when it would do no good to stand and be cut down .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 15]: To let yourself be killed when you ought not is to give up fighting .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 12]: There is a time to run and a time to stand .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 16]: But the man will run like a man and the coward like a coward . ''
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 19]: Said Vavasor to himself , `` I 'll be bound you know when to run at least ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 21]: `` What can harmless creatures do but run , '' resumed the major , filling his glass with old port .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 35]: `` But when the wretch that has done all the hurt he could will not show fight for it , but turns tail the moment danger appears , I call him a contemptible coward .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 11]: Man or beast I would set my foot on him .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 16]: That 's what made me go into the hole to look after the brute . ''
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 30]: `` But he might have killed you , though he was a coward , '' said Hester , `` when you did not leave him room to run . ''
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 9]: `` Of course he might , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 9]: Where else would be the fun of it ?
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 32]: Without that the thing would be no better than this shooting of pigeons and pheasants by men who would drop their guns if a cock were to fly in their faces .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 11]: You _ had _ to kill him , you know !
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 61]: He 's first cousin -- the man-eating , or rather woman-eating tiger , to a sort that I understand abounds in the Zoological Gardens called English society ; if the woman be poor , he devours her at once ; if she be rich he marries her , and eats her slowly up at his ease in his den . ''
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 8]: `` How with the black wife ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 12]: thought Mr. Raymount , who had been little more than listening .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 25]: But Mr. Raymount did not really know anything about that part of his old friend 's history ; it was hardly to his discredit .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 58]: The black wife , as he called her , was the daughter of an English merchant by a Hindoo wife , a young creature when he first made her acquaintance , unaware of her own power , and kept almost in slavery by the relatives of her deceased father , who had left her all his property .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 25]: Major Marvel made her acquaintance and became interested in her through a devilish attempt to lay the death of her father to her door .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 25]: I believe the shine of her gold had actually blinded her relatives into imagining , I can hardly say _ believing _ her guilty .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 15]: The major had taken her part and been of the greatest service to her .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 5]: She was entirely acquitted .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 19]: But although nobody believed her in the smallest degree guilty , _ society _ looked askance upon her .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 12]: True , she was rich , but was she not black ?
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 10]: and had she not been accused of a crime ?
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 9]: And who saw her father and mother married ?
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 22]: Then said the major to himself -- `` Here am I a useless old fellow , living for nobody but myself !
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 18]: It would make one life at least happier if I took the poor thing home with me .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 24]: She 's rather too old , and I 'm rather too young to adopt her ; but I daresay she would marry me .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 21]: She has a trifle I believe that would eke out my pay , and help us to live decently ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 34]: He did not know then that she had more than a very moderate income , but it turned out to be a very large fortune indeed when he came to inquire into things .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 35]: That the major rejoiced over his fortune , I do not doubt ; but that he would have been other than an honorable husband had he found she had nothing , I entirely disbelieve .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 18]: When she left him the widowed father of a little girl , he mourned sincerely for her .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 17]: When the child followed her mother , he was for some time a sad man indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 46]: Then , as if her money was all he had left of her , and he must lead what was left of his life in its company , he went heartily into speculation with it , and at least doubled the fortune she brought him .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 31]: He had now returned to his country to find almost every one of his old friends dead , or so changed as to make them all but dead to him .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 30]: Little as any one would have imagined it from his conversation or manner , it was with a kind of heart-despair that he sought the cousin he had loved .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 60]: And scarcely had he more than seen the daughter of his old love than , in the absence of almost all other personal interest , he was immediately taken possession of by her -- saw at once that she was a grand sort of creature , gracious as grand , and different from anything he had even seen before .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 41]: At the same time he unconsciously began to claim a property in her ; to have loved the mother seemed to give him a right in the daughter , and that right there might be a way of making good .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 23]: But all this was as yet only in the region of the feeling , not at all in that of the thinking .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 30]: In proportion as he was taken with the daughter of the house , he disliked the look of the fine gentleman visitor that seemed to be dangling after her .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 39]: Who he was , or in what capacity there , he did not know , but almost from the first sight profoundly disliked him , and the more as he saw more sign of his admiration of Hester .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 29]: He might be a woman-eater , and after her money -- if she had any : such suspects must be watched and followed , and their haunts marked .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 29]: `` But , '' said Hester , fearing the conversation might here take a dangerous turn , `` I should like to understand the thing a little better .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 32]: I am not willing to set myself down as a coward ; I do not see that a woman has any right to be a coward any more than a man .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 32]: Tell me , major Marvel -- when you know that a beast may have you down , and begin eating you any moment , what is it that keeps you up ?
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 8]: What have you to fall back upon ?
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 13]: Is it principle , or faith , or what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 6]: `` Ho , ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 17]: said the Major , laughing , `` a meta-physician in the very bosom of my family !
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 8]: -- I had not reckoned upon that !
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 27]: -- Well , no , my dear , I can not exactly say that it is principle , and I am sure it is not faith .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 9]: You do n't think about it at all .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 26]: It 's partly your elephant , and partly your rifle -- and partly perhaps -- well , there I daresay comes in something of principle !
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 26]: -- that as an Englishman you are sent to that benighted quarter of the world to kill their big vermin for them , poor things !
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 13]: But no , you do n't think of that at the time .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 11]: You 've got to kill him -- that 's it .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 18]: And then when he comes roaring on , your rifle jumps to your shoulder of itself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 22]: `` Do you make up your mind beforehand that if the animal should kill you , it is all right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 3]: asked Hester .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 20]: `` By no means , I give you my word of honor , '' answered the major , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 34]: `` Well now , '' answered Hester , `` except I had made up my mind that if I was killed it was all right , I could n't meet the tiger . ''
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 31]: `` But you see , my dear , '' said the major , `` you do not know what it is to have confidence in your eye and your rifle .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 28]: It is a form of power that you soon come to feel as resting in yourself -- a power to destroy the thing that opposes you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 12]: Hester fell a-thinking , and the talk went on without her .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 19]: She never heard the end of the story , but was roused by the laughter that followed it .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 21]: `` It was no tiger at all -- that was the joke of the thing , '' said the major .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 22]: `` There was a roar of laughter when the brute -- a great lumbering floundering hyena , rushed into the daylight .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 22]: But the barrel of my rifle was bitten together as a schoolboy does a pen -- a quill-pen , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 10]: They have horribly powerful jaws , those hyenas . ''
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 9]: `` And what became of the man-eater ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 8]: asked Mark , with a disappointed look .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 21]: `` Stopped in the hole till it was safe to come out and go on with his delicate meals . ''
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 23]: `` Just imagine that horrible growl behind you , as if it came out of a whole mine of teeth inside ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 4]: `` By George !
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 16]: for a young lady , '' said the major , `` you have an imagination !
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 21]: Too much of that , you know , wo n't go to make you a good hunter of tigers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 12]: `` Then you owe your coolness to want of imagination ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 3]: suggested Hester .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 4]: `` Perhaps so .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 37]: Perhaps , after all , '' returned the major , with a merry twinkle in his eye , `` we hunters are but a set of stupid fellows -- too stupid to be reasonably frightened ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 8]: `` I do n't mean that exactly .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 19]: I think that perhaps you do not know so well as you might where your courage comes from .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 19]: For my part I would rather be courageous to help the good than to destroy the bad . ''
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 48]: `` Ah , but we 're not all good enough ourselves for that , '' said the major , with a serious expression , and looking at her full out of his clear eyes , from which their habitual twinkle of fun had for the moment vanished .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 17]: `` Some of us are only fit to destroy what is yet worse than ourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 26]: `` To be sure we ca n't _ make _ anything , '' said Hester thoughtfully , `` but we can help God to make .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 26]: To destroy evil things is good , but the worst things can only be destroyed by being good , and that is so hard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 23]: `` It _ is _ hard , '' said the major -- `` so hard that most people never try it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 13]: he added with a sigh , and a gulp of his wine .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 12]: Mrs. Raymount rose , and with Hester and the children withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 52]: After they were gone the major rattled on again , his host putting in a word now and then , and Vavasor sat silent , with an expression that seemed to say , `` I am amused , but I do n't eat all that is put on my plate . ''
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIX .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 4]: A BRAVE ACT .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 33]: The major had indeed taken a strong fancy to Hester , and during the whole of his visit kept as near her as he could , much to the annoyance of Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 25]: Doubtless it was in part to keep the other from her that he himself sought her : the major did not take to Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 8]: There was a natural repulsion between them .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 27]: Vavasor thought the major a most objectionable , indeed low fellow , full of brag and vulgarity , and the major thought Vavasor a supercilious idiot .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 85]: It is curious how differently a man 's character will be read by two people in the same company , but it is not hard to explain , seeing his carriage to the individual affects only the man who is the object of it , and is seldom observed by the other ; like a man , and you will judge him with more or less fairness ; dislike him , fairly or unfairly , and you can not fail to judge him unjustly .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 41]: All deference and humility towards Hester and her parents , Vavasor without ceasing for a moment to be conventionally polite , allowed major Marvel to see unmistakably that his society was not welcome to the man who sat opposite him .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 33]: Entirely ignorant each of the other 's pursuits , and nearly incapable of sympathy upon any point , each would have gladly shown the other to be the fool he counted him .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 29]: Only the major , being the truer man , was able to judge the man of the world with a better gauge than he could apply in return .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 78]: Each watched the other -- the major annoyed with the other 's silent pretension , and disgusted with his ignorance of everything in which he took an interest , and Vavasor regarding the major as a narrow-minded overgrown school-boy -- though , in fact , his horizon was very much wider than his own -- and disgusted with the vulgarity which made even those who knew his worth a little anxious every time he opened his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 16]: He did not offend very often , but one never knew when he might not .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 18]: The offence never hurt , only rendered the sensitive , and others for their sakes , uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 19]: After breakfast the next day , they all but Mr. Raymount went out for a little walk together .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 11]: It seemed destined to be a morning of small adventures .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 64]: As they passed the gate of the Home Farm , out rushed , all of a sudden , a half-grown pig right between the well-parted legs of the major , with the awkward consequence that he was thrown backwards , and fell into a place which , if he had had any choice , he certainly would not have chosen for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 27]: A look of keen gratification rose in Vavasor 's face , but was immediately remanded ; he was much too well-bred to allow it to remain .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 63]: With stony countenance he proceeded to offer assistance to the fallen hero , who , however , heavy as he was , did not require it , but got cleverly on his feet again with a cheerfulness which discomfited discomfiture , and showed either a sweetness or a command of temper which gave him a great lift in the estimation of Hester .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 6]: `` Confound the brute ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 5]: he said , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 24]: `` He ca n't know how many of his wild relatives I have stuck , else I should set it down to revenge .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 9]: What a mess he has made of me !
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 17]: I shall have to throw myself in the river , like a Hindoo , for purification .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 16]: It 's a good thing I 've got some more clothes in my portmanteau . ''
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 20]: Saffy laughed right merrily over his fall and the fun he made of it ; but Mark looked concerned .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 14]: He ran and pulled some grass and proceeded to rub the Major down .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 13]: `` Let us go into the farmhouse , '' said Mrs. Raymount .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 10]: `` Mrs. Stokes will give us some assistance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 10]: `` No , no , '' returned the major .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 15]: `` Better let the mud dry , it will come off much better then .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 8]: A hyena once served me the same .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 17]: I did n't mind that , though all the fellows cracked their waistbands laughing at me .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 16]: Why should n't piggy have his fun as well as another -- eh , Mark ?
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 3]: Come along .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 13]: You sha 'n' t have your walk spoiled by my heedllessness . ''
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 14]: `` The pig did n't mean it , sir , '' said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 9]: `` He only wanted to get out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 16]: But there seemed to be more creatures about the place that wanted to get out .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 7]: A spirit of liberty was abroad .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 24]: Mark and Saffy went rushing away like wild rabbits every now and then , making a round and returning , children once more .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 33]: It was one of those cooler of warm mornings that rouse all the life in heart , brain and nerves , making every breath a pleasure , and every movement a consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 44]: They had not gone much farther , when , just as they approached the paling of a paddock , a horse which had been turned in to graze , came blundering over the fence , and would presently have been ranging the world .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 26]: Unaccustomed to horses , except when equipped and held ready by the hand of a groom , the ladies and children started and drew back .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 18]: Vavasor also stepped a little aside , making way for the animal to follow his own will .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 82]: But as he lighted from his jump , carrying with him the top bar of the fence , he stumbled , and almost fell , and while yet a little bewildered , the major went up to him , and ere he could recover such wits as by nature belonged to him , had him by nose and ear , and leading him to the gap , made him jump in again , and replaced the bar he had knocked away .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 20]: `` Mind we do n't forget to mention it as we go back , '' he said to Mark .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 4]: `` Thank you !
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 9]: How brave of you , major Marvel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 4]: said Mrs. Raymount .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 8]: The Major laughed with his usual merriment .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 39]: `` If it had been the horse of the Rajah of Rumtool , '' he said , `` I should have been brave indeed only by this time there would have been nothing left of me to thank .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 13]: A man would have needed courage to take him by the head !
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 17]: But a quiet good-tempered carriage-horse -- none but a cockney would be frightened at him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 27]: With that he began and to the awful delight of the children , told them the most amazing and indeed horrible tales about the said horse .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 34]: Whether it was all true or not I can not tell ; all I can say is that the major only told what he had heard and believed , or had himself seen .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 90]: Vavasor , annoyed at the involuntary and natural enough nervousness he had shown , for it was nothing more , turned his annoyance on the Major , who by such an insignificant display of coolness , had gained so great an advantage over him in the eyes of the ladies , and made up his opinion that in every word he said about the horse of the Rajah of Rumtool he was romancing -- and that although there had been no slightest pretence to personal prowess in the narrative .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 15]: Our judgment is always too much at the mercy of our likes and dislikes .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 40]: He did indeed mention himself , but only to say that once in the street of a village he saw the horse at some distance with a child in his teeth shaking him like a terrier with a rat .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 12]: He ran , he said , but was too far off .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 37]: Ere he was half-way , the horse 's groom , who was the only man with any power over the brute , had come up and secured him -- though too late to save the child .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 34]: They were following the course of the river , and had gradually descended from the higher grounds to the immediate banks , which here spread out into a small meadow on each side .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 39]: There were not now many flowers , but Saffy was pulling stalks of feathery-headed grasses , while Mark was walking quietly along by the brink of the stream , stopping every now and then to look into it .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 28]: The bank was covered with long grass hanging over , here and there a bush of rushes amongst it , and in parts was a little undermined .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 63]: On the opposite side lower down was a meal-mill , and nearly opposite , a little below , was the head of the mill-lade , whose weir , turning the water into it , clammed back the river , and made it deeper here than in any other part -- some seven feet at least , and that close to the shore .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 16]: It was still as a lake , and looked , as deep as it was .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 16]: The spot was not a great way from the house , but beyond its grounds .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 38]: The two ladies and two gentlemen were walking along the meadow , some distance behind the children , and a little way from the bank , when they were startled by a scream of agony from Saffy .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 14]: She was running towards them-shrieking , and no Mark was to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 17]: All started at speed to meet her , but presently Mrs. Raymount sank on the grass .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 13]: Hester would have stayed with her , but she motioned her on .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 21]: Vavasor outran the major , and reached Saffy first , but to his anxious questions -- `` Where is he ?
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 6]: Where did you leave him ?
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 8]: Where did you see him last ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 12]: she answered only by shrieking with every particle of available breath .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 38]: When the major came up , he heard enough to know that he must use his wits and lose no time in trying to draw information from a creature whom terror had made for the moment insane .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 20]: He kept close to the bank , looking for some sign of the spot where he had fallen in .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 22]: He had indeed overrun the place , and was still intent on the bank when he heard a cry behind him .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 14]: It was the voice of Hester , screaming `` Across ; Across ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 34]: He looked across , and saw half-way over , slowly drifting towards the mill-lade , a something dark , now appearing for a little above the water , now sinking out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 41]: The major 's eye , experienced in every point of contact between man and nature , saw at once it must be the body , dead or alive -- only he could hardly be dead yet -- of poor Mark .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 31]: He threw off his coat , and plunged in , found the water deep enough for good swimming , and made in the direction of the object he had seen .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 44]: But it showed so little and so seldom , that fearing to miss it , he changed his plan , and made straight for the mouth of the mill-lade , anxious of all things to prevent him from getting down to the water-wheel .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 36]: In the meantime , Hester , followed by Vavasor , while Saffy ran to her mother , sped along the bank till she came to the weir , over which hardly any water was running .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 58]: When Vavasor saw her turn sharp round and make for the weir , he would have prevented her , and laid his hand on her arm ; but she turned on him with eyes that flashed , and lips which , notwithstanding her speed , were white as with the wrath that has no breath for words .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 8]: He drew back and dared only follow .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 31]: The footing was uncertain , with deep water on one side up to a level with the stones , and a steep descent to more deep water on the other .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 16]: In one or two spots the water ran over , and those spots were slippery .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 34]: But , rendered absolutely fearless by her terrible fear , Hester flew across without a slip , leaving Vavasor some little way behind , for he was neither very sure-footed nor very sure-headed .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 60]: But when they had run along the weir and landed , they were only on the slip between the lade and the river : the lade was between them and the other side -- deep water therefore between them and the major , where already he was trying to heave the unconscious form of Mark on to the bank .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 17]: The poor man had not swum so far for many years , and was nearly spent .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 9]: `` Bring him here , '' cried Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 13]: `` The stream is too strong for me to get to you .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 9]: It will bring you in a moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 29]: The major muttered an oath , gave a great heave , got the body half on the shore , and was then just able to scramble out himself .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 20]: When Vavasor looked round , he saw Hester had left him , and was already almost at the mill .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 32]: There she crossed the lade and turning ran up the other side , and was soon at the spot where the major was doing all he could to bring back life .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 11]: But there was little hope out there in the cold .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 9]: Hester caught the child up in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 6]: `` Come ; come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 12]: she cried , and ran with him back to the mill .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 10]: The major followed , running , panting , dripping .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 21]: When they met Vavasor , he would have taken him from her , but she would not give him up .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 11]: `` Go back to my mother , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 15]: `` Tell her we have got him , and he is at the mill .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 17]: Then go and tell my father , and ask him to send for the doctor . ''
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 9]: Vavasor obeyed , feeling again a little small .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 33]: But Hester had never thought that he might have acted at all differently ; she never recalled even that he had tried to prevent her from crossing to the major 's help .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 9]: She thought only of Mark and her mother .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 81]: In a few minutes they had him in the miller 's blankets , with hot water about him , while the major , who knew well what ought to be done , for he had been tried in almost every emergency under the sun , went through the various movements of the arms prescribed ; inflated the chest again and again with his own breath , and did all he could to bring back the action of the breathing muscles .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 22]: Vavasor took upon him to assure Mrs. Raymount that Mark was safe and would be all right in a little while .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 18]: She rose then , and with what help Saffy could give her , managed to walk home .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 11]: But after that day she never was so well again .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 7]: Vavasor ran on to the house .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 26]: Mr. Raymount crossed the river by the bridge , and was soon on the spot -- just as the first signs of returning animation appeared .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 15]: His strength and coolness were a great comfort both to Hester and the major .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 20]: The latter was the more anxious that he knew the danger of such a shock to a delicate child .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 31]: After about half-an-hour , the boy opened his eyes , looked at his father , smiled in his own heavenly way , and closed them again with a deep sigh .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 17]: They covered him up warm , and left him to sleep till the doctor should appear .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 33]: That same night , as Hester was sitting beside him , she heard him talking in his sleep : `` When may I go and play with the rest by the river ?
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 7]: Oh , how sweetly it talks !
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 9]: it runs all through me and through me !
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 14]: It was such a nice way , God , of fetching me home !
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 8]: I rode home on a water-horse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 23]: He thought he was dead ; that God had sent for him home ; that he was now safe , only tired .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 10]: It sent a pang to the heart of Hester .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 11]: What if after all he was going to leave them !
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 9]: For the child had always seemed fitter for .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 15]: Home than being thus abroad , and any day he might be sent for !
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 31]: He recovered by degrees , but seemed very sleepy and tired ; and when , two days after , he was taken home he only begged to go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 30]: But he never fretted or complained , received every attention with a smile , and told his mother not to mind , for he was not going away yet .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 12]: He had been told that under the water , he said .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 37]: Before winter , he was able to go about the house , and was reading all his favourite books over again , especially the Pilgrim 's Progress , which he had already read through five times .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 25]: The major left Yrndale the next morning , saying now there was Mark to attend to , his room was better than his company .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 15]: Vavasor would stay a day or two longer , he said , much relieved .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 16]: He could not go until he saw Mark fairly started on the way of recovery .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 35]: But in reality the major went because he could no longer endure the sight of `` that idiot , '' as he called Vavasor , and with design against him fermenting in his heart .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 5]: `` The poltroon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 15]: `` A fellow like that to marry a girl like cousin Helen 's girl !
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 7]: A grand creature , by George !
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 10]: The grandest creature I ever saw in my life !
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 24]: Why , rather than wet his clothes the sneak would have let us both drown after I had got him to the bank !
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 23]: Calling to me to go to him , when I had done my best , and was at the last gasp ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 15]: He was not fair to Vavasor ; he never asked if he could swim .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 19]: But indeed Vavasor could swim , well enough , only he did not see the necessity for it .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 15]: He did not love his neighbor enough to grasp the facts of the case .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 11]: And after all he could and did do without him !
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 28]: The major hurried to London , assured he had but to inquire to find out enough and more than enough to his discredit , of the fellow .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 64]: He told them to tell Mark he was gone to fetch tiger-skins and a little idol with diamond eyes , and a lot of queer things that he had brought home ; and he would tell him all about them , and let him have any of them he liked to keep for his own , as soon as he was well again .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 24]: So he must make haste , for the moth would get at them if they were long lying about and not seen to .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 31]: He told Mr. Raymount that he had no end of business to look after ; but now he knew the way to Yrndale , he might be back any day .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 20]: As soon as Mark was well enough to be handed over to a male nurse he would come directly .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 28]: He told Mrs. Raymount that he had got some pearls for her -- he knew she was fond of pearls -- and was going to fetch them .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 23]: For Hester he made her promise to write to him at the Army and Navy Club every day till Mark was well .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 20]: And so he departed , much blessed of all the family for saving the life of their precious boy .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 23]: The major when he reached London hunted up some of his old friends , and through them sent out inquiry concerning Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 30]: He learned then some few things about him -- nothing very bad as things went where everything was more or less bad , and nothing to his special credit .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 45]: That he was heir to an earldom he liked least of all , for he was only the more likely to marry his beautiful cousin , and her he thought a great deal too good for him -- which was truer than he knew .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 29]: Vavasor was relieved to find that Hester , while full of gratitude to the major , had no unfavourable impression concerning his own behaviour in the sad affair .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 63]: As the days went on , however , and when he expected enthusiasm to have been toned down , he was annoyed to find that she was just as little impressed with the objectionable character of the man who by his unselfish decision , he called it his good luck , had got the start of him in rendering the family service .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 21]: To himself he styled him `` a beastly fellow , a lying braggart , a disgustingly vulgar ill-bred rascal . ''
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 19]: He would have called him an army-cad , only the word _ cad _ was not then invented .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 21]: If there were any more such relations likely to turn up , the sooner he cut the connection the better !
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 22]: But that Hester should not be shocked with him was almost more than he could bear ; that was shocking indeed !
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 32]: He could not understand that as to the pure all things are pure , so the common mind sees far more vulgarity in others than the mind developed in genuine refinement .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 11]: It understands , therefore forgives , nor finds it hard .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 43]: Hester was able to look deeper than he , and she saw much that was good and honourable in the man , however he might have the bridle of his tongue too loose for safe riding in the crowded paths of society .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 36]: Vavasor took care , however , after hearing the first words of defence which some remark of his brought from Hester , not to go farther , and turned the thing he had said aside .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 19]: Where was the use of quarrelling about a man he was never likely to set eyes on again ?
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 43]: A day or two before the natural end of his visit , as Mrs. Raymount , Hester and he were sitting together in the old-fashioned garden , the letters were brought them -- one for Vavasor , with a great black seal .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 19]: He read it through , and said quietly : `` I am sorry I must leave you to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 8]: Or is there not a train to-night ?
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 25]: But I dare say it does not matter , only I ought to be present at the funeral of my uncle , Lord Gartley .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 11]: He died yesterday , from what I can make out .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 20]: It is a tiresome thing to succeed to a title with hardly property enough to pay the servants ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 19]: `` Very tiresome , '' assented Mrs. Raymount ; `` but a title is not like an illness .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 13]: If you can live without , you can live with one . ''
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 6]: `` True ; very true !
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 6]: But society , you see .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 12]: There 's so much expected of a man in my position !
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 9]: What do you think , Miss Raymount ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 23]: he asked , turning towards her with a look that seemed to say whatever she thought would always be law to him .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 10]: `` I think with mamma , '' replied Hester .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 21]: `` I do not see why a mere name should have any power to alter one 's mode of life .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 34]: Of course if the change brings new duties , they must be attended to ; but if the property be so small as you say , it can not want much looking after .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 17]: To be sure there are the people upon it , but they can not be many .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 11]: Why should you not go on as you are ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 14]: `` I must go a good deal by what my aunt thinks best .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 10]: She has a sort of right , you see .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 35]: All her life her one fixed idea , knowing I was likely to succeed , has been the rehabilitation of the earldom , and all her life she has been saving for that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 12]: `` Then she is going to make you her heir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 21]: said Hester , who , having been asked her opinion , simply desired the grounds on which to give it .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 6]: `` My dear Hester ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 4]: said her mother .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 21]: `` I am only too much delighted Miss Raymount should care to ask me _ any_thing , '' said Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 39]: `` My aunt does mean to make me her heir , I believe , but one must not depend upon that , because , if I were to displease her , she might change her mind any moment .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 38]: But she has been like a mother to me , and I do not think , for any small provocation such as I am likely to give her , she would yield the dream of her life .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 20]: She is a kind-hearted woman , though a little peculiar ; true as steel where she takes a fancy .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 11]: I wish you knew my aunt , Mrs. Raymount . ''
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 11]: `` I should be much pleased to know her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 12]: `` She would be delighted with this lovely place of yours .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 6]: It is a perfect paradise .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 19]: I feel its loveliness the more that I am so soon to hear its gates close behind me .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 14]: Happily there is no flaming sword to mount guard against the expelled ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 12]: `` You must bring your aunt some time , Mr. Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 12]: We should make her very welcome , '' said Mrs. Raymount .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 22]: `` Unfortunately , with all her good qualities , my aunt , as I have said , is a little peculiar .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 11]: For one thing she shrinks from making new acquaintances . ''
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 13]: He should have said -- any acquaintances out of her own world .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 18]: All others , so far as she was concerned , existed only on the sufferance of remoteness .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 20]: But by this time Vavasor had resolved to make an attempt to gain his aunt , and so Hester .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 33]: He felt sure his aunt could not fail to be taken with Hester if only she saw her in fit surroundings : with her the frame was more than half the picture .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 35]: He was glad now that she had not consented to call on the family in Addison Square : they would be of so much more importance in her eyes in the setting of Yrndale .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 59]: He had himself also the advantage of being now of greater importance , the title being no longer in prospect but in possession : he was that Earl of Gartley for whom she had been saving all the time he was merely the heir , who might die , or be kept waiting twenty years for the succession .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 21]: She must either be of one mind with him now , or lose the cherished purpose of so many years .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 24]: If he stood out , seeming to prefer poverty and the woman of his choice , she would be compelled to give in .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 53]: That same evening he left them in high spirits , and without any pretence of decent regret for the death of one whom he had never seen , and who had for many years lived the life of an invalid and a poor man -- neither of much account in his world .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 27]: He left behind him one child -- a lovely but delicate girl , of whom no one seemed to think in the change that had arrived .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 15]: It would be untrue to say that Hester was not interested in the news .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 60]: They had been so much thrown together of late , and in circumstances so favourable to intimacy , to the manifestation of what of lovable was in him , and to the revelation of how much her image possessed him , that she could hardly have been a woman at all and not care for what might befall him .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 59]: Neither , although her life lay , and she felt that it lay , in far other regions , was she so much more than her mother absorbed in the best , as to be indifferent to the pleasure of wearing a distinguished historical name , or of occupying an exalted position in the eyes of the world .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 48]: Her nature was not yet so thoroughly possessed with the things that _ are _ as distinguished from the things that only appear , as not to feel some pleasure in being a countess of this world , while waiting the inheritance of the saints in light .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 117]: Of course this was just as far unworthy of her as it is unworthy of any one who has seen the hid treasure not to have sold all that he has to buy it -- not to have counted , with Paul , everything but dross to the winning of Christ -- not even worth being picked up on the way as he presses towards the mark of the high calling ; but I must say this for her , that she thought of it first of all as a buttressing help to the labours , which , come what might , it remained her chief hope to follow again among her poor friends in London .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 15]: To be a countess would make many things easier for her , she thought .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 18]: Little she knew how immeasurably more difficult it would make it to do anything whatever worth doing !
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 47]: -- that , at the very first , she would have to fight for freedom -- her own -- with hidden crafts of slavery , especially mighty in a region more than any other under the influences of the prince of the power of the air !
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 42]: She had the foolish notion that , thus uplifted among the shows of rule , she would be able with more than mere personal help to affect the load of injustice laid upon them from without , and pressing them earthwards .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 38]: She had learned but not yet sufficiently learned that , until a man has begun to throw off the weights that hold him down , it is a wrong done him to attempt to lighten those weights .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 24]: Why seek a better situation for the man whose increase of wages will only go into the pocket of the brewer or distiller ?
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 12]: While the tree is evil , its fruit will be evil .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 8]: So again the days passed quietly on .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 6]: Mark grew a little better .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 18]: Hester wrote regularly , but the briefest bulletins , to the major , seldom receiving an acknowledgment .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 30]: The new earl wrote that he had been to the funeral , and described in a would-be humorous way the house and lands to which he had fallen heir .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 32]: The house might , he said , with unlimited money , be made fit to live in , but what was left of the estate was literally a mere savage mountain .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXX .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 4]: IN ANOTHER LIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 14]: Mr. Raymount went now and then to London , but never stayed long .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 34]: In the autumn he had his books removed to Yrndale , saying in London he could always get what books he wanted , but must have his own about him in the country .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 58]: When they were accommodated and arranged to his mind , all on the same floor , and partly in the same room with the old library of the house , he began , for the first time in his life , to feel he had an abiding place and talked of selling the house in Addison Square .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 19]: It would have been greater progress to feel that there is no abiding in place or among things .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 149]: In the month of October , when the forsaken spider-webs were filled no more with flies , but in the morning now with the dew-drops , now with hoarfrost , and the fine stimulus and gentle challenge of the cold roused the vital spirit in every fibre to meet it ; when the sun shone a little sadly , and the wraith of the coming winter might be felt hovering in the air , major Marvel again made his appearance at Yrndale , but not quite the man he was ; he had a troubled manner , and an expression on his face such as Mrs. Raymount had never before seen there : it was the look of one who had an unpleasant duty to discharge -- a thing to do he would rather not do , but which it would cost him far more to leave undone .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 22]: He had brought the things he promised , every one , and at sight of them Mark had brightened up amazingly .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 31]: At table he tried to be merry as before , but failed rather conspicuously , drank more wine than was his custom , and laid the blame on the climate .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 23]: His chamber was over that of his host and hostess , and they heard him walking about for hours in the night .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 13]: There was something on his mind that would not let him sleep !
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 19]: In the morning he appeared at the usual hour , but showed plain marks of a sleepless night .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 27]: When condoled with he answered he must seek a warmer climate , for if it was like this already , what would it be in January ?
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 30]: It was in reality a perfect autumn morning , of which every one except the major felt the enlivening influence -- the morning of all mornings for a walk !
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 57]: Just as Hester was leaving the room to get ready to go with Saffy -- Mark was not able for a long walk -- the major rose , and overtaking her in the anteroom , humbly whispered the request that she would walk with him alone , as he much wished a private conversation with her .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 25]: Hester , though with a little surprise , also a little undefined anxiety , at once consented , but ran first to her mother .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 14]: `` What can he want to talk to me about , mamma ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 3]: she concluded .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 10]: `` How can I tell , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 7]: answered her mother with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 12]: `` Perhaps he will dare the daughter 's refusal too . ''
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 5]: `` Oh , mamma !
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 10]: how can you joke about such a thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 10]: `` I am not quite joking , my child .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 12]: There is no knowing what altogether unsuitable things men will do !
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 17]: -- Who can blame them when they see how women consent to many unsuitable things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 15]: `` But , mamma , he is old enough to be my father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 6]: `` Of course he is !
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 3]: Poor man !
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 20]: it would be a hard fate to have fallen in love with both mother and daughter in vain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 11]: `` I wo n't go with him , mamma ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 9]: `` You had better go , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 7]: You need not be much afraid .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 13]: He is really a gentleman , however easily mistaken for something else .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 13]: You must not forget how much we owe him for Mark ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 33]: `` Do you mean , mamma , '' said Hester , with a strange look out of her eyes , `` that I ought to marry him if he asks me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 18]: Hester was sometimes oddly stupid for a moment as to the intent of those she knew best .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 5]: Her mother laughed heartily .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 10]: `` What a goose you are , my darling !
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 12]: Do n't you know your mother from a miscreant yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 16]: But in truth her mother so rarely jested that there was some excuse for her .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 28]: Relieved from the passing pang of a sudden dread , Hester went without more words and put on her bonnet to go with the cause of it .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 23]: She did not like the things at all , for no one could be certain what absurd thing he might not do .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 28]: They set out together , but until they were some distance from the house walked in absolute silence , which seemed to Hester to bode no good .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 11]: But how changed the poor man was , she thought .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 13]: It would be pitiful to have to make him still more miserable !
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 23]: Steadily the major marched along , his stick under his arm like a sword , and his eyes looking straight before him .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 31]: `` Cousin Hester , '' he said at length , `` I am about to talk to you very strangely -- to conduct myself indeed in a very peculiar manner .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 20]: Can you imagine a man rendering himself intensely , unpardonably disagreeable , from the very best of motives ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 14]: It was a speech very different from any to be expected of him .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 18]: That he should behave oddly seemed natural -- not that he should knowingly intend to do so !
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 35]: `` I think I could , '' answered Hester , wishing neither to lead him on nor to deter him : whatever he had to say , the sooner it was said the better !
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 22]: `` Tell me , '' he said suddenly after a pause just beginning to be awkward -- then paused again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 22]: -- Let me ask you first , '' he resumed , `` whether you are able to trust me a little .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 37]: I am old enough to be your father -- let me say your grandfather ; -- fancy I am your grandfather : in my soul I believe neither could wish you well more truly than myself .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 19]: Tell me -- trust me and tell me : what is there between you and Mr. Vavasor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 4]: Hester was silent .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 34]: The silence would have lasted but a moment had Hester to ask herself , not what answer she should give to his question , but what answer there was to give to it .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 39]: Whether bound , whether pleased to answer it or not , might have come presently , but it did not ; every question has its answer , known or unknown : what was the answer to this one ?
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 9]: Before she knew it , the major resumed .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 46]: `` I know , '' he said , `` ladies think such things are not to be talked about with gentlemen ; but there are exceptions to every rule : David ate the show-bread because there was a good reason for breaking a good rule .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 9]: -- Are you engaged to Mr. Vavasor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 8]: `` No , '' answered Hester promptly .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 6]: `` What is it then ?
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 7]: Are you going to be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 28]: `` If I answered that in the affirmative , '' said Hester , `` would it not be much the same as acknowledging myself already engaged ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 3]: no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 5]: cried the major vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 13]: `` So long as your word is not passed you remain free .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 13]: The two are as far asunder as the pole from the equator .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 11]: I thank God you are not engaged to him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 5]: `` But why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 11]: asked Hester , with a pang of something like dread .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 11]: `` Why should you be so anxious about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 10]: `` Has he never said he loved you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 5]: asked the major eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 8]: `` No , '' said Hester hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 17]: She felt instinctively it was best to answer directly where there was no reason for silence .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 15]: What he might be wrong to ask she was not therefore wrong to answer .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 25]: But her _ No _ trembled a little , for the doubt came with it , whether though literally , it was strictly true .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 9]: `` We are friends , '' she added .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 10]: `` We trust each other a good deal . ''
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 21]: `` Trust him with nothing , least of all your heart , my dear , '' said the major earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 19]: `` Or if you must trust him , trust him with anything , with everything , except that .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 8]: He is not worthy of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 14]: `` Do you say so to flatter me or to disparage him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 6]: `` Entirely to disparage him .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 5]: I never flatter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 23]: `` You did not surely bring me out , major Marvel , to hear evil of one of my best friends ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 6]: said Hester , now angry .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 17]: `` I certainly did -- if the truth be evil -- but only for your sake .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 13]: The man I do not feel interest enough in to abuse even .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 6]: He is a nobody . ''
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 45]: `` That only proves you do not know him : you would not speak so if you did , '' said Hester , widening the space between her and the major , and ready to choke with what in utterance took such gentle form .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 16]: `` I am confident I should have worse to say if I knew him better .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 9]: It is you who do not know him .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 23]: It astonishes me that sensible people like your father and mother should let a fellow like that come prowling after you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 30]: `` Major Marvel , if you are going to abuse my father and mother as well as lord Gartley , -- '' cried Hester , but he interrupted her .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 8]: `` Ah , there it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 4]: exclaimed he bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 4]: `` Lord Gartley !
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 16]: -- I have no business to interfere -- no more than your gardener or coachman !
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 20]: but to think of an angel like you in the arms of a -- '' `` Major Marvel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 11]: -- `` I beg ten thousand pardons , cousin Hester !
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 16]: but I am so damnably in earnest I ca n't pick and choose my phrases .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 11]: Believe me the man is not worthy of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 8]: `` What have you got against him ?
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 6]: -- I do hate backbiting !
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 13]: As his friend I ask you what you have against him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 8]: `` That 's the pity of it !
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 11]: I ca n't tell you anything very bad of him .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 33]: But a man of whom no one has anything good to say -- one of whom never a warm word is uttered -- '' `` I have called him my friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 3]: said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 8]: `` That 's the worst of it !
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 15]: If it were not for that he might go to the devil for me !
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 18]: -- I daresay you think it a fine thing he should have stuck to business so long !
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 33]: `` He was put to that before there was much chance of his succeeding ; his aunt would not have him on her hands consuming the money she meant for the earldom .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 30]: His elder brother would have had it , but he killed himself before it fell due : there are things that must not be spoken of to young ladies .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 30]: I do n't say your _ friend _ has disgraced himself ; he has not : by George , it takes a good deal for that in his set !
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 15]: But not a soul out of his own family cares two-pence for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 25]: `` There are some who are better liked everywhere than at home , and they 're not the better sort , '' said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 8]: `` That goes for less than nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 12]: I know the part of him chance acquaintances can not know .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 10]: He does not bear his heart on his sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 33]: I assure you , major Marvel , he is a man of uncommon gifts and -- '' `` Great attractions , no doubt -- to me invisible , '' blurted the major .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 5]: Hester turned from him .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 11]: `` I am going home , '' she said . ''
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 9]: -- Luncheon is at the usual hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 13]: `` Just one word , '' cried he , hurrying after her .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 24]: `` I swear by the living God I have no purpose or hope in interfering but to save you from a miserable future .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 21]: Promise me not to marry this man , and I will settle on you a thousand a year -- safe .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 11]: You shall have the principal down if you prefer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 5]: Hester walked the faster .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 20]: `` Hear me , '' he went on , in an agony of entreaty mingled with something like anger .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 9]: `` I mean it , '' he continued .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 11]: `` Why should I not for Helen 's child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 9]: He was a yard or two behind her .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 10]: She turned on him with a glance of contempt .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 14]: But the tears were in his eyes , and her heart smote her .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 12]: He had abused her friend , but was plainly honest himself .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 9]: Her countenance changed as she looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 6]: He came up to her .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 24]: She laid her hand on his arm , and said -- `` Dear major Marvel , I will speak to you without anger .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 18]: What would you think of one who took money to do the thing she ought to do ?
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 24]: I will not ask you what you would think of one who took money to do the thing she ought not to do !
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 15]: I would not _ promise _ not to marry a beggar from the street .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 22]: It _ might _ be disgraceful to marry the beggar ; it _ must _ be disgraceful to promise not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 8]: `` Yes , yes , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 14]: you are quite right -- absolutely right , '' said the major humbly .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 9]: `` I only wanted to make you independent .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 9]: You do n't think half enough of yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 25]: -- But I will dare one more question before I give you up ; is he going to ask you to marry him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 3]: `` Perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 6]: I do not know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 12]: `` One more question yet : can you secure any liberty ?
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 9]: Will your father settle anything upon you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 11]: I have never thought about anything of the kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 23]: `` How could they let you go about with him so much and never ask him what he meant by it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 14]: `` They could easier have asked me what I meant by it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 14]: `` If I had such a jewel I would look after it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 29]: `` Have me shut up like an eastern lady , I suppose , '' said Hester , laughing ; `` make my life miserable to make it safe .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 31]: If a woman has any sense , major Marvel , she can take care of herself ; if she has not , she must learn the need of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 15]: said the major sadly , `` but the thousand pangs and aches and heart-sickenings !
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 27]: I would sooner see my child on the funeral pyre of a husband she loved , than living a merry life with one she despised ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 13]: Hester began to feel she had not been doing the major justice .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 6]: `` So would I ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 4]: she said heartily .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 17]: `` You mean me well , and I shall not forget how kind you have been .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 7]: Now let us go back . ''
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 24]: `` Just one thing more : if ever you think I can help you , you _ will _ let me know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 13]: `` That I promise with all my heart , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 24]: `` I mean , '' she added , `` if it be a thing I count it right to trouble you about . ''
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 6]: The major 's face fell .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 5]: `` I see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 10]: he said ; `` you wo n't promise anything .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 14]: Well , stick to that , and _ do n't _ promise . ''
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 18]: `` You would n't have me come to you for a new bonnet , would you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 4]: `` By George !
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 19]: should n't I be proud to fetch you the best in Regent street by the next train ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 9]: `` Or saddle the pony for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 4]: `` Try me .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 10]: -- But I wo n't have any more chaff .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 34]: I throw myself on your generosity , and trust you to remember there is an old man that loves you , and has more money than he knows what to do with . ''
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 22]: `` I think , '' said Hester , `` the day is sure to come when I shall ask your help .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 20]: In the meantime , if it be any pleasure to you to know it , I trust you heartily .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 9]: You are all wrong about lord Gartley though .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 9]: He is not what you think him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 6]: She gave him her hand .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 30]: The major took it in his own soft small one -- small enough almost for the hilt of an Indian tulwar -- and pressed it devoutly to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 14]: She did not draw it away , and he felt she trusted him .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 26]: Now that the hard duty was done , and if not much good yet no harm had resulted , he went home a different man .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 44]: A pang of fear for Hester in the power of `` that ape Gartley '' would now and then pass through him ; but he had now a right to look after her , and who can tell what might not turn up !
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 23]: His host congratulated him on looking so much better for his walk , and Hester recounted to her mother their strange conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 7]: `` Only think , mamma ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 18]: she said ; `` he offered me a thousand a year not to marry lord Gartley ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 4]: `` Hester ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 23]: `` He does not like the earl , and he does like me ; so he wants me not to marry him .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 5]: That is all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 19]: `` I thought I could have believed anything of him , but this goes almost beyond belief ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 7]: `` Why should it , mamma ?
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 22]: There is an odder thing still : instead of hating him for it , I like him better than before . ''
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 15]: `` Are you sure he has no notion of making room for himself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 4]: `` Quite sure .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 13]: He would have it he was old enough to be my grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 9]: But you know he is not that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 15]: `` Perhaps you would n't mind if he were a little younger yet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 17]: said her mother merrily , `` as he is too young to be your grandfather . ''
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 21]: `` I suppose you had a presentiment I should like him , and left him for me , mamma ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 6]: returned Hester in like vein .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 18]: `` But seriously , Hester , is it not time we knew what lord Gartley means ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 5]: `` Oh , mamma !
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 8]: please do n't talk like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 25]: `` It does sound disagreeable -- vulgar , if you like , my child ; but I can not help being anxious about you .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 18]: If he does not love you he has no right to court your company so much . ''
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 7]: `` I encourage it , mamma .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 5]: I like him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 9]: `` That is what makes me afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 22]: `` It will be time enough to think about it if he comes again now he has got the earldom . ''
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 12]: `` Should you like to be a countess , Hester ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 11]: `` I would rather not think about it , mother .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 14]: It may never make any difference whether I should like it or not .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 22]: `` I ca n't help thinking it strange he should be so much with you and never say a word ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 38]: `` Might you not just as well say it was strange of me to be so much with him , or of you , mother dear , to let him come so much to the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 12]: `` It was neither your part nor mine to say anything .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 35]: Your father even has always said he would scorn to ask a man his _ intentions _ : either he was fit to be in his daughter 's company , or he was not .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 18]: Either he must get rid of him , or leave his daughter to manage her own affairs .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 14]: He is quite American in his way of looking at those matters . ''
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 11]: `` Do n't you think he is right , mother ?
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 16]: If I let lord Gartley come , surely he is not to blame for coming !
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 20]: `` Only if you should have got fond of him , and it were to come to nothing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 24]: `` It ca n't come to nothing , mother , and neither of us will be the worse for it , I trust .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 30]: As to what I think about him , I do n't feel as if I quite knew ; and I do n't think at present I need ask myself .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 40]: I am afraid you think me very cool : and in truth I do n't quite understand myself ; but perhaps if one tries to do right as things come up , one may get on without understanding oneself .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 19]: I do n't think , so far as I can make out , St. Paul understood himself always .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 20]: Miss Dasomma says a great part of music is the agony of the musician after the understanding of himself .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 19]: I will try to do what is right -- you may be sure of that , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 23]: `` I am sure of that , my dear -- quite sure ; and I wo n't trouble you more about it .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 21]: You may imagine I should not like to see my Hester a love-sick maiden , pining and wasting away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 34]: `` Depend upon It , mamma , if I found myself in that state no one else should discover it , '' said Hester , partly in play , but thoroughly in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 15]: `` That only reveals how little you know about such things , my love !
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 19]: You could no more hide it from the eyes of your mother than you could a husband . ''
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 11]: `` Such things have been hid before now , mamma !
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 10]: And yet why should a woman ever hide anything ?
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 6]: I must think about that !
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 6]: From one 's own mother ?
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 15]: No ; when I am dying of love , you shall know , mamma .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 12]: But it wo n't be to-morrow or the next day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXI .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 8]: THE MAJOR AND COUSIN HELEN 'S BOYS .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 26]: The major was in no haste to leave , but he spent most of his time with Mark , and was in nobody 's way .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 8]: Mark was very happy with the major .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 71]: The nature of the man was so childlike that , although he knew little of the deep things in which Mark was at home , his presence was never an interruption to the child 's thoughts ; and when the boy made a remark in the upward direction , he would look so grave , and hold such a peace that the child never missed the lacking words of response .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 17]: Who knows what the man may not have gained even from silent communication with the child !
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 38]: One day he was telling the boy how he had been out alone on a desolate hill all night ; how he heard the beasts roaring round him , and not one of them came near him .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 9]: `` Did you see _ him _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 3]: asked Mark .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 7]: `` See who , sonny ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 4]: returned the major .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 24]: `` The one between you and them , '' answered Mark in a subdued tone ; and from the tone the major understood .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 20]: `` No , '' he answered ; and taking into his the spirit of the child , went on .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 12]: `` I do n't think any one sees him now-a-days . ''
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 8]: `` Is n't it a pity ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 3]: said Mark .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 23]: Then after a thoughtful pause , he resumed : `` Well , not see him just with your eyes , you know !
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 56]: But old Jonathan at the cottage -- he has got no eyes -- at least none to speak of , for they 're no good to see with -- he always speaks of seeing the people he has been talking with -- and in a way he does see them , do n't you think ?
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 42]: But I fancy sometimes I must have seen _ him _ with my very eyes when I was young : and that 's why I keep always expecting to see him again -- some day , you know -- some day .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 10]: Do n't you think I shall , Majie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 9]: `` I hope so , indeed , Mark !
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 15]: It would be a bad job if we were never to see him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 14]: he added , suddenly struck with a feeling he had never had before .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 10]: `` Yes , indeed ; that it would ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 4]: responded the child .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 15]: `` Why , where would be the good of it all , you know !
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 12]: That 's what we came here for -- ai n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 17]: God calls children -- I know he calls some , for he said , ` Samuel !
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 3]: Samuel ! '
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 8]: I wish he would call me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 7]: `` What would you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 4]: asked the major .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 12]: `` I would say -- ' Here I am , God !
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 5]: What is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 11]: We mus n't keep God waiting , you know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 23]: The major felt , like Wordsworth with the leech-gatherer , that the child was there to give him `` apt admonishment . ''
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 12]: Could God have ever called him and he not have listened ?
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 8]: Of course it was all a fancy !
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 40]: And yet as he looked at the child , and met his simple believing eyes , he felt he had been a great sinner , and the best things he had done were not fit to be looked at .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 51]: Happily there were no conventional religious phrases in the mouth of the child to repel him ; his father and mother had a horror of pharisaic Christianity : I use the word _ pharisaic _ in its true sense -- as _ formal _ , not as _ hypocritical _ .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 18]: They had both seen in their youth too many religious prigs to endure temple-whitewash on their children .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 17]: Except what they heard at church , hardly a special religious phrase ever entered their ears .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 28]: Those of the New Testament were avoided from reverence , lest they should grow common and fail of their purpose when the children read them for themselves .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 15]: `` But if this succeeded with Hester and Mark , how with Cornelius ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 47]: I answer , if to that youth 's education had been added the common _ forms _ of a religious one , he would have been -- not perhaps a worse fellow , but a far more offensive one , and harder to influence for good .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 38]: Inclined to scoff , he would have had the religious material for jest and ribaldry ready to his hand ; while if he had wanted to start as a hypocrite , it would have been specially easy .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 34]: The true teaching for children is persons , history and doctrine in the old sense of the New Testament -- instruction in righteousness , that is -- not human theory about divine facts .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 26]: The major was still at Yrndale , when , in the gloomy month to which for reasons he had shifted his holiday , Cornelius arrived .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 19]: The major could hardly accept him as one of the family , so utterly inferior did he show .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 23]: There was a kind of mean beauty about his face and person and an evident varnish on his manners which revolted him .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 10]: `` That lad will bring grief on them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 5]: he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 22]: He was more than usually polite to the major : he was in the army , the goal of his aspiration !
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 26]: but he laughed at what he called his vulgarity in private , and delighted to annoy Hester with remarks upon her `` ancient adorer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 30]: Because he prized nothing of the kind , he could see nothing of his essential worth , and took note merely of his blunders , personal ways and oddities .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 33]: The major was not properly vulgar , only ill-bred : he had not had a sharp enough mother , jealous for the good manners as well as good behaviour of her boy .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 41]: There are many ladylike mothers -- ladylike because their mothers were ladies and taught them to behave like ladies , whose children do not turn out ladies and gentlemen because they do not teach them as they were taught themselves .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 12]: Cornelius had been taught -- and had learned nothing but manners .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 16]: He was vulgar with a vulgarity that went miles deeper than that of the major .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 33]: The major would have been sorry to find he had hurt the feelings of a dog ; Cornelius would have whistled on learning that he had hurt the feelings of a woman .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 12]: If the major was a clown , Cornelius was a cad .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 15]: The one was capable of genuine sympathy ; the other not yet of any .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 33]: The latter loved his own paltry self , counting it the most precious thing in creation ; the former was conceited it is true , but had no lofty opinion of himself .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 13]: Hence it was that he thought so much of his small successes .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 23]: His boasting of them was mainly an uneasy effort at establishing himself comfortably in his own eyes and the eyes of friends .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 19]: It was little more than a dog 's turning of himself round and round before he lies down .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 55]: He knew they were small things of which he boasted but he had no other , and scorned to invent : his great things , those in which he had shown himself a true and generous man , he looked on as matters of course , nor recognized anything in them worth thinking of .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 47]: He was not a great man , but had elements of greatness ; he had no vision of truth , but obeyed his moral instincts : when those should blossom into true intents , as one day they must , he would be a great man .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 7]: As yet he was not safe .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 15]: But how blessed a thing that God will judge us and man shall not !
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 12]: Where we see no difference , he sees ages of difference .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 29]: The very thing that looks to us for condemnation may to the eyes of God show in its heart ground of excuse , yea , of partial justification .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 20]: Only God 's excuse is , I suspect , seldom coincident with the excuse a man makes for himself .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 23]: If any one thinks that God will not search closely into things , I say there could not be such a God .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 8]: He will see the uttermost farthing paid .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 9]: His excuses are as just as his condemnations .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 46]: In respect of Cornelius the major was more careful than usual not to make himself disagreeable , for his feelings put him on his guard : there are not a few who behave better to those they do not like than to those they do .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 25]: He thus flattered , without intending it , the vanity of the youth , who did not therefore spare his criticism behind his back .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 20]: Hester usually answered in his defence , but sometimes would not condescend to justify him to such an accuser .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 11]: One day she lost her temper with her beam-eyed brother .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 26]: `` Cornelius , the major may have his faults , '' she said , `` but you are not the man to find them out .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 9]: He is ten times the gentleman you are .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 12]: I say it deliberately , and with all my soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 19]: As she began this speech , the major entered the room , but she did not see him .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 11]: He asked Cornelius to go with him for a walk .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 63]: Hoping he had only just come in , but a little anxious , Cornelius agreed , and as they walked behaved better than he had ever done before -- till he had persuaded himself that the major had heard nothing , when he speedily relapsed into his former manner -- one of condescension and thin offence to nearly every one about him .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 46]: But all the time the major was studying him , and saw into him deeper than his mother or Hester -- descried a certain furtive anxiety in the youth 's eyes when he was silent , an unrest as of trouble he would not show .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 24]: `` The rascal has been doing something wrong , '' he said to himself ; `` he is afraid of being found out !
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 19]: And found out he is sure to be ; he has not the brains to hide a thing !
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 22]: It 's not murder -- he ai n't got the pluck for that ; but it may be petty larceny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 5]: The weeks went on .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 52]: Cornelius 's month wore out , but he seemed restless for it to be gone , making no response to the lamentations of the children that Christmas was so near , and their new home such a grand one for keeping it in , and Corney not to be with them !
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 23]: He did not show them much kindness , but a little went a great way with them , and they loved him .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 35]: `` Mind you 're well , before I come again , Markie , '' he said as he took his leave ; `` you 're not a pleasant sight moping about the house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 9]: The tears came in the child 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 19]: He was not moping -- only weakly and even when looking a little sad , was quite happy .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 14]: `` I do n't think I mope , Hessy -- do I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 6]: `` What does Corney mean ?
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 11]: I do n't want to do what ai n't nice .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 7]: I want to be pleasant ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 35]: `` Never mind , Markie dear , '' answered Hester ; `` it 's only that you are not very strong -- not up to a game of romps as you used to be .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 9]: You will be merry again one day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 54]: `` I am merry enough , '' replied Mark ; `` only somehow the merry goes all about inside me , and do n't want to come out -- like the little bird , you know , that would n't go out of its cage though I left the door open for it .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 8]: I suppose it felt just like me .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 15]: I do n't care if I never go out of the house again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 16]: He was indeed happy enough -- more than happy when _ Majie _ was there .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 10]: They would be together most days all day long .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 17]: And the amount of stories Mark , with all his contemplativeness could swallow , was amazing .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 11]: That may be good food which can not give life .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 18]: But the family-party was soon to be broken up -- not by subtraction , but by addition .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 27]: The presence of the major had done nothing to spoil the homeness of home , but it was now for a time to be set aside .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 22]: There is something wrong with anyone who , entering a house of any kind , makes it less of a home .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 54]: The angel-stranger makes the children of a house more aware of their home ; they delight in showing it to him , for he takes interest in all that belongs to the family-life -- the only blessed life in heaven or upon earth , and sees the things as the children see them .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 18]: But the stranger of this world makes the very home by his presence feel out of doors .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXII .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 4]: A DISTINGUISHED GUEST .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 43]: A letter came from lord Gartley , begging Mrs. Raymount to excuse the liberty he took , and allow him to ask whether he might presume upon her wish , casually expressed , to welcome his aunt to the hospitality of Yrndale .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 41]: London was empty , therefore her engagements , although Parliament was sitting , were few , and he believed if Mrs. Raymount would take the trouble to invite her , she might be persuaded to avail herself of the courtesy .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 62]: `` I am well aware , '' he wrote , `` of the seeming rudeness of this suggestion , but you , dear Mrs. Raymount , can read between lines , and understand that it is no presumptuous desire to boast my friends to my relatives that makes me venture what to other eyes than yours might well seem an arrogance .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 29]: If you have not room for us , or if our presence would spoil your Christmas party , do not hesitate to put us off , I beg .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 24]: I shall understand you , and say nothing to my rather peculiar but most worthy aunt , waiting a more convenient season . ''
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 33]: The desired invitation was immediately dispatched , -- with some wry faces on the part of the head of the house who , however , would not oppose what his wife wished .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 60]: Notwithstanding his knowledge of men , that is , of fundamental human nature , Mr. Raymount was not good at reading a man who made himself agreeable , and did not tread on the toes of any of his theories -- of which , though mostly good , he made too much , as every man of theory does .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 36]: I would not have him supposed a man of theory only : such a man is hardly man at all ; but while he thought of the practice , he too sparingly practiced the thought .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 28]: He laid too much upon words altogether ; especially words in print , attributing more power to them for the regeneration of the world than was reasonable .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 36]: If he had known how few cared a pin 's point for those in which he poured out his mind , just flavored a little with his heart , he would have lost hope altogether .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 25]: If he had known how his arguments were sometimes used against the very principles he used them for , it would have enraged him .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 44]: Perhaps the knowledge of how few of those who admired his words acted upon them , would have made him think how little he struggled himself to do the things which by persuasion and argument he drove home upon the consciences of others .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 30]: He had not yet believed that to do right is more to do for the regeneration of the world than any quality or amount of teaching can do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 39]: _ The Press _ '' no doubt has a great power for good , but every man possesses , involved in the very fact of his consciousness , a greater power than any verbal utterance of truth whatever .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 35]: It is righteousness -- not of words , not of theories , but in being , that is , in vital action , which alone is the prince of the power of the spirit .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 31]: Where that is , everything has its perfect work ; where that is not , the man is not a power -- is but a walker in a vain show .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 20]: He did not see through or even into Gartley who was by no means a profound or intentional hypocrite .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 12]: But he never started on a new relation with any suspicions .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 13]: Men of the world called him too good , therefore a fool .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 67]: It was not however any over-exalted idea of human nature that led him astray in his judgment of the individual ; it was merely that he was too much occupied with what he counted his work -- with his theories first , then his writing of them , then the endless defending of them , to care to see beyond the focus of his short-sighted eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 15]: Vavasor was a gentlemanly fellow , and that went a long way with him .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 50]: He did not oppose him , and that went another long way : of all things he could not bear to be opposed in what he so plainly saw to be true , nor could think why every other honest man should not at once also see it true .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 25]: He forgot that the difficulty is not so much in recognizing the truth of a proposition , as in recognizing what the proposition is .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 31]: In the higher regions of thought the recognition of what a proposition is , and the recognition of its truth are more than homologous -- they are the same thing .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 39]: The ruin of a man 's teaching comes of his followers , such as having never touched the foundation he has laid , build upon it wood , hay , and stubble , fit only to be burnt .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 19]: Therefore , if only to avoid his worst foes , his admirers , a man should avoid system .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 35]: The more correct a system the worse will it be misunderstood ; its professed admirers will take both its errors and their misconceptions of its truths , and hold them forth as its essence .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 24]: Mr. Raymount , then , was not the man to take that care of his daughter which people of the world think necessary .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 35]: But , on the whole , even with the poor education they have , women , if let alone , would take better care of themselves , than father or brother will for them .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 15]: I say _ on the whole _ ; there may well be some exceptions .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 34]: The only thing making men more fit to take care of women than the women themselves , is their greater opportunity of knowing the character of men concerned -- which knowledge , alas !
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 46]: they generally use against those they claim to protect , concealing facts from the woman to whom they ought to be conveyed ; sometimes indeed having already deluded her with the persuasion that is of no consequence in the man which is essential in herself .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 17]: The day before Christmas-eve the expected visitors arrived -- just in time to dress for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 20]: The family was assembled in the large old drawing-room of dingy white and tarnished gold when Miss Vavasor entered .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 30]: She was tall and handsome and had been handsomer , for she was not of those who , growing within , grow more beautiful without as they grow older .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 35]: She was dressed in the plainest , handsomest fashion -- in black velvet , fitting well her fine figure , and half covered with point lace of a very thick texture -- Venetian probably .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 8]: The only stones she wore were diamonds .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 58]: Her features were regular ; her complexion was sallow , but not too sallow for the sunset of beauty ; her eyes were rather large , and of a clear gray ; her expression was very still , self-contained and self-dependent , without being self-satisfied ; her hair was more than half gray , but very plentiful .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 17]: Altogether she was one with an evident claim to distinction , never asserted because always yielded .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 24]: To the merest glance she showed herself well born , well nurtured , well trained , and well kept , hence well preserved .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 35]: At an age when a poor woman must have been old and wrinkled , and half undressed for the tomb , she was enough to make any company look distinguished by her mere presence .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 68]: Her manner was as simple as her dress -- without a trace of the vulgarity of condescension or the least more stiffness than was becoming with persons towards whose acquaintance , the rather that she was their guest , it was but decent to advance gently , while it was also prudent to protect her line of retreat , lest it should prove desirable to draw back .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 43]: She spoke with the utmost readiness and simplicity , looked with interest at Hester but without curiosity , had the sweetest smile at hand for use as often as wanted -- a modest smile which gleamed but a moment and was gone .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 16]: There was nothing in her behaviour to indicate a consciousness of error from her sphere .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 16]: The world had given her the appearance of much of which Christ gives the reality .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 14]: For the world very oddly prizes the form whose informing reality it despises .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 7]: Lord Gartley was in fine humour .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 10]: He had not before appeared to so great advantage .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 60]: Vavasor had never put off his company manner with Hester 's family , but Gartley was almost merry , quite graciously familiar -- as if set on bringing out the best points of his friends , and preventing his aunt 's greatness from making them abashed , or their own too much modesty from showing a lack of breeding .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 12]: But how shall I describe his face when major Marvel entered !
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 8]: he had not even feared his presence .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 41]: A blank dismay , such as could seldom have been visible there , a strange mingling of annoyance , contempt , and fear , clouded it with an inharmonious expression , which made him look much like a discomfited commoner .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 18]: In a moment he had overcome the unworthy sensation , and was again impassive and seemingly cool .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 24]: The major did not choose to see him at first , but was presented to Miss Vavasor by their hostess as her cousin .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 28]: He appeared a little awed by the fine woman , and comported himself with the dignity which awe gives , behaving like any gentleman used to society .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 88]: Seated next her at dinner , he did not once allude to pig-sticking or tiger-shooting , to elephants or niggers , or even to his regiment or India , but talked about the last opera and the last play , with some good criticisms on the acting he had last seen , conducting himself in such manner as would have made lord Gartley quite grateful to him , had he not put it down to the imperial presence of his high-born aunt , cowering his inferior nature .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 32]: But while indeed the major was naturally checked by a self-sufficing feminine presence , the cause that mainly operated to his suppression was of another kind and from an opposite source .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 14]: He had been strongly tempted all that day to a very different behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 55]: Remembering what he had heard of the character of the lady , and of the relation between her and her nephew , he knew at once , when told she was coming , that lord Gartley was bringing her down with the hope of gaining her consent to his asking Hester to marry him .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 22]: `` The rascal knows , '' said the major to himself , `` that nothing human could stand out against her !
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 15]: There is only her inferior position to urge from any point of view ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 36]: And therewith arose his temptation : might he not so comport himself before the aunt as to disgust her with the family , and save his lovely cousin from being sacrificed to a heartless noodle ?
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 16]: To the extent of his means he would do what money could to console her !
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 10]: It was at least better than the empty title !
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 54]: He recalled the ways of his youth , remembered with what delightful success he had annoyed aunts and cousins and lady friends , chuckled to think that some of them had for months passed him without even looking at him : `` I 'll settle the young ape 's hash for him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 5]: he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 15]: `` It only wants a little free-and-easyness with my lady to do the deed .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 15]: It can cost me nothing except her good opinion , which I can afford .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 27]: But I 'll lay you anything to nothing , if she knew the weight of my four quarters , she would have me herself after all !
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 16]: I do n't quite think myself a lady-killer : by George , my -- hum !
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 15]: -- _ entourage _ is against that , but where money is money can !
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 15]: Only I do n't want her , and my money is for her betters !
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 18]: What damned jolly fun it will be to send her out of the house in a rage !
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 8]: -- and a good deed done too !
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 9]: -- By George , I 'll do it !
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 7]: See if I do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 22]: He might possibly have found it not quite so easy to shock Miss Vavasor as some of his late country cousins .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 21]: In this resolution he had begun to dress , but before he had finished had begun to have his doubts .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 6]: Would it not be dishonorable ?
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 15]: Would it not bring such indignation upon him that even Mark would turn away ?
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 25]: Hester would never except so much as a postage-stamp from him if he brought disgrace on her family , and drove away her suitor !
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 6]: Besides , he might fail !
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 14]: They might come to an understanding and leave him out in the cold !
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 21]: By the time he was dressed he had resolved to leave the fancy alone , and behave like a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 14]: But now with every sip of wine the temptation came stronger and stronger .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 9]: The spirit of fun kept stirring in him .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 38]: Not merely for the sake of Hester , but for the joke of the thing , he was tempted , and had to keep fighting the impulse till the struggle was almost more than he could endure .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 12]: And just from this came the subdued character of his demeanour !
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 35]: What had threatened to destroy his manners for the evening turned out the corrective of his usual behaviour : as an escape from the strife within him , he tried to make himself agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 17]: Miss Vavasor being good natured , was soon interested and by and by pleased with him .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 18]: This reacted ; he began to feel pleased with her , and was more at his ease .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 21]: Therewith came the danger not unforeseen of some at the table : he began to tell one of his stories .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 19]: But he saw Hester look anxious ; and that was enough to put him on his careful honour .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 40]: Ere dinner was over he said to himself that if only the nephew were half as good a fellow as the aunt , he would have been happy to give the young people his blessing and a handsome present .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 5]: `` By Jove ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 16]: said lord Gartley , `` the scoundrel is not such a low fellow after all !
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 10]: I think I will try to forgive him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 26]: Now and then he would listen across the table to their talk , and everything the major said that pleased his aunt pleased him amazingly .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 27]: At one little witticism of hers in answer to one of the major 's he burst into such a hearty laugh that his aunt looked up .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 8]: `` You are amused , Gartley ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 9]: `` You are so clever , aunt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 3]: he returned .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 15]: `` Major Marvel has all the merit of my wit , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 31]: This gave the _ coup de grace _ to the major 's temptation to do evil that good might come , and sacrifice himself that Hester might not be sacrificed .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 17]: After dinner , they sat down to whist , of which Miss Vavasor was very fond .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 29]: When however she found they did not play for money , though she praised the asceticism of the manner , she plainly took little interest in the game .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 41]: The major therefore , who had no scruples either of conscience or of pocket in the matter , suggested that his lordship and Hester should take their places , and proposed cribbage to her , for what points she pleased .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 7]: To this she acceded at once .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 30]: The major was the best player in his regiment , but Miss Vavasor had much the better of it , and regretted she had not set the points higher .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 19]: All her life she had had money in the one eye and the poor earldom in the other .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 47]: The major laid down his halfcrowns so cheerfully , with such a look of satisfaction even , that she came quite to like the man , and to hope he would be there for some time , and prove as fond of cribbage as she was .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 16]: The fear of lord Gartley as to the malign influence of the major vanished entirely .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 32]: And now that he was more at his ease , and saw that his aunt was at least far from displeased with Hester , lord Gartley began to radiate his fascinations .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 6]: All his finer nature appeared .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 27]: He grew playful , even teasing ; gave again and again a quick repartee ; and sang as his aunt had never heard him sing before .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 32]: But when Hester sang , the thing was done , and the aunt won : she perceived at once what a sensation such a singer would make in her heavenly circle !
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 40]: She had , to be sure , a little _ too _ much expression , and sang well enough for a professional , which was too well for a lady with no object in her singing except to please .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 35]: But in manner and style , to mention neither beauty nor accomplishments , she would be a decided gain to the family , possessing even in herself a not inconsiderable counterpoise to the title .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 42]: Then who could tell but this cousin -- who seemed to have plenty of money , he parted with it so easily -- might be moved by like noble feelings with her own to make a poor countess a rich one .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 18]: The thing , I say , was settled , so far as the chief family-worshipper was concerned .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIII .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 4]: COURTSHIP IN EARNEST .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 10]: I do not care to dwell upon what followed .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 22]: Christmas was a merry day to all but the major , who did not like the engagement any better than before .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 8]: He found refuge and consolation with Mark .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 36]: The boy was merry in a mild , reflected way , because the rest were merry , but preferred his own room with `` dear Majie , '' to the drawing-room with the grand lady .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 29]: He would steal from it , assured that in a moment the major would be after him , to keep him company , and tell him such stories !
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 13]: Lord Gartley now began to make love with full intent and purpose .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 9]: `` How could she listen to him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 6]: says this and that reader ?
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 13]: I can but echo the exclamation , `` How could she ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 13]: To explain the thing is more than I am bound to undertake .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 37]: As I may have said twenty times before , how this woman will have this man is one of the deeper mysteries of the world -- yea , of the maker of the world , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 43]: One thing I may fairly suggest -- that where men see no reason why a woman should love this or that man , she may see something in him which they do not see , or do not value as she does .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 9]: Alas for her if she only imagines it !
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 46]: Another thing we may be sure of -- that in few cases does the woman see what the men know : much of that which is manifest to the eyes of the male world , is by the male world scrupulously hidden from the female .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 49]: One thing more I would touch upon which men are more likely never to have thought of than to have forgotten : that the love which a beautiful woman gives a man , is in itself not an atom more precious than that which a plain woman gives .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 28]: In the two hearts they are the same , if the hearts be like ; if not , the advantage may well be with the plain woman .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 18]: The love of a beautiful woman is no more thrown away than the love of the plainest .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 14]: The same holds with regard to women of differing intellectual developments or endowment .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 78]: But when a woman of high hopes and aims -- a woman filled with eternal aspirations after life , and unity with her divine original gives herself to such a one as lord Gartley , I can not help thinking she must have seriously mistaken some things both in him and in herself , the consequence , probably , of some self-sufficiency , ambition , or other fault in her , which requires the correction of suffering .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 8]: Hester found her lover now very pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 99]: If sometimes he struck a jarring chord , she was always able to find some way of accounting for it , or explaining it away -- if not entirely to her satisfaction , yet so far that she was able to go on hoping everything , and for the present to put off any further consideration of the particular phenomenon to the time when , like most self-deceiving women , she _ scarcely _ doubted she would have greater influence over him -- namely , the time when , man and wife , they would be one flesh .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 34]: But where there is not already a far deeper unity than marriage can give , marriage itself can do little to bring two souls together -- may do much to drive them asunder .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 25]: She began to put him in training , as she thought , for the help he was to give her with her loved poor .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 6]: `` What a silly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 5]: exclaims a common-minded girl-reader .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 12]: `` That was not the way to land her fish ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 42]: But let those who are content to have fishy husbands , net or hook and land them as they can ; a woman has more in herself than any husband can give her , though he may take much from her .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 29]: Lord Gartley had no real conception of her outlook on life , and regarded all her endeavor as born of the desire to perfect his voice and singing .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 15]: With such teaching he must , he imagined , soon become her worthy equal .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 12]: He had no notion of the sort of thing genius is .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 3]: Few have .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 22]: They think of it as something supreme in itself , whereas it is altogether dependent on truth in the inward parts .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 20]: It may last for a time separated from truth , but it dies its life , not lives it .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 30]: Its utterance depends on enthusiasm ; all enthusiasm depends on love and nobility of purpose ; and love and nobility depend upon truth -- that is , live truth .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 23]: Not millions of years , without an utter regeneration of nature , could make such a man as Gartley sing like Hester .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 32]: His faculties were in the power of decay , therefore of the things that pass ; Hester was of the powers that give life , and keep things going and growing .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 12]: She sang because of the song that was in her soul .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 17]: Her music came out of her being , not out of her brain and her throat .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 20]: If such a one as Gartley can sing , there is no reason why he should be kept singing .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 21]: In all the arts the man who does not reach to higher things falls away from the things he has .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 13]: The love of money will ruin poet , painter , or musician .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 9]: For Hester the days now passed in pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 39]: I fear the closer contact with lord Gartley , different he was in her thought from what he was in his own best , influenced at least the _ rate _ of her growth towards the upper regions .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 42]: We can not be heart and soul and self in the company of the evil -- and the untrue is the evil , however beheld as an angel of light in the mirage of our loving eyes , without sad loss .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 13]: Her prayers were not so fervent , her aspirations not so strong .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 15]: I see again the curl on the lip of a certain kind of girl-reader !
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 7]: Her judgment here is but foolishness .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 31]: She is much too low in the creation yet , be she as high-born and beautiful as a heathen goddess , to understand the things of which I am writing .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 26]: But she has got to understand them -- they are not mine -- and the understanding may come in dread pain , and dire dismay .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 50]: Hester was one of those who in their chambers are not alone , but with him who seeth in secret ; and not to get so near to God in her chamber -- I can but speak in human figure -- did not argue well for the new relationship .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 9]: But the Lord is mindful of his own .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 8]: He does not forget because we forget .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 21]: Horror and pain may come , but not because he forgets -- nay , just because he does not forget .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 8]: That is a thing God never does .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 32]: There are many women who would have bewitched Gartley more , yet great was his delight in the presence and converse of Hester , and he yielded himself with pleasing grace .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 44]: Inclined to rebel at times when wearied with her demands on his attention and endeavour , he yet condescended to them with something of the playfulness with which one would humour a child : he would have a sweet revenge by and by !
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 22]: His turn would come soon , and he would have to instruct her in many things she was now ignorant of !
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 38]: She had never moved in his great world : he must teach her its laws , instruct her how to shine , how to make the most of herself , how to do honour to his choice !
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 15]: He had but the vaguest idea of the _ folly _ that possessed her .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 23]: He thought of her relation to the poor but as a passing -- indeed a past phase of a hitherto objectless life .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 16]: Anything beyond a little easy benevolence would be impossible to the wife of lord Gartley !
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 29]: That she should contemplate the pursuit of her former objects with even greater freedom and devotion than before , would have seemed to him a thing utterly incredible .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 27]: And Hester would have been equally staggered to find he had so failed to understand her after the way she had opened her heart to him .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 17]: To imagine that for anything she would forsake the work she had been sent to do !
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 66]: So things went on _ upon a mutual misunderstanding _ -- to make a bull for my purpose -- each in the common meaning of the word getting more and more in love with the other every day , while in reality they were separating farther and farther , in as much as each one was revelling in thoughts that were alien to the other .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 20]: An occasional blasting doubt would cross the mind of Hester , but she banished it like an evil spectre .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 11]: Miss Vavasor continued the most pleasant and unexacting of guests .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 28]: Her perfect breeding , sustained by a quiet temper and kindly disposition , was easily , by simple hearts , taken for the sweetness it only simulated .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 29]: To people like Miss Vavasor does the thought never occur -- what if the thing they find it so necessary to simulate should actually in itself be indispensable ?
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 13]: What if their necessity of simulating it comes of its absolute necessity !
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 39]: She found the company of the major agreeable in the slow time she had for her nephew 's sake to pass with such primitive people , and was glad of what she might otherwise have counted barely endurable .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 36]: For Mr. Raymount , he would not leave what he counted his work for any goddess in creation : Hester had got her fixedness of purpose through him , and its direction through her mother .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 48]: But it was well he did not give Miss Vavasor much of his company : if they had been alone together for a quarter of an hour , they would have parted sworn foes , hating each other almost as much as is possible without having loved .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 36]: So the major , instead of putting a stop to the unworthy alliance , found himself actually furthering the affair , doing his part with the lady on whom the success of the enemy depended .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 48]: He was still now and then tempted to break through and have a hideous revenge ; but , with no great sense of personal dignity to restrain him , he was really a man of honour and behaved like one , curbing himself with no little severity .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 47]: So the time went on till after the twelfth night , when Miss Vavasor took her leave for a round of visits , and lord Gartley went up to town , with intention thereafter to pay a visit to his property , such as it was .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 23]: He would return to Yrndale in three weeks or a month , when the final arrangements for the marriage would be made .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 19]: A correspondence naturally commenced , and Hester , unwarned by former experience , received his first letter joyfully .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 17]: But , the letter read , lo , there was the same disappointment as of old !
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 13]: And as the first letter , so the last and all between .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 86]: In Hester 's presence , she suggesting and leading , he would utter what seemed to indicate the presence of what she would have in him ; but alone in his room , without guide to his thoughts , without the stimulus of her presence or the sense of her moral atmosphere , the best things he could write were poor enough ; they had no bones in them , and no other fire than that which the thought of Hester 's loveliness could supply .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 7]: So his letters were not inspiriting .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 14]: They absorbed her atmosphere and after each followed a period of mental asphyxy .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 29]: Had they been those of a person indifferent to her , she would have called them stupid , thrown them down , and thought no more of them .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 15]: As it was , I doubt if she read many of them twice over .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 16]: But all would be well , she said to herself , when they met again .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 11]: It was her absence that oppressed him , poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 11]: He was out of spirits , and could not write !
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 11]: He had not the faculty for writing that some had !
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 26]: Her father had told her of men that were excellent talkers , but set them down pen in hand and not a thought would come !
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 10]: Was it not to his praise rather than blame ?
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 17]: Was not the presence of a man 's own kind the best inspirer of his speech ?
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 28]: It was his loving human nature -- she would have persuaded herself , but never quite succeeded -- that made utterance in a letter impossible to him .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 19]: Yet she _ would _ have liked a little genuine , definite response to the things she wrote !
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 10]: He seemed to have nothing to say from himself !
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 42]: He would assent and echo , but any response was always such as to make her doubt whether she had written plainly , invariably suggesting things of this world and not of the unseen , the world of thought and being .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 21]: And when she mentioned work he always replied as if she meant an undefined something called _ doing good _ .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 56]: He never doubted the failure of that foolish concert of ladies and gentlemen given to the riff-raff of London , had taught her that whether man be equal in the sight of God or not , any attempt on the part of their natural superiors to treat them as such could not but be disastrous .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIV .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 2]: CALAMITY .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 27]: One afternoon the post brought side by side with a letter from lord Gartley , one in a strange-looking cramped hand , which Mrs. Raymount recognized .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 9]: `` What can Sarah be writing about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 12]: she said , a sudden foreboding of evil crossing her mind .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 20]: `` The water-rate perhaps , '' answered Hester , opening her own letter as she withdrew to read it .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 41]: For she did not like to read Gartley 's letters before her mother -- not from shyness , but from shame : she would have liked ill to have her learn how poor her Gartley 's utterances were upon paper .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 18]: But ere she was six slow steps away , she turned at a cry from her mother .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 9]: `` Good heavens , what can it be ?
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 7]: Something has happened to him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 4]: said Mrs. Raymount .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 11]: Her face was white almost as the paper she held .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 7]: Hester put her arms round her .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 3]: `` Mother !
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 2]: mother !
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 5]: what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 6]: `` Anything about Corney ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 11]: `` I thought something would come to stop it all .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 6]: We were too happy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 8]: she moaned , and began to tremble .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 17]: `` Come to papa , mamma dear , '' said Hester , frightened , but quiet .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 9]: She stood as if fixed to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 24]: Mr. Raymount 's letters had been carried to him in the study , and one of them had put him into like perturbation .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 23]: He was pacing up and down the room almost as white as his wife , but his pallor was that of rage .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 5]: `` The scoundrel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 13]: he groaned , and seizing a chair hurled it against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 11]: `` I had the suspicion he was a mean dog !
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 15]: Now all the world will know it -- and that he is my son !
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 23]: What have I done -- what has my wife done , that we should give being to a vile hound like this ?
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 11]: What is there in her or in me -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 26]: There he paused , for he remembered : far back in the family some five generations or so , one had been hanged for forgery .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 14]: He threw himself in a chair , and wept with rage and shame .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 17]: He had for years been writing of family and social duties ; here was his illustration !
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 11]: His books were his words ; here was his deed !
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 8]: How should he ever show himself again !
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 6]: He would leave the country !
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 4]: Damn the property !
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 8]: The rascal should never succeed to it !
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 9]: Mark should have it -- if he lived !
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 7]: But he hoped he would die !
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 28]: He would like to poison them all , and go with them out of the disgrace -- all but the dog that had brought it on them !
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 5]: Hester marry an earl !
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 8]: Not if the truth would prevent it !
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 8]: Her engagement must at once be broken !
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 9]: Lord Gartley marry the sister of a thief !
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 17]: While he was thus raging a knock came to the door , and a maid entered .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 27]: `` Please , sir , '' she said , `` Miss Raymount says will you come to mis ` ess : she 's taken bad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 6]: This brought him to himself .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 7]: The horrible fate was hers too !
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 6]: He must go to her .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 9]: How could she have heard the vile news ?
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 6]: She must have heard it !
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 7]: what else could make her ill !
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 8]: He followed the maid to the lawn .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 9]: It was a cold morning of January sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 23]: There stood his wife in his daughter 's arms , trembling from head to foot , and apparently without power of motion !
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 45]: He asked no question , took her in his arms , bore her to her room , laid her on the bed , and sat down beside her , hardly caring if she died , for the sooner they were all dead the better !
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 20]: She lay like one dead , and do what she could Hester was unable to bring her to herself .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 8]: But by and by the doctor came .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 19]: She had caught up the letter and as her father sat there , she handed it to him .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 26]: The substance and manner of it were these : `` Dear mistress , it is time to let you know of the goings on here .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 50]: I never held with bearing of tales against my fellow-servants , and perhaps it 's worse to bring tales against Master Cornelius , as is your own flesh and blood , but what am I to do as was left in charge , and to keep the house respectable ?
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 64]: He 's not been home this three nights ; and you ought to know as there is a young lady , his cousin from New Zealand , as is come to the house a three or four times since you went away , and stayed a long time with him , though it is some time now that I ai n't seen her .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 73]: She is a pretty , modest-looking young lady ; though I must say I was ill-pleased when Mr. Cornelius would have her stay all night ; and I up and told him if she was his cousin it was n't as if she was his sister , and it would n't do , and I would walk out of the house if he insisted on me making up a bed for her .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 25]: Then he laughed in my face , and told me I was an old fool , and he was only making game of me .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 19]: But that was after he done his best to persuade me , and I would n't be persuaded .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 27]: I told him if neither he nor the young lady had a character to keep , I had one to lose , and I would n't .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 40]: But I do n't think he said anything to her about staying all night ; for she come down the stair as innocent-like as any dove , and bid me good night smiling , and they walked away together .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 65]: And I would n't by no means have took upon me to be a spy , nor I would n't have mentioned the thing , for it 's none of my business so long as nobody does n't abuse the house as is my charge ; but he ai n't been home for three nights , and there is the feelings of a mother !
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 29]: and it 's my part to let her know as her son ai n't slept in his own bed for three nights , and that 's a fact .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 23]: So no more at present , and I hope dear mis ` ess it wo n't kill you to hear on it .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 33]: O why did his father leave him alone in London , with none but an old woman like me , as he always did look down upon , to look after him !
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 27]: Your humble servant for twenty years to command , S. H. '' * * * * * Mrs. Raymount had not read the half of this .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 14]: It was enough to learn he had not been home for three nights .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 4]: How is it ?
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 38]: Parents with no reasonable ground for believing their children good , nay with considerable ground for believing them worse than many , are yet seized as by the awfully incredible when they hear they are going wrong .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 32]: Helen Raymount concluded her boy had turned into bad ways because left in London , although she knew he had never taken to good ways while they were all with him .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 15]: If he had never gone right why should she wonder he had gone wrong ?
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 18]: The doctor was sitting by the bedside , watching the effect of something he had given her .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 24]: Mr. Raymount rose and led Hester from the room -- sternly almost , as if she had been to blame for it all .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 26]: Some people when they are angry , speak as if they were angry with the person to whom they are in fact looking for comfort .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 43]: When in trouble few of us are masters enough of ourselves , because few of us are children enough of our Father in heaven , to behave like gentlemen -- after the fashion of `` the first stock father of gentleness . ''
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 10]: But Hester understood her mother and did not resent .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 11]: `` Is this all your mother knows , Hester ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 12]: said her father , pointing to the letter in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 14]: She told him her mother had read but the first sentence or two .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 13]: He was silent -- returned to the bedside , and stood silent .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 28]: The life of his dearest had been suddenly withered at the root , like the gourd of Jonah , and had she not learned nearly the worst !
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 17]: His letter was from his wife 's brother , in whose bank Cornelius was a clerk .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 10]: A considerable deficit had been discovered in his accounts .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 22]: He had not been to the bank for two days before , and no trace of him was to be found .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 44]: His uncle , from regard to the feelings of his sister , had not allowed the thing to transpire , but had requested the head of his office to be silent : he would wait his brother-in-law 's reply before taking any steps .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 37]: He feared the misguided youth had reckoned on the forbearance of an uncle ; but for the sake of his own future , if for no other reason , the thing could not be passed over !
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 5]: `` Passed over ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 34]: Had Gerald Raymount been a Roman with the power of life and death over his children , he would in his present mood have put his son to death with his own hands .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 34]: But for his wife 's illness he would have been already on the way to London to repay the missing money ; for his son 's sake he would not cross his threshold !
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 8]: So at least he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 6]: But something must be done .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 6]: He must send some one !
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 6]: Who was there to send ?
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 4]: There was Hester !
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 8]: With her uncle she was a favourite !
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 31]: nor would she dread the interview , which , as the heat of his rage yielded to a cold despair , he felt would be to him an unendurable humiliation .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 45]: For he had had many arguments , not always quite friendly , with this same brother-in-law concerning the way he brought up his children : they had all turned out well , and here was his miserable son a felon , disgracing both families !
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 6]: Yes ; let Hester go !
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 12]: There were things a woman could do better than a man !
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 11]: Hester was no child now , but a capable woman !
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 19]: While she was gone he could be making up his mind what to do with the wretched boy !
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 22]: He led Hester again from her mother 's room to his , and gave her her uncle 's letter to read .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 8]: Tell her its contents he could not .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 31]: He watched her as she read -- watched his own heart as it were in her bosom -- saw her grow pale , then flush , then turn pale again .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 11]: At length her face settled into a look of determination .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 19]: She laid the letter on the table , and rose with a steady troubled light in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 18]: What she was thinking of he could not tell , but he made at once the proposal .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 30]: `` Hester , '' he said , `` I can not leave your mother ; you must go for me to your uncle and do the best you can .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 22]: If it were not for your mother I would have the rascal prosecuted ; but it would break her heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 26]: Hester wasted no words of reply : She had often heard him say there ought to be no interference with public justice for private ends .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 9]: `` Yes , papa , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 9]: `` I shall be ready in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 12]: If I ride Hotspur I shall catch the evening train . ''
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 10]: `` There is time to take the brougham . ''
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 12]: `` Am I to say anything to Corney , papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 10]: she asked , her voice trembling over the name .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 14]: `` You have nothing to do with him , '' he answered sternly .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 26]: `` Where is the good of keeping a villain from being as much of a villain as he has got it in him to be ?
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 21]: I will sign you a blank cheque , which your uncle can fill up with the amount he has stolen .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 11]: Come for it as soon as you are ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 28]: Hester thought as she went whether , if it had not been for the possibility of repentance , the world would ever have been made at all .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 42]: On her way to her room she met the major , looking for herself , to tell him about her mother , of whose attack , as he had been out for a long walk , he had but just heard .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 9]: `` But what did it , Hester ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 18]: `` I can smell in the air something has gone wrong : what the deuce is it ?
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 15]: There 's always something getting out of gear in this best of worlds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 20]: She would have passed him with a word in her haste , but he turned and walked with her .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 37]: `` The individual , any individual , all the individuals , '' he went on , `` may come to smash , but the world is all right , notwithstanding , and a good serviceable machine !
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 25]: -- by George , without a sound pinion in all the carcass of it , or an engineer that cares there should be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 26]: They had met in a dark part of the corridor , and had now , at a turn in it , come opposite a window .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 18]: Then first the major saw Hester 's face : he had never seen her look like that !
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 8]: `` Is your mother in danger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 21]: he asked , his tone changing to the gentlest , for his heart was in reality a most tender one .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 10]: `` She is very ill , '' answered Hester .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 11]: `` The doctor has been with her now three hours .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 9]: I am going up to London for papa .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 7]: He ca n't leave her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 12]: `` Going up to London -- and by the night-train ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 6]: said the major to himself .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 8]: `` Then there has been bad news !
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 5]: What can they be ?
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 3]: Money matters ?
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 14]: No ; cousin Helen is not the one to send health after money !
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 7]: It 's something worse than that !
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 4]: I have it !
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 12]: That scoundrel Corney has been about some mischief -- damn him !
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 12]: I should n't be surprised to hear anything bad of him !
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 10]: But what can you do , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 4]: he said aloud .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 11]: `` It 's not fit -- '' He looked up .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 4]: Hester was gone .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 44]: She put a few things together , drank a cup of tea brought to her room , went to her father and received the cheque , and was ready by the time the brougham came to the door with a pair of horses .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 33]: She would not look at her mother again lest she might be sufficiently revived to wonder where she was going , but hastened down , and saw no one on the way .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 16]: One of the servants was in the hall , and opened the carriage-door for her .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 18]: The moment it closed she was on her way through the gathering dusk to the railway station .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 33]: While the lodge-gate was being opened , she thought she saw some one get up on the box beside the coachman , and fancied it must be a groom going with them .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 25]: The drive was a long and anxious one ; it seemed to her all the time as if the horses could not get on .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 26]: In spots the road was slippery , and as the horses were not roughed they had to go slowly , and parts were very heavy .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 21]: What might not be happening to Corney , she thought , while she was on the way to his rescue !
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 9]: She kept fancying one dreadful thing after another .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 16]: It was like a terrible dream , only with the assurance of reality in it .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 28]: The carriage stopped , the door opened , and there was the major in a huge fur coat , holding out his hand to help her down .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 14]: It was as great a pleasure as surprise , and she showed both .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 15]: `` You did n't think I was going to let you travel alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 12]: `` Who knows what wolf might be after my Red riding-hood !
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 24]: I 'll go in another carriage of course if you wish it ; but in this train I 'm going to London . ''
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 12]: Hester told him she was only too glad of his escort .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 43]: Careful not to seem in the least bent on the discovery of the cause of her journey , he seated himself in the farthest corner , for there was no one else in the carriage , and pretended to go to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 16]: And now first began Hester 's private share in the general misery of the family .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 32]: In the presence of her suffering father and mother , she put off looking into the mist that kept gathering deeper and deeper , filled with forms undefined , about herself .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 13]: Now these forms began to reveal themselves in shifting yet recognizable reality .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 30]: If this miserable affair should be successfully hushed up , there was yet one must know it : she must immediately acquaint lord Gartley with what had taken place !
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 44]: And therewith one of the shapes in the mist settled into solidity : if the love between them had been of an ideal character , would she have had a moment 's anxiety as to how her lover would receive the painful news ?
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 19]: But therewith her own mind was made up : if he but hesitated , that would be enough !
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 18]: Nothing could make her marry a man who had once hesitated whether to draw back or not .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 4]: It was impossible .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXV .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 3]: IN LONDON .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 12]: It was much too early to do anything when they arrived .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 29]: Nor could Hester go to her uncle 's house : it was in one of the suburbs , and she would reach it before the household was stirring .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 7]: They went therefore to Addison square .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 31]: When they had roused Sarah , the major took his leave of Hester , promising to be with her in a few hours , and betook himself to his hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 64]: As she would not be seen at the bank , with the risk of being recognized as the sister of Cornelius and rousing speculation , she begged the major when he came to be her messenger to her uncle , and tell him that she had come from her father , asking him where it would be convenient for him to see her .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 15]: The major undertook the commission at once , and went without asking a question .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 15]: Early in the afternoon her uncle came , and behaved to her very kindly .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 36]: He was chiefly a man of business , and showing neither by look nor tone that he had sympathy with the trouble she and her parents were in , by his very reticence revealed it .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 44]: His manner was the colder that he was studiously avoiding the least approximation to remark on the conduct or character of the youth -- an abstinence which , however , had a chilling and hopeless effect upon the ardent mind of the sister .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 62]: At last , when she had given him her father 's cheque , with the request that he would himself fill it up with the amount of which he had been robbed , and he with a slight deprecatory smile and shrug had taken it , she ventured to ask what he was going to do in regard to her brother .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 35]: `` When I take this cheque , '' answered her uncle , `` it indicates that I treat the matter as a debt discharged , and leave him entirely in your father 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 8]: He must do as he sees fit .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 25]: I am sorry for you all , and for you especially that you should have had to take an active part in the business .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 10]: I wish your father could have come up himself .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 5]: My poor sister ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 47]: `` I can not be glad my father could not come , '' said Hester , `` but I am glad he did not come , for he is so angry with Cornelius that I could almost believe he would have insisted on your prosecuting him .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 42]: You never saw such indignation as my father 's at any wrong done by one man to another -- not to say by one like Cornelius to one like you , uncle , who have always been so kind to him !
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 6]: It is a terrible blow !
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 9]: He will never get over it -- never !
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 3]: never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 34]: She broke down , and wept bitterly -- the more bitterly that they were her first tears since learning the terrible fact , for she was not one who readily found such relief .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 80]: To think of their family , of which she was too ready to feel proud , being thus disgraced , with one for its future representative who had not even the commonest honesty , and who , but that his crime had been committed against an indulgent relative , would assuredly , for the sake of the business morals of his associates , if for no other reason , have been prosecuted for felony , was hard to bear !
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 21]: But to one of Hester 's deep nature and loyalty to the truth , there were considerations far more sad .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 16]: How was ever such a child of the darkness to come to love the light ?
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 50]: How was one who cared so little for righteousness , one who , in all probability , would only excuse or even justify his crime -- if indeed he would trouble himself to do so much -- how was one like him to be brought to contrition and rectitude ?
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 25]: There was a hope , though a poor one , in the shame he must feel at the disgrace he had brought upon himself .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 3]: But alas !
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 42]: if the whole thing was to be kept quiet , and the semblance allowed that he had got tired of business and left it , how would even what regenerating power might lie in shame be brought to bear upon him ?
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 41]: If not brought to _ open _ shame , he would hold his head as high as ever -- be arrogant under the protection of the fact that the disgrace of his family would follow upon the exposure of himself .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 19]: When her uncle left her , she sat motionless a long time , thinking much but hoping little .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 9]: The darkness gathered deeper and deeper around her .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 15]: The ruin of her own promised history seemed imminent upon that of her family .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 12]: What sun of earthly joy could ever break through such clouds !
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 18]: There was indeed a sun that nothing could cloud , but it seemed to shine far away .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 20]: Some sorrows seem beyond the reach of consolation , in as much as their causes seem beyond setting right .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 16]: They can at best , _ as it seems _ , only be covered over .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 31]: Forgetfulness alone seems capable of removing their sting , and from that cure every noble mind turns away as unworthy both of itself , and of its Father in heaven .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 29]: But the human heart has to go through much before it is able to house even a suspicion of the superabounding riches of the creating and saving God .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 60]: The foolish child thinks there can be nothing where he sees nothing ; the human heart feels as if where it can not devise help , there is none possible to God ; as if God like the heart must be content to botch the thing up , and make , as we say , the best of it .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 26]: But as the heavens are higher than the earth , so are his ways higher than our ways , and his thoughts than our thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 15]: `` But what _ can _ be done when -- so and so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 22]: says my reader ; for , whatever generalities I utter , his hurt seems not the less unapproachable of any help .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 41]: You think , I answer , that you see all round your own sorrow ; whereas much the greater part of the very being you call yours , is as unknown to you as the other side of the moon .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 25]: It is as impossible you should understand it therefore , its sorrow , as that you should understand God , who alone understands you .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 41]: Be developed into the divine idea of you ; for your grief 's sake let God have his way with you , and not only will all be well , but you shall say , `` It is well . ''
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 23]: It was a sore and dreary time for Hester , alone in the room where she had spent so many happy hours .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 24]: She sat in a window , looking out upon the leafless trees and the cold gloomy old statue in the midst of them .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 6]: Frost was upon every twig .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 9]: A thin sad fog filled the comfortless air .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 17]: There might be warm happy homes many , but such no more belonged to her world !
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 18]: The fire was burning cheerfully behind her , but her eyes were fixed on the dreary square .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 14]: She was hardly thinking -- only letting thoughts and feelings come and go .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 91]: What a thing is life and being , when a soul has become but the room in which ghosts hold their revel ; when the man is no longer master of himself , can no more say to this or that thought , thou shall come , and thou shall go ; but is a slave to his own existence , can neither cease to be , nor order his being -- able only in fruitless rebellion to entangle himself yet more in the net he has knotted around him !
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 41]: Such is every one parted from the essential life , who has not the Power by which he lives one with him , holding pure and free and true the soul he sent forth from the depths of his being .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 43]: I repent me of the ignorance wherein I ever said that God made man out of nothing : there is no nothing out of which to make anything ; God is all in all , and he made us out of himself .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 16]: He who is parted from God has no original nothingness with which to take refuge .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 9]: He is a live discord , an anti-truth .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 54]: He is a death fighting against life , and doomed to endless vanity ; an opposition to the very power by whose strength yet in him he opposes ; a world of contradictions , not greedy after harmony , but greedy for lack of harmony -- his being an abyss of positive negation .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 44]: Not such was Hester , and although her thoughts now came and went without her , they did not come and go without God ; and a truth from the depths of her own true being was on its way to console her .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 8]: How would her lover receive the news ?
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 13]: -- that was the agitating question ; what would he thereupon do ?
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 58]: She could not at once write to acquaint him with the grief and disgrace that had fallen upon them , for she did not know where precisely he was : his movements were not fixed ; and she dreaded the falling of such a letter as she would have to write into any hands except his own .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 56]: But another , and far stronger reason against writing to him , made itself presently clear to her mind : if she wrote , she could not know how he received her sad story ; and if his mind required making up , which was what she feared , he would have time for it !
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 5]: This would not do !
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 12]: She must communicate the dread defiling fact with her own lips !
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 8]: She must see how he took it !
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 21]: Like Hamlet with the king at the play , `` If he but blench , I know my course ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 42]: If he showed the slightest change towards her , the least tendency to regard his relation to her as an entanglement , to regret that he had involved himself with the sister of a thief , marry her he should not !
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 9]: That was settled as the earth 's course !
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 23]: If he was not to be her earthly refuge in this trouble as in any other , she would none of him !
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 12]: If it should break her heart she would none of him !
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 8]: But break her heart it would not !
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 9]: There were worse evils than losing a lover !
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 18]: There was losing a true man -- and that he would not be if she lost him !
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 98]: The behaviour of Cornelius had perhaps made her more capable of doubt ; possibly her righteous anger with him inclined her to imagine grounds of anger with another ; but probably this feeling of uncertainty with regard to her lover had been prepared for by things that had passed between them since their engagement , but upon which regarding herself as his wife , she had not allowed herself to dwell , turning her thought to the time when , as she imagined , she would be able to do so much more for and with him .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 13]: And now she was almost in a mood to quarrel with him !
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 23]: Brought to moral bay , she stood with her head high , her soul roused , and every nerve strung to defence .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 29]: She had not yet cast herself for defence on the care of her Father in heaven , who is jealous for the righteousness of those who love righteousness .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 8]: But he was not far from her .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 9]: Yet deeper into the brooding fit she sank .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 40]: Weary with her journey and the sleepless night , her brain seemed to work itself ; when suddenly came the thought that , after so long a separation , she was at last in the midst of her poor .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 9]: But how was she to face them now !
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 8]: how hold up her head amongst them !
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 8]: how utter a word of gentlest remonstrance !
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 25]: Who was she to have dared speak to them of the evil of their ways , and the bad influence of an ill-behaved family !
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 20]: But how lightly they bore such ills as that which was now breaking her down with trouble and shame !
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 44]: Even such of them as were honest people , would have this cousin or that uncle , or even a son or the husband _ in _ for so many months , and think only of when they would have him out again !
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 5]: Misfortune had overtaken them !
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 7]: and they loved them no less .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 17]: The man or the woman was still man or woman , mother or husband to them .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 11]: Nothing could degrade them beyond the reach of their sympathies !
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 27]: They had no thought of priding themselves against them because they themselves had not transgressed the law , neither of drawing back from them with disgust .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 54]: And were there not a thousand wrong things done in business and society which had no depressing effect either on those who did them , or those whose friends did them -- only because these wrongs not having yet come under the cognizance of law had not yet come to be considered disgraceful ?
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 16]: Therewith she felt nearer to her poor than ever before , and it comforted her .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 8]: The bare soul of humanity comforted her .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 74]: She was not merely of the same flesh and blood with them -- not even of the same soul and spirit only , but of the same failing , sinning , blundering breed ; and that not alone in the general way of sin , ever and again forsaking the fountain of living water , and betaking herself to some cistern , but in their individual sins was she not their near relative ?
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 20]: Their shame was hers : the son of her mother , the son of her father was a thief !
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 13]: She was and would be more one with them than ever before !
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 20]: If they made less of crime in another , they also made less of innocence from it in themselves !
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 26]: Was it not even better to do wrong , she asked herself , than to think it a very grand thing not to do it ?
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 15]: What merit was there in being what it would be contemptible not to be ?
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 26]: The Lord Christ could get nearer to the publican than the Pharisee , to the woman that was a sinner than the self-righteous honest woman !
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 40]: The Pharisee was a good man , but he thought it such a fine thing to be good that God did not like him nearly so well as the other who thought it a sad thing to be bad !
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 29]: Let her but get among her nice , honest , wicked poor ones , out of this atmosphere of pretence and appearance , and she would breathe again !
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 57]: She dropped upon her knees , and cried to her Father in heaven to make her heart clean altogether , to deliver her from everything mean and faithless , to make her turn from any shadow of ill as thoroughly as she would have her brother repent of the stealing that made them all so ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 31]: Like a woman in the wrong she drew nigh the feet of her master ; she too was a sinner ; her heart needed his cleansing as much as any !
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 10]: And with that came another God-given thought of self-accusing .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 29]: For suddenly she perceived that self had been leading her astray : she was tender towards those farther from her , hard towards the one nearer to her !
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 28]: It was easy to be indulgent towards those whose evil did not touch herself : to the son of her own mother she was severe and indignant !
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 30]: If she condemned him , who would help his mother to give him the love of which he stood in the sorer need that he was unworthy of it ?
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 38]: Corney whom she had nursed as a baby -- who used to crow when she appeared -- could it be that she who had then loved him so dearly had ceased and was loving him no more ?
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 38]: True , he had grown to be teasing and trying in every way , seeming to despise her and all women together ; but was not that part of the evil disease that clung fast to him ?
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 18]: If God were to do like her , how many would be giving honour to his Son ?
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 26]: But God knew all the difficulties that beset men , and gave them fair play when sisters did not : he would redeem Corney yet !
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 17]: But was it possible he should ever wake to see how ugly his conduct had been ?
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 26]: It _ seemed _ impossible ; but surely there were powers in God 's heart that had not yet been brought to bear upon him !
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 13]: Perhaps this , was one of them -- letting him disgrace himself !
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 14]: If he could but be made ashamed of himself there would be hope !
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 37]: And in the meantime she must get the beam out of her own eye , that she might see to take the mote or the beam , whichever it might be , out of Corney 's !
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 14]: Again she fell upon her knees , and prayed God to enable her .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 22]: Corney was her brother , and must for ever be her brother , were he the worst thief under the sun !
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 20]: God would see to their honor or disgrace ; what she had to do was to be a sister !
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 43]: She rose determined that she would not go home till she had done all she could to find him ; that the judgment of God should henceforth alone be hers , and the judgment of the world nothing to her for evermore .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 43]: Presently the fact , which had at various times cast a dim presence up her horizon without thoroughly attracting her attention , became plain to her -- that she had in part been drawn towards her lover because of his social position .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 31]: Certainly without loving him , she would never have consented to marry him for that , but had she not come the more readily to love him because of that ?
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 15]: Had it not passed him within certain defences which would otherwise have held out ?
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 32]: Had he not been an earl in prospect , were there not some things in him which would have more repelled her , as not manifesting the highest order of humanity ?
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 19]: Would she , for instance , but for that , have tried so much to like his verses ?
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 10]: Clearly she must take her place with the sinners !
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXVI .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 6]: A TALK WITH THE MAJOR .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 11]: While she meditated thus , major Marvel made his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 35]: He had been watching outside , saw her uncle go , and an hour after was shown to the room where she still sat , staring out on the frosty trees of the square .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 24]: `` Why , my child , '' he said , with almost paternal tenderness , `` your hand is as cold as ice !
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 11]: Why do you sit so far from the fire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 10]: She rose and went to the fire with him .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 14]: He put her in an easy chair , and sat down beside her .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 31]: Common , pudgy , red-faced , bald-headed as he was , she come to him , and that out of regions of deepest thought , with a sense of refuge .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 60]: He could scarcely have understood one of her difficulties , would doubtless have judged not a few of her scruples nonsensical and over-driven ; yet knowing this it was a comfort to her to come from those regions back to a mere , honest , human heart -- to feel a human soul in a human body nigh her .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 22]: For the mere human is divine , though not _ the _ divine , and to the mere human essential comfort .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 35]: Should relations be broken between her and lord Gartley , she knew it would delight the major ; yet she was able to look upon him as a friend in whom she could trust .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 15]: Unity of _ opinion _ is not necessary to confident friendship and warm love .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 66]: As they talked , the major , seeing she was much depressed , and thinking to draw her from troubled thought , began to tell her some of the more personal parts of his history , and in these she soon became so interested that she began to ask him questions , and drew from him much that he would never have thought of volunteering .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 24]: Before their talk was over , she had come to regard the man as she could not have imagined it possible she should .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 47]: She had looked upon him as a man of so many and such redeeming qualities , that his faults must be over-looked and himself defended from any overweighing of them ; but now she felt him a man to be looked up to -- almost revered .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 65]: It was true that every now and then some remark would reveal in him a less than attractive commonness of thinking ; and that his notions in religion were of the crudest , for he regarded it as a set of doctrines -- not a few of them very dishonouring to God ; yet was the man in a high sense a true man .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 97]: There is nothing shows more how hard it has been for God to redeem the world than the opinions still uttered concerning him and his so-called _ plans _ by many who love him and try to obey him : a man may be in possession of the most precious jewels , and yet know so little about them that his description of them would never induce a jeweller to purchase them , but on the contrary make him regard the man as a fool , deceived with bits of coloured glass for rubies and sapphires .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 7]: Major Marvel was not of such .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 53]: He knew nothing of the slang of the Pharisees , knew little of the language of either the saints or the prophets , had , like most Christians , many worldly ways of looking at things , and yet I think our Lord would have said there was no guile in him .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 31]: With her new insight into the man 's character came to Hester the question whether she would not be justified in taking him into her confidence with regard to Cornelius .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 40]: She had received no injunctions to secrecy from her father : neither he nor her mother ever thought of such a thing with her ; they knew she was to be trusted as they were themselves to be trusted .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 31]: Her father had taken no step towards any effort for the rescue of his son , and she would sorely need help in what she must herself try to do .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 50]: She could say nothing to the major about lord Gartley , or the influence her brother 's behaviour might have on her future : that would not be fair either to Gartley or to the major ; but might she not ask him to help her to find Corney ?
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 37]: She was certain he would be prudent and keep quiet whatever ought to be kept quiet ; while on the other hand her father had spoken as if he would have nothing of it all concealed .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 13]: She told him the whole story , hiding nothing that she knew .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 18]: Hardly could she restrain her tears as she spoke , but she ended without having shed one .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 13]: The major had said nothing , betrayed nothing , only listened intently .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 27]: `` My dear Hester , '' he said solemnly , after a few moments ' pause , `` the mysteries of creation are beyond me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 9]: Hester thought the remark irrelevant , but waited .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 8]: `` It 's such a mixture ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 4]: he went on .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 15]: `` There is your mother , the loveliest woman except yourself God ever made !
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 8]: Then comes Cornelius -- a -- well !
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 5]: -- Then comes yourself !
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 5]: and then little Mark !
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 15]: a child -- I will not say too good to live -- God forbid !
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 14]: -- but too good for any of the common uses of this world !
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 25]: I declare to you I am terrified when left alone with him , and keep wishing for somebody to come into the room ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 8]: `` What about him terrifies you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 18]: asked Hester , amused at the idea , in spite of the gnawing unrest at her heart .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 17]: `` To answer you , '' replied the major , `` I must think a bit !
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 4]: Let me see !
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 4]: Let me see !
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 5]: it must be that !
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 47]: I am ashamed to confess it , but to a saint one must speak the truth : I believe in my heart it is simply fear lest I should find I must give up everything and do as I know he is thinking I ought . ''
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 7]: `` And what is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 8]: `` Turn a saint like him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 11]: `` And why should you be afraid of that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 53]: `` Well , you see , I 'm not the stuff that saints -- good saints , I mean , are made of ; and rather than not be a good one , if I once set about it , I would , saving your presence , be the devil himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 8]: Hester laughed , yet with some self-accusation .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 28]: `` I think , '' she said softly , `` one day you will be as good a saint as love can wish you to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 27]: `` Give me time ; give me time , I beg , '' cried the major , wiping his forehead , and evidently in some perturbation .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 45]: `` I would not willingly begin anything I should disgrace , for that would be to disgrace myself , and I never had any will to that , though the old ladies of our village used to say I was born without any shame .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 40]: But the main cause of my unpopularity was that I hated humbug -- and I do hate humbug , cousin Hester , and shall hate it till I die -- and so want to steer clear of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 21]: `` I hate it , I hope , as much as you do , major Marvel , '' responded Hester .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 37]: `` But , whatever it may be mixed up with , what is true , you know , can not be humbug , and what is not true can not be anything else than humbug . ''
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 5]: `` Yes , yes !
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 13]: but how is one to know what is true , my dear ?
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 11]: There are so many differing claims to the quality ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 37]: `` I have been told , and I believe it with all my heart , '' replied Hester , `` that the only way to know what is true is to do what is true . ''
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 19]: `` But you must know what is true before you can begin to do what is true . ''
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 24]: `` Everybody knows something that is true to do -- that is , something he ought to lose no time in setting about .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 18]: The true thing to any man is the thing that must not be let alone but done .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 18]: It is much easier to know what is true to do than what is true to think .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 21]: But those who do the one will come to know the other -- and none else , I believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 11]: The major was silent , and sat looking very thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 5]: At last he rose .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 18]: `` Is there anything you want me to do in this sad affair , cousin Hester ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 11]: `` I want your help to find my brother . ''
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 9]: `` Why should you want to find him ?
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 9]: You can not do him any good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 6]: `` Who can tell that ?
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 20]: If Christ came to seek and save his lost , we ought to seek and save our lost . ''
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 39]: `` Young men do n't go wrong for the mere sake of going wrong : you may find him in such a position as will make it impossible for you to have anything to do with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 9]: `` You know that line of Spenser 's .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 9]: -- Entire affection hateth nicer hands ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 3]: asked Hester .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 49]: `` No , I do n't know it ; and I do n't know that I understand it now you tell it me , '' replied the major , just a little crossly , for he did not like poetry ; it was one of his bugbear humbugs .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 23]: `` But one thing is plain : you must not expose yourself to what in such a search would be unavoidable . ''
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 24]: The care of men over some women would not seldom be ludicrous but for the sad suggested contrast of their carelessness over others .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 30]: `` Answer me one question , dear major Marvel , '' said Hester : `` Which is in most danger from disease -- the healthy or the sickly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 27]: `` That 's a question for the doctor , '' he answered cautiously ; `` and I do n't believe he knows anything about it either .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 16]: What it has to do with the matter in hand I can not think . ''
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 13]: Hester saw it was not for her now to pursue the argument .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 10]: And one would almost imagine it scarce needed pursuing !
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 23]: For who shall walk safe in the haunts of evil but those upon whom , being pure , evil has no hold ?
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 17]: The world 's notions of purity are simply childish -- because it is not itself pure .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 30]: You might well suppose its cherished ones on the brink of all corruption , so much afraid does it seem of having them tainted _ before their time _ .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 64]: Sorry would one be , but for the sake of those for whom Christ died , that any woman should be pained with the sight of evil , but the true woman may , even like God himself , know all evil and remain just as lovely , as clean , as angelic and worshipful as any child in the simplest country home .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 47]: The idea of a woman like Hester being _ in any sense _ defiled by knowing what her Lord knows while she fills up what is left behind of the sufferings of Christ for her to suffer for the sake of his world , is contemptible .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 33]: As wrong melts away and vanishes in the heart of Christ , so does the impurity she encounters vanish in the heart of the pure woman : it is there burned up .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 21]: `` I hardly see what is to be done , '' said the major , after a moment 's silence .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 34]: `` What do you say to an advertisement in _ The Times _ , to the effect that , if C. R. will return to his family , all will be forgiven ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 10]: `` That I must not , dare not do .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 16]: There is surely some other way of finding persons without going to the police ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 12]: `` What do you think your father would like done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 22]: `` I do not know ; but as I am Corney 's sister , I will venture as a sister may .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 24]: I think my father will be pleased in the end , but I will risk his displeasure for the sake of my brother .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 21]: If my father were to cast him off , would you say I was bound to cast him off ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 12]: `` I dare say nothing where you are sure , Hester .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 15]: My only anxiety would be whether you thoroughly knew what you were about . ''
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 39]: `` If one were able to look upon the question of life or death as a mere candle-flame in the sun of duty , would she not at least be more likely to do right than wrong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 23]: `` If the question were put about a soldier I should feel surer how to answer you , '' replied the major .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 35]: `` But you are so much better than I -- you go upon such different tactics , that we can hardly , I fear , bring our troops right in front of each other .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 24]: -- I will do what I can for you -- though I greatly fear your brother will never prove worth the trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 29]: `` People have repented who have gone as far wrong as Corney , '' said Hester , with the tears in her voice it not in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 4]: `` True ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 19]: responded the major ; `` but I do n't believe he has character enough to repent of anything .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 8]: He will be fertile enough in excuse !
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 15]: But I will do what I can to find out where he is . ''
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 11]: Hester heartily thanked him , and he took his leave .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 32]: Her very estrangement from him , the thought of her mother 's misery and the self-condemnation that must overtake her father if he did nothing , urged her to find Cornelius .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 12]: But if she found him , what would come of it ?
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 9]: Was he likely to go home with her ?
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 11]: How would he be received if he did go home ?
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 14]: and if not , what was she to do with or for him ?
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 10]: Was he to keep the money so vilely appropriated ?
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 11]: And what was he to do when it was spent ?
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 16]: If want would drive him home , the sooner he came to it the better !
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 25]: We pity the prodigal with his swine , but then first a ray of hope begins to break through the darkness of his fate .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 14]: To do nothing was nearly unendurable , and she saw nothing to do .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 17]: She could only wait , and it took all the patience and submission she could find .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 58]: She wrote to her father , told him what there was to tell , and ended her letter with a message to her mother : -- `` Tell darling mother , '' she said , `` that what a sister can do , up to the strength God gives her , shall be done for my brother .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 11]: Major Marvel is doing his best to find him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 37]: Next day she heard from her father that her mother was slowly recovering ; and on the following day that her letter was a great comfort to her ; but beyond this he made no remark .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 12]: Even his silence however was something of a relief to Hester .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 8]: In the meantime she was not idle .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 12]: Hers was not the nature even in grief to sit still .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 17]: The moment she had dispatched her letter , she set out to visit her poor friends .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 36]: On her way she went into Mrs. Baldwin 's shop and had a little talk with her , in the course of which she asked if she had ever heard anything more of the Frankses .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 29]: Mrs. Baldwin replied that she had once or twice heard of their being seen in the way of their profession ; but feared they were not getting on .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 15]: Hester was sorry , but had many more she knew better to think of .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 8]: There was much rejoicing at her return .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 23]: But there were changes -- new faces where she had left friends , and not the best news of some who remained .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 17]: One or two were in prison of whom when she left she was in great hope .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 32]: One or two were getting on better in the sense of this world , but she could see nothing in themselves to make her glad of their `` good luck . ''
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 24]: One who had signed the pledge some time before she went , had broken out fearfully , and all but killed his wife .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 20]: One of whom she had been hopeful , had disappeared -- it was supposed with another man 's wife .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 20]: In spite of their sufferings the evil one seemed as busy among them as among the world 's elect .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 31]: The little ones came about her again , but with less confidence , both because she had been away , and because they had grown more than they had improved .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 12]: But soon things were nearly on the old footing with them .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 7]: Every day she went among them .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 23]: Certain of the women -- chiefly those who had suffered most with least fault -- were as warmly her friends as before .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 60]: Amongst them was just one who had some experience of the Christian life , and she had begun to learn long before Hester came to know her : she did not seem , however , to have gained any influence even with those who lived in the same house ; only who can trace the slow working of leaven ?
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVII .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 2]: RENCONTRES .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 7]: There was no news of Cornelius .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 16]: In vain the detective to whom the major had made liberal promises continued his inquiries .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 26]: There was a rumour of a young woman in whose company he had lately been seen , but she too had disappeared from public sight .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 32]: Sarah did her best to make Hester comfortable , and behaved the better that she was humbled by the consciousness of having made a bad job of her caretaking with Cornelius .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 61]: One afternoon -- it had rained , but the sun was now shining , and Hester 's heart felt lighter as she took deep breaths of the clean-washed air -- she turned into a passage to visit the wife of a book-binder who had been long laid up with rheumatism so severe as to render him quite unable to work .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 32]: They had therefore been on the borders of want , and for Hester it was one of those happy cases in which she felt at full liberty to help with money .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 36]: The part of the house occupied by them was pretty decent , but the rest of it was in bad repair and occupied by yet poorer people , of none of whom she knew much .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 17]: It was in fact a little way beyond what she had come to count her limit .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 6]: She knocked at the door .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 8]: It was opened by the parish doctor .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 14]: `` You can not come in , Miss Raymount , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 11]: `` We have a very bad case of small-pox here .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 18]: You good ladies must make up your minds to keep away from these parts for a while .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 12]: Their bodies are in more danger than their souls now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 11]: `` That may very well be , '' replied Hester .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 26]: `` My foot may be in more danger than my head , but I can better afford to lose the one than the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 14]: The doctor did not see the point , and thought there was none .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 12]: `` You will only carry the infection , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 11]: `` I will take every precaution , '' answered Hester .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 20]: `` I always take more , I am certain , than it can be possible for you to take .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 14]: Why should not I also do my part to help them through ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 26]: `` While the parish is in my care , '' answered the doctor , `` I must object to whatever increases the risk of infection .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 36]: It is hard while we are doing all we can to stamp out the disease , to have you , with the best of motives I admit , carrying it from one house to another .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 22]: How are we to keep it out of the West End , if you ladies carry the seeds of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 8]: The hard-worked man spoke with some heat .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 18]: `` So the poor brothers are to be left for fear of hurting the rich ones ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 13]: `` That 's not fair -- you know it is not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 4]: said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 17]: `` We are set here to fight the disease , and fight it we must . ''
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 18]: `` And I am set here to fight something worse , '' returned Hester with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 9]: The doctor came out and shut the door .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 14]: `` I must beg of you to go away , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 21]: `` I shall be compelled to mention in my report how you and other ladies add to our difficulties . ''
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 9]: He slipped in again and closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 16]: Hester turned and went down the stair , now on her part a little angry .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 24]: She knew it was no use thinking when she was angry , for when the anger was gone she almost always thought otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 11]: The first thing was to get rid of the anger .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 25]: Instinctively she sat down and began to sing ; it was not the first time she had sat and sung in a dirty staircase .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 19]: It was not a wise thing to do , but her anger prevented her from seeing its impropriety .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 29]: In great cities the children are like flies , gathering swiftly as from out of the unseen : in a moment the stair below was half-filled with them .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 10]: The tenants above opened their doors and came down .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 17]: Others came in from the street and were pushed up by those who came behind them .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 46]: The stair and entrance were presently filled with people , all shabby , and almost all dirty -- men and women , young and old , good and bad , listening to the voice of the singing lady , as she was called in the .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 2]: neighborhood .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 21]: By this time the doctor had finished his visit at the bookbinder 's , and appeared on the stair above .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 31]: He had heard the singing , and thought it was in the street ; now he learnt it was actually in the house , and had filled it with people !
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 21]: It was no wonder , especially when he saw who the singer was , that he should lose his temper .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 22]: Through the few women and children above where Hester sat , he made his way towards the crowd of faces below .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 23]: When he reached her he seized her arm from behind and began to raise at once and push her down the stair .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 11]: He , too , was an enthusiast in his way .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 18]: Some of the faces below grew red with anger , and their eyes flamed at the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 28]: A loud murmur arose , and several began to force their way up to rescue her , as they would one of their own from the police .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 31]: But Hester , the moment she saw who it was that had laid hold of her , rose and began to descend the stair , closely followed by the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 44]: It was not easy ; and the annoyance of a good many in the crowd , some because Hester was their friend , others because the doctor had stopped the singing , gave a disorderly and indeed rather threatening look to the assemblage .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 34]: As she reached the door she saw , on the opposite side of the crowded passage , the pale face and glittering eyes of Mr. Blaney looking at her over the heads between .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 46]: The little man was mounted on a box at the door of a shop whose trade seemed to be in withered vegetables and salt fish , and had already had the pint which , according to his brother-in-law , was more than he could stand .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 27]: `` Sarves you right , miss , '' he cried , when he saw who was the centre of the commotion ; `` sarves you right !
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 35]: You turned me out o ' your house for singin ' , an ' I do n't see why you should come a singin ' an ' a misbehavin ' of yourself in ourn !
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 22]: Jest you bring her out here , pleeceman , an ' let me give her a bit o ' my mind .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 14]: Oh , do n't you be afeared , I wo n't hurt her !
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 16]: Not in all my life did I ever once hurt a woman -- bless 'em !
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 20]: But it 's time the gentry swells knowed as how we 're yuman bein 's as well as theirselves .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 32]: We do n't like , no more 'n they would theirselves , havin ' our feelin 's hurt for the sake o ' what they calls bein ' done good to .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 10]: Come you along down over here , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 39]: The crowd had been gathering from both ends of the passage , for high words draw yet faster than sweet singing , and the place was so full that it was hardly possible to get out of it .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 19]: The doctor was almost wishing he had let ill alone , for he was now anxious about Hester .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 8]: Some of the rougher ones began pushing .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 17]: The vindictive little man kept bawling , his mouth screwed into the middle of his cheek .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 29]: From one of the cross entrances of the passage came the pulse of a fresh tide of would-be spectators , causing the crowd to sway hither and thither .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 22]: All at once Hester spied a face she knew , considerably changed as it was since last she had seen it .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 8]: `` Now we shall have help ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 16]: she said to her companion , making common cause with him notwithstanding his antagonism . ''
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 5]: -- Mr. Franks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 15]: The athlete was not so far off that she needed to call very loud .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 8]: He heard and started with eager interest .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 17]: He knew the voice , sent his eyes looking and presently found her who called him .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 23]: With his great lean muscular arms he sent the crowd right and left like water , and reached her in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 3]: `` Come !
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 2]: come !
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 7]: do n't you hurt her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 10]: shouted Mr. Blaney from the top of his box .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 8]: `` She ai n't nothing to you .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 23]: She 's a old friend o ' mine , an ' I ai n't a goin ' to see her hurt . ''
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 6]: `` You shut up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 16]: bawled Franks , `` or I 'll finish the pancake you was meant for . ''
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 50]: Then turning to Hester , who had begun to be a little afraid he too had been drinking , he pulled off his fur cap , and making the lowest and politest of stage bows , said briefly , `` Miss Raymount -- at your service , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 17]: `` I am very glad to see you again , Mr. Franks , '' said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 14]: `` Do you think you could get us out of the crowd ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 5]: `` Easy , miss .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 22]: I 'll _ carry _ you out of it like a baby , miss , if you 'll let me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 19]: `` No , no ; that will hardly be necessary , '' returned Hester , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 27]: `` Go on before , and make a way for us , '' said the doctor , with an authority he had no right to assume .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 20]: `` There is not the least occasion for you to trouble yourself about me farther , '' said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 9]: `` I am perfectly safe with this man .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 6]: I know him very well .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 9]: I am sorry to have vexed you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 44]: Franks looked up sharply at the doctor , as if to see whether he dared acknowledge a claim to the apology ; then turning to Hester , -- `` Nobody ` ai n't ha ' been finding fault with you , miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 7]: he said -- a little ominously .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 11]: `` Not more than I deserved , '' replied Hester .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 6]: `` But come , Franks !
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 16]: lead the way , or all Bloomsbury will be here , and then the police !
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 14]: I should n't like to be shut up for offending Mr. Blaney ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 7]: Those near them heard and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 6]: She took Franks 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 26]: Room was speedily made before them , and in a minute they were out of the crowd , and in one of the main thoroughfares .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 41]: But as if everybody she knew was going to appear , who should meet them face to face as they turned into Steevens 's Road , with a fringe of the crowd still at their heels , but lord Gartley !
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 38]: He had written from town , and Mrs. Raymount had let him know that Hester was in London , for she saw that the sooner she had an opportunity of telling him what had happened the better .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 26]: His lordship went at once to Addison square , and had just left the house disappointed when he met Hester leaning on Franks 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 5]: `` Miss Raymount ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 5]: he exclaimed almost haughtily .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 5]: `` My lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 21]: she returned , with unmistakable haughtiness , drawing herself up , and looking him in the face , hers glowing .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 11]: `` Who would have expected to see you here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 8]: `` Apparently yourself , my lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 5]: He tried to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 14]: `` Come then ; I will see you home , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 7]: `` Thank you , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 5]: Come , Franks . ''
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 12]: As she spoke she looked round , but Franks was gone .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 35]: Finding she had met one of her own family , as he supposed , he had quietly withdrawn : the moment he was no longer wanted , he grew ashamed , and felt shabby .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 36]: But he lingered round a corner near , to be certain she was going to be taken care of , till seeing them walk away together he was satisfied , and went with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXVIII .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 4]: IN THE HOUSE .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 13]: The two were silent on their way , but from different causes .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 34]: Lord Gartley was uneasy at finding Hester in such a position -- led into it by her unreflecting sympathies , no doubt , so unbefitting the present century of the world 's history !
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 37]: He had gathered from the looks and words of the following remnants of the crowd that she had been involved in some street-quarrel -- trying to atone it no doubt , or to separate the combatants .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 16]: For a woman of her refinement , she had the strangest proclivity for low company !
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 13]: Hester was silent , thinking how to begin her communication about Cornelius .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 63]: Uncomfortable from the contretemps , as well as from what she had now to do , and irritated at the tone in which his lordship had expressed the surprise he could not help feeling at sight of her so accompanied and attended , she had felt for a moment as if the best thing would be to break with him at once .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 20]: But she was too just , had she not had too much regard for him , to do so .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 23]: She felt , however , for that one moment very plainly , that the relation between them was far from the ideal .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 43]: Another thing was yet clearer : if he could feel such surprise and annoyance at the circumstances in which he had just met her , it would be well to come to a clearer understanding at once concerning her life-ideal and projects .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 42]: But she would make up her mind to nothing till she saw how he was going to carry himself now his surprise had had time to pass off : perhaps it would not be necessary to tell him anything about Corney !
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 7]: they might part upon other grounds !
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 32]: In the one case it would be she , in the other it would be he that broke off the engagement : she would rather it were his doing than hers !
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 37]: No doubt she would stand better in the eyes of the world if she dismissed him ; but that was an aspect of the affair she would never have deigned to heed had it presented itself .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 51]: These thoughts , with what of ratiocination was in them , hardly passed through her mind ; it was filled , rather , with a confused mass of tangled thought and feeling , which tossed about in it like the nets of a fishing fleet rolled together by a storm .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 26]: Not before they reached the house did lord Gartley speak , and Hester began to wonder if he might not already have heard of Cornelius .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 22]: It was plain he was troubled ; plain too he was only waiting for the coverture of the house to speak .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 17]: It should be easy , oh , very easy for him to get rid of her .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 8]: He need not be anxious about that !
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 50]: It was doubtless shock upon shock to the sensitive nature of his lordship to find , when they reached the house , that , instead of ringing the bell , she took a latch-key from her pocket , opened the door herself , and herself closed it behind them .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 11]: It was just as a bachelor might enter his chambers !
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 42]: It did not occur to him that it was just such as his bachelor that ought not to have the key , and such as Hester that ought to have it , to let them come and go as the angels .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 8]: She led the way up the stair .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 11]: Not a movement of life was audible in the house !
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 5]: The stillness was painful .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 10]: `` Did no one come up with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 19]: `` No one but major Marvel , '' she answered , and opened the door of the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 58]: As she opened it , she woke to the consciousness that she was very cross , and in a mood to make her unfair to Gartley : the moment she had closed it , she turned to him and said , `` Forgive me , Gartley ; I am in trouble ; we are all in trouble .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 16]: When I have told you about it , I shall be more at ease . ''
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 61]: Without preamble , or any attempt to influence the impression of the dreadful news , she began her story , softening the communication only by making it as the knowledge had come to her -- telling first her mother 's distress at Sarah 's letter , then the contents of that letter , and then those of her uncle 's .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 22]: She could not have done it with greater fairness to her friend : his practised self-control had opportunity for perfect operation .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 16]: But the result was more to her satisfaction than she could have dared to hope .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 18]: He held out his hand with a smile , and said , `` I am very sorry .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 8]: What is there I can do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 7]: She looked up in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 8]: They were looking down kindly and lovingly .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 33]: `` Then -- then -- , '' she said , `` you do n't -- I mean there 's no -- I mean , you do n't feel differently towards me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 8]: `` Towards you , my angel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 9]: exclaimed Gartley , and held out his arms .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 11]: She threw herself into them , and clung to him .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 17]: It was the first time either of them had shown anything approaching to _ abandon _ .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 14]: Gartley 's heart swelled with delight , translating her confidence into his power .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 23]: He was no longer the second person in the compact , but had taken the place belonging to the male contracting party !
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 16]: For he had been painfully conscious now and then that he played but second fiddle .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 10]: They sat down and talked the whole thing over .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 19]: Now that Hester was at peace she began to look at it from Gartley 's point of view .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 9]: `` I am so sorry for you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 16]: `` It is very sad you should have to marry into a family so disgraced .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 9]: What _ will _ your aunt say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 19]: `` My aunt will treat the affair like the sensible woman she is , '' replied the earl .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 16]: `` But there is no fear of disgrace ; the thing will never be known .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 20]: Besides , where is the family that has n't one or more such loose fishes about in its pond ?
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 16]: The fault was committed inside the family too , and that makes a great difference .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 17]: It is not as if he 'd been betting , and could n't pay up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 10]: From the heaven of her delight Hester fell prone .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 12]: Was this the way her almost husband looked at these things ?
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 5]: But , poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 9]: how could he help looking at them so ?
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 16]: Was it not thus he had been from earliest childhood taught to look at them ?
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 13]: The greater was his need of all she could do for him !
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 8]: He was so easy to teach anything !
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 21]: What she saw clear as day it could not be hard to communicate to one who loved as he loved !
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 17]: She would say nothing now -- would let him see no sign of disappointment in her !
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 22]: `` If he do n't improve , '' continued his lordship , `` we must get him out of the country .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 16]: In the meantime he will go home , and not a suspicion will be roused .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 15]: What else should he do , with such a property to look after ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 13]: `` My father will not see it so , '' answered Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 12]: `` I doubt if he will ever speak to him again .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 11]: Certainly he will not except he show some repentance . ''
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 11]: `` Has your father refused to have him home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 8]: `` He has not had the chance .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 9]: Nobody knows what has become of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 38]: `` He 'll have to condone , or compromise , or compound , or what do they call it , for the sake of his family -- for your sake , and my sake , my darling !
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 12]: He ca n't be so vindictive as expose his own son !
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 8]: We wo n't think more about it !
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 7]: Let us talk of ourselves ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 9]: `` If only we could find him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 3]: returned Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 15]: `` Depend upon it he is not where you would like to find him .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 9]: Men do n't come to grief without help !
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 9]: We must wait till he turns up . ''
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 40]: Far as this was from her purpose , Hester was not inclined to argue the point : she could not expect him or any one out of their own family to be much interested in the fate of Cornelius .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 39]: They began to talk about other things ; and if they were not the things Hester would most readily have talked about , neither were they the things lord Gartley had entered the house intending to talk about .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 17]: He too had been almost angry , only by nature he was cool and even good-tempered .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 66]: To find Hester , the moment she came back to London , and now in the near prospect of marriage with himself , yielding afresh to a diseased fancy of doing good ; to come upon her in the street of a low neighbourhood , followed by a low crowd , supported and championed by a low fellow -- well , it was not agreeable !
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 69]: His high breeding made him mind it less than a middle-class man of like character would have done ; but with his cold dislike to all that was poor and miserable , he could not fail to find it annoying , and had entered the house intending to exact a promise for the future -- not the future after marriage , for a change then went without saying .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 47]: But when he had heard her trouble , and saw how deeply it affected her , he knew this was not the time to say what he had meant ; and there was the less occasion now that he was near to take care of her !
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 30]: He had risen to go , and was about to take a loving farewell , when Hester , suddenly remembering , drew back , with almost a guilty look .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 6]: `` Oh , Gartley ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 15]: she said , `` I thought not to have let you come near me !
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 10]: Not that _ I _ am afraid of anything !
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 8]: But you came upon me so unexpectedly !
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 22]: It is all very well for one 's self , but one ought to heed what other people may think ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 11]: `` What _ can _ you mean , Hester ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 19]: exclaimed Gartley , and would have laid his hand on her arm , but again she drew back .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 20]: `` There was small-pox in the house I had just left when you met me , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 32]: He started back and stood speechless -- manifesting therein no more cowardice than everyone in his circle would have justified : was it not reasonable and right he should be afraid ?
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 15]: was it not a humiliation to be created subject to such a loathsome disease ?
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 23]: The disgrace of fearing anything except doing wrong , few human beings are capable of conceiving , fewer still of actually believing .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 20]: `` Has it never occurred to you what you are doing in going to such places , Hester ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 3]: he faltered .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 10]: `` It is a treachery against every social claim .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 27]: I am sorry to use such hard words , but -- really -- I -- I -- can not help being a little surprised at you !
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 11]: I thought you had more -- more -- sense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 10]: `` I am sorry to have frightened you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 4]: `` Frightened ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 27]: repeated Gartley , with an attempt at a smile , which closed in a yet more anxious look , '' -- you do indeed frighten me !
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 14]: The whole world would agree you give me good cause to be frightened .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 17]: I should never have thought _ you _ capable of showing such a lack of principle .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 17]: Do n't imagine I am thinking of myself ; _ you _ are in most danger !
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 13]: Still , you may carry the infection without taking it yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 28]: `` I did n't know it was there when I went to the house -- only I should have gone all the same , '' said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 26]: `` But if seeing you so suddenly had not made me forget , I should have had a bath as soon as I got home .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 13]: I _ am _ sorry I let you come near me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 40]: `` One has no right either to take or carry infection , '' insisted lord Gartley , perhaps a little glad of the height upon which an opportunity of finding fault set him for the first time above her .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 12]: `` But there is no time to talk about it now .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 10]: I hope you will use what preventives you can .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 11]: It is very wrong to trifle with such things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 6]: `` Indeed it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 14]: answered Hester ; `` and I say again I am sorry I forgot .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 10]: You see how it was -- do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 8]: It was you made me forget ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 13]: But his lordship was by no means now in a smiling mood .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 33]: He bade her a somewhat severe good night , then hesitated , and thinking it hardly signified now , and he must not look too much afraid , held out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 47]: But Hester drew back a third time , saying , `` No , no ; you must not , '' and with solemn bow he turned and went , his mind full of conflicting feelings and perplexing thoughts : -- What a glorious creature she was !
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 6]: -- and what a dangerous !
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 27]: He recalled the story of the young woman brought up on poisons , whom no man could come near but at the risk of his life .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 6]: What a spirit she had !
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 9]: but what a pity it was so ill-directed !
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 18]: It was horrible to think of her going into such abominable places -- and all alone too !
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 7]: How ill she had been trained !
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 14]: -- in such utter disregard of social obligation and the laws of nature !
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 4]: It was preposterous !
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 17]: He little thought what risks he ran when he fell in love with _ her _ !
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 13]: If he got off now without an attack he would be lucky !
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 5]: But -- good heavens !
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 8]: if she were to take it herself !
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 10]: `` I wonder when she was last vaccinated ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 13]: `` I was last year ; I daresay I 'm all right !
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 17]: But if she were to die , or lose her complexion , I should kill myself !
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 6]: I know I should ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 13]: Would honor compel him to marry her if she were horribly pock-marked ?
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 8]: Those dens ought to be rooted out !
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 5]: Philanthropy was gone mad !
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 8]: It was strict repression that was wanted !
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 12]: To sympathize with people like that was only to encourage them !
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 16]: Vice was like hysterics -- the more kindness you showed the worse grew the patient !
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 8]: They took it all as their right !
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 21]: And the more you gave , the more they demanded -- never showing any gratitude so far as he knew !
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIX .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 6]: THE MAJOR AND THE SMALL-POX .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 10]: His lordship was scarcely gone when the major came .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 43]: So closely did the appearance of the one follow on the disappearance of the other , that there was ground for suspecting the major had seen his lordship enter the house , and had been waiting and watching till he was gone .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 33]: But she was not yet to be seen : she had no fear of the worst small-pox could do to her , yet was taking what measures appeared advisable for her protection .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 18]: Her fearlessness came from no fancied absence of danger , but from an utter disbelief in chance .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 38]: The same and only faith that would have enabled him to face the man-eating tiger , enabled her to face the small-pox ; if she did die by going into such places , it was all right .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 45]: For aught I know there may be a region whose dwellers are so little capable of being individually cared for , that they are left to the action of mere general laws as sufficient for what for the time can be done for them .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 26]: Such may well to themselves seem to be blown about by all the winds of chaos and the limbo -- which winds they call chance ?
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 32]: Even then and there it is God who has ordered all the generals of their condition , and when they are sick of it , will help them out of it .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 17]: One thing is sure -- that God is doing his best for _ every _ man .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 7]: The major sat down and waited .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 10]: `` I am at my wits ' end ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 9]: he said , when she entered the room .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 8]: `` I ca n't find the fellow !
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 6]: That detective 's a muff !
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 10]: He ai n't got a trace of him yet !
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 6]: I must put on another !
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 11]: -- Do n't you think you had better go home ?
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 14]: I will do what can be done , you may be sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 11]: `` I _ am _ sure , '' answered Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 31]: `` But mamma is better ; so long as I am away papa will not leave her ; and she would rather have papa than a dozen of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 16]: `` But it must be so dreary for you -- here alone all day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 9]: he said , with a touch of malice .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 12]: `` I go about among my people , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 3]: ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 3]: he returned .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 25]: `` Then I hope you will be careful what houses you go into , for I hear the small-pox is in the neighborhood . ''
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 17]: `` I have just come from a house where it is now , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 7]: The major rose in haste . ''
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 23]: -- But , '' she went on , `` I have changed all my clothes , and had a bath since . ''
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 6]: The major sat down again .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 7]: `` My dear young lady ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 22]: he said , the roses a little ashy on his cheek-bones , `` do you know what you are about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 16]: `` I hope I do -- I _ think _ I do '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 3]: `` Hope !
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 3]: Think ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 5]: repeated the major indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 11]: `` Well , _ believe _ , '' said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 6]: `` Come , come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 33]: he rejoined with rudeness , `` you may hope or think or believe what you like , but you have no business to act but on what you _ know _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 13]: `` I suppose you never act where you do not know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 3]: returned Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 28]: `` You always _ know _ you will win the battle , kill the tiger , take the small-pox , and be the worse for it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 12]: `` It 's all very well for you to laugh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 18]: returned the major ; `` but what is to become of us if you take the small-pox !
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 17]: Why , my dear cousin , you might lose every scrap of your good looks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 14]: `` And then who on earth would care for me any more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 22]: said Hester , with mock mournfulness , which brought a glimmer of the merry light back to the major 's face .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 16]: `` But really , Hester , '' he persisted , `` this is most imprudent .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 14]: It is your life , not your beauty only you are periling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 7]: `` Perhaps , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 9]: `` And the lives of us all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 4]: added the major .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 11]: `` Is the small-pox worse than a man-eating tiger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 9]: `` Ten times worse , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 15]: `` You can fight the tiger , but you ca n't fight the small-pox .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 13]: You really ought _ not _ to run such fearful risks . ''
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 8]: `` How are they to be avoided ?
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 12]: Every time you send for the doctor you run a risk !
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 11]: You ca n't order a clean doctor every time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 8]: `` A joke 's all very well !
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 12]: but it is our duty to take care of ourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 10]: `` In reason , yes , '' replied Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 70]: `` You may think , '' said the major , `` that God takes special care of you because you are about his business -- and far be it from me to say you are not about his business or that he does not take care of you ; but what is to become of me and the like of me if we take the small-pox from you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 56]: Hester had it on her lips to say that if he was meant to die of the small-pox , he might as well take it of her as of another ; but she said instead that she was sure God took care of her , but not sure she should not die of the small-pox .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 20]: `` How can you say God takes care of you if he lets you die of the small-pox ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 23]: `` No doubt people would die if God forgot them , but do you think people die because God forgets them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 24]: `` My dear cousin Hester , if there is one thing I have a _ penchant _ for , it is common sense !
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 10]: A paradox I detest with my whole soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 16]: `` One word , dear major Marvel : Did God take care of Jesus ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 4]: `` Of course !
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 3]: of course !
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 12]: But he was n't like other men , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 28]: `` I do n't want to fare better , that is , I do n't want to have more of God 's care than he had . ''
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 7]: `` I do n't understand you .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 38]: I should think if we were sure God took as good care of us as of him -- '' But there he stopped , for he began to have a glimmer of where she was leading him .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 11]: `` Did he keep him what you call safe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 3]: said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 14]: `` Did he not allow the worst man could do to overtake him ?
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 11]: Was it not the very consequence of his obedience ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 14]: `` Then you have made up your mind to die of the small-pox ?
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 19]: -- In that case -- '' `` Only if it be God 's will , '' interrupted Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 15]: `` To that , and that alone , have I made up my mind .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 42]: If I die of the small-pox , it will not be because it could not be helped , or because I caught it by chance ; it will be because God allowed it as best for me and for us all .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 69]: It will not be a punishment for breaking his laws : he loves none better , I believe , than those who break the laws of nature to fulfil the laws of the spirit -- which is the deeper nature , ` the nature naturing nature , ' as I read the other day : of course it sounds nonsense to anyone who does not understand it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 12]: `` That 's your humble servant , '' said the major .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 39]: `` I have n't a notion what you or the author you quote means , though I do n't doubt both of you mean well , and that you are a most courageous and indeed heroic young woman .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 32]: For all that it is time your friends interfered ; and I am going to write by the next post to let your father know how you are misbehaving yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 18]: `` They will not believe me quite so bad as I fear you will represent me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 6]: I must write anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 13]: `` That they may order me home to give them the small-pox ?
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 17]: Would n't it be better to wait and be sure I had not taken it already ?
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 10]: Your letter , too , might carry the infection .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 9]: I think you had better not write . ''
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 9]: `` You persist in making fun of it !
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 21]: I say again it is not a thing to be joked about , '' remarked the major , looking red .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 25]: `` I think , '' returned Hester , `` whoever lives in terror of infection had better take it and have done with it .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 14]: I know I would rather die than live in the fear of death .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 7]: It is the meanest of slaveries .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 23]: At least , to live a slave to one 's fears is next worst to living a slave to one 's likings .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 90]: Do as you please , major Marvel , but I give you warning that if you interpose -- I will not say _ interfere _ -- because you do it all for kindness -- but if you interpose , I will never ask you to help me again ; I will never let you know what I am doing , or come to you for advice , lest , instead of assisting me , you should set about preventing me from doing what I may have to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 24]: She held out her hand to him , adding with a smile : `` Is it for good-bye , or a compact ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 22]: `` But just look at it from my point of view , '' said the major , disturbed by the appeal .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 15]: `` What will your father say if he finds me aiding and abetting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 26]: `` You did not come up at my father 's request , or from the least desire on his part to have me looked after .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 24]: You were not put in charge of me , and have no right to suppose me doing anything my parents would not like .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 14]: They never objected to my going among my friends as I thought fit .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 18]: Possibly they had more faith in my good sense , knowing me better than major Marvel . ''
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 42]: `` But when one sees you doing the thing that is plainly wrong -- '' `` If it be so plainly wrong , how is it that I who am really anxious to do right , should not see it wrong ?
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 19]: Why should you think me less likely to know what is right than you , major Marvel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 19]: `` I give in , '' said the major , `` and will abide by the consequences . ''
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 11]: `` But you shall not needlessly put yourself in danger .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 12]: You must not come to me except I send for you .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 12]: If you hear anything of Corney , write , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 26]: `` You do n't imagine , '' cried the major , firing up , `` that I am going to turn tail where you advance ?
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 14]: I 'm not going to run from the small-pox any more than you .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 20]: So long as he do n't get on my back to hunt other people , I do n't care .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 3]: By George !
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 12]: you women have more courage ten times than we men ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 18]: `` What we 've got to do we just go and do , without thinking about danger .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 23]: I believe it is often the best wisdom to be blind and let God be our eyes as well as our shield .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 30]: But would it be right of you , not called to the work , to put yourself in danger because you would not be out where I am in ?
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 28]: I could admire of course , but never quite justify sir Philip Sidney in putting off his cuisses because his general had not got his on . ''
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 12]: `` You 're fit for a field-marshal , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 33]: said the major enthusiastically -- adding , as he kissed her hand , `` I will think over what you have said , and at least not betray you without warning . ''
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 18]: `` That is enough for the present , '' returned Hester , shaking hands with him warmly .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 22]: The major went away hardly knowing whither , so filled was he with admiration of `` cousin Helen 's girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 5]: `` By Jove ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 31]: he said to himself , `` it 's a confounded good thing I did n't marry Helen ; she would never have had a girl like that if I had !
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 5]: Things are always best .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 40]: The world needs a few such in it -- even if they be fools -- though I suspect they will turn out the wise ones , and we the fools for taking such care of our precious selves ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 11]: But the major was by no means a selfish man .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 12]: He was pretty much mixed , like the rest of us .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 32]: Only , if we do not make up our minds not to be mixed with the one thing , we shall by and by be but little mixed with the other .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 24]: That same evening he sent her word that one answering the description of Cornelius had been descried in the neighborhood of Addison square .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 3]: CHAPTER XL .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 4]: DOWN AND DOWN .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 6]: Down the hill and down !
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 36]: -- to the shores of the salt sea , where the flowing life is dammed into a stagnant lake , a dead sea , growing more and more bitter with separation and lack of outlet .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 24]: Mrs. Franks had come to feel the comforting of her husband a hopeless thing , and had all but ceased to attempt it .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 42]: He grew more hopeless for the lack of what she thought moved him no more , and when she ceased to comfort him , the fountain of her own hope began to fail ; in comforting him she had comforted herself .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 51]: The boys , whose merriment even was always of a sombre kind , got more gloomy , but had not begun to quarrel ; for that evil , as interfering with their profession , the father had so sternly crushed that they had less than the usual tendency to it .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 16]: They had reached at last the point of being unable to pay for their lodging .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 9]: They were indeed a fort-night 's rent behind .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 22]: Their landlady was not willing to be hard upon them , but what could a poor woman do , she said .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 45]: The day was come when they must go forth like Abraham without a home , but not like Abraham with a tent and the world before them to set it up in , not like Abraham with camels and asses to help them along .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 24]: The weakly wife had to carry the sickly baby , who , with many ups and downs , had been slowly pining away .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 36]: The father went laden with the larger portion of the goods yet remaining to them , and led the Serpent of the Prairies , with the drum hanging from his neck , by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 16]: The other boys followed , bearing the small stock of implements belonging to their art .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 55]: They had delayed their departure till it was more than dusk , for Franks could not help a vague feeling of blame for the condition of his family , and shrank from being seen of men 's eyes ; every one they met must know they had not a place to lay their heads !
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 42]: The world was like a sea before them -- a prospect of ceaseless motion through the night , with the hope of an occasional rest on a doorstep or the edge of the curb-stone when the policeman 's back was turned .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 13]: They set out to go nowhither -- to tramp on and on .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 45]: Is it any wonder -- does it imply wickedness beyond that lack of trust in God which is at the root of all wickedness , if the thought of ending their troubles by death crossed his mind , and from very tenderness kept returning ?
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 35]: At the last gasp , as it seemed , in the close and ever closer siege of misfortune , he was almost ready , like the Jews of Masada , to conquer by self-destruction .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 32]: But ever and again the sad eyes of his wife turned him from the thought , and he would plod on , thinking , as near as possible , about nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 20]: At length as they wandered they came to a part where seemed to be only small houses and mews .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 30]: Presently they found themselves in a little lane with no thoroughfare , at the back of some stables , and had to return along the rough-paved , neglected way .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 36]: Such was the quiet and apparent seclusion of the spot , that it struck Franks they had better find its most sheltered corner , in which to sit down and rest awhile , possibly sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 13]: Scarcely would policeman , he thought , enter such a forsaken place !
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 19]: The same moment they heard the measured tread of the enemy on the other side of the stables .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 45]: Instinctively , hurriedly , they looked around for some place of concealment , and spied , at the end of a blank wall , belonging apparently to some kind of warehouse , a narrow path between that and the wall of the next property .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 22]: Careless to what it led , anxious only to escape the annoyance of the policeman , they turned quickly into it .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 31]: Scarcely had they done so when the Serpent , whose hand his father had let go , disappeared with a little cry , and a whimper ascended through the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 9]: `` Hold your n'ise , you rascal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 26]: said his father sharply , but under his breath ; `` the bobby will hear you , and have us all to the lock-up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 7]: Not a sound more was heard .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 6]: Neither did the boy reappear .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 7]: `` Good heavens , John ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 17]: cried the mother in an agonized whisper , `` the child has fallen down a sewer !
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 5]: Oh , my God !
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 7]: he is gone for ever ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 23]: `` Hold your n'ise , '' said Franks again , `` an ' let 's all go down a ` ter him !
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 24]: It 's better down anywheres than up where there ai n't nothing to eat an ' nowheres to lie down in . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 21]: ` Tai n't a bad place , '' cried a little voice in a whisper broken with repressed sobs . ''
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 34]: ` Tai n't a bad place , I do n't think , only I broken one o ' my two legs ; it wo n't move to fetch of me up again . ''
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 12]: `` Thank God in heaven , the child 's alive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 5]: cried the mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 13]: -- You ai n't much hurt , are you , Moxy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 6]: `` Rather , mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 33]: By this time the steps of the policeman , to which the father had been listening with more anxiety than to the words of wife or child , were almost beyond hearing .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 23]: Franks turned , and going down a few steps found his child , where he half lay , half sat upon them .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 14]: But when he lifted him , he gave a low cry of pain .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 13]: It was impossible to see where or how much he was hurt .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 11]: The father sat down and took him on his knees .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 21]: `` You 'd better come an ' sit here , wife , '' he said in a low dull voice .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 13]: `` There ai n't no one a sittin ' up for us .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 24]: The b ` y 's a bit hurt , an ' here you 'll be out o ' the wind at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 28]: They all got as far down the stair as its room would permit -- the elder boys with their heads hardly below the level of the wind .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 32]: But by and by one of them crept down past his mother , feebly soothing the whimpering baby , and began to feel what sort of a place they were in .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 9]: `` Here 's a door , father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 9]: `` Well , what o ' that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 5]: returned his father . ''
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 13]: ` Taint no door open to us or the likes on us .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 20]: There ai n't no open door for the likes of us but the door o ' the grave . ''
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 12]: `` Perhaps this is it , father , '' said Moxy .
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 25]: `` If it be , '' answered his father with bitterness , `` we 'll find it open , I 'll be bound . ''
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 17]: The boy 's hand had come upon a latch ; he lifted it , and pushed .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 18]: `` Father , '' he cried with a gasp , '' _ it is open _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 19]: `` Get in then , '' said his father roughly , giving him a push with his foot .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 5]: `` I dare n't .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 6]: It 's so dark ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 3]: he answered .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 35]: `` Here , you come an ' take the Sarpint , '' returned the father , with faintly reviving hope , `` an ' I 'll see what sort of a place it is .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 27]: If it 's any place at all , it 's better than bein ' i ' the air all night at this freezin ' time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 23]: So saying he gave Moxy to his bigger brother and went to learn what kind of a place they had got to .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 22]: Ready as he had been a moment before for the grave , he was careful in stepping into the unknown dark .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 10]: Feeling with foot and hand , he went in .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 25]: He trod upon an earthen floor , and the place had a musty smell : it might be a church vault , he thought .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 65]: In and in he went , with sliding foot on the soundless floor , and sliding hand along the cold wall -- on and on , round two corners , past a closed door , and back to that by which he had entered , where , as at the grave 's mouth , sat his family in sad silence , waiting his return .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 23]: `` Wife , '' he said , `` we ca n't do better than to take the only thing that 's offered .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 15]: The floor 's firm , an ' it 's out o ' the air .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 20]: It 's some sort of a cellar -- p ` r ` aps at the bottom of a church .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 13]: It do look as if it wur left open jest for us !
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 16]: -- You _ used _ to talk about _ him _ above , wife ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 40]: He took her by the hand and led the way into the darkness , the boys following , one of them with a hold of his mother , and his arm round the other , who was carrying Moxy .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 14]: Franks closed the door behind them , and they had gained a refuge .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 57]: Feeling about , one of the boys came upon a large packing-case ; having laid it down against the inner wall , Franks sat , and made his wife lie upon it , with her head on his knees , and took Moxy again in his arms , wrapt in one of their three thin blankets .
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 14]: The boys stretched themselves on the ground , and were soon fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 10]: The baby moaned by fits all the night long .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 33]: In about an hour Franks , who for long did not sleep , heard the door open softly and stealthily , and seemed aware of a presence besides themselves in the place .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 41]: He concluded some other poor creature had discovered the same shelter ; or , if they had got into a church-vault , it might be some wandering ghost ; he was too weary for further speculation , or any uneasiness .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 19]: When the slow light crept through the chinks of the door , he found they were quite alone .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 14]: It was a large dry cellar , empty save for the old packing-case .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 19]: They must use great caution , and do their best to keep their hold of this last retreat !
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 16]: Misfortune had driven them into the earth ; it would be fortune to stay there .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 14]: When his wife woke , he told her what he had been thinking .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 17]: He and the boys would creep out before it was light , and return after dark .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 14]: She must not put even a finger out of the cellar-door all day .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 19]: He laid Moxy down beside her , woke the two elder boys , and went out with them .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 12]: They were so careful that for many days they continued undiscovered .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 31]: Franks and the boys went and returned , and gained bread enough to keep them alive , but it may well seem a wonder they did not perish with cold .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 26]: It is amazing what even the delicate sometimes go through without more than a little hastening on the road the healthiest are going as well .
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLI .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 2]: DIFFERENCE .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 10]: About noon the next day , lord Gartley called .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 34]: Whether he had got over his fright , or thought the danger now less imminent , or was vexed that he had _ appeared _ to be afraid , I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 9]: Hester was very glad to see him again .
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 14]: `` I think I am a safe companion to-day , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 11]: `` I have not been out of the house yet .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 24]: But till the bad time is over among my people , we had better be content not to meet , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 5]: Lord Gartley mentally gasped .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 18]: He stood for a moment speechless , gathering his thoughts , which almost refused to be gathered .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 9]: `` Do I understand you , Hester ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 16]: `` It would trouble me more than I can tell to find I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 10]: `` I fear I understand you , Gartley ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 3]: said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 25]: `` Is it possible you would have me abandon my friends to the small-pox , as a hireling his sheep to the wolf ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 14]: `` There are those whose business it is to look after them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 11]: `` I am one of those , '' returned Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 37]: `` Well , '' answered his lordship , `` for the sake of argument we will allow it _ has _ been your business ; but how can you imagine it your business any longer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 38]: Indignation , a fire always ready `` laid '' in Hester 's bosom , but seldom yet lighted by lord Gartley , burst into flame , and she spoke as he had never heard her speak before .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 38]: `` I am aware , my lord , '' she said , `` that I must by and by have new duties to perform , but I have yet to learn that they must annihilate the old .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 12]: The claims of love can not surely obliterate those of friendship !
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 14]: The new should make the old better , not sweep it away . ''
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 13]: `` But , my dear girl , the thing is preposterous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 4]: exclaimed his lordship .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 13]: `` Do n't you see you will enter on a new life !
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 22]: In the most ordinary cases even , the duties of a wife are distinct from those of an unmarried woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 14]: `` But the duties of neither can supersede those of a human being .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 36]: If the position of a wife is higher than that of an unmarried woman , it must enable her to do yet better the things that were her duty as a human being before . ''
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 14]: `` But if it be impossible she should do the same things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 9]: `` Whatever is impossible settles its own question .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 12]: I trust I shall never desire to attempt the impossible . ''
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 10]: `` You have begun to attempt it now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 8]: `` I do not understand you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 28]: `` It is impossible you should perform the duties of the station you are about to occupy , and continue to do as you are doing now .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 7]: The attempt wuld be absurd . ''
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 9]: `` I have not tried it yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 30]: `` But I know what your duties will be , and I assure you , my dear Hester , you will find the thing can not be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 24]: `` You set me thinking of more things than I can manage all at once , '' she replied in a troubled way .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 6]: `` I must think . ''
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 17]: `` The more you think , the better satisfied you will be of what I say .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 28]: All I want of you is to think ; for I am certain if you do , your good sense will convince you I am right . ''
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 5]: He paused a moment .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 5]: Hester did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 35]: He resumed : `` Just think , '' he said , `` what it would be to have you coming home to go out again straight from one of these kennels of the small-pox !
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 5]: The idea is horrible !
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 20]: Wherever you were suspected of being present , the house would be shunned like the gates of death . ''
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 11]: `` In such circumstances I should not go out . ''
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 9]: `` The suspicion of it would be enough .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 27]: And in your absence , as certainly as in your presence , though not so fatally , you would be neglecting your duty to society . ''
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 38]: `` Then , '' said Hester , `` the portion of society that is healthy , wealthy , and -- merry , has stronger claims than the portion that is poor and sick and in prison ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 28]: Lord Gartley was for a moment bewildered -- not from any feeling of the force of what she said , but from inability to take it in .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 43]: He had to turn himself about two or three times mentally before he could bring himself to believe she actually meant that those to whom she alluded were to be regarded as a portion of the same society that ruled his life .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 27]: He thought another moment , then said : `` There are the sick in every class : you would have those of your own to visit .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 11]: Why not leave others to visit those of theirs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 19]: `` Then of course you would have no objection to my visiting a duchess in the small-pox ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 28]: Lord Gartley was on the point of saying that duchesses never took the smallpox , but he did not , afraid Hester might know to the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 13]: `` There could be no occasion for that , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 10]: `` She would have everything she could want . ''
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 10]: `` And the others are in lack of everything !
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 10]: To desert them would be to desert the Lord .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 7]: He will count it so . ''
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 48]: `` Well , certainly , '' said his lordship , returning on the track , `` there would be less objection in the case of the duchess , in as much as every possible precaution would in her house be taken against the spread of the disease .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 14]: It would be horribly selfish to think only of the person affected ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 21]: `` You show the more need that the poor should not be deserted of the rich in their bitter necessity !
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 17]: Who among them is able to take the right precautions against the spread of the disease ?
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 30]: And if it spread among them , there is no security against its reaching those at last who take every possible care of themselves and none of their neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 31]: You do not imagine , because I trust in God , and do not fear what the small-pox can do to me , I would therefore neglect any necessary preventive !
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 15]: That would be to tempt God : means as well as results are his .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 14]: They are a way of giving us a share in his work . ''
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 20]: `` If I should have imagined such neglect possible , would not yesterday go far to justify me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 4]: said lord Gartley .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 9]: `` You are ungenerous , '' returned Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 9]: `` You know I was then taken unprepared !
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 18]: The smallpox had but just appeared -- at least I had not heard of it before . ''
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 17]: `` Then you mean to give up society for the sake of nursing the poor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 21]: `` Only upon occasion , when there should be a necessity -- such as an outbreak of infectious disease . ''
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 25]: `` And how , pray , should I account for your absence -- not to mention the impossibility of doing my part without you ?
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 32]: I should have to be continually telling stories ; for if people came to know the fact , they would avoid me too as if I were the pest itself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 21]: It was to Hester as if a wall rose suddenly across the path hitherto stretching before her in long perspective .
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 27]: It became all but clear to her that he and she had been going on without any real understanding of each other 's views in life .
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 11]: Her expectations tumbled about her like a house of cards .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 54]: If he wanted to marry her , full of designs and aims in which she did not share , and she was going to marry him , expecting sympathies and helps which he had not the slightest inclination to give her , where was the hope for either of anything worth calling success ?
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 4]: She sat silent .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 10]: She wanted to be alone that she might think .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 10]: It would be easier to write than talk further !
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 14]: But she must have more certainty as to what was in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 47]: `` Do you mean then , Gartley , '' she said , `` that when I am your wife , if ever I am , I shall have to give up all the friendships to which I have hitherto devoted so much of my life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 18]: Her tone was dominated by the desire to be calm , and get at his real feeling .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 17]: Gartley mistook it , and supposed her at length betraying the weakness hitherto so successfully concealed .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 18]: He concluded he had only to be firm now to render future discussion of the matter unnecessary .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 22]: `` I would not for a moment act the tyrant , or say you must never go into such houses again .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 46]: Your own good sense , the innumerable engagements you will have , the endless calls upon your time and accomplishments , will guide you -- and I am certain guide you right , as to what attention you can spare to the claims of benevolence .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 32]: But just please allow me one remark : in the circle to which you will in future belong , nothing is considered more out of place than any affectation of enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 61]: I do not care to determine whether your way or theirs is the right one ; all I want to say is , that as the one thing to be avoided is peculiarity , you would do better not to speak of these persons , whatever regard you may have for their spiritual welfare , as _ your friends _ .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 28]: One can not have so many friends -- not to mention that a unity of taste and feeling is necessary to that much-abused word _ friendship _ .
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 13]: You know well enough such persons can not be your friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 8]: This was more than Hester could bear .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 19]: She broke out with a vehemence for which she was afterwards sorry , though nowise ashamed of it .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 8]: `` They _ are _ my friends .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 15]: There are twenty of them would do more for me than you would . ''
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 4]: Lord Gartley rose .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 4]: He was hurt .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 40]: `` Hester , '' he said , `` you think so little of me or my anxiety about your best interests , that I can not but suppose it will be a relief to you if I go . ''
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 23]: She answered not a word -- did not even look up , and his lordship walked gently but unhesitatingly from the room .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 10]: `` It will bring her to her senses ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 6]: he said to himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 7]: -- How grand she looked ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 14]: Long after he was gone , Hester sat motionless , thinking , thinking .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 28]: What she had vaguely foreboded -- she knew now she had foreboded it all the time -- at least she thought she knew it -- was come !
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 16]: They were not , never had been , never could be at one about anything !
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 17]: He was a mere man of this world , without relation to the world of truth !
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 14]: To be tied to him for life would be to be tied indeed !
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 66]: And yet she loved him -- would gladly die for him -- not to give him his own way -- for that she would not even marry him ; but to save him from it -- to save him from himself , and give him God instead -- that would be worth dying for , even if it were the annihilation unbelievers took it for !
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 23]: To marry him , swell his worldly triumphs , help gild the chains of his slavery was not to be thought of !
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 15]: It was one thing to die that a fellow-creature might have all things good !
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 16]: another to live a living death that he might persist in the pride of life !
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 15]: She could not throw God 's life to the service of the stupid Satan !
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 14]: It was a sad breakdown to the hopes that had clustered about Gartley !
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 7]: But did she not deserve it ?
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 28]: Therewith began a self-searching which did not cease until it had prostrated her in sorrow and shame before him whose charity is the only pledge of ours .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 8]: Was it then all over between them ?
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 21]: Might he not bethink himself , and come again , and say he was sorry he had so left her ?
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 13]: He might indeed ; but would that make any difference to her ?
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 15]: Had he not beyond a doubt disclosed his real way of thinking and feeling ?
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 23]: If he could speak thus now , after they had talked so much , what spark of hope was there in marriage ?
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 15]: To forget her friends that she might go into _ society _ a countess !
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 8]: The thought was as contemptible as poverty-stricken .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 15]: She would leave such ambition to women that devoured novels and studied the peerage !
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 17]: One loving look from human eyes was more to her than the admiration of the world !
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 25]: She would go back to her mother as soon as she had found her poor Corney , and seen her people through the smallpox !
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 17]: If only the house was her own , that she might turn it into a hospital !
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 32]: She would make it a home to which any one sick or sad , any cast out of the world , any betrayed by seeming friends , might flee for shelter !
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 41]: She would be more than ever the sister and helper of her own -- cling faster than ever to the skirts of the Lord 's garment , that the virtue going out of him might flow through her to them !
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 23]: She would be like Christ , a gulf into which wrong should flow and vanish -- a sun radiating an uncompromising love !
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 18]: How easy is the thought , in certain moods , of the loveliest , most unselfish devotion !
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 17]: How hard is the doing of the thought in the face of a thousand unlovely difficulties !
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 20]: Hester knew this , but , God helping , was determined not to withdraw hand or foot or heart .
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 15]: She rose , and having prepared herself , set out to visit her people .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 20]: First of all she would go to the bookbinder 's , and see how his wife was attended to .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 11]: The doctor not being there , she was readily admitted .
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 18]: The poor husband , unable to help , sat a picture of misery by the scanty fire .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 21]: A neighbor , not yet quite recovered from the disease herself , had taken on her the duties of nurse .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 32]: Having given her what instructions she thought it least improbable she might carry out , and told her to send for anything she wanted , she rose to take her leave .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 17]: `` Wo n't you sing to her a bit , miss , before you go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 5]: said the husband beseechingly .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 15]: `` It 'll do her more good than all the doctor 's stuff . ''
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 14]: `` I do n't think she 's well enough , '' said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 61]: `` Not to get all the good on it , I daresay , miss , '' rejoined the man ; `` but she 'll hear it like in a dream , an ' she 'll think it 's the angels a singin ' ; an ' that 'll do her good , for she do like all them creaturs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 47]: Hester yielded and sang , thinking all the time how the ways of the open-eyed God look to us like things in a dream , because we are only in the night of his great day , asleep before the brightness of his great waking thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 29]: The woman had been tossing and moaning in an undefined discomfort , but as she sang she grew still , and when she ceased lay as if asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 11]: `` Thank you , miss , '' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 14]: `` You can do more than the doctor , as I told you !
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 17]: When he comes , he always wakes her up ; you make her sleep true ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLII .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 5]: DEEP CALLETH UNTO DEEP .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 13]: In the meantime yet worse trouble had come upon the poor Frankses .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 55]: About a week after they had taken possession of the cellar , little Moxy , the Serpent of the Prairies , who had been weakly ever since his fall down the steps , by which he had hurt his head and been sadly shaken , became seriously ill , and grew worse and worse .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 57]: For some days they were not much alarmed , for the child had often been ailing -- oftener of late since they had not been faring so well ; and even when they were they dared not get a doctor to him for fear of being turned out , and having to go to the workhouse .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 15]: By this time they had contrived to make the cellar a little more comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 29]: They managed to get some straw , and with two or three old sacks made a bed for the mother and the baby and Moxy on the packing-case .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 22]: They got also some pieces of matting , and contrived to put up a screen betwixt it and the rickety door .
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 26]: By the exercise of their art they had gained enough to keep them in food , but never enough to pay for the poorest lodging .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 33]: They counted themselves , however , better off by much than if they had been crowded with all sorts in such lodging as a little more might have enabled them to procure .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 24]: The parents loved Moxy more tenderly than either of his brothers , and it was with sore hearts they saw him getting worse .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 29]: The sickness was a mild smallpox -- so mild that they did not recognize it , yet more than Moxy could bear , and he was gradually sinking .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 20]: When this became clear to the mother , then indeed she felt the hand of God heavy upon her .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 135]: Religiously brought up , she had through the ordinary troubles of a married life sought help from the God in whom her mother had believed : -- we do not worship our fathers and mothers like the Chinese -- though I do not envy the man who can scorn them for it -- but they are , if at all decent parents , our first mediators with the great father , whom we can worse spare than any baby his mother ; -- but with every fresh attack of misery , every step further down on the stair of life , she thought she had lost her last remnant of hope , and knew that up to that time she had hoped , while past seasons of failure looked like times of blessed prosperity .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 23]: No man , however little he may recognize the hope in him , knows what it would be to be altogether hopeless .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 22]: Now Moxy was about to be taken from them , and no deeper misery seemed , to their imagination , possible !
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 12]: Nothing seemed left them -- not even the desire of deliverance .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 12]: How little hope there is in the commoner phases of religion !
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 65]: The message grounded on the uprising of the crucified man , has as yet yielded but little victory over the sorrows of the grave , but small anticipation of the world to come ; not a little hope of deliverance from a hell , but scarce a foretaste of a blessed time at hand when the heart shall exult and the flesh be glad .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 29]: In general there is at best but a sad looking forward to a region scarcely less shadowy and far more dreary than the elysium of the pagan poets .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 25]: When Christ cometh , shall he find faith in the earth -- even among those who think they believe that he is risen indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 33]: Margaret Franks , in the cellar of her poverty , the grave yawning below it for her Moxy , felt as if there was no heaven at all , only a sky .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 27]: But a strange necessity was at hand to compel the mother to rouse afresh all the latent hope and faith and prayer that were in her .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 14]: By an inexplicable insight the child seemed to know that he was dying .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 35]: For , one morning , after having tossed about all the night long , he suddenly cried out in tone most pitiful , `` Mother , do n't put me in a hole . ''
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 41]: As far as any of them knew , he had never seen a funeral -- at least to know what it was -- had never heard anything about death or burial : his father had a horror of the subject !
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 13]: The words went like a knife to the heart of the mother .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 15]: She sat silent , neither able to speak , not knowing what to answer .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 18]: Again came the pitiful cry , `` Mother , do n't put me in a hole . ''
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 39]: Most mothers would have sought to soothe the child , their own hearts breaking the while , with the assurance that no one should put him into any hole , or anywhere he did not want to go .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 36]: But this mother could not lie in the face of death , nor had it ever occurred to her that no _ person _ is ever put into a hole , though many a body .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 35]: Before she could answer , a third time came the cry , this time in despairing though suppressed agony , -- `` Mother , do n't let them put me in a hole . ''
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 19]: The mother gave a cry like the child 's , and her heart within her became like water .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 6]: `` Oh , God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 9]: she gasped , and could say no more .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 20]: But with the prayer -- for what is a prayer but a calling on the name of the Lord ?
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 15]: -- came to her a little calm , and she was able to speak .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 9]: She bent over him and kissed his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 13]: `` My darling Moxy , mother loves you , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 13]: What that had to do with it she did not ask herself .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 11]: The child looked up in her face with dim eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 28]: `` Pray to the heavenly father , Moxy , '' she went on -- and there stopped , thinking what she should tell him to ask for .
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 47]: `` Tell him , '' she resumed , `` that you do n't want to be put in a hole , and tell him that mother does not want you to be put in a hole , for she loves you with all her heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 19]: `` Do n't put me in the hole , '' said Moxy , now using the definite article .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 23]: `` Jesus Christ was put in the hole , '' said the voice of the next elder boy from behind his mother .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 15]: He had come in softly , and she had neither seen nor heard him .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 19]: It was Sunday , and he had strolled into a church or meeting-house -- does it matter which ?
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 10]: -- and had heard the wonderful story of hope .
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 37]: It was remarkable though that he had taken it up as he did , for he went on to add , `` but he did n't mind it much , and soon got out again . ''
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 8]: `` Ah , yes , Moxy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 25]: said the poor mother , `` Jesus died for our sins , and you must ask him to take you up to heaven . ''
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 16]: But Moxy did not know anything about sins , and just as little about heaven .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 16]: What he wanted was an assurance that he would not be put in the hole .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 18]: And the mother , now a little calmer , thought she saw what she ought to say .
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 25]: `` It ai n't your soul , it 's only your body , Moxy , they put in the hole , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 17]: `` I do n't want to be put in the hole , '' Moxy almost screamed .
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 11]: `` I do n't want my head cut off ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 10]: The poor mother was at her wits ' end .
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 25]: But here the child fell into a troubled sleep , and for some hours a silence as of the grave filled the dreary cellar .
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 41]: The moment he woke the same cry came from his fevered lips , `` Do n't put me in the hole , '' and at intervals , growing longer as he grew weaker , the cry came all the day .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLIII .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 2]: DELIVERANCE .
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 23]: Hester had been to church , and had then visited some of her people , carrying them words of comfort and hope .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 26]: They received them in a way at her hand , but none of them , had they gone , would have found them at church .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 25]: How seldom is the man in the pulpit able to make people feel that the things he is talking about are things at all !
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 33]: Neither when the heavens are black with clouds and rain , nor when the sun rises glorious in a blue perfection , do many care to sit down and be taught astronomy !
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 15]: But Hester was a live gospel to them -- and most when she sang .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 30]: Even the name of the Saviour uttered in her singing tone and with the expression she then gave it , came nearer to them than when she spoke it .
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 20]: The very brooding of the voice on a word , seems to hatch something of what is in it .
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 49]: She often felt , however , as if some new , other kind of messengers than she or such as she , must one day be sent them ; for there seemed a gulf between their thoughts and hers , such as neither they nor she could pass .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 28]: In fact they _ could not _ think the things she thought , and had no vocabulary or phrases or imagery whereby to express their own thinkings .
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 19]: God does not hurry such : have we enough of hope for them , or patience with them ?
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 9]: I suspect their teachers must arise among themselves .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 32]: They too must have an elect of their own kind , of like passions with themselves , to lift them up , and perhaps shame those that can not reach them .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 38]: Our teaching to them is no teaching at all ; it does not reach their ignorance ; perhaps they require a teaching that to our ignorance would seem no teaching at all , or even bad teaching .
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 22]: How many things are there in the world in which the wisest of us can ill descry the hand of God !
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 19]: Who not knowing could read the lily in its bulb , the great oak in the pebble-like acorn ?
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 35]: God 's beginnings do not _ look _ like his endings , but they _ are _ like ; the oak _ is _ in the acorn , though we can not see it .
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 36]: The ranting preacher , uttering huge untruths , may yet wake vital verities in chaotic minds -- convey to a heart some saving fact , rudely wrapped in husks of lies even against God himself .
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 41]: Mr. Christopher , thrown at one time into daily relations with a good sort of man , had tried all he could to rouse him to a sense of his higher duties and spiritual privileges , but entirely without success .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 32]: A preacher came round , whose gospel was largely composed of hell-fire and malediction , with frequent allusion to the love of a most unlovely God , as represented by him .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 7]: This preacher woke up the man .
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 24]: `` And then , '' said Christopher , `` I was able to be of service to him , and get him on .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 38]: He speedily outgrew the lies his prophet had taught him , and became a devout Christian ; while the man who had been the means of rousing him was tried for bigamy , convicted and punished . ''
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 81]: This Sunday Hester , in her dejection and sadness about Gartley , over whom -- not her loss of him -- she mourned deeply , felt more than ever , if not that she could not reach her people , yet how little she was able to touch them , and there came upon her a hopelessness that was heavy , sinking into the very roots of her life , and making existence itself appear a dull and undesirable thing .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 49]: Hitherto life had seemed a good thing , worth holding up as a heave-offering to him who made it ; now she had to learn to take life itself from the hand of God as his will , in faith that he would prove it a good gift .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 60]: She had to learn that in _ all _ drearinesses , of the flesh or spirit , even in those that seem to come of having nothing to do , or from being unable to do what we think we have to do , the refuge is the same -- he who is the root and crown of life .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 9]: Who would receive comfort from anything but love ?
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 9]: Who would build on anything but the eternal ?
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 12]: Who would lean on that which has in itself no persistence ?
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 27]: Even the closest human loves have their only endurance , only hope of perfection , in the eternal perfect love of which they are the rainbow-refractions .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 42]: I can not love son or daughter as I would , save loving them as the children of the eternal God , in whom his spirit dwells and works , making them altogether lovely , and me more and more love-capable .
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 33]: That they are mine is not enough ground for enough love -- will not serve as operative reason to the height of the love my own soul demands from itself for them .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 19]: But they are mine because they are his , and he is the demander and enabler of love .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 13]: The day was a close , foggy , cold , dreary day .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 9]: The service at church had not seemed interesting .
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 73]: She laid the blame on herself , and neither on prayers nor lessons nor psalms nor preacher , though in truth some of these might have been better ; the heart seemed to have gone out of the world -- as if not Baal but God had gone to sleep , and his children had waked before him and found the dismal gray of the world 's morning full of discomfortable ghosts .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 37]: She tried her New Testament ; but Jesus too seemed far away -- nothing left but the story about him -- as if he had forgotten his promise , and was no longer in the world .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 22]: She tried some of her favourite poems : each and all were infected with the same disease -- with common-place nothingness .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 8]: They seemed all made up -- words !
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 2]: words !
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 2]: words !
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 18]: Nothing was left her in the valley but the shadow , and the last weapon , All-prayer .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 12]: She fell upon her knees and cried to God for life .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 37]: `` My heart is dead within me , '' she said , and poured out her lack into the hearing of him from whom she had come that she might have himself , and so be .
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 24]: She did not dwell upon her sorrows ; even they had sunk and all but vanished in the gray mass of lost interest .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 34]: The modern representatives of Eliphaz , Bildad , and Zophar would comfort us with the assurance that all such depression has physical causes : right or wrong , what does their comfort profit !
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 9]: Consolation in being told that we are slaves !
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 17]: What noble nature would be content to be cured of sadness by a dose of medicine ?
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 66]: There is in the heart a conviction that the soul ought to be supreme over the body and its laws ; that there must be a faith which conquers the body with all its tyrants ; and that no soul is right until it has that faith -- until it is in closest , most immediate understanding with its own unchangeable root , God himself .
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 47]: Such faith may not at once remove the physical cause , if such there be , but it will be more potent still ; in the presence of both the cause and the effect , its very atmosphere will be a peace tremulous with unborn gladness .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 30]: This gained , the medicine , the regimen , or the change of air may be resorted to without sense of degradation , with cheerful hope and some indifference .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 9]: Such is perhaps the final victory of faith .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 19]: Faith , in such circumstances , must be of the purest , and may be of the strongest .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 18]: In few other circumstances can it have such an opportunity -- can it rise to equal height .
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 10]: It may be its final lesson , and deepest .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 66]: God is in it just in his seeming to be not in it -- that we may choose him in the darkness of the feeling , stretch out the hand to him when we can not see him , verify him in the vagueness of the dream , call to him in the absence of impulse , obey him in the weakness of the will .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 11]: Even in her prayers Hester could not get near him .
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 13]: It seemed as if his ear were turned away from her cry .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 9]: She sank into a kind of lethargic stupor .
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 78]: I think , in order to convey to us the spiritual help we need , it is sometimes necessary -- just as , according to the psalmist , `` he giveth to his beloved in their sleep '' -- to cast us into a sort of mental quiescence , that the noise of the winds and waters of the questioning intellect and roused feelings may not interfere with the impression the master would make upon our beings .
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 13]: But Hester 's lethargy lasted long , and was not so removed .
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 29]: She rose from her knees in a kind of despair , almost ready to think that either there was no God , or he would not hear her .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 11]: An inaccessible God was worse than no God at all !
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 8]: In either case she would rather cease !
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 23]: It had been dark for hours , but she had lighted no candle , and sat in bodily as in spiritual darkness .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 35]: She was in her bedroom , which was on the second floor , at the back of the house , looking out on the top of the gallery that led to the great room .
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 5]: She had no fire .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 10]: One was burning away unheeded in the drawing-room below .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 13]: She was too miserable to care whether she was cold or warm .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 18]: When she had got some light in her body , then she would go and get warm !
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 9]: What time it was she did not know .
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 18]: She had been summoned to the last meal of the day , but had forgotten the summons .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 8]: It must have been about ten o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 12]: The streets were silent , the square deserted -- as usual .
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 20]: The evening was raw and cold , one to drive everybody in-doors that had doors to go in at .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 14]: Through the cold and darkness came a shriek that chilled her with horror .
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 47]: Yet it seemed as if she had been expecting it -- as if the cloud of misery that had all day been gathering deeper and deeper above and around her , had at length reached its fullness , and burst in the lightning of that shriek .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 9]: It was followed by another and yet another .
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 5]: Whence did they come ?
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 19]: Not from the street , for all beside was still ; even the roar of London was hushed !
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 21]: And there was a certain something in the sound of them that assured her that they rose in the house .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 5]: Was Sarah being murdered ?
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 17]: She was half-way down the stairs before the thought that sent her was plain to herself .
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 6]: The house seemed unnaturally still .
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 29]: At the top of the kitchen stairs she called aloud to Sarah -- as loud , that is , as a certain tremor in her throat would permit .
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 5]: There came no reply .
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 38]: Down she went to face the worst : she was a woman of true courage -- that is , a woman whom no amount of apprehension could deter when she knew she ought to seek the danger .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 12]: In the kitchen stood Sarah , motionless , frozen with fear .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 10]: A candle was in her hand , just lighted .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 9]: Hester 's voice seemed to break her trance .
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 10]: She started , stared , and fell a trembling .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 14]: She made her drink some water , and then she came to herself .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 10]: `` It 's in the coal-cellar , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 3]: she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 11]: `` I was that minute going to fetch a scuttleful !
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 16]: There 's something buried in them coals as sure as my name 's Sarah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 4]: `` Nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 3]: returned Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 11]: `` Who could scream like that from under the coals ?
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 12]: Come ; we 'll go and see what it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 5]: `` Laws , miss !
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 8]: do n't you go near it now .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 8]: It 's too late to do anything .
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 22]: Either it 's the woman 's sperrit as they say was murdered there , or it 's a new one . ''
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 12]: `` And you would let her be killed without interfering ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 13]: `` Oh , miss , all 's over by this time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 8]: persisted Sarah , with white lips trembling .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 17]: `` Then you are ready to go to bed with a murderer in the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 3]: said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 15]: `` He 's done his business now , an ' 'll go away . ''
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 6]: `` Give me the candle .
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 6]: I will go alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 16]: `` You 'll be murdered , miss -- as sure 's you 're alive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 13]: Hester took the light from her , and went towards the coal-cellar .
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 8]: The old woman sank on a chair .
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 19]: I have already alluded to the subterranean portion of the house , which extended under the great room .
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 15]: A long vault , corresponding to the gallery above , led to these cellars .
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 18]: It was rather a frightful place to go into in search of the source of a shriek .
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 18]: Its darkness was scarcely affected by the candle she carried ; it seemed only to blind herself .
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 16]: She tried holding it above her head , and then she could see a little .
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 28]: The black tunnel stretched on and on , like a tunnel in a feverish dream , a long way before the cellars began to open from it .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 16]: She advanced , I can not say fearless , but therefore only the more brave .
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 30]: She felt as if leaving life and safety behind , but her imagination was not much awake , and her mental condition made her almost inclined to welcome death .
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 19]: She reached at last the coal-cellar , the first that opened from the passage , and looked in .
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 14]: The coal-heap was low , and the place looked large and very black .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 33]: She sent her keenest gaze through the darkness , but could see nothing ; went in and moved about until she had thrown light into every corner : no one was there .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 39]: She was on the point of returning when she bethought herself there were other cellars -- one the wine-cellar , which was locked : she would go and see if Sarah knew anything about the key of it .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 21]: But just as she left the coal-cellar , she heard a moan , followed by a succession of low sobs .
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 13]: Her heart began to beat violently , but she stopped to listen .
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 19]: The light of her candle fell upon another door , a pace or two from where she stood .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 14]: She went to it , laid her ear against it , and listened .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 13]: The sobs continued a while , ceased , and left all silent .
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 32]: Then clear and sweet , but strange and wild , as if from some region unearthly , came the voice of a child : she could hear distinctly what it said .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 20]: `` Mother , '' it rang out , `` you _ may _ put me in the hole . ''
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 8]: And the silence fell deep as before .
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 7]: Hester stood for a moment horrified .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 17]: Her excited imagination suggested some deed of superstitious cruelty in the garden of the house adjoining .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 11]: Nor were the sobs and cries altogether against such supposition .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 12]: She recovered herself instantly , and ran back to the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 16]: `` You have the keys of the cellars -- have you not , Sarah ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 10]: `` Yes , miss , I fancy so . ''
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 13]: `` Where does the door beyond the coal-cellar lead out to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 8]: `` Not out to nowhere , miss .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 10]: That 's a large cellar as we never use .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 21]: I ai n't been into it since the first day , when they put some of the packing-cases there . ''
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 10]: `` Give me the key , '' said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 13]: `` Something is going on there we ought to know about . ''
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 11]: `` Then pray send for the police , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 5]: answered Sarah , trembling .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 17]: `` It ai n't for you to go into such places -- on no account ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 7]: not in our own house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 11]: `` It 's the police 's business , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 19]: `` Then the police are their brothers ' keepers , and not you and me , Sarah ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 16]: `` It 's the wicked as is in it , I fear , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 23]: `` It 's those that weep anyhow , and they 're our business , if it 's only to weep with them .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 2]: Quick !
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 8]: show me which is the key . ''
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 32]: Sarah sought the key in the bunch , and noting the coolness with which her young mistress took it , gathered courage from hers to follow , a little way behind .
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 25]: When Hester reached the door , she carefully examined it , that she might do what she had to do as quickly as possible .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 27]: There were bolts and bars upon it , but not one of them was fastened ; it was secured only by the bolt of the lock .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 19]: She set the candle on the floor , and put in the key as quietly as she could .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 20]: It turned without much difficulty , and the door fell partly open with a groan of the rusted hinge .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 10]: She caught up her light , and went in .
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 10]: It was a large , dark , empty place .
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 9]: For a few moments she could see nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 38]: But presently she spied , somewhere in the dark , a group of faces , looking white through the circumfluent blackness , the eyes of them fixed in amaze , if not in terror , upon herself .
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 44]: She advanced towards them , and almost immediately recognized one of them -- then another ; but what with the dimness , the ghostliness , and the strangeness of it all , felt as if surrounded by the veiling shadows of a dream .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 17]: But whose was that pallid little face whose eyes were not upon her with the rest ?
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 20]: It stared straight on into the dark , as if it had no more to do with the light !
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 6]: She drew nearer to it .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 9]: The eyes of the other faces followed her .
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 32]: When the eyes of the mother saw the face of her Moxy who died in the dark , she threw herself in a passion of tears and cries upon her dead .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 33]: But the man knelt upon his knees , and when Hester turned in pain from the agony of the mother , she saw him with lifted hands of supplication at her feet .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 19]: A torrent of divine love and passionate pity filled her heart , breaking from its deepest God-haunted caves .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 11]: She stooped and kissed the man upon his upturned forehead .
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 7]: Many are called but few chosen .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 51]: Hester was the disciple of him who could have cured the leper with a word , but for reasons of his own , not far to seek by such souls as Hester 's , laid his hands upon him , sorely defiling himself in the eyes of the self-respecting bystanders .
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 12]: The leper himself would never have dreamed of his touching him .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 9]: Franks burst out crying like the veriest child .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 22]: All at once in the depths of hell the wings of a great angel were spread out over him and his !
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 13]: No more starvation and cold for his poor wife and the baby !
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 7]: The boys would have plenty now !
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 21]: If only Moxy -- but he was gone where the angels came from -- and theirs was a hard life !
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 14]: Surely the God his wife talked about must have sent her to them !
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 9]: Did he think they had borne enough now ?
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 8]: Only he had borne it so ill !
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 12]: Thus thought Franks , in dislocated fashion , and remained kneeling .
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 21]: Hester was now kneeling also , with her arms round her whose arms were about the body of her child .
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 27]: She did not speak to her , did not attempt a word of comfort , but wept with her : she too had loved little Moxy !
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 32]: she too had heard his dying words -- glowing with reproof to her faithlessness who cried out like a baby when her father left her for a moment in the dark !
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 22]: In the midst of her loneliness and seeming desertion , God had these people already in the house for her help !
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 10]: The back-door of every tomb opens on a hill-top .
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 8]: With awe-struck faces the boys looked on .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 9]: They too could now see Moxy 's face .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 13]: They had loved Moxy -- loved him more than they knew yet .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 13]: The woman at length raised her head , and looked at Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 10]: `` Oh , miss , it 's Moxy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 12]: she said , and burst into a fresh passion of grief .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 6]: `` The dear child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 3]: said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 5]: `` Oh , miss !
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 9]: who 's to look after him now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 10]: `` There will be plenty to look after him .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 34]: You do n't think he who provided a woman like you for his mother before he sent him here , would send him there without having somebody ready to look after him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 18]: `` Well , miss , it would n't be like him -- I do n't think ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 17]: `` It would _ not _ be like him , '' responded Hester , with self-accusation .
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 39]: Then she asked them a few questions about their history since last she saw them , and how it was they had sunk so low , receiving answers more satisfactory than her knowledge had allowed her to hope .
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 6]: `` But oh miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 46]: exclaimed Mrs. Franks , bethinking herself , `` you ought not to ha ' been here so long : the little angel there died o ' the small-pox , as I know too well , an ' it 's no end o ' catching ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 15]: `` Never mind me , '' replied Hester ; `` I 'm not afraid .
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 19]: But , '' she added , rising , `` we must get you out of this immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 5]: `` Oh , miss !
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 7]: where would you send us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 6]: said Mrs. Franks in alarm .
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 10]: `` There 's nobody as 'll take us in !
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 37]: An ' it would break both our two hearts -- Franks 's an ' mine -- to be parted at such a moment , when us two 's the father an ' mother o ' Moxy .
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 23]: An ' they 'd take Moxy from us , an ' put him in the hole he was so afeared of ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 18]: `` You do n't think I would leave my own flesh and blood in the cellar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 3]: answered Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 16]: `` I will go and make arrangement for you above and be back presently . ''
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 8]: `` Oh thank you , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 13]: said the woman , as Hester sat down the candle beside them .
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 19]: `` I do want to look on the face of my blessed boy as long as I can !
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 10]: He will be taken from me altogether soon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 18]: `` Mrs. Franks , '' rejoined Hester , `` you mus n't talk like a heathen . ''
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 15]: `` I did n't know as I was saying anything wrong , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 29]: `` Do n't you know , '' said Hester , smiling through tears , `` that Jesus died and rose again that we might be delivered from death ?
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 15]: Do n't you know it 's he and not Death has got your Moxy ?
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 17]: He will take care of him for you till you are ready to have him again .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 21]: If you love Moxy more than Jesus loves him , then you are more like God than Jesus was ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 13]: `` Oh , miss , do n't talk to me like that !
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 10]: The child was born of my own body ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 27]: `` And both you and he were born of God 's own soul : if you know how to love he loves ten times better . ''
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 10]: `` You know how to love anyhow , miss !
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 5]: the Lord love you !
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 14]: An angel o ' mercy you been to me an ' mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 12]: `` Good-bye then for a few minutes , '' said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 13]: `` I am only going to prepare a place for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 16]: Only as she said the words did she remember who had said them before her .
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 34]: And as she went through the dark tunnel she sang with a voice that seemed to beat at the gates of heaven , `` Thou didst not leave his soul in hell . ''
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 26]: Mrs. Franks threw herself again beside her child , but her tears were not so bitter now ; she and hers were no longer forsaken !
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 37]: She also read her New Testament , and the last words of Hester had struck her as well as the speaker of them : `` And she 'll come again and receive us to herself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 4]: she said . ''
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 12]: -- An ' Christ 'll receive my poor Moxy to himself !
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 66]: If he was n't , as they say , a Christian , it was only as he had n't time -- so young , an ' all the hard work he had to do -- with his precious face a grinnin ' like an angel between the feet of him , a helpin ' of his father to make a livin ' for us all !
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 23]: That would be no reason why he as did the will o ' _ his _ father should n't take to him .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 17]: If ever there was a child o ' God 's makin ' it was that child !
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 16]: I feel as if God must ha ' made him right off , like ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 36]: Thoughts like these kept flowing through the mind of the bereaved mother as she lay with her arm over the body of her child -- ever lovely to her , now more lovely than ever .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 30]: The small-pox had not been severe -- only severe enough to take a feeble life from the midst of privation , and the expression of his face was lovely .
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 19]: He lay like the sacrifice that sealed a new covenant between his mother and her father in heaven .
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 13]: We have yet learned but little of the blessed power of death .
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 6]: We call it an evil !
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 8]: It is a holy , friendly thing .
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 63]: We are not left shivering all the world 's night in a stately portico with no house behind it ; death is the door to the temple-house , whose God is not seated aloft in motionless state , but walks about among his children , receiving his pilgrim sons in his arms , and washing the sore feet of the weary ones .
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 16]: Either God is altogether such as Christ , or the Christian religion is a lie .
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 9]: Not a word passed between husband and wife .
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 18]: Their hearts were too full for speech , but their hands found and held each the other .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 10]: It was the strangest concurrence of sorrow and relief !
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 14]: The two boys sat on the ground with their arms about each other .
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 4]: So they waited .
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLIV .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 5]: ON THE WAY UP .
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 62]: Hearing only the sounds of a peaceful talk , Sarah had ventured near enough to the door to hear something of what was said , and set at rest by finding that the cause of her terror was but a poor family that had sought refuge in the cellar , she woke up to better , and was ready to help .
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 29]: More than sufficiently afraid of robbers and murderers , she was not afraid of infection : `` What should an old woman like me do taking the small-pox !
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 10]: I 've had it bad enough once already ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 19]: She was rather staggered , however , when she found what Hester 's plan for the intruders was .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 23]: Nothing more , since the night of the concert , had been done to make the great room habitable by the family .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 11]: It had been well cleaned out and that was all .
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 28]: Now and then a fire was lighted in it , and the children played in it as before , but it had never been really in use .
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 15]: What better place , thought Hester , could there be for a small-pox ward !
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 15]: Thither she would convey her friends rescued from the slimy embrace of London poverty .
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 23]: She told Sarah to light a great fire as speedily as possible , while she settled what could be done about beds .
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 38]: Almost all in the house were old-fashioned wooden ones , hard to take down , heavy to move , and hard to put up again : with only herself and Sarah it would take a long time !
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 26]: For safety too it would be better to hire iron beds which would be easily purified -- only it was Sunday night , and late !
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 37]: But she knew the little broker in Steevens 's Road : she would go to him and see if he had any beds , and if he would help her to put them up at once !
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 23]: The raw night made her rejoice the more that she had got hold of the poor creatures drowning in the social swamp .
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 32]: It was a consolation , strong even against such heavy sorrows and disappointments as housed in her heart to know that virtue was going out of her for rescue and redemption .
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 34]: She had to ring the bell a good many times before the door opened , for the broker and his small household had retired for the night : it was now eleven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 24]: He was not well pleased at being taken from his warm bed to go out and work -- on such a night too !
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 31]: He grounded what objection he made , however , on its being Sunday , and more than hinted his surprise that Hester would ask him to do such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 47]: She told him it was for some who had nowhere to lay their heads , and in her turn more than hinted that he could hardly know what Sunday meant if he did not think it right to do any number of good deeds on it .
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 18]: The man assented to her argument , and went to look out the two beds she wanted .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 37]: But what in reality influenced him was dislike to offending a customer ; customers are the divinities of tradesmen , as society is the divinity of society : in her , men and women worship themselves .
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 58]: Having got the two bedsteads extracted piecemeal from the disorganized heaps in his back shop , he and Hester together proceeded to carry them home -- and I can not help wishing lord Gartley had come upon her at the work -- no very light job , for she went three times , and bore good weights .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 31]: It was long after midnight before the beds were ready -- and a meal of coffee , and toast , and bread and butter , spread in the great room .
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 10]: Then at last Hester went back to the cellar .
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 35]: `` Now , come , '' she said , and taking up the baby , which had just weight enough to lie and let her know how light it was , led the way .
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 36]: Franks rose from the edge of the packing-case , on which lay the body of Moxy , with his mother yet kneeling beside it , and put his arm round his wife to raise her .
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 19]: She yielded , and he led her away after their hostess , the boys following hand in hand .
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 26]: But when they reached the cellar door , the mother gave a heart-broken cry , and turning ran and threw herself again beside her child .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 5]: They all followed her .
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 5]: `` I ca n't !
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 5]: I ca n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 13]: `` I ca n't leave my Moxy lyin ' here all alone !
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 7]: He ai n't used to it .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 12]: He 's never once slep ' alone since he was born .
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 31]: I ca n't bear to think o ' that lovely look o ' his lost on the dark night -- not a soul to look down an ' see it !
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 4]: Oh , Moxy !
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 11]: was your mother a-leavin ' of you all alone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 16]: `` What makes you think there will not be a soul to see it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 3]: said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 9]: `` The darkness may be full of eyes !
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 15]: And the night itself is only the black pupil of the Father 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 12]: -- But we 're not going to leave the darling here .
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 20]: We 'll take him too , of course , and find him a good place to lie in . ''
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 20]: The mother was satisfied , and the little procession passed through the dark way , and up the stair .
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 23]: The boys looked pleased at sight of the comforts that waited them , but a little awed with the great lofty room .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 50]: Over the face of Franks , notwithstanding his little Serpent of the Prairies had crept away through the long tangled grass of the universe , passed a gleam of joy mingled with gratitude : much was now begun to be set to rights between him and the high government .
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 14]: But the mother was with the little body lying alone in the cellar .
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 11]: Suddenly with a wild gesture she made for the door .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 6]: `` Oh , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 7]: she cried , `` the rats !
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 4]: the rats ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 8]: and would have darted from the room .
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 10]: `` Stop , stop , dear Mrs. Franks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 3]: cried Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 3]: `` Here !
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 28]: take the baby ; Sarah and I are going immediately to bring him away , and lay him where you can see him when you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 5]: Again she was satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 12]: She took the baby , and sat down beside her husband .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 55]: I have mentioned a low pitched room under the great one : in this Hester had told Sarah to place a table covered with white : they would lay the body there in such fashion as would be a sweet remembrance to the mother : she went now to see whether this was done .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 13]: But on the way she met Sarah coming up with ashy face .
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 6]: `` Oh , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 25]: she said , `` the body must n't be left a minute : there 's a whole army of rats in the house already !
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 35]: As I was covering the table with a blanket before I put on the sheet , there got up all at once behind the wainscot the most uprageous hurry-scurry o ' them horrid creaturs .
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 14]: They 'll be in wherever it is -- you may take your bible-oath !
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 10]: Once when I was -- '' Hester interrupted her .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 12]: `` Come , '' she said , and led the way .
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 34]: She looked first into the low room to see that it was properly prepared , and was leaving it again , when she heard a strange sound behind the wainscot as it seemed .
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 6]: `` There , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 3]: said Sarah .
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 16]: Hester made up her mind at once that little Moxy should not be left alone .
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 37]: Her heart trembled a little at the thought , but she comforted herself that Sarah would not be far off , and that the father and mother of the child would be immediately over her head .
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 29]: The same instant she was ashamed of having found this comfort first , for was he not infinitely nearer to her who is lord of life and death ?
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 6]: They went to the cellar .
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 22]: `` But how , '' said Hester on the way , `` can the Frankses have got into the place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 13]: `` There is a back door to it , of course ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 3]: answered Sarah .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 38]: `` The first load of coals came in that way , but master would n't have it used : he did n't like a door to his house he never set eyes on , he said . ''
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 14]: `` But how could it have been open to let them in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 3]: said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 18]: When they reached the cellar , she took the candle and went to look at the door .
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 25]: It was pushed to , but not locked , and had no fastening upon it except the lock , in which was the key .
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 16]: She turned the key , and taking it out , put it in her pocket .
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 84]: Then they carried up the little body , washed it , dressed it in white , and laid it straight in its beauty -- symbol -- passing , like all symbols -- of a peace divinely more profound -- the little hands folded on the breast under the well-contented face , repeating the calm expression of that conquest over the fear of death , that submission to be `` put in the hole , '' with which the child-spirit passed into wide spaces .
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 34]: They lighted six candles , three at the head and three at the feet , that the mother might see the face of her child , and because light not darkness befits death .
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 31]: To Hester they symbolized the forms of light that sat , one at the head and one at the foot of the place where the body of Jesus had lain .
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 8]: Then they went to fetch the mother .
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 11]: She was washing the things they had used for supper .
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 7]: The boys were already in bed .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 20]: Franks was staring into the fire : the poor fellow had not even looked at one for some time .
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 19]: Hester asked them to go and see where she had laid Moxy , and they went with her .
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 10]: The beauty of Death 's courtly state comforted them .
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 10]: `` But I ca n't leave him alone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 9]: said the mother '' -- all night too !
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 7]: -- he would n't like it !
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 30]: I know he wo n't wake up no more ; only , you know , miss -- '' `` Yes , I know very well , '' replied Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 9]: `` I 'm ready , '' said Franks .
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 6]: `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 3]: returned Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 33]: `` You are worn out and must go to bed , both of you : I will stay with the beautiful thing , and see that no harm comes to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 17]: After some persuasion the mother consented , and in a little while the house was quiet .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 23]: Hester threw a fur cloak round her , and sat down in the chair Sarah had placed for her beside the dead .
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 25]: When she had sat some time , the exceeding stillness of the form beside her began to fill her heart with a gentle awe .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 32]: The stillness was so persistent that the awe gradually grew to dismay , and fear , inexplicable , unreasonable fear , of which she was ashamed , began to invade her .
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 15]: She knew at once that she must betake her to the Truth for refuge .
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 15]: It is little use telling one 's self that one 's fear is silly .
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 23]: It comes upon no pretence of wisdom or logic ; proved devoid of both , it will not therefore budge a jot .
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 23]: She prayed to the Father , awake with her in the stillness ; and then began to think about the dead Christ .
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 31]: Would the women who waited for the dawn because they had no light by which to minister , have been afraid to watch by that body all the night long ?
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 10]: Oh , to have seen it come to life !
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 10]: move and wake and rise with the informing God !
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 13]: Every dead thing belonged to Christ , not to something called Death !
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 6]: This dead thing was his .
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 13]: It was dead as he had been dead , and no otherwise !
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 23]: There was nothing dreadful in watching by it , any more than in sitting beside the cradle of a child yet unborn !
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 10]: In the name of Christ she would fear nothing !
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 5]: He had abolished death !
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 33]: Thus thinking , she lay back in her chair , closed her eyes , and thanking God for having sent her relief in these his children to help , fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 17]: She started suddenly awake , seeming to have been roused by the opening of a door .
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 30]: The fringe of a departing dream lay yet upon her eyes : was the door of the tomb in which she had lain so long burst from its hinges ?
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 9]: was the day of the great resurrection come ?
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 14]: Swiftly her senses settled themselves , and she saw plainly and remembered clearly .
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 7]: Yet could she be really awake ?
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 12]: for in the wall opposite stood the form of a man !
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 11]: She neither cried out nor fainted , but sat gazing .
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 11]: She was not even afraid , only dumb with wonder .
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 7]: The man did not look fearful .
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 19]: A smile she seemed to have seen before broke gradually from his lips and spread over his face .
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 13]: The next moment he stepped from the wall and came towards her .
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 31]: Then sight and memory came together : in that wall was a door , said to lead into the next house : for the first time she saw it open !
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 11]: The man came nearer and nearer : it was Christopher !
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 9]: She rose , and held out her hand .
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 9]: `` You are surprised to see me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 11]: he said , '' -- and well you may be !
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 6]: Am I in your house ?
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 5]: -- And this watch !
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 5]: what does it mean ?
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 8]: I seem to recognize the sweet face !
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 10]: I must have seen you and it together before !
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 3]: -- Yes !
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 5]: it is Moxy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 12]: `` You are right , Mr. Christopher , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 12]: `` Dear little Moxy died of the small-pox in our cellar .
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 11]: He was just gone when I found them there . ''
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 16]: `` Is it wise of you to expose yourself so much to the infection ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 4]: said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 13]: `` Is it worthy of you to ask such a question ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 3]: returned Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 22]: `` We have our work to do ; life or death is the care of him who sets the work . ''
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 16]: The doctor bent his head low , lower , and lower still , before her .
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 24]: Nothing moves a man more than to recognize in another the principles which are to himself a necessity of his being and history .
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 26]: `` I put the question to know on what grounds you based your action , '' he replied , `` and I am answered . ''
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 17]: `` Tell me then , '' said Hester , `` how you came to be here .
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 19]: It seemed to my sleepy eyes as if an angel had melted his own door through the wall !
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 8]: Are you free of ordinary hindrances ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 74]: She asked almost in seriousness ; for , with the lovely dead before her , in the middle of the night , roused suddenly from a sleep into which she had fallen with her thoughts full of the shining resurrection of the Lord , she would have believed him at once if he had told her that for the service of the Lord 's poor he was enabled to pass where he pleased .
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 88]: He smiled with a wonderful sweetness as he made answer : `` I hope you are not one of those who so little believe that the world and its ways belong to God , that they want to have his presence proved by something out of the usual way -- something not so good ; for surely the way He chooses to work almost always , must be a better way than that in which he only works now and then because of a special necessity ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 21]: By these words Hester perceived she was in the presence of one who understood the things of which he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 34]: `` I came here in the simplest way in the world , '' he went on , `` though I am no less surprised than you to find myself in your presence . ''
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 13]: `` The thing is to me a marvel , '' said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 10]: `` It shall not be such a moment longer .
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 8]: I was called to see a patient .
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 20]: When I went to return as I came , I found the door by which I had entered locked .
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 20]: I then remembered that I had passed a door on the stair , and went back to try it .
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 10]: It was bolted on the side to the stair .
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 22]: I withdrew the bolts , opened the door gently , and beheld one of the most impressive sights I ever saw .
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 9]: Shall I tell you what I saw ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 7]: `` Do , '' answered Hester .
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 45]: `` I saw , '' said Christopher with solemnity , `` the light shining in the darkness , and the darkness comprehending it not -- six candles , and only the up-turned face of the dead , and the down-turned face of the sleeping !
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 34]: I seemed to look into the heart of things , and see the whole waste universe waiting for the sonship , for the redemption of the body , the visible life of men !
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 26]: I saw that love , trying to watch by death , had failed , because the thing that is not needs not to be watched .
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 7]: I saw all this and more .
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 27]: I think I must have unconsciously pushed the door against the wall , for somehow I made a noise with it , and you woke . ''
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 10]: Hester 's face alone showed that she understood him .
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 18]: She turned and looked at Moxy to calm the emotion to which she would not give scope .
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 13]: Christopher stood silent , as if brooding on what he had seen .
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 21]: She could not ask him to sit down , but she must understand how he had got into the house .
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 5]: Where was his patient ?
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 10]: `` In the next house , of course ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 3]: she concluded .
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 7]: But the thing wanted looking into !
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 9]: That door must be secured on their side ?
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 23]: Their next midnight visitor might not be so welcome as this , whose heart burned to the same labour as her own !
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 39]: `` But what we really want , '' she thought , `` is to have more not fewer of our doors open , if they be but the right ones for the angels to come and go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 23]: `` I never saw that door open before , '' she said , `` and none of us knew where it led .
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 49]: We took it for granted it was into the next house , but the old lady was so cross , -- '' Here she checked herself ; for if Mr. Christopher had just come from that house , he might be a friend of the old lady 's !
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 19]: `` It goes into no lady 's house , so far as I understand , '' said Christopher .
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 23]: `` The stair leads to a garret -- I should fancy over our heads here -- much higher up , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 11]: `` Would you show me how you came in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 3]: said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 19]: `` With pleasure , '' he answered , and taking one of the candles , led the way .
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 21]: `` I would not let the young woman leave her husband to show me out , '' he went on .
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 26]: `` When I found myself a prisoner , I thought I would try this door before periling the sleep of a patient in the small-pox .
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 11]: You seem to have it all round you here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 15]: Through the door so long mysterious Hester stepped on a narrow , steep stair .
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 8]: Christopher turned downward , and trod softly .
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 19]: At the bottom he passed through a door admitting them to a small cellar , a mere recess .
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 12]: Thence they issued into that so lately occupied by the Frankses .
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 20]: Christopher went to the door Hester had locked , and said , `` This is where I came in .
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 12]: I suppose one of your people must have locked it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 21]: `` I locked it myself , '' replied Hester , and told him in brief the story of the evening .
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 5]: `` I see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 18]: said Christopher ; `` we must have passed through just after you had taken them away . ''
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 24]: `` And now the question remains , '' said Hester , '' -- who can it be in our house without our knowledge ?
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 9]: The stair is plainly in our house . ''
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 9]: `` Beyond a doubt , '' said Christopher .
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 15]: `` But how strange it is you should know your own house so imperfectly !
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 29]: I fancy the young couple , having got into some difficulty , found entrance the same way the Frankses did ; only they went farther and fared better !
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 11]: -- to the top of the house , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 10]: They 've managed to make themselves pretty comfortable too !
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 17]: There is something peculiar about them -- I can hardly say what in a word . ''
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 14]: `` Could I not go up with you to-morrow and see them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 3]: said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 9]: `` That would hardly do , I fear .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 18]: I could be of no farther use to them were they to suppose I had betrayed them .
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 25]: You have a perfect right to know what is going on in your house , but I would rather not appear in the discovery .
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 17]: One thing is plain , you must either go to them , or unlock the cellar-door .
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 9]: You will be taken with the young woman .
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 10]: She is a capable creature -- an excellent nurse .
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 8]: Shall I go out this way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 7]: `` Will you come to-morrow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 3]: said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 27]: `` I am alone , and can not ask anybody to help me because of the small-pox ; and I shall want help for the funeral .
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 8]: You do not think me troublesome ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 6]: `` Not in the least .
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 10]: It is all in the way of my business .
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 7]: I will manage for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 12]: `` Come then ; I will show you the way out .
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 8]: This is no. 18 , Addison square .
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 11]: You need not come in the cellar-way next time . ''
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 29]: `` If I were you , '' said Christopher , stopping at the foot of the kitchen stair , `` I would leave the key in that cellar-door .
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 14]: The poor young woman would be terrified to find they were prisoners . ''
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 15]: She turned immediately and went back , he following , and replaced the key .
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 17]: `` Now let us fasten up the door I came in by , '' said Christopher .
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 19]: `` I have got a screw in my pocket , and I never go without my tool-knife . ''
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 9]: This was soon done , and he went .
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 16]: What a strange night it had been for Hester -- more like some unbelievable romance !
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 10]: For the time she had forgotten her own troubles !
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 52]: Ah , if she had been of one mind with lord Gartley , those poor creatures would be now moaning in darkness by the dead body of their child , or out with it in their arms in the streets , or parted asunder in the casual wards of some workhouse !
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 41]: Certainly God could have sent them other help than hers , but where would _ she _ be then -- a fellow-worker with his lordship , and not with God -- one who did it not to _ him _ !
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 18]: Woe for the wife whose husband has no regard to her deepest desires , her highest aspirations !
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 29]: -- who loves her so that he would be the god of her idolatry , not the friend and helper of her heart , soul , and mind !
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 20]: Many of Hester 's own thoughts were revealed to her that night by the side of the dead Moxy .
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 46]: It became clear to her that she had been led astray , in part by the desire to rescue one to whom God had not sent her , in part by the pleasure of being loved and worshipped , and in part by worldly ambition .
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 17]: Surer sign would God have sent her had he intended she should give herself to Gartley !
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 23]: Would God have her give herself to one who would render it impossible for her to make life more abundant to others ?
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 16]: Marriage might be the absorbing duty of some women , but was it necessarily hers ?
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 7]: Certainly not with such a man ?
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 12]: Might not the duties of some callings be incompatible with marriage ?
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 16]: Did not the providence of the world ordain that not a few should go unmarried ?
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 21]: The children of the married would be but ill cared for were there only the married to care for them !
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 27]: It was one thing to die for a man -- another to enslave God 's child to the will of one who did not know him !
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 17]: Was a husband to take the place of Christ , and order her life for her ?
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 6]: Was man enough for woman ?
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 6]: Did she not need God ?
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 5]: It came to that !
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 9]: Was he or God to be her master ?
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 12]: It grew clearer and clearer as she watched by the dead .
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 20]: There was , there could be no relation of life over which the Lord of life was not supreme !
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 21]: That this or that good woman could do this or that faithless or mean thing , was nothing to her !
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 15]: What might be unavoidable to one less instructed , would be sin in her !
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 26]: The other might heed the sufferings and confusions that resulted ; but for her must remain a fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation !
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 26]: When the morning came and she heard Sarah stirring , she sent her to take her place , and went to get a little rest .
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLV .
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 3]: MORE YET .
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 6]: But she could not sleep .
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 22]: She rose , went back to the room where the dead Moxy lay , and sent Sarah to get breakfast ready .
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 29]: Then came upon her an urgent desire to know the people who had come , like swallows , to tenant , without leave asked , the space overhead .
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 34]: She undid the screw , opened the door , and stole gently up the stair , steep , narrow and straight , which ran the height of the two rooms between two walls .
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 35]: A long way up she came to another door , and peeping through a chink in it , saw that it admitted to the small orchestra high in the end-wall of the great room .
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 16]: Probably then the stair and the room below had been an arrangement for the musicians .
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 20]: Going higher yet , till she all but reached the roof , the stair brought her to a door .
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 3]: She knocked .
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 37]: No sound of approaching foot followed , but after some little delay it was opened by a young woman , with her finger on her lip , and something of a scared look in her eye .
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 17]: She had expected to see the doctor , and started and trembled at sight of Hester .
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 25]: There was little light where she stood , but Hester could not help feeling as if she had not merely seen her somewhere before .
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 13]: She came out on the landing and shut the door behind her .
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 22]: `` He is very ill , '' she said ; `` and he hears a strange voice even in his sleep .
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 9]: A strange voice is dreadful to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 35]: Her voice was not strange , and the moment she spoke it seemed to light up her face : Hester , with a pang she could scarcely have accounted for , recognized Amy Amber .
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 4]: `` Amy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 7]: `` Oh , Miss Raymount ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 10]: cried Amy joyfully , `` is it indeed you ?
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 6]: Are you come at last ?
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 12]: I thought I was never to see you any more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 9]: `` You bewilder me , '' said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 9]: `` How do you come to be here ?
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 7]: I do n't understand . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 9]: _ He _ brought me here . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 8]: _ Who _ brought you here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 6]: `` Why , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 19]: exclaimed Amy , as if hearing the most unexpected of questions , `` who should it be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 12]: `` I have not the slightest idea , '' returned Hester .
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 21]: But the same instant a feeling strangely mingled of alarm , discomfort , indignation , and relief crossed her mind .
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 20]: Through her whiteness Amy turned whiter still , and she turned a little away , like a person offended .
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 9]: `` There is but one , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 4]: she said coldly .
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 9]: `` Who should it be but him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 11]: `` Speak his name , '' said Hester almost sternly .
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 8]: `` This is no time for hide-and-seek .
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 7]: Tell me whom you mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 8]: `` Are you angry with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 3]: faltered Amy .
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 15]: `` Oh , Miss Raymount , I do n't think I deserve it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 6]: `` Speak out , child !
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 9]: Why should I be angry with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 8]: `` Do you know what it is ?
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 11]: -- Oh , I hardly know what I am saying !
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 4]: He is dying !
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 5]: he is dying ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 14]: She sank on the floor , and covered her face with her hands .
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 25]: Hester stood a moment and looked at her weeping , her heart filled with sad dismay , mingled with a kind of wan hope .
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 15]: Then softly and quickly she opened the door of the room and went in .
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 31]: Amy started to her feet , but too late to prevent her , and followed trembling , afraid to speak , but relieved to find that Hester moved so noiselessly .
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 18]: It was a great room , but the roof came down to the floor nearly all round .
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 8]: It was lighted only with a skylight .
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 8]: In the farthest corner was a screen .
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 17]: Hester crept gently towards it , and Amy after her , not attempting to stop her .
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 10]: She came to the screen and peeped behind it .
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 30]: There lay a young man in a troubled sleep , his face swollen and red and blotched with the small-pox ; but through the disfigurement she recognized her brother .
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 21]: Her eyes filled with tears ; she turned away , and stole out again as softly as she came in .
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 25]: Amy had been looking up at her anxiously ; when she saw the tenderness of her look , she gathered courage and followed her .
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 12]: Outside , Hester stopped , and Amy again closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 15]: `` You _ will _ forgive him , wo n't you , miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 18]: she said pitifully , `` What do you want me to forgive him for , Amy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 7]: asked Hester , suppressing her tears .
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 8]: `` I do n't know , miss .
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 6]: You seemed angry with him .
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 10]: I do n't know what to make of it .
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 37]: Sometimes I feel certain it must have been his illness coming on that made him weak in his head and talk foolishness ; and sometimes I wonder whether he has really been doing anything wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 21]: `` He must have been doing something wrong , else how should _ you _ be here , Amy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 6]: said Hester with hasty judgment .
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 28]: `` He never told me , miss : or of course I would have done what I could to prevent it , '' answered Amy , bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 11]: `` We were so happy , miss , till then !
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 11]: and we 've never had a moment 's peace since !
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 15]: That 's why we came here -- to be where nobody would find us .
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 11]: I wonder how he came to know the place ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 15]: `` Do _ you _ not know where you are then , Amy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 10]: `` No , miss ; not in the least .
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 11]: I only know where to buy the things we need .
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 11]: He has not been out once since we came . ''
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 9]: `` You are in our house , Amy .
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 6]: What will my father say !
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 25]: -- How long have you -- have you been -- '' Something in her heart or her throat prevented Hester from finishing the sentence .
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 12]: `` How long have I been married to him , miss ?
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 13]: You surely know that as well as I do , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 5]: `` My poor Amy !
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 11]: Did he make you believe we knew about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 25]: Amy gave a cry , but after her old way instantly crammed her handkerchief into her mouth , and uttered no further smallest sound .
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 4]: `` Alas ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 15]: said Hester , `` I fear he has been more wicked than we know !
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 13]: But , Amy , he has done something besides very wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 17]: Amy covered her face with her apron , through which Hester could see her soundless sobs .
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 28]: `` I have been doing what I could to find him , '' continued Hester , `` and here he was close to me all the time !
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 16]: But it adds greatly to my misery to find you with him , Amy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 25]: `` Indeed , miss , I may have been silly ; but how was I to suspect he was not telling me the truth ?
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 8]: I loved him too much for that !
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 16]: I told him I would not marry him without he had his father 's leave .
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 19]: And he pretended he had got it , and read me such a beautiful letter from his mother !
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 14]: Oh , miss , it breaks my heart to think of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 18]: A new fear came upon Hester : had he deceived the poor girl with a pretended marriage ?
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 7]: Was he bad through and through ?
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 25]: What her father would say to a marriage , was hard to think ; what he would say to a deception , she knew !
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 28]: That he would like such a marriage , she could ill imagine ; but might not the sense of escape from an alternative reconcile him to it ?
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 28]: Such thoughts passed swiftly through her mind as she stood half turned from Amy , looking down the deep stair that sank like a precipice before her .
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 13]: She heard nothing , but Amy started and turned to the door .
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 37]: She was following her , when Amy said , in a voice almost of terror , `` Please , miss , do not let him see you till I have told him you are here . ''
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 26]: `` Certainly not , '' answered Hester , and drew back , -- `` if you think the sight of me would hurt him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 16]: `` Thank you , miss ; I am sure it would , '' whispered Amy .
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 8]: `` He is frightened of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 6]: `` Frightened of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 25]: said Hester to herself , repeating Amy 's phrase , when she had gone in , leaving her at the head of the stair .
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 10]: `` I should have thought he only disliked me !
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 20]: I wonder if he would have loved me a little , if he had not been afraid of me !
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 11]: Perhaps I could have made him if I had tried .
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 11]: It is easier then to wake fear than love ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 42]: It may be very well for a nature like Corney 's to fear a father : fear does come in for some good where love is wanting : but I doubt if fear of a sister can be of any good .
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 26]: `` If he could n't love me , '' thought Hester , `` it would have been better he had n't been afraid of me .
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 14]: Now comes the time when it renders me unable to help him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 59]: When first it began to dawn upon Hester that there was in her a certain hardness of character distinct in its nature from that unbending devotion to the right which is imperative -- belonging in truth to the region of her weakness -- that self which fears for itself , and is of death , not of life .
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 56]: But she was one of those who , when they discover a thing in them that is wrong , take refuge in the immediate endeavour to set it right -- with the conviction that God is on their side to help them : for wherein , if not therein , is he God our Saviour ?
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 32]: She went down to the house , to get everything she could think of to make the place more comfortable : it would be long before the patient could be moved .
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 12]: In particular she sought out a warm fur cloak for Amy .
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 3]: Poor Amy !
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 21]: she was but the shadow of her former self , but a shadow very pretty and pleasant to look on .
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 23]: Hester 's heart was sore to think of such a bright , good honest creature married to a man like her brother .
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 20]: But she was sure however credulous she might have been , she had done nothing to be ashamed of .
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 11]: Where there was blame it must all be Corney 's !
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 37]: It was with feelings still strangely mingled of hope and dismay , that , having carried everything she could at the time up the stair , she gave herself to the comfort of her other guests .
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 28]: Left alone in London , Corney had gone idly ranging about the house when another man would have been reading , or doing something with his hands .
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 50]: Curious in correspondent proportion to his secrecy , for the qualities go together , the moment he happened to cast his eyes on the door in the wainscot of the low room , no one being in the house to interfere with him , he proceeded to open it .
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 27]: He little thought then what his discovery would be to him , for at that time he had done nothing to make him fear his fellow-men .
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 9]: But he kept the secret after his kind .
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 65]: Contriving often to meet Amy , he had grown rapidly more and more fond of her -- became indeed as much in love with her as was possible to him ; and though the love of such a man can never be of a lofty kind , it may yet be the best thing in him , and the most redemptive power upon him .
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 71]: Without a notion of denying himself anything he desired and could possibly have , he determined she should be his , but from fear as well as tortuosity , avoided the direct way of gaining her : the straight line would not , he judged , be the shortest : his father would never , or only after unendurable delay , consent to his marriage with a girl like Amy !
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 65]: How things might have gone had he not found her even unable to receive a thought that would have been dishonorable to him , and had he not come to pride himself on her simplicity and purity , I can not say ; but he contrived to persuade her to a private marriage -- contrived also to prevent her from communicating with her sister .
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 30]: His desire to please her , his passion for showing off , and the preparations his design seemed to render necessary , soon brought him into straits for money .
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 39]: He could not ask his father , who would have insisted on knowing how it was that he found his salary insufficient , seeing he was at no expense for maintenance , having only to buy his clothes .
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 34]: He went on and on , hiding his eyes from the approach of the `` armed man , '' till he was in his grasp , and positively in want of a shilling .
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 23]: Then he borrowed , and went on borrowing small sums from those about him , till he was ashamed to borrow more .
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 18]: The next thing was to _ borrow _ a trifle of what was passing through his hands .
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 11]: He was merely borrowing , and of his own uncle !
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 17]: It was a shame his uncle should have so much and leave him in such straits !
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 13]: -- be rolling in wealth and pay him such a contemptible salary !
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 7]: It was the height of injustice !
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 12]: Of course he would replace it long before any one knew !
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 22]: Thus by degrees the poor weak creature , deluding himself with excuses , slipped into the consciousness of being a rogue .
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 30]: There are some , I suspect , who fall into vice from being so satisfied with themselves that they scorn to think it possible they should ever do wrong .
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 36]: He went on taking and taking until at last he was obliged to confess to himself that there was no possibility of making restoration before the time when his _ borrowing _ must be embezzlement .
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 22]: Then in a kind of cold despair he laid hold upon a large sum and left the bank an unconvicted felon .
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 36]: What story he told Amy , to whom he was by this time married , I do not know ; but once convinced of the necessity for concealment , she was as careful as himself .
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 11]: He brought her to their refuge by the back way .
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 15]: She went and came only through the cellar , and knew no other entrance .
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 55]: When they found that , through Amy 's leaving the door unfastened when she went to buy , there being no way of securing it from the outside , others had taken refuge in the cellar , they dared not , for fear of attracting attention to themselves , warn them off the premises .
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLVI .
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 4]: AMY AND CORNEY .
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 49]: The Frankses remained at rest until the funeral was over , and then Hester would have father and sons go out to follow their calling , while the mother and she did what could be done for the ailing baby , who could not linger long behind Moxy .
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 34]: Hester had a little money of her own -- not much , but enough to restore to decency , with the help of the wife 's fingers , the wardrobe of the family .
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 34]: For the present she would not let them leave the house ; she must have them in better condition first , and with a little money in their pockets of their own earning .
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 35]: And the very first day , though they went out with heavy hearts , and could hardly have played with much spirit , they brought home more money than any day for weeks before .
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 30]: And Franks as he walked home weary , took some comfort that his Moxy was not with him to trouble his mother with his white face and drawn look .
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 40]: The same day lord Gartley called , but was informed by Sarah , who opened the door but a chink , that the small-pox was in the house , and that she could admit no one but the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 28]: To his exclamation she made answer that her young mistress was perfectly well , but could and would see nobody -- was in attendance upon the sick .
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 32]: So his lordship was compelled to go without seeing her , not without a haunting doubt that he was being played upon , and she did not want to see him .
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 19]: As had happened more than once before , soon after he was gone the major made his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 50]: To him Sarah gave the same answer , adding by her mistress 's directions , that in the meantime there was no occasion to prosecute inquiry about Mr. Cornelius , for it was all -- as Sarah put it -- explained , and her mistress would write to him .
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 11]: But what was Hester to tell her father and mother ?
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 30]: Until she knew with certainty the fact of her marriage , she shrank from mentioning Amy ; and at present it was impossible to find out anything from Cornelius .
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 49]: She merely wrote , therefore , that she had found him , but very ill ; that she would take the best care of him she could , and as soon as he was able to be moved , bring him home to be nursed by his mother .
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 14]: The great room was for the mean time given over to the Frankses .
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 14]: The wife kept everything tidy , and they managed things their own way .
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 25]: Hester made inquiry now and then , to be sure they were having everything they wanted , but left them to provide for themselves .
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 27]: She did her best to help Amy without letting her brother suspect her presence , and by degrees she got the room more comfortable for them .
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 30]: Corney had indeed taken a good many things from the house to make habitable the waste expanse , but had been careful not to take anything Sarah would miss .
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 53]: He was covered with the terrible eruption , and if he survived , which again and again seemed doubtful , would probably be much changed , for Amy could not keep his hands from his face : in trifles the lack of self-restraint is manifested , and its consequences are sometimes grievous .
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 51]: Hitherto Hester had not let her parents quite know how ill he was -- for what may seem a far-fetched reason -- not to save them from anxiety , but to save her mother from hearing his father say , the best thing he could do would be to die .
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 16]: Nor was she mistaken : many a time had her father said so to himself .
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 26]: It was simply impossible , he said , that he should ever again speak to him or in any way treat him as a son .
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 48]: He had by his vile conduct ceased to be a son , and he was nowise bound to do anything more for him ; though , from mere compassion , he would keep him from starving till he got some employment to which no character was necessary .
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 31]: He began at last to recover , but it was long before he could be treated otherwise than as a child -- so feeble was he , and so unreasonable .
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 29]: The first time he saw and knew Hester , he closed his eyes and turned away his head as if he would have no more of that apparition .
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 29]: She retired ; but , watching , presently saw him , in his own sly way , looking through half closed lids to know whether she was gone .
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 14]: When he saw Amy where Hester had stood , his face beamed up .
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 37]: `` Amy , '' he said , `` come here ; '' and when she went , he took her hand and laid it on his cheek , little knowing what a disfigured cheek it was .
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 5]: `` Thank God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 22]: said Hester to herself : she had never seen him look so sweet or loving or lovable , despite his disfigurement .
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 22]: She took care not to show herself again till he should be a little accustomed to the idea of her presence .
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 12]: The more she saw of Amy the better she liked her .
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 58]: She treated her patient with so much good sense , showed such a readiness to subordinate her ignorance to the wisdom of others , and such a careful obedience to the directions of the doctor , that she rose every day in Hester 's opinion , as well as found a yet deeper place in her heart .
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 39]: His lordship wrote , making an apology for anything he had said , from anxiety about one whom he loved to distraction , in which he might have presumed on the closeness of their relation to each other .
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 18]: He would gladly talk the whole matter over with her as soon as she gave him leave .
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 54]: For his part he had not a moment 's doubt that her good sense , relieved from the immediate pressure of her feelings , which were in themselves but too divine for the needs of this world , would convince her of the reasonableness of all he had sought to urge upon her .
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 26]: As soon as she was able , and judged it safe to admit a visitor , his aunt would be happy to call upon her .
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 44]: For the present , as he knew she would not admit him , he would content himself with frequent and most anxious inquiries after her , reserving argument and expostulation for a happier , and , he hoped , not very distant time .
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 26]: Hester smiled a curious smile at the prospect of a call from Miss Vavasor : was she actually going to plead her nephew 's cause ?
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 39]: As her brother grew better , and things became easier , the thought of lord Gartley came oftener , with something of the old feeling for the man himself , but mingled with sadness and a strange pity .
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 12]: She would never have been able to do anything for him !
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 30]: It had been in her spiritual presumption to think she could save him by the preciousness of her self-gift to him and the strength of her power over him !
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 84]: If God can not save a man by all his good gifts , not even by the gift of a woman offered to his higher nature , but by that refused , the woman 's giving of herself a slave to his lower nature can only make him the more unredeemable ; while the withholding of herself may do something -- may at least , as the years go on , wake in him some sense of what a fool he had been .
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 36]: The man who would go to the dogs for lack of the woman he fancies , will go to the dogs when he has her -- may possibly drag her to the dogs with him .
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 8]: Hester began to see something of this .
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 37]: She recalled how she had never once gained from him a satisfactory reply to anything she said worth saying ; she had in her foolishness supplied from her own imagination the defective echoes of his response !
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 29]: Love had made her apt and able to do this ; but now that she had yielded entrance to doubt , she saw many things otherwise than before .
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 30]: She loved the man enough to die for him : she would not have one moment hesitated about that ; but it was quite another thing to marry him !
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 10]: It was her brother now she had to save !
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 27]: His dear , good little wife was doing all she could for him , but it would take sister and mother and all to save him !
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 33]: She could not do so much for him as Amy now , but by and by there would be his father to meditate with : to that she would give her energy !
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 5]: But his poor mother !
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 11]: would she recognize him -- so terribly scarred and changed ?
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 23]: He might in time , being young , grow more like himself , but now he was not pleasant to look upon .
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 17]: Some men are as vain as any women , and Corney was one of those some .
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 53]: While pretending to despise the kindest word concerning his good looks , he had taken the greatest pleasure in them ; and the first time he saw himself in a mirror , the look of dismay , of despairing horror that came over his face was as pitiful as it was ludicrous .
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 31]: He had been accustomed to regard himself as one superior on most grounds , on that of good looks in particular , to any one he knew -- and now !
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 25]: He could not but admit that he was nothing less than unpleasant to behold -- must be so even to those who loved him !
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 45]: It was a pain that in itself could do little to cast out the evil spirit that possessed him , but it was something that that evil spirit , while it remained in him , should be deprived of one source of its nourishment .
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 17]: It was a good thing that from any cause the transgressor should find his ways hard .
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 20]: He dashed the glass from him , and burst into tears which he did not even try to conceal .
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 60]: It was notable that from that time he was more dejected , and less peevish ; and this latter might not be only from returning health , for he had always been more or less peevish at home , where he never thought of cultivating the same conception or idea of himself as before the eyes of the world .
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 52]: Much of supposed goodness is merely a looking of the thing men would like to be considered -- originating doubtless sometimes in an admiration of , perhaps in a vague wish to be that thing , but unaccompanied of desire or strength enough to rouse the smallest endeavour after being it .
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 53]: Still Hester found it difficult to bear with his remaining peevishness and bad temper , knowing what he had made of himself , and that he knew she must know it ; but at such hard moments she had the good sense to leave him to the soothing ministrations of his wife .
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 42]: Amy never set herself against him : first of all she would show him that she understood what was troubling him : then would say something sympathetic , or petting , or coaxing , and always had her way with him .
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 15]: She had the great advantage that not yet had he once quarrelled with her .
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 18]: That gave a ground of hope for her influence with him that his sister had long lost .
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 19]: God had made Amy so that she had less trouble from selfishness than all but a few people .
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 18]: Hester , more than Amy , felt her own rights , and was ready to be indignant .
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 28]: She would have far more trouble than Amy in getting rid of the self-asserting self in her , which closes the door against heaven 's divinest gifts .
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 38]: In Hester it was no doubt associated with a loftier nature , and the harder victory would have its greater reward , but until finally conquered it must continue to obstruct her walk in the true way .
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 18]: So Hester learned from the sweetness of Amy , as Amy from the unbending principle of Hester .
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 26]: She at last made up her mind that she would take Cornelius home without giving her father the opportunity of saying he should not come .
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 19]: She would presume that he must go home after such an illness : the result she would wait !
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 44]: The meeting could in no case be a happy one , but if he were not altogether repulsed , if the mean devil in him was not thoroughly roused by the harshness of his father , she would think much had been gained !
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 40]: With gentle watchfulness she regarded Amy , and was more and more satisfied that , whatever might be wrong , she had had a share in it not as one who did , but as one who endured wrong .
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 41]: The sweetness and devotion with which she seemed to live only for her husband was to Hester , who found it impossible to take such a position even in imagination towards Gartley , in her tenderer moments almost a rebuke .
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 28]: But she could not believe that had Amy known before she married him what kind of person Cornelius was , she would have given herself to him .
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 20]: She did not think how nearly the man she had once accepted stood on the same level of manhood .
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 15]: But Amy was the wife of Cornelius , and that made an eternal difference .
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 20]: Her duty was as plain as Hester 's -- and the same -- to do the best for him !
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 23]: When he was able to be moved , Hester brought them into the house , and placed them in a comfortable room .
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 31]: She then moved the Frankses into the room they had left , making it over to them , subject to her father 's pleasure , for a time at least .
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 39]: With their own entrance through the cellar , they were to live there after their own fashion , and follow their own calling , only they were to let Hester know if they found themselves in any difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 26]: And now for the first time in her life she wished she had some means of her own , that she might act with freedom .
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 17]: She had seen hope of freedom in marriage , but now she wished it in independence .
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLVII .
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 3]: MISS VAVASOR .
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 57]: About three weeks after lord Gartley 's call , during which he had left a good many cards in Addison square , Hester received the following letter from Miss Vavasor : `` My dear Miss Raymount , I am very anxious to see you , but fear it is hardly safe to go to you yet .
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 31]: You with your heavenly spirit do not regard such things , but I am not so much in love with the future as to risk my poor present for it .
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 26]: Neither would I willingly be the bearer of infection into my own circle : I am not so selfish as to be careless about that .
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 32]: But communicate with you somehow I must , and that for your own sake as well as Gartley 's who is pining away for lack of the sunlight of your eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 8]: I throw myself entirely on your judgment .
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 35]: If you tell me you consider yourself out of quarantine , I will come to you at once ; if you do not , will you propose something , for meet we must . ''
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 8]: Hester pondered well before returning an answer .
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 37]: She could hardly say , she replied , that there was no danger , for her brother , who had been ill , was yet in the house , too weak for the journey to Yrndale .
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 21]: She would rather suggest , therefore , that they should meet in some quiet corner of one of the parks .
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 13]: She need hardly add she would take every precaution against carrying infection .
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 8]: The proposal proved acceptable to Miss Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 7]: She wrote suggesting time and place .
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 7]: Hester agreed , and they met .
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 55]: Hester appeared on foot , having had to dismiss her cab at the gate ; Miss Vavasor , who had remained seated in her carriage ; got down as soon as she saw her , and having sent it away , advanced to meet her with a smile : she was perfect in skin-hospitality .
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 18]: `` How long is it now , '' she began , `` since you saw Gartley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 11]: `` Three weeks or a month , '' replied Hester .
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 31]: `` I am afraid , sadly afraid , you can not be much of a lover , not to have seen him for so long and look so fresh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 29]: smiled Miss Vavasor , with gently implied reproach , and followed the words with a sigh , as if _ she _ had memories of a different complexion .
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 15]: `` When one has one 's work to do , -- '' said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 6]: `` Ah , yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 21]: returned Miss Vavasor , not waiting for the sentence , `` I understand you have some peculiar ideas about work .
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 13]: That kind of thing is spreading very much in our circle too .
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 9]: I know many ladies who visit the poor .
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 12]: They complain there are so few unobjectionable tracts to give them .
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 11]: The custom came in with these Woman 's - rights .
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 9]: I fear they will upset everything before long .
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 10]: But I hope the world will last my time .
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 11]: No one can tell where such things will end . ''
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 7]: `` No , '' replied Hester .
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 8]: `` Nothing has ever stopped yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 15]: `` Is that as much as to say that nothing ever will stop ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6367 len. 13]: `` I think it is something like it , '' said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 15]: `` We know nothing about the ends of things -- only the beginnings . ''
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 35]: There had been an air of gentle raillery in Miss Vavasor 's tone , and Hester used the same , for she had no hope of coming to an understanding with her about anything .
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 9]: `` Then the sooner we do the better !
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 15]: I do n't see else how things are to go on at all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 13]: said Miss Vavasor , revealing the drop of Irish blood in her .
Parsing [sent. 6373 len. 23]: `` When the master comes he will stop a good deal , '' thought Hester , but she did not say it .
Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 15]: She could not allude to such things without at least a possibility of response .
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 29]: `` You and Gartley had a small misunderstanding , he tells me , the last time you met , '' continued Miss Vavasor , after a short pause .
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 21]: `` I think not , '' answered Hester ; `` at least I fancy I understood him very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 14]: `` My dear Miss Raymount , you must not be offended with me .
Parsing [sent. 6378 len. 28]: I am an old woman , and have had to compose differences that had got in the way of their happiness between goodness knows how many couples .
Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 19]: I am not boasting when I say I have had considerable experience in that sort of thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 11]: `` I do not doubt it , '' said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 27]: `` What I do doubt is , that you have had any experience of the sort necessary to set things right between lord Gartley and myself .
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 36]: The fact is , for I will be perfectly open with you , that I saw then -- for the first time plainly , that to marry him would be to lose my liberty . ''
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 16]: `` Not more , my dear , than every woman does who marries at all .
Parsing [sent. 6384 len. 19]: I presume you will allow marriage and its duties to be the natural calling of a woman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6385 len. 4]: `` Certainly . ''
Parsing [sent. 6386 len. 15]: `` Then she ought not to complain of the loss of her liberty . ''
Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 18]: `` Not of so much as is naturally involved in _ marriage _ , I allow . ''
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 12]: `` Then why draw back from your engagement to Gartley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 28]: `` Because he requires me to turn away at once , and before any necessity shows itself , from the exercise of a higher calling yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 11]: `` I am not aware of any higher calling . ''
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 4]: `` I am .
Parsing [sent. 6392 len. 25]: God has given me gifts to use for my fellows , and use them I must till he , not man , stops me .
Parsing [sent. 6393 len. 6]: That is my calling . ''
Parsing [sent. 6394 len. 32]: `` But you know that of necessity a woman must give up many things when she accepts the position of a wife , and possibly the duties of a mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 15]: `` The natural claims upon a wife or mother I would heartily acknowledge . ''
Parsing [sent. 6396 len. 22]: `` Then of course to the duties of a wife belong the claims Society has upon her as a wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 80]: `` So far as I yet know what is meant in your circle by such claims , I count them the merest usurpations : I will never subject myself to such -- never put myself in a position where I should be expected to obey a code of laws not merely opposed to the work for which I was made , but to all the laws of the relations to each other of human beings as human beings . ''
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 13]: `` I do not quite understand you , '' said Miss Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 69]: `` Well , for instance , '' returned Hester , willing to give the question a general bearing , `` a mother in your class , according at least to much that I have heard , considers the duties she owes to society , duties that consist in what looks to me the merest dissipation and killing of time , as paramount even to those of a mother .
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 38]: Because of those ` traditions of men , ' or fancies of fashionable women rather , she justifies herself in leaving her children in the nursery to the care of other women -- the vulgarest sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 9]: `` Not knowingly , '' said Miss Vavasor .
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 9]: `` We are all liable to mistakes . ''
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 61]: `` But certainly , '' insisted Hester , `` without taking the pains necessary to know for themselves the characters of those to whom they trust the children God has given to their charge ; whereas to abandon them to the care of angels themselves would be to go against the laws of nature and the calling of God . ''
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 38]: Miss Vavasor began to think it scarcely desirable to bring a woman of such levelling opinions into their quiet circle : she would be preaching next that women were wicked who did not nurse their own brats !
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 8]: But she would be faithful to Gartley !
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 21]: `` To set up as reformers would be to have the whole hive about our ears , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 18]: `` That may be , '' replied Hester , `` but it does not apply to me .
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 22]: I keep the beam out of my own eye which I have no hope of pulling out of my neighhour 's .
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 9]: I do not belong to your set . ''
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 14]: `` But you are about to belong to it , I hope . ''
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 6]: `` I hope not . ''
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 10]: `` You are engaged to marry my nephew . ''
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 8]: `` Not irrevocably , I trust . ''
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 14]: `` You should have thought of all that before you gave your consent .
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 5]: Gartley thought you understood .
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 10]: Certainly our circle is not one for saints . ''
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 10]: `` Honest women would be good enough for me .
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 49]: But I thought I had done and said more than was necessary to make Gartley understand my ideas of what was required of me in life , and I thought he sympathized with me so far at least that he would be what help to me he could .
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 45]: Now I find instead of this , that he never believed I meant what I said , but all the time intended to put a stop to the aspiration of my life the moment he had it in his power to do so . ''
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 17]: `` Ah , my dear young lady , you do not know what love is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 17]: said Miss Vavasor , and sighed again as if _ she _ knew what love was .
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 42]: And in truth she had been in love at least once in her youth , but had yielded without word of remonstrance when her parents objected to her marrying three hundred a year , and a curacy of _ fifty _ .
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 19]: She saw it was reasonable : what fellowship can light have with darkness , or love with starvation ?
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 34]: `` A woman really in love , '' she went on , `` is ready to give up everything , yes , my dear , _ everything _ for the man she loves .
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 16]: She who is not equal to that , does not know what love is . ''
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 10]: `` Suppose he should prove unworthy of her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 9]: `` That would be nothing , positively nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 18]: If she had once learned to love him she would see no fault in him . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 9]: _ Whatever _ faults he might have ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 11]: `` Whatever faults : love has no second thoughts . ''
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 25]: `` Suppose he were to show himself regardless of her best welfare -- caring for her only as an adjunct to his display ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 26]: `` If she loved him , I only say _ if she loved him _ , she would be proud to follow in his triumph .
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 6]: His glory is hers . ''
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 9]: `` Whether it be real or not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 7]: `` If he counts it so .
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 16]: A woman who loves gives herself to her husband to be moulded by him . ''
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 33]: `` I fear that is the way men think of us , '' said Hester , sadly ; `` and no doubt there are women whose behaviour would justify them in it .
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 123]: With all my heart I say a woman ought to be ready to die for the man she loves ; that is a matter of course ; she can not really love him if she would not ; but that she should fall in with all his thoughts , feelings , and judgments whatever , even such as in others she would most heartily despise ; that she should act as if her husband and not God made her , and his whims , instead of the lovely will of him who created man and woman , were to be to her the bonds of her being -- that surely no woman could grant who had not first lost her reason . ''
Parsing [sent. 6439 len. 32]: `` You wo n't lose yours for love at least , '' concluded Miss Vavasor , who could not help admiring her ability , though she despised the direction it took .
Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 25]: `` I see , '' she said to herself , `` she is one of the strong-minded who think themselves superior to any man .
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 13]: Gartley will be well rid of her -- that is my conviction !
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 14]: I think I have done nearly all he could require of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 32]: `` I tell you honestly , '' continued Hester , `` I love lord Gartley so well that I would gladly yield my life to do him any worthy good . ''
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 15]: -- `` It is easy to talk , '' said Miss Vavasor to herself .
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 33]: -- `` Not that that is saying much , '' Hester went on , `` for I would do that to redeem any human creature from the misery of living without God .
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 80]: I would even marry lord Gartley -- I think I would , after what has passed -- if only I knew that he would not try to prevent me from being the woman I ought to be and have to be ; -- perhaps I would -- I am not clear about it just at this moment : never , if I were married to him , would I be so governed by him that he should do that !
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 10]: But who would knowingly marry for strife and debate ?
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 31]: Who would deliberately add to the difficulties of being what she ought to be , what she desired , and was determined , with God 's help , to be !
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 15]: I for one will not take an enemy into the house of my life .
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 18]: I will not make it a hypocrisy to say , ` Lead us not into temptation . '
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 53]: I grant you a wife must love her husband grandly ' -- passionately , if you like the word ; but there is one to be loved immeasurably more grandly , yea _ passionately _ , if the word means anything true and good in love -- he whose love creates love .
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 24]: Can you for a moment imagine , when the question came between my Lord and my husband , I would hesitate ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 43]: 'T is a pity you were not born in the middle ages , '' said Miss Vavasor , smiling , but with a touch of gentle scorn in the superiority of her tone ; `` you would certainly have been canonized ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 15]: `` But now I am sadly out of date -- am I not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 8]: returned Hester , trying to smile also .
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 32]: `` I could no more consent to live in God 's world without minding what he told me , than I would marry a man merely because he admired me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 20]: `` Heavens , '' exclaimed Miss Vavasor to what she called herself , `` what an extravagant young woman !
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 7]: She wo n't do for us !
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 13]: You 'll have to let her fly , my dear boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 27]: What she said to Hester was , `` Do n't you think , my dear , all that sounds a little -- just a little extravagant ?
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 33]: You know as well as I do -- you have just confessed it -- that the kind of thing is out of date -- does not belong to the world of to-day .
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 22]: And when a thing is once of the past , it can not be called back , do what you will .
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 11]: Nothing will ever bring in that kind of thing again .
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 73]: It is all very well to go to church and that sort of thing ; I should be the last to encourage the atheism that is getting so frightfully common , but really it seems to me such extravagant notions about religion as you have been brought up in must have not a little to do with the present sad state of affairs -- must in fact go far to make atheists .
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 9]: Civilization will never endure to be priest-ridden . ''
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 20]: `` It is my turn now , '' said Hester , `` to say that I scarcely understand you .
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 8]: Do you take God for a priest ?
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 19]: Do you object to atheism , and yet regard obedience to God as an invention of the priests ?
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 6]: Was Jesus Christ a priest ?
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 26]: or did he say what was not true when he said that whoever loved any one else more than him was not worthy of him ?
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 15]: Or do you confess it true , yet say it is of no consequence ?
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 50]: If you do not care about what he wants of you , I simply tell you that I care about nothing else ; and if ever I should change , I hope he will soon teach me better -- whatever sorrow may be necessary for me to that end .
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 16]: I desire not to care a straw about anything he does not care about . ''
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 50]: `` It is very plain , at least , '' said Miss Vavasor , `` that you do not love my nephew as he deserves to be loved -- or as any woman ought to love the man to whom she has given her consent to be his wife !
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 19]: You have very different ideas from such as were taught in my girlhood concerning the duties of wives !
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 37]: A woman , I used to be told , was to fashion herself upon her husband , fit her life to his life , her thoughts to his thoughts , her tastes to his tastes . ''
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 34]: Absurd indeed would have seemed , to any one really knowing the two , the idea of a woman like Hester fitting herself into the mould of such a man as lord Gartley !
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 24]: -- for what must be done with the quantity of her that would be left over after his lordship 's mould was filled !
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 54]: The notion of squeezing a large , divine being , like Hester , into the shape of such a poor , small , mean , worldly , time-serving fellow , would have been so convincingly ludicrous as to show at once the theory on which it was founded for the absurdity it was .
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 65]: Instead of walking on together in simple equality , in mutual honour and devotion , each helping the other to be better still , to have the woman , large and noble , come cowering after her pigmy lord , as if he were the god of her life , instead of a Satan doing his best to damn her to his own meanness !
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 10]: -- it is a contrast that needs no argument !
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 72]: Not the less if the woman be married to such a man , will it be her highest glory , by the patience of Christ , by the sacrifice of self , yea of everything save the will of God , to win the man , if he may by any means be won , from the misery of his self-seeking to a noble shame of what he now delights in .
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 20]: `` You are right , '' said Hester ; `` I do not love lord Gartley sufficiently for that !
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 26]: Thank you , Miss Vavasor , you have helped me to the thorough conviction that there could never have been any real union between us .
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 26]: Can a woman love with truest wifely love a man who has no care that she should attain to the perfect growth of her nature ?
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 38]: _ He _ would have been quite content I should remain for ever the poor creature I am -- would never by word , or wish , or prayer , have sought to raise me above myself !
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 18]: The man I shall love as I could love must be a greater man than lord Gartley !
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 12]: He is not fit to make any woman love him so .
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 29]: If she were so much less than he as to have to look up to him , she would be too small to have any devotion in her .
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 10]: I will be a woman and not a countess !
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 11]: -- I wish you good morning , Miss Vavasor . ''
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 27]: `` If I am not to help him , '' she said to herself , `` what is there in reason why I should marry him ?
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 38]: His love , no doubt , is the best thing he has to give , but a poor thing is his best , and save as an advantage for serving him , not worth the having . ''
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 24]: What her love to him would have been three months after marrying him , I am glad to have no occasion to imagine .
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 6]: She held out her hand .
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 15]: Miss Vavasor drew herself up , and looked a cold annihilation into her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 12]: The warm blood rose from Hester 's heart to her brain .
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 11]: Quietly she returned her gaze , nor blenched a moment .
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 38]: She felt as if she were looking a far off idea in the face -- as if she were telling her what a poor miserable creature of money and manners , ambitions and expediencies she thought her .
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 43]: Miss Vavasor , unused to having such a full strong virgin look fixed fearless , without defiance , but with utter disapproval , upon her , quailed -- only a little , but as she had never in her life quailed before .
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 22]: She forced her gaze , and Hester felt that to withdraw her eyes would give her a false sense of victory .
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 22]: She therefore continued her look , but had no need to force it , for she knew she was the stronger .
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 8]: It seemed minutes where only seconds passed .
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 24]: She smiled at last and said , `` I am glad you are not going to be my aunt , Miss Vavasor . ''
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 7]: `` Thank goodness , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 10]: cried Miss Vavasor , with a slightly hysterical laugh .
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 32]: Notwithstanding her educated self-command , she felt cowed before the majesty of Hester , for woman was face to face with woman , and the truth was stronger than the lie .
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 32]: Had she then yielded to the motions within her , she would , and it would have been but the second time in her life , have broken into undignified objurgation .
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 33]: She had to go back to her nephew and confess that she had utterly failed where she had expected , if not an easy victory , yet the more a triumphant one !
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 41]: She had to tell him that his lady was the most peculiar , most unreasonable young woman she had ever had to deal with ; and that she was not only unsuited to him , but quite unworthy of him !
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 20]: He would conclude she had managed the matter ill , and said things she ought not to have said !
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 61]: It was very hard that she , who desired only to set things right , looking for no advantage to herself -- she who was recognized as a power in her own circle , should have been so ignominiously foiled in the noble endeavour , having sacrificed herself , to sacrifice also another upon the altar of her beloved earldom !
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 9]: She could not reconcile herself to the thought .
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 36]: It did not occur to her that there was a power here concerned altogether different from any she had before encountered -- namely a soul possessed by truth and clad in the armour of righteousness .
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 54]: Of conscience that dealt with the qualities of things , nor cared what had been decreed concerning them by a class claiming for itself the apex of the world , she had scarce even a shadowy idea ; for never in her life had she herself acted from any insight into primary quality .
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 73]: When therefore she had to do with a girl who did not acknowledge the jurisdiction of the law to which she bowed as supreme , she was out of her element -- had got , as it seemed to her , into water too shoal to swim in ; whereas , in fact , she had got into water too deep to wade in , and did not know how to swim .
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 33]: She turned and walked away , attempting a show of dignity , but showing only that Brummagem thing , haughtiness -- an adornment the possessor alone does not recognize as a counterfeit .
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 30]: Then Hester turned too , and walked in the opposite direction , feeling that one supposed portion of her history was but an episode , and at an end .
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 31]: She did not know that , both coming and going , she was attended at a near distance by a tall , portly gentleman of ruddy complexion and military bearing .
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 39]: He had beheld her interview -- by no means overheard her conversation -- with Miss Vavasor , and had seen with delight the unmistakable symptoms of serious difference which at last appeared , and culminated in their parting .
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 53]: He did not venture to approach her , but when she got into a cab , took a Hansom and followed her to the entrance of the square , where he got down , his heart beating with exultant hope that `` the rascal ass of a nobleman '' had been dismissed .
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 64]: All the time since he came to London with Hester , he had , as far as possible to him , kept guard over her , and had known a good deal more of her goings and comings than she was aware of -- this with an unselfishness of devotion that took from him the least suspicion of its being a thing unwarrantable .
Parsing [sent. 6524 len. 33]: He was like the dog which , not allowed to accompany his master , follows him at a distance , ready to interfere at any moment when such interference may be desirable .
Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 35]: She had let him know that she had found her brother , that he was very ill , and that she was helping to nurse him ; but she had not yet summoned him .
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 15]: In severe obedience to orders , therefore , he did not even now call .
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 22]: Next day , however , he found a summons waiting him at his club , and made haste to obey it .
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 41]: She had thought it better to prepare him for what she was about to ask of him , therefore mentioned in her note that in a day or two she was going to Yrndale with her brother and his wife .
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 4]: `` Whew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 11]: exclaimed the major when he read it , `` wife !
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 4]: this complicates matters !
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 23]: I was sure he had not gone to the dogs -- no dog but a cur would receive him -- without help !
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 5]: -- Marriage and embezzlement !
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 3]: Poor devil !
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 13]: if he were not such a confounded ape I should pity him !
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 14]: But the small-pox and a wife may perhaps do something for him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 25]: When he reached the house , Hester received him warmly , and at once made her request that he would go down with them .
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 15]: It would be such a relief to her if he would , she said .
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 26]: He expressed entire readiness , but thought she had better not say he was coming , as in the circumstances he could hardly be welcome .
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 25]: They soon made their arrangements , and he left her yet more confirmed in a respect such as he had never till now felt .
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 38]: And this was the major 's share in the good that flowed from Hester 's sufferings : the one most deficient thing in him was reverence , and in this he was now having a strong lesson .
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLVIII .
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 3]: MR. CHRISTOPHER .
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 62]: On the Sunday evening , the last before she was to leave for Yrndale , Hester had gone to see a poor woman in a house she had not been in before , and was walking up the dismal stair , dark and dirty , when she heard a moaning from a room the door of which was a little open .
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 28]: She peeped in , and saw on a low bed a poor woman , old , yellow , and wrinkled , apparently at the point of death .
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 19]: Her throat was bare , and she saw the muscles of it knotted in the struggle for life .
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 10]: -- Is not death the victorious struggle for life ?
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 31]: -- She was not alone ; a man knelt by her bedside , his arm under the pillow to hold her head higher , and his other hand clasping hers .
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 4]: `` The darkness !
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 4]: the darkness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 4]: moaned the woman .
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 6]: `` You feel lonely ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 14]: said the voice of the man , low , and broken with sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 11]: `` All , all alone , '' sighed the woman .
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 8]: `` I can do nothing for you .
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 7]: I can only love you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 11]: `` Yes , yes , '' said the woman hopelessly .
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 22]: `` You are slipping away from me , but my master is stronger than me , and can help you yet .
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 13]: He is not far from you though you ca n't see him .
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 16]: He loves you too , and only wants you to ask him to help you .
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 12]: He can cure death as easy as any other disease . ''
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 7]: No reply came for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 20]: Then , moulded of all-but dying breath , came the cry , `` O Christ , save me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 53]: Then Hester was seized with a sudden impulse : she thought afterwards the feeling of it might be like what men and women of old had when the Spirit of God came upon them : it seemed she had not intended song when the sounds issuing from her mouth entered her ears .
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 32]: The words she uttered were those and no more , over and over again , which the poor dying woman had just spoken : `` O Christ , save me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 27]: But the song-sounds in which they were lapt and with which they came winged from her lips , seemed the veriest outpouring of her whole soul .
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 19]: They seemed to rise from some eternal deep within her , yet not to be of her making .
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 27]: She was as in the immediate presence of Christ , pleading with him for the consolation and strength which his poor dying creature so sorely needed .
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 15]: The holy possession lasted but a minute or so , and left her dumb .
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 10]: She turned away , and passed up the stair .
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 4]: `` The angels !
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 3]: the angels !
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 6]: I 'm going now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 5]: said the woman feebly .
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 15]: `` The angel was praying to Christ for you , '' said Christopher . ''
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 11]: -- Oh living brother , save our dying sister ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6577 len. 8]: `` O Christ , save me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6578 len. 11]: she murmured again , and they were her last words .
Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 10]: Christopher laid the body gently back on the pillow .
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 22]: A sigh of relief passed from his lips , and he went from the room to give notice of the death .
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 17]: The dead or who would might bury the dead ; he must go to the living !
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 12]: Inflated sentiment all this looks to the man of this world .
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 58]: But when the inevitable Death has him by the throat ; when he lies like that poor woman , lonely in the shadow , though his room be crowded with friends , whatever his theories about future or no future , it may be an awful hour in which less than a Christ will hardly comfort him .
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 28]: Hester 's heart was full when she found the woman she went to see , and she was able to speak as she had never spoken before .
Parsing [sent. 6585 len. 87]: She never troubled her poor with any of the theories of salvation , which , right or wrong , are _ not _ the things to be presented for men 's reception -- now any more than in the days of the first teachers who knew nothing of them : they serve but to obscure the vision of the live brother in whom men must believe to be lifted out of their evil and brought into the air of truth and the room for growing deliverance .
Parsing [sent. 6586 len. 43]: Hester spoke of Christ , the friend of men , who came to save every one by giving him back to God , as one gives back to a mother the stray child who has run from her to escape obeying her .
Parsing [sent. 6587 len. 13]: The woman at least listened ; and then she sang to her .
Parsing [sent. 6588 len. 14]: But she could not sing as she had sung a little while before .
Parsing [sent. 6589 len. 56]: One can not have or give the best always -- not at least until the soul shall be always in its highest and best moods -- a condition which may perhaps be on the way to us , though I am doubtful whether the created will ever stand continuously on the apex of conscious existence .
Parsing [sent. 6590 len. 35]: I think part of the joy will be to contemplate the conditions in which we are at our best : I delight to think of twilights in heaven -- the brooding on the best .
Parsing [sent. 6591 len. 34]: Perhaps we may be full of God always and yet not always full of the ecstasy of good , or always able to make it pass in sweet splendours from heart to heart .
Parsing [sent. 6592 len. 32]: Hester was walking homewards when , passing through a court on her way , she heard the voice of a man , which again she recognized as that of Mr. Christopher .
Parsing [sent. 6593 len. 15]: Glancing about her she discovered that it came from a room half under ground .
Parsing [sent. 6594 len. 6]: She went to the door .
Parsing [sent. 6595 len. 59]: There was a little crowd of dirty children making a noise round it , and she could not well hear what was going on , but what she did hear was enough to let her know it was the voice of one pleading with his fellows not to be miserable and die , but to live and rejoice .
Parsing [sent. 6596 len. 48]: Now for all the true liberality of Hester 's heart and brain both , she had never entered any place of worship that did not belong to the established church , thinking all the rest only and altogether sectarian , and she would not be a sectary .
Parsing [sent. 6597 len. 18]: She had not yet learned that therein she just was a sectary -- from Christ the head .
Parsing [sent. 6598 len. 38]: But here was something meant only for the poor , she thought , and seeing they would not go to church , a layman like Mr. Christopher might surely give them of the good things he had !
Parsing [sent. 6599 len. 18]: So she went in : she would sit near the door , and come out again presently !
Parsing [sent. 6600 len. 18]: It was a low room , and though not many were present , the air was stifling .
Parsing [sent. 6601 len. 8]: The doctor stood at the farther end .
Parsing [sent. 6602 len. 51]: Some of his congregation were decently dressed , some but sparingly washed ; many wore the same clothes they wore through the week , though probably most of these had a better gown or suit , if that could be called _ having _ which was represented by a pawn-ticket .
Parsing [sent. 6603 len. 13]: Hester could hardly say she saw among them much sign of listening .
Parsing [sent. 6604 len. 64]: Most of the faces were just as vacant as those to be seen in the most fashionable churches , but there were one or two which seemed to show their owners in some kind of sympathetic relation with the speaker , and that was a far larger proportion than was found in Sodom that was destroyed , or in Nineveh that was spared .
Parsing [sent. 6605 len. 14]: That the speaker was in earnest there could be no manner of question .
Parsing [sent. 6606 len. 50]: His eyes were glowing , his face was gleaming with a light of its own ; his hands were often clenched hard and his motions broken by very earnestness : it was the bearing of one that pleaded with men , saying , `` Why will ye die ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6607 len. 12]: The whole rough appearance of the man was elevated into dignity .
Parsing [sent. 6608 len. 10]: Simplicity and self-forgetfulness were manifest in carriage and utterance .
Parsing [sent. 6609 len. 10]: He was not self-possessed -- but he was God-possessed .
Parsing [sent. 6610 len. 9]: He kept saying the simplest things to them .
Parsing [sent. 6611 len. 57]: One thing she heard him tell them was , that they were like orphan children , hungry in the street , raking the gutter for what they could get , while behind them stood a grand , beautiful house to which they never so much as lifted up their eyes -- and there their father lived !
Parsing [sent. 6612 len. 35]: There he sat in a beautiful room , waiting , waiting , waiting for any one of them all who would but turn round , run in , and up the stairs to him .
Parsing [sent. 6613 len. 37]: `` But you will say , '' something as thus he went on , -- `` Why does he not send out a message to them , to tell them he is waiting there for them ?
Parsing [sent. 6614 len. 8]: How can they know without being told ?
Parsing [sent. 6615 len. 4]: -- you say .
Parsing [sent. 6616 len. 9]: But that is just what he does do .
Parsing [sent. 6617 len. 15]: He is constantly sending out messengers to them to tell them to come in .
Parsing [sent. 6618 len. 10]: But they mostly laugh and make faces at them .
Parsing [sent. 6619 len. 15]: _ They _ wo n't be at the trouble to go up those stairs !
Parsing [sent. 6620 len. 32]: ` It 's not likely , ' they say , ' a man like that would trouble his head about such as us , even if we were his children ! '
Parsing [sent. 6621 len. 12]: That makes me wonder how such people treat their own children !
Parsing [sent. 6622 len. 26]: But some do listen and hear and go in ; and some of them come out again , and say they find it all true .
Parsing [sent. 6623 len. 16]: Very few believe them a bit , or mind in the least what they say .
Parsing [sent. 6624 len. 52]: They are not miserable enough yet to go back to the father that loves them , and would be as good to them as the bird that covers her young ones all over with her wings , or the mother you see wrapping her shawl round her child in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 6625 len. 20]: `` Some of you are thinking with yourselves now , ' _ We _ would n't do like that !
Parsing [sent. 6626 len. 24]: _ We _ should be only too glad to get somebody that would make us comfortable without any trouble on our parts ! '
Parsing [sent. 6627 len. 7]: Ah , there 's the rub !
Parsing [sent. 6628 len. 23]: These children that wo n't go in , they 're just like you : they wo n't take any trouble about it .
Parsing [sent. 6629 len. 14]: Why now here I am , sent to you with the very message !
Parsing [sent. 6630 len. 18]: and you fancy I am only talking , as you do so often , without meaning anything !
Parsing [sent. 6631 len. 23]: I am one of those who have been into the house , and have found my father -- oh , so grand !
Parsing [sent. 6632 len. 6]: and so good to me !
Parsing [sent. 6633 len. 31]: And I am come out again to tell you it is so , and that if you will go in , you will have the same kindness I have had .
Parsing [sent. 6634 len. 24]: All the servants of the house even will rejoice over you with music and dancing -- so glad that you are come home .
Parsing [sent. 6635 len. 12]: Is it possible you will not take the trouble to go !
Parsing [sent. 6636 len. 28]: There are certain things required of you when you go : perhaps you are too lazy or too dirty in your habits , to like doing them !
Parsing [sent. 6637 len. 31]: I have known some refuse to scrape their shoes , or rub them on the door-mat when they went in , and then complain loudly that they were refused admittance .
Parsing [sent. 6638 len. 22]: A fine house would such make to their father , were they allowed to run in and out as they pleased !
Parsing [sent. 6639 len. 19]: such a house , in fact , as would very soon drive their father himself out of it !
Parsing [sent. 6640 len. 14]: for they would make it unfit for any decent person to live in .
Parsing [sent. 6641 len. 25]: A few months and they would have the grand beautiful house as wretched and mean and dirty as the houses they live in now .
Parsing [sent. 6642 len. 13]: Such persons are those that keep grumbling that they are not rich .
Parsing [sent. 6643 len. 23]: They want to loaf about , and drink , and be a nuisance to everybody , like some of the rich ones .
Parsing [sent. 6644 len. 41]: They think it hard they should not be able to do just as they please with everything that takes their fancy , when they would do nothing but break and spoil it , and make it no good to anybody .
Parsing [sent. 6645 len. 25]: Their father , who can do whatever he sees fit , is not one to let such disagreeable children work what mischief they like !
Parsing [sent. 6646 len. 11]: He is a better father than that would come to !
Parsing [sent. 6647 len. 24]: A father who lets them be dirty and rude just as they like , is one of the worst enemies of his children .
Parsing [sent. 6648 len. 49]: And the day is coming when , if he ca n't get them to mind him any other way , he will put them where they will be ten times more miserable than ever they were at the worst time of their lives , and make them mind .
Parsing [sent. 6649 len. 31]: Out of the same door whence came the messengers to ask them in , he will send dogs and bears and lions and tigers and wild cats out upon them .
Parsing [sent. 6650 len. 46]: `` You will , I daresay , some of you , say , ` Ah , we know what you mean ; but you see that 's not the sort of thing we care for , so you need n't go on about it . '
Parsing [sent. 6651 len. 27]: I know it is not the sort of thing you care for , else you might have been in a very different condition by this time .
Parsing [sent. 6652 len. 50]: And I know the kind of thing you do care for -- low , dirty things : you are like a child , if such there could be , that preferred mud and the gutter to all the beautiful toys in the shop at the corner of Middle Row .
Parsing [sent. 6653 len. 32]: But though these things are not the things you want , they are the things you need ; and the time is coming when you will say , ` Ah me !
Parsing [sent. 6654 len. 35]: what a fool I was not to look at the precious things , and see how precious they were , and put out my hand for them when they were offered me ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6655 len. 37]: It was something in this simple way , but more earnestly yet , and occasionally with an energy that rose to eloquence , that the man freed his soul of the things he had to give .
Parsing [sent. 6656 len. 19]: After about twenty minutes , he ceased , saying , `` We will now sing a hymn . ''
Parsing [sent. 6657 len. 25]: Then he read a short hymn , repeating each verse before they sang it , for there was no other hymn-book than his own .
Parsing [sent. 6658 len. 14]: It was the simplest hymn , Hester thought , she had ever heard .
Parsing [sent. 6659 len. 41]: He began the singing himself to a well-known tune , but when he heard the voice of Hester take it up , he left the leading to her , and betaking himself to the bass , did his part there .
Parsing [sent. 6660 len. 24]: When they heard her voice the people all turned to look , and some began to whisper , but presently resumed the hymn .
Parsing [sent. 6661 len. 21]: When it was ended , he prayed for two or three minutes , not more , and sent them away .
Parsing [sent. 6662 len. 34]: Hester being near the door went out with the first of them , and walked home full of pleasure in the thought of such preaching : if only her friends could hear such !
Parsing [sent. 6663 len. 19]: The great difficulty was to wake in them any vaguest recognition of a Nature from whom they came .
Parsing [sent. 6664 len. 45]: She had been driven to conclude that the faculty for things _ epouranian _ was awake in them not an atom more than in the South-African Bushman , in whom most travellers have failed to discover even the notion of a power above him .
Parsing [sent. 6665 len. 21]: But to wake the faculty in them what could be so powerful as the story and the message of Jesus ?
Parsing [sent. 6666 len. 10]: -- and Mr. Christopher had not spoken of him !
Parsing [sent. 6667 len. 35]: She did not know that every Sunday he taught them there , and that this sermon , if such it could be called , was but one wave in the flow of a river .
Parsing [sent. 6668 len. 37]: The true teacher brings from his treasure things old and things new ; at one time tells , at another explains ; and ever and anon lets his own well of water flow to everlasting life .
Parsing [sent. 6669 len. 34]: But as she thought , Hester , like the true soul she was , turned from ways and means to the questioning of herself : what of the faculty was awake in her ?
Parsing [sent. 6670 len. 19]: Had she been obedient only to that she had been taught , or obedient to the very God ?
Parsing [sent. 6671 len. 20]: This questioning again she left for better labour : she turned her whole soul towards God in prayer unutterable .
Parsing [sent. 6672 len. 24]: Of one thing she could be sure -- that she had but the faintest knowledge of him whom to know is life eternal .
Parsing [sent. 6673 len. 27]: She was near the turning that led to the square when she heard a quick footstep behind her , and was presently overtaken by Mr. Christopher .
Parsing [sent. 6674 len. 12]: `` I was so glad to see you come in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6675 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 6676 len. 22]: `` I was able to speak the better , for I was sure then of some sympathy in the spiritual air .
Parsing [sent. 6677 len. 50]: It is not easy to go on when you feel all the time a doubt whether to one present your words are more than mere words ; or , if they have some meaning to any , whether that meaning be not something very different from your meaning . ''
Parsing [sent. 6678 len. 28]: `` I do not see , '' said Hester , `` how any one could misunderstand , or indeed help understanding what I heard you say . ''
Parsing [sent. 6679 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6680 len. 11]: he returned , `` the one incomprehensible thing is ignorance !
Parsing [sent. 6681 len. 16]: To understand why another does not understand seems to me beyond the power of humanity .
Parsing [sent. 6682 len. 28]: As God only can understand evil , while we only can be evil , so God only can understand ignorance , while we only can be ignorant .
Parsing [sent. 6683 len. 34]: I have been trying now for a good many months to teach those people , and I am not sure that a single thought has passed from my mind into one of theirs .
Parsing [sent. 6684 len. 10]: I sometimes think I am but beating the air .
Parsing [sent. 6685 len. 20]: But I must tell you how your singing comforted the poor woman at whose door you stopped this afternoon !
Parsing [sent. 6686 len. 7]: I saw it in her face .
Parsing [sent. 6687 len. 7]: She thought it was the angels .
Parsing [sent. 6688 len. 13]: And it was one angel , for did not God send you ?
Parsing [sent. 6689 len. 18]: I trust your fellow-servants were waiting for her : she died a minute or two after . ''
Parsing [sent. 6690 len. 9]: They walked some distance before either spoke again .
Parsing [sent. 6691 len. 28]: `` I was surprised , '' said Hester at length , `` to find you taking the clergyman 's part as well as the doctor 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 6692 len. 17]: `` By no means , '' returned Christopher ; `` I took no clergyman 's part .
Parsing [sent. 6693 len. 17]: I took but the part of a human being , bound to share with his fellow .
Parsing [sent. 6694 len. 7]: What could make you think so ?
Parsing [sent. 6695 len. 7]: Did I preach like one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6696 len. 8]: `` Not very , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 6697 len. 28]: `` I am glad of that , '' he returned , `` for such a likeness would by no means favour my usefulness with such as those .
Parsing [sent. 6698 len. 33]: If you see any reason why a layman , as was our Lord , should not speak to his fellows , I fear it is one I should be unable to comprehend .
Parsing [sent. 6699 len. 22]: I do whatever seems to me a desirable action , so long as I see no reason for not doing it .
Parsing [sent. 6700 len. 31]: As to the customs of society , my experience of them has resulted in mere and simple contempt -- in so far at least as they would hamper my freedom .
Parsing [sent. 6701 len. 17]: I have another master ; and they who obey higher rules need not regard lower judgment .
Parsing [sent. 6702 len. 15]: If Shakspere liked my acting , should I care if Marlowe did not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6703 len. 28]: `` But if anybody and everybody be at liberty to preach , how are we to have any assurance what kind of doctrine will be preached ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6704 len. 7]: `` We must go without it .
Parsing [sent. 6705 len. 26]: -- But it is too late to object , for here are a few of us laymen preaching , and no one to hinder us .
Parsing [sent. 6706 len. 15]: There are many uneducated preachers who move the classes the clergy can not touch .
Parsing [sent. 6707 len. 16]: Their preaching has a far more evident effect , I know , than mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 6708 len. 11]: `` Why do you not then preach like them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6709 len. 28]: `` I would not if I could , and could not if I would : I do not believe one half of the things they say . ''
Parsing [sent. 6710 len. 16]: `` How can they do more good if what they say is not true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6711 len. 24]: `` I did not say they did more good -- about that I can not tell ; that may need centuries to determine .
Parsing [sent. 6712 len. 8]: I said they moved their people more .
Parsing [sent. 6713 len. 26]: And the fundamental element of what they say is most true , only the forms they express it in contain much that is false . ''
Parsing [sent. 6714 len. 16]: `` Will you then defend a man in speaking things that are not true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6715 len. 16]: `` If he believes them , what is he to do but speak them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6716 len. 9]: Let him speak them in God 's name .
Parsing [sent. 6717 len. 12]: I can not speak them because I do not believe them .
Parsing [sent. 6718 len. 16]: If I did believe them they would take from me the heart to preach . ''
Parsing [sent. 6719 len. 24]: `` Can it be , '' said Hester , `` that falsehood is more powerful than truth -- and for truth too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6720 len. 5]: `` By no means .
Parsing [sent. 6721 len. 11]: A falsehood has in itself no power but for evil .
Parsing [sent. 6722 len. 15]: It is the spiritual truth clothed in the partially false form that is powerful .
Parsing [sent. 6723 len. 44]: Clearer truth will follow in the wake of it , and cast the false forms out : they serve but to make a place of seeming understanding in ignorant minds , wherein the truths themselves may lie and work with their own might .
Parsing [sent. 6724 len. 27]: But if what I teach be nearer the truth , let it be harder to get in , it will in the end work more truth .
Parsing [sent. 6725 len. 17]: In the meantime I say God-speed to every man who honestly teaches what he honestly believes .
Parsing [sent. 6726 len. 22]: Paul was grand when he said he would rejoice that Christ was preached , from whatever motive he might be preached .
Parsing [sent. 6727 len. 34]: If you say those people , though contentious , may have preached good doctrine , I answer -- Possibly ; for they could not have preached much of what is called doctrine now-a-days .
Parsing [sent. 6728 len. 33]: If they preached theories of their own , they were teachers of lies , for they were not true men , and the theories of an untrue man can not be true .
Parsing [sent. 6729 len. 15]: But they told something about Christ , and of that Paul was glad . ''
Parsing [sent. 6730 len. 57]: Some may wonder that Hester , having got so far as she had , should need to be told such things ; but she had never had occasion to think about them before , though the truth wrought out in her life had rendered her capable of seeing them the moment they were put before her .
Parsing [sent. 6731 len. 11]: `` You interest me much , '' she said . ''
Parsing [sent. 6732 len. 30]: -- Would you mind telling me how you , whose profession has to do with the bodies of men , have come to do more for their souls ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6733 len. 14]: `` I know nothing about less or more , '' answered Christopher . ''
Parsing [sent. 6734 len. 22]: -- You would find it , I fear , a long story if I were to attempt telling it in full .
Parsing [sent. 6735 len. 27]: I studied medicine from guile , not therefore the less carefully , that I might have a good ostensible reason for going about among the poor .
Parsing [sent. 6736 len. 41]: I count myself bound to do all I can for their bodies ; and pity itself would , I think , when I came to go among them , have driven me to the study , had I been ignorant .
Parsing [sent. 6737 len. 31]: No one who has not been among them knows their sufferings -- borne by some of them without complaint -- for the sad reason that it is of no use .
Parsing [sent. 6738 len. 28]: To be to such if only one to whom they can speak , is in some sort to mediate between them and a possible world of relief .
Parsing [sent. 6739 len. 37]: But it was not primarily from the desire to alleviate their sufferings that I learned what I could of medicine , but in the hope to start them on the way towards victory over all evil .
Parsing [sent. 6740 len. 44]: I saw that the man who brought them physical help had a chance with them such as no clergyman had -- an advantage quite as needful with them as with the heathen -- to whom we are not so _ immediately _ debtors .
Parsing [sent. 6741 len. 28]: It would have been a sad thing for the world if the Lord of it had not sought first the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
Parsing [sent. 6742 len. 47]: One awful consequence of our making haste to pull out the mote out of our heathen brother 's eye , while yet the beam is in our own , is that wherever our missionaries go , they are followed by a foul wave of our vices .
Parsing [sent. 6743 len. 11]: `` With all my guile I have not done much .
Parsing [sent. 6744 len. 98]: But now after nearly two thousand years , such is the amount of faith I find in myself towards my Lord and his Father , that sometimes I ask myself whether in very truth I believe that that man did live and die as the story says : if it has taken all this time for such a poor result , I say to myself , perhaps I may have done something , for it must be too small to be seen ; so I will try on , helping God as the children help the father .
Parsing [sent. 6745 len. 23]: -- You know that grand picture , on the ceiling of the pope 's chapel , of the making of Adam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6746 len. 5]: `` Michael Angelo 's ?
Parsing [sent. 6747 len. 4]: -- Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 6748 len. 30]: `` You must have noticed then how the Father is accompanied by a crowd of young ones -- come to help him to make Adam , I always think .
Parsing [sent. 6749 len. 58]: The poet has there , consciously or not , hit upon a great truth : it is the majesty of God 's great-heartedness , and the majesty of man 's destiny , that every man must be a fellow-worker with God , nor can ever in less attain his end , and the conscious satisfaction of being .
Parsing [sent. 6750 len. 11]: I want to help God with my poor brothers . ''
Parsing [sent. 6751 len. 8]: `` How well I understand you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6752 len. 3]: said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 6753 len. 16]: `` But would you mind telling me what made you think of the thing first ?
Parsing [sent. 6754 len. 27]: I began because I saw how miserable so many people were , and longed to do something to make life a better thing for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 6755 len. 14]: `` That was not quite the way with me , '' replied Christopher .
Parsing [sent. 6756 len. 21]: `` I see I must tell you something of my external , in order to explain my internal history . ''
Parsing [sent. 6757 len. 8]: `` No , no , pray ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6758 len. 8]: returned Hester , fearing she had presumed .
Parsing [sent. 6759 len. 9]: `` I did not mean to be inquisitive .
Parsing [sent. 6760 len. 26]: I ought not to have asked such a question ; for these things have to do with the most sacred regions of our nature . ''
Parsing [sent. 6761 len. 27]: `` I was only going to cast the less in with the greater -- the outer fact to explain the inner truth , '' said Christopher .
Parsing [sent. 6762 len. 10]: `` I should like to tell you about it .
Parsing [sent. 6763 len. 23]: -- And first , -- you may suppose I could not have followed my wishes had I not had some money ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6764 len. 10]: `` A good thing you had , then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6765 len. 16]: `` I do n't know exactly , '' replied the doctor in a dubious tone .
Parsing [sent. 6766 len. 10]: `` You shall judge for yourself from my story .
Parsing [sent. 6767 len. 17]: -- I had money then -- a good deal too -- left me by my grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 6768 len. 9]: My father died when I was a child .
Parsing [sent. 6769 len. 7]: I am glad to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 6770 len. 6]: `` Glad to say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6771 len. 4]: repeated Hester bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 6772 len. 22]: `` Yes : if he had lived , how do I know he might not have done just like my grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 6773 len. 8]: But my mother lived , thank God .
Parsing [sent. 6774 len. 49]: -- Not that my grandfather was what is counted a bad man ; on the contrary he stood high in the world 's opinion -- was considered indeed the prince of -- well , I will not say what , for my business is not to expose him .
Parsing [sent. 6775 len. 7]: The world had nothing against him .
Parsing [sent. 6776 len. 48]: `` When he died and left me his money -- I was then at school , preparing for Oxford -- it was necessary that I should look into the affairs of the business , for it was my mother 's wish that I should follow the same .
Parsing [sent. 6777 len. 54]: In the course of my investigation , I came across things not a few in the books , all fair and square in the judgment of the trade itself , which made me doubtful , and which at last , unblinded by custom , I was confident were unfair , that is dishonest .
Parsing [sent. 6778 len. 14]: Thereupon I began to argue with myself : ` What is here ? '
Parsing [sent. 6779 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 6780 len. 17]: ` Am I to use the wages of iniquity as if they were a clean God-gift ?
Parsing [sent. 6781 len. 13]: If there has been wrong done there must be atonement , reparation .
Parsing [sent. 6782 len. 31]: I can not look on this money as mine , for part of it at least , I can not say how much , ought not to be mine . '
Parsing [sent. 6783 len. 27]: The truth flashed upon me ; I saw that my business in life must be to send the money out again into the channels of right .
Parsing [sent. 6784 len. 11]: I could claim a workman 's wages for doing that .
Parsing [sent. 6785 len. 44]: The history of the business went so far back that it was impossible to make return of more than a small proportion of the sums rightly due ; therefore something else , and that a large something , must be done as well .
Parsing [sent. 6786 len. 66]: `` To be honest , however , in explaining how I came to choose the life I am now leading , I must here confess the fact that about this time I had a disappointment of a certain kind which set me thinking , for it gave me such a shock that for some months I could not imagine anything to make life worth living .
Parsing [sent. 6787 len. 37]: Some day , if you like , I will give you a detailed account of how I came to the truth of the question -- came to see what alone does make the value of life .
Parsing [sent. 6788 len. 80]: A flash came first , then a darkness , then a long dawn ; by and in which it grew clearer and ever clearer , that there could be no real good , in the very nature of things and of good , but oneness with the will of God ; that man 's good lay in becoming what the inventor of him meant in the inventing of him -- to speak after the fashion of man 's making .
Parsing [sent. 6789 len. 64]: Going on thinking about it all , and reading my New Testament , I came to see that , if the story of Christ was true , the God that made me was just inconceivably lovely , and that the perfection , the very flower of existence , must be to live the heir of all things , at home with the Father .
Parsing [sent. 6790 len. 56]: Next , mingled inextricably with my resolve about the money , came the perception that my fellow-beings , my brothers and sisters of the same father , must be , next to the father himself , the very atmosphere of life ; and that perfect misery must be to care only for one 's self .
Parsing [sent. 6791 len. 98]: With that there woke in me such a love and pity for my people , my own race , my human beings , my brothers and sisters , whoever could hear the word of the father of men , that I felt the only thing worth giving the energy of a life to , was the work that Christ gave himself to -- the delivery of men out of their lonely and mean devotion to themselves , into the glorious liberty of the sons of God , whose joy and rejoicing is the rest of the family .
Parsing [sent. 6792 len. 19]: Then I saw that here the claim upon my honesty , and the highest calling of man met .
Parsing [sent. 6793 len. 51]: I saw that were I as free to do with my grandfather 's money as it was possible for man to be , I could in no other way use it altogether worthily than in aiding to give outcome , shape and operation to the sonship and brotherhood in me .
Parsing [sent. 6794 len. 54]: I have not yet found how best to use it all ; and I will do nothing in haste , which is the very opposite of divine , and sure to lead astray ; but I keep thinking in order to find out , and it will one day be revealed to me .
Parsing [sent. 6795 len. 25]: God who has laid the burden on me will enable me to bear it until he shows me how to unpack and disperse it .
Parsing [sent. 6796 len. 18]: `` First , I spent a portion in further study , and especially the study of medicine .
Parsing [sent. 6797 len. 39]: I could not work miracles ; I had not the faith necessary to that , if such is now to be had ; but God might be pleased I should heal a little by the doctor 's art .
Parsing [sent. 6798 len. 65]: So doing I should do yet better , and learn how , to spend the money upon humanity itself , repaying to the race what had been wrongfully taken from its individuals to whom it was impossible to restore it ; and should while so doing at the same time fill up what was left behind for me of the labours of the Master .
Parsing [sent. 6799 len. 6]: `` That is my story .
Parsing [sent. 6800 len. 33]: I am now trying to do as I have seen , working steadily , without haste , with much discouragement , and now and then with a great gladness and auroral hope .
Parsing [sent. 6801 len. 19]: I have this very day got a new idea that may have in it a true germ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6802 len. 11]: `` Will you not tell me what it is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6803 len. 3]: said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 6804 len. 19]: `` I do n't like talking about things before at least they are begun , '' answered Christopher .
Parsing [sent. 6805 len. 10]: `` And I have not much hope from money .
Parsing [sent. 6806 len. 35]: If it were not that I have it and can not help it , and am bound to spend it , I would not trouble myself about any scheme to which it was necessary .
Parsing [sent. 6807 len. 20]: I sometimes feel as if it was a devil , restrained a little by being spell-bound in mental discs .
Parsing [sent. 6808 len. 36]: I know the feeling is wrong and faithless ; for money is God 's as certainly as the earth in which the crops grow , though he does not care so much about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6809 len. 13]: `` I know what I would do if I had money ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6810 len. 3]: said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 6811 len. 25]: `` You have given me the right to ask what -- the right to ask -- not the right to have an answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 6812 len. 29]: `` I would have a house of refuge to which any one might run for covert or rest or warmth or food or medicine or whatever he needed .
Parsing [sent. 6813 len. 31]: It should have no society or subscriptions or committee , but should be my own as my hands and my voice are mine -- to use as God enabled me .
Parsing [sent. 6814 len. 17]: I would have it like the porch -- not of Bethesda , but of heaven itself .
Parsing [sent. 6815 len. 12]: It should come into use by the growth of my friendships .
Parsing [sent. 6816 len. 28]: It should be a refuge for the needy , from the artisan out of work to the child with a cut finger , or cold bitten feet .
Parsing [sent. 6817 len. 17]: I would take in the weary-brained prophet , the worn curate , or the shadowy needle-woman .
Parsing [sent. 6818 len. 20]: I would not take in drunkards or ruined speculators -- not at least before they were very miserable indeed .
Parsing [sent. 6819 len. 29]: The suffering of such is the only desirable consequence of their doing , and to save from it would be to take from them their last chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 6820 len. 11]: `` It is a lovely idea , '' said Christopher .
Parsing [sent. 6821 len. 24]: `` One of my hopes is to build a small hospital for children in some lovely place , near some sad ugly one .
Parsing [sent. 6822 len. 35]: But perhaps I can not do it till I am old , for when I do , I must live among them and have them and their nurses within a moment 's reach . ''
Parsing [sent. 6823 len. 17]: `` Is it not delightful to know that you can start anything when you please ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6824 len. 26]: `` Anybody with leisure can do that who is willing to begin where everything ought to be begun -- that is , at the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 6825 len. 13]: Nothing worth calling good can or ever will be started full grown .
Parsing [sent. 6826 len. 29]: The essential of any good is life , and the very body of created life , and essential to it , being its self operant , is growth .
Parsing [sent. 6827 len. 17]: The larger start you make , the less room you leave for life to extend itself .
Parsing [sent. 6828 len. 32]: You fill with the dead matter of your construction the places where assimilation ought to have its perfect work , building by a life-process , self-extending , and subserving the whole .
Parsing [sent. 6829 len. 28]: Small beginnings with slow growings have time to root themselves thoroughly -- I do not mean in place nor yet in social regard , but in wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 6830 len. 23]: Such even prosper by failures , for their failures are not too great to be rectified without injury to the original idea .
Parsing [sent. 6831 len. 16]: God 's beginnings are imperceptible , whether in the region of soul or of matter .
Parsing [sent. 6832 len. 23]: Besides , I believe in no good done save in person -- by personal operative presence of soul , body and spirit .
Parsing [sent. 6833 len. 30]: God is the one only person , and it is our personality alone , so far as we have any , that can work with God 's perfect personality .
Parsing [sent. 6834 len. 22]: God can use us as tools , but to be a tool of , is not to be a fellow-worker with .
Parsing [sent. 6835 len. 17]: How the devil would have laughed at the idea of a society for saving the world !
Parsing [sent. 6836 len. 54]: But when he saw _ one _ take it in hand , one who was in no haste even to do that , one who would only do the will of God with all his heart and soul , and cared for nothing else , then indeed he might tremble for his kingdom !
Parsing [sent. 6837 len. 32]: It is the individual Christians forming the church by their obedient individuality , that have done all the good done since men for the love of Christ began to gather together .
Parsing [sent. 6838 len. 12]: It is individual ardour alone that can combine into larger flame .
Parsing [sent. 6839 len. 12]: There is no true power but that which has individual roots .
Parsing [sent. 6840 len. 12]: Neither custom nor habit nor law nor foundation is a root .
Parsing [sent. 6841 len. 27]: The real roots are individual conscience that hates evil , individual faith that loves and obeys God , individual heart with its kiss of charity . ''
Parsing [sent. 6842 len. 22]: `` I think I understand you ; I am sure I do in part , at least , '' said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 6843 len. 23]: They had , almost unconsciously , walked , twice round the square , and had now the third time reached the house .
Parsing [sent. 6844 len. 32]: He went in with her and saw his patient , then took his leave to go home to his Greek Testament -- for the remainder of the evening if he might .
Parsing [sent. 6845 len. 19]: Except when some particular case required attention , he never went on-trying to teach with his soul weary .
Parsing [sent. 6846 len. 14]: He would carry material aid or social comfort , but would not teach .
Parsing [sent. 6847 len. 22]: His soul must be shining -- with faith or hope or love or repentance or compassion , when he unveiled it .
Parsing [sent. 6848 len. 43]: `` No man , '' he would say , `` will be lost because I do not this or that ; but if I do the unfitting thing , I may block his way for him , and retard his redemption . ''
Parsing [sent. 6849 len. 28]: He would not presume beyond what was given him -- as if God were letting things go wrong , and he must come in to prevent them !
Parsing [sent. 6850 len. 17]: He would not set blunted or ill tempered tools to the finest work of the universe !
Parsing [sent. 6851 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLIX .
Parsing [sent. 6852 len. 3]: AN ARRANGEMENT .
Parsing [sent. 6853 len. 14]: Hester had not yet gone to see Miss Dasomma because of the small-pox .
Parsing [sent. 6854 len. 22]: Second causes are God 's as much as first , and Christ made use of them as his father 's way .
Parsing [sent. 6855 len. 19]: It were a sad world indeed if God 's presence were only interference , that is , miracle .
Parsing [sent. 6856 len. 37]: The roundabout common ways of things are just as much his as the straight , miraculous ones -- I incline to think more his , in the sense that they are plainly the ways he prefers .
Parsing [sent. 6857 len. 30]: In all things that are , he is -- present even in the evil we bring into the world , to foil it and bring good out of it .
Parsing [sent. 6858 len. 20]: We are always disbelieving in him because things do not go as we intend and desire them to go .
Parsing [sent. 6859 len. 25]: We forget that God has larger ends , even for us , than we can see , so his plans do not fit ours .
Parsing [sent. 6860 len. 43]: If God were not only to hear our prayers , as he does ever and always , but to answer them as we want them answered , he would not be God our Saviour , but the ministering genius of our destruction .
Parsing [sent. 6861 len. 10]: But now Hester thought she might visit her friend .
Parsing [sent. 6862 len. 12]: She had much to say to her and ask of her .
Parsing [sent. 6863 len. 10]: First she told her of herself and lord Gartley .
Parsing [sent. 6864 len. 16]: Miss Dasomma threw her arms about her , and broke into a flood of congratulation .
Parsing [sent. 6865 len. 19]: Hester looked a little surprised , and was indeed a little annoyed at the vehemence of her pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 6866 len. 7]: Miss Dasomma hastened to excuse herself .
Parsing [sent. 6867 len. 58]: `` My dear , '' she said , `` the more I saw of that man , the more I thought and the more I heard about him , his ways , and his surroundings , the more I marvelled you should ever have taken him for other than the most wordly , shallow , stunted creature .
Parsing [sent. 6868 len. 27]: It was the very impossibility of your understanding the mode of being of such a man that made it possible for him to gain on you .
Parsing [sent. 6869 len. 34]: Believe me , if you had married him , you would have been sick of him -- forgive the vulgar phrase -- yes , and hopeless of him , in six weeks . ''
Parsing [sent. 6870 len. 40]: `` There was more and better in him than you imagine , '' returned Hester , hurt that her friend should think so badly of the man she loved , but by no means sure that she was wrong .
Parsing [sent. 6871 len. 32]: `` That may be , '' answered her friend ; `` but I am certain also that if you had married him , you would have done him no good . ''
Parsing [sent. 6872 len. 10]: Then Hester went on with her tale of trouble .
Parsing [sent. 6873 len. 23]: Her brother Cornelius had been behaving very badly , she said , and had married a young woman without letting them know .
Parsing [sent. 6874 len. 22]: Her father and mother were unaware of the fact as yet , and she dreaded having to communicate it to them .
Parsing [sent. 6875 len. 37]: He had been very ill with the small-pox , and she must take him home ; but what to do with his wife until she had broken the matter to them , she did not know .
Parsing [sent. 6876 len. 37]: She knew her father would be very angry , and until he should have got over it a little she dared not have her home : in a word she was at her wits ' end .
Parsing [sent. 6877 len. 23]: `` One question , excuse me if I ask , '' said Miss Dasomma : '' _ are _ they married ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6878 len. 16]: `` I am not sure ; but I am sure she believes they are . ''
Parsing [sent. 6879 len. 10]: Then she told her what she knew of Amy .
Parsing [sent. 6880 len. 6]: Miss Dasomma fell a thinking .
Parsing [sent. 6881 len. 7]: `` Could I see her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6882 len. 5]: she said at length .
Parsing [sent. 6883 len. 20]: `` Surely ; any time , '' replied Hester , `` now that Corney is so much better . ''
Parsing [sent. 6884 len. 21]: Miss Dasomma called , and was so charmed with Amy that she proposed to Hester she should stay with her .
Parsing [sent. 6885 len. 13]: This was just what Hester wished but had not dared to propose .
Parsing [sent. 6886 len. 41]: Now came the painful necessity not only of breaking to the young wife that she must be parted from her husband for a while , but -- which was much worse -- of therein revealing that he had deceived her .
Parsing [sent. 6887 len. 34]: Had Cornelius not been ill and helpless , and characterless , he would probably have refused to go home ; but he did not venture a word of opposition to Hester 's determination .
Parsing [sent. 6888 len. 27]: He knew she had not told Amy anything , but saw that , if he refused , she might judge it necessary to tell her all .
Parsing [sent. 6889 len. 18]: And notwithstanding his idiotic pretence of superiority , he had a kind of thorough confidence in Hester .
Parsing [sent. 6890 len. 62]: In his sickness something of the old childish feeling about her as a refuge from evil had returned upon him , and he was now nearly ready to do and allow whatever she pleased , trusting to her to get him out of the scrape he was in : she could do more than any one else , he was sure !
Parsing [sent. 6891 len. 40]: `` But now tell me , on your word of honour , '' she said to him that same night , happening to find herself alone with him , `` are you really and truly married to Amy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6892 len. 11]: She was delighted to see him blaze up in anger .
Parsing [sent. 6893 len. 9]: `` Hester , you insult us both ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6894 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 6895 len. 24]: `` No , Cornelius , '' returned Hester , `` I have a right to distrust you -- but I distrust only you .
Parsing [sent. 6896 len. 21]: Whatever may be amiss in the affair , I am certain you alone are to blame -- not Amy . ''
Parsing [sent. 6897 len. 22]: Thereupon Cornelius swore a solemn oath that Amy was as much his lawful wife as he knew how to make her .
Parsing [sent. 6898 len. 14]: `` Then what is to be done with her when you go home ?
Parsing [sent. 6899 len. 9]: You can not expect she will be welcomed .
Parsing [sent. 6900 len. 15]: I have not dared tell them of your marriage -- only of your illness .
Parsing [sent. 6901 len. 10]: The other must be by word of mouth . ''
Parsing [sent. 6902 len. 13]: `` I do n't know what 's to be done with her .
Parsing [sent. 6903 len. 8]: How should _ I _ know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6904 len. 10]: answered Cornelius with a return of his old manner .
Parsing [sent. 6905 len. 11]: `` I thought you would manage it all for me !
Parsing [sent. 6906 len. 25]: This cursed illness -- '' `` Cornelius , '' said Hester , `` this illness is the greatest kindness God could show you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6907 len. 10]: `` Well , we wo n't argue about that !
Parsing [sent. 6908 len. 13]: -- Sis , you must get me out of the scrape ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6909 len. 15]: Hester 's heart swelled with delight at the sound of the old loving nursery-word .
Parsing [sent. 6910 len. 8]: She turned to him and kissed him .
Parsing [sent. 6911 len. 15]: `` I will do what I honestly can , Cornelius , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 6912 len. 5]: `` All right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6913 len. 3]: replied Corney .
Parsing [sent. 6914 len. 9]: `` What do you mean to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6915 len. 9]: `` Not to take Amy down with us .
Parsing [sent. 6916 len. 9]: She must wait till I have told . ''
Parsing [sent. 6917 len. 13]: `` Then my wife is to be received only on sufferance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6918 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 6919 len. 11]: `` You can hardly expect to be otherwise received yourself .
Parsing [sent. 6920 len. 22]: You have put your wife at no end of disadvantage by making her your wife without the knowledge of your family .
Parsing [sent. 6921 len. 36]: For yourself , when a man has taken money not his own ; when he has torn the hearts of father and mother with anguish such as neither ever knew before -- ah , Corney !
Parsing [sent. 6922 len. 25]: if you had seen them as I saw them , you would not now wonder that I tremble at the thought of your meeting .
Parsing [sent. 6923 len. 25]: If you have any love for poor Amy , you will not dream of exposing her to the first outbreak of a shocked judgment .
Parsing [sent. 6924 len. 22]: I can not be sure what my mother might think , but my father would take her for your evil genius !
Parsing [sent. 6925 len. 11]: It is possible he may refuse to see yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6926 len. 7]: `` Then I 'm not going .
Parsing [sent. 6927 len. 7]: Better stay here and starve ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6928 len. 15]: `` If so , I must at once tell Amy what you have done .
Parsing [sent. 6929 len. 19]: I will not have the parents on whom you have brought disgrace and misery supposed guilty of cruelty .
Parsing [sent. 6930 len. 21]: Amy must know all about it some day , but it ought to come from yourself -- not from me .
Parsing [sent. 6931 len. 19]: You will never be fit for honest company till for very misery you have told your wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 6932 len. 38]: Hester thought she must not let him fancy things were going back into the old grooves -- that his crime would become a thing of no consequence , and pass out of existence , ignored and forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 6933 len. 8]: Evil can not be destroyed without repentance .
Parsing [sent. 6934 len. 11]: He was silent as one who had nothing to answer .
Parsing [sent. 6935 len. 26]: `` So now , '' said Hester , `` will you , or must I , tell Amy that she can not go home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6936 len. 6]: He thought for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 6937 len. 8]: `` I will , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6938 len. 9]: Hester left him and sent Amy to him .
Parsing [sent. 6939 len. 7]: In a few minutes she returned .
Parsing [sent. 6940 len. 16]: She had wept , but was now , though looking very sad , quite self-possessed .
Parsing [sent. 6941 len. 14]: `` Please , miss , '' she said -- but Hester interrupted her .
Parsing [sent. 6942 len. 16]: `` You must not call me _ miss _ , Amy , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 6943 len. 9]: `` You must call me _ Hester _ .
Parsing [sent. 6944 len. 7]: Am I not your sister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6945 len. 18]: A gleam of joy shot from the girl 's eyes , like the sun through red clouds .
Parsing [sent. 6946 len. 8]: `` Then you have forgiven me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6947 len. 8]: she cried , and burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 6948 len. 8]: `` No , Amy , not that !
Parsing [sent. 6949 len. 11]: I should have had to know something to forgive first .
Parsing [sent. 6950 len. 21]: You may have been foolish ; everybody ca n't always be wise , though everybody must try to do right .
Parsing [sent. 6951 len. 30]: But now we must have time to set things straighter , without doing more mischief , and you must n't mind staying a little while with Miss Dasomma . ''
Parsing [sent. 6952 len. 13]: `` Does she know all about it , miss -- Hester ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6953 len. 21]: asked Amy ; and as she called her new sister by her name , the blood rushed over her face .
Parsing [sent. 6954 len. 14]: `` She knows enough not to think unfairly of you , Amy . ''
Parsing [sent. 6955 len. 24]: `` And you wo n't be hard upon him when he has n't me to comfort him -- will you , Hester ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6956 len. 16]: `` I will think of my new sister who loves him , '' replied Hester .
Parsing [sent. 6957 len. 13]: `` But you must not think I do not love him too .
Parsing [sent. 6958 len. 5]: And oh , Amy !
Parsing [sent. 6959 len. 8]: you must be very careful over him .
Parsing [sent. 6960 len. 10]: No one can do with him what you can .
Parsing [sent. 6961 len. 31]: You must help him to be good , for that is the chief duty of every one towards a neighbour , and particularly of a wife towards a husband . ''
Parsing [sent. 6962 len. 24]: Amy was crying afresh , and made no answer ; but there was not the most shadowy token of resentment in her weeping .
Parsing [sent. 6963 len. 6]: CHAPTER L. THINGS AT HOME .
Parsing [sent. 6964 len. 12]: In the meantime things had been going very gloomily at Yrndale .
Parsing [sent. 6965 len. 11]: Mrs. Raymount was better in health but hardly more cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 6966 len. 5]: How could she be ?
Parsing [sent. 6967 len. 11]: how get over the sadness that her boy was such ?
Parsing [sent. 6968 len. 21]: But the thing that most oppressed her was to see the heart of his father so turned from the youth .
Parsing [sent. 6969 len. 12]: What would become of them if essential discord invaded their home !
Parsing [sent. 6970 len. 60]: Cornelius had not been pleasant , even she was to herself compelled to admit , since first he began to come within sight of manhood ; but she had always looked to the time when growing sense would make him cast aside young-mannish ways ; and this was the outcome of her cares and hopes and prayers for him !
Parsing [sent. 6971 len. 8]: Her husband went about listless and sullen .
Parsing [sent. 6972 len. 5]: He wrote no more .
Parsing [sent. 6973 len. 15]: How could one thus disgraced in his family presume to teach the world anything !
Parsing [sent. 6974 len. 36]: How could he ever hold up his head as one that had served his generation , when this was the kind of man he was to leave behind him for the life of the next !
Parsing [sent. 6975 len. 15]: Cornelius 's very being cast doubt on all he had ever said or done !
Parsing [sent. 6976 len. 17]: He had been proud of his children : they were like those of any common stock !
Parsing [sent. 6977 len. 7]: and the shame recoiled upon himself .
Parsing [sent. 6978 len. 13]: Bitterly he recalled the stain upon his family in generations gone by .
Parsing [sent. 6979 len. 25]: He had never forged or stolen himself , yet the possibility had remained latent in him , else how could he have transmitted it ?
Parsing [sent. 6980 len. 30]: Perhaps there were things in which he might have been more honest , and so have killed the latent germ and his child not have had it to develop !
Parsing [sent. 6981 len. 28]: Far into the distance he saw a continuous succession of dishonest Raymounts , nor succession only but multiplication , till streets and prisons were swarming with them .
Parsing [sent. 6982 len. 38]: For hours he would sit with his hands in his pockets , scarcely daring to think , for the misery of the thoughts that came crowding out the moment the smallest chink was opened in their cage .
Parsing [sent. 6983 len. 17]: He had become short , I do not say rough in his speech to his wife .
Parsing [sent. 6984 len. 43]: He would break into sudden angry complaints against Hester for not coming home , but stop dead in the middle , as if nothing was worth being angry about now , and turn away with a sigh that was almost a groan .
Parsing [sent. 6985 len. 11]: The sight of the children was a pain to him .
Parsing [sent. 6986 len. 71]: Saffy was not one to understand much of grief beyond her own passing troubles ; it was a thing for which she seemed to have little reception ; and her occasionally unsympathetic ways were , considering her age , more of a grief to her mother than was quite reasonable ; she feared she saw in her careless glee the same root which in her brother flowered in sullen disregard .
Parsing [sent. 6987 len. 5]: Mark was very different .
Parsing [sent. 6988 len. 36]: The father would order Saffy away , but the boy might come and go as he pleased , nor give him any annoyance , although he never or scarcely ever took any notice of him .
Parsing [sent. 6989 len. 15]: He had been told nothing of the cause of his parents ' evident misery .
Parsing [sent. 6990 len. 55]: When the news came of Corney 's illness , his mother told him of that ; but he had sympathy and penetration enough to perceive that there must be something amiss more than that : if this were all , they would have told him of it when first they began to be changed !
Parsing [sent. 6991 len. 20]: And when the news came that he was getting better , his father did not seem the least happier !
Parsing [sent. 6992 len. 29]: He would sometimes stand and gaze at his father , but the solemn , far-off , starry look of the boy 's eyes never seemed to disturb him .
Parsing [sent. 6993 len. 43]: He loved his father as few boys love , and yet had a certain dread of him and discomfort in his presence , which he could not have accounted for , and which would vanish at once when he spoke to him .
Parsing [sent. 6994 len. 34]: He had never recovered the effects of being so nearly drowned , and in the readier apprehension caused by accumulated troubles his mother began to doubt if ever he would be well again .
Parsing [sent. 6995 len. 30]: He had got a good deal thinner ; his food did not seem to nourish him ; and his being seemed slipping away from the hold of the world .
Parsing [sent. 6996 len. 21]: He was full of dreams and fancies , all of the higher order of things where love is the law .
Parsing [sent. 6997 len. 46]: He did not read much that was new , for he soon got tired with the effort to understand ; but he would spend happy hours alone , seeming to the ordinary eye to be doing nothing , because his doing was with the unseen .
Parsing [sent. 6998 len. 38]: So-called religious children are often peculiarly disagreeable , mainly from false notions of the simple thing religion in their parents and teachers ; but in truth nowhere may religion be more at home than in a child .
Parsing [sent. 6999 len. 18]: A strong conscience and a loving regard to the desires of others were Mark 's chief characteristics .
Parsing [sent. 7000 len. 24]: When such children as he die , we may well imagine them wanted for special work in the world to which they go .
Parsing [sent. 7001 len. 57]: If the very hairs of our head are all numbered , and he said so who knew and is true , our children do not drop hap-hazard into the near world , neither are they kept out of it by any care or any power of medicine : all goes by heavenliest will and loveliest ordinance .
Parsing [sent. 7002 len. 15]: Some of us will have to be ashamed of our outcry after our dead .
Parsing [sent. 7003 len. 35]: Beloved , even for your dear faces we can wait awhile , seeing it is His father , your father and our father to whom you have gone , leaving us with him still .
Parsing [sent. 7004 len. 17]: Our day will come , and your joy and ours , and all shall be well .
Parsing [sent. 7005 len. 10]: The attachment of Mark to the major continued growing .
Parsing [sent. 7006 len. 21]: `` When Majie comes , '' he said one of those days , `` he must not go again . ''
Parsing [sent. 7007 len. 6]: `` Why , Markie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7008 len. 20]: asked his mother , almost without a meaning , for her thought was with her eldest-born , her disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 7009 len. 21]: `` Because , if he does , '' he answered , `` I shall not see much of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7010 len. 11]: The mother looked at the child , but said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7011 len. 9]: Sorrow was now the element of her soul .
Parsing [sent. 7012 len. 21]: Cornelius had destroyed the family heart ; the family must soon be broken up , and vanish in devouring vacancy !
Parsing [sent. 7013 len. 8]: Do you ask where was her faith ?
Parsing [sent. 7014 len. 102]: I answer , Just where yours and mine is when we give thanks trusting in the things for which we give thanks ; when we rest in what we have , in what we can do , in what people think of us , in the thought of the friends we have at our back , or in anything whatever but the living , outgoing power of the self-alive -- the one causing potency in the heart of our souls , and in every clothing of those souls , from nerve , muscle , and skin to atmosphere and farthest space .
Parsing [sent. 7015 len. 31]: The living life is the one power , the only that can , and he who puts his trust or hope in anything else whatever is a worshipper of idols .
Parsing [sent. 7016 len. 19]: He who does not believe in God must be a truster in that which is lower than himself .
Parsing [sent. 7017 len. 7]: Mark seldom talked about his brother .
Parsing [sent. 7018 len. 27]: Before he went away the last time he had begun to shrink from him a little , as if with some instinct of an inward separation .
Parsing [sent. 7019 len. 41]: He would stand a little way off and look at him as if he were a stranger in whom he was interested , and as if he himself were trying to determine what mental attitude he must assume towards him .
Parsing [sent. 7020 len. 21]: When he heard that he was ill , the tears came in his eyes , but he did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 7021 len. 9]: `` Are you not sorry for Corney ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7022 len. 4]: said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 7023 len. 17]: `` I 'm sorry , '' he answered , `` because it must make him unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 7024 len. 9]: He does not like being ill . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 7025 len. 15]: _ You _ do n't like being ill , I 'm sure Mark ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7026 len. 7]: returned his mother , apprehending affectation .
Parsing [sent. 7027 len. 38]: `` I do n't mind it much , '' answered the boy , looking far away -- as it seemed to his mother , towards a region to which she herself had begun to look with longing .
Parsing [sent. 7028 len. 19]: The way her husband took their grief made them no more a family , but a mere household .
Parsing [sent. 7029 len. 7]: He brooded alone and said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7030 len. 11]: They did not share sorrow as they had shared joy .
Parsing [sent. 7031 len. 23]: At last came a letter from Hester saying that in two days she hoped to start with Corney to bring him home .
Parsing [sent. 7032 len. 23]: The mother read the letter , and with a faded gleam of joy on her countenance , passed it to her husband .
Parsing [sent. 7033 len. 20]: He took it , glanced at it , threw it from him , rose , and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 7034 len. 25]: For an hour his wife heard him pacing up and down his study ; then he took his hat and stick and went out .
Parsing [sent. 7035 len. 72]: What he might have resolved upon had Corney been returning in tolerable health , I do not know -- possibly to kick him out of the house for his impudence in daring to show his face there ; but even this wrathful father , who thought he did well to be angry , could not turn from his sickly child , let him be the greatest scoundrel under the all-seeing sun ?
Parsing [sent. 7036 len. 10]: But not therefore would he receive or acknowledge him !
Parsing [sent. 7037 len. 19]: Swine were the natural companions of the prodigal , and the sooner he was with them the better !
Parsing [sent. 7038 len. 27]: There was truth in the remark , but hell in the spirit of it : for the heart of the father was turned from his son .
Parsing [sent. 7039 len. 14]: The Messiah came to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children .
Parsing [sent. 7040 len. 8]: Strange it should ever have wanted doing !
Parsing [sent. 7041 len. 6]: But it wants doing still .
Parsing [sent. 7042 len. 18]: There is scarce a discernible segment of the round of unity between many fathers and their children .
Parsing [sent. 7043 len. 11]: Gerald Raymount went walking through the pine-woods on his hills .
Parsing [sent. 7044 len. 14]: Little satisfaction lay in land to which such a son was to succeed !
Parsing [sent. 7045 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 7046 len. 6]: the land was his own !
Parsing [sent. 7047 len. 17]: not an acre , not as much as would bury him , should the rascal have !
Parsing [sent. 7048 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 7049 len. 15]: he had taken honesty as a matter of course in _ his _ family .
Parsing [sent. 7050 len. 8]: Were they not _ his _ children ?
Parsing [sent. 7051 len. 25]: He had not thought of God as the bond of life between him and them , nor sought to nourish the life in them .
Parsing [sent. 7052 len. 10]: He was their father and was content with them .
Parsing [sent. 7053 len. 51]: He had pondered much the laws by which society proceeds and prospers , but had not endeavoured in his own case to carry towards perfection the relation that first goes to the making of society : the relation between himself and his children had been left to shift for itself .
Parsing [sent. 7054 len. 17]: He had never known anything of what was going on in the mind of his son .
Parsing [sent. 7055 len. 45]: He had never asked himself if the boy loved the truth -- if he cared that things should stand in him on the footing of eternal reason , or if his consciousness was anything better than the wallowing of a happy-go-lucky satisfaction in being .
Parsing [sent. 7056 len. 21]: And now he was astonished to find _ his _ boy no better than the common sort of human animal !
Parsing [sent. 7057 len. 41]: My reader may say he was worse , for there is the stealing ; but that is just the point in which I see him likest the common run of men , while in his home relations he was worse .
Parsing [sent. 7058 len. 53]: It is my conviction that such an act of open disgrace as he had been guilty of , may be the outcome of evil more easy to cast off than that indicated by home-habits embodying a selfishness regarded embodied in families , and which perhaps are as a mere matter of course .
Parsing [sent. 7059 len. 43]: There is little hope of the repentance and redemption of certain some until they have committed one or another of the many wrong things of which they are daily , through a course of unrestrained selfishness , becoming more and more capable .
Parsing [sent. 7060 len. 38]: Few seem to understand that the true end is not to keep their children from doing what is wrong , though that is on the way to it , but to render them incapable of doing wrong .
Parsing [sent. 7061 len. 33]: While one is capable of doing wrong , he is no nearer right than if that wrong were done -- not so near as if the wrong were done and repented of .
Parsing [sent. 7062 len. 40]: Some minds are never roused to the true nature of their selfishness until having clone some patent wrong , the eyes of the collective human conscience are fixed with the essence of human disapprobation and general repudiation upon them .
Parsing [sent. 7063 len. 39]: Doubtless in the disapproving crowd are many just as capable of the wrong as they , but the deeper nature in them , God 's and not yet theirs utters its disapproval , and the culprit feels it .
Parsing [sent. 7064 len. 18]: Happy he if then at last he begin to turn from the evil itself , so repenting !
Parsing [sent. 7065 len. 43]: This Cornelius had not begun to do yet , but his illness , while perhaps it delayed the time when the thought of turning should present itself , made it more likely the thought would be entertained when it did present itself .
Parsing [sent. 7066 len. 42]: The father came back from his lonely walk , in which his communion with nature had been of the smallest , as determined as before that his son , having unsonned himself , should no more be treated as a son .
Parsing [sent. 7067 len. 38]: He could not refuse him shelter in his house for a time , but he should be in it on sufferance -- in no right of sonship , and should be made to understand it was so !
Parsing [sent. 7068 len. 29]: But the heart of the mother was longing after her boy , like a human hen whose chicken had run from under her wing and come to grief .
Parsing [sent. 7069 len. 38]: He had sinned , he had suffered , and was in disgrace -- good reasons why the mother 's heart should cling to the youth , why her arms should long to fold him to her bosom !
Parsing [sent. 7070 len. 27]: The things which made his father feel he could not speak to him again , worked in the deeper nature of the mother in opposite fashion .
Parsing [sent. 7071 len. 10]: In her they reached a stratum of the Divine .
Parsing [sent. 7072 len. 4]: Was he unlovely ?
Parsing [sent. 7073 len. 8]: -- she must love him the more !
Parsing [sent. 7074 len. 6]: Was he selfish and repellent ?
Parsing [sent. 7075 len. 9]: -- she must get the nearer to him !
Parsing [sent. 7076 len. 11]: Everything was reason to her for love and more love .
Parsing [sent. 7077 len. 7]: If he were but with her !
Parsing [sent. 7078 len. 13]: She would clasp him so close that evil should not touch him !
Parsing [sent. 7079 len. 15]: Satan himself could not get at him with her whole mother-being folded round him !
Parsing [sent. 7080 len. 38]: She had been feeling of late as if she could not get near him : now that sickness had reduced his strength , and shame his proud spirit , love would have room to enter and minister !
Parsing [sent. 7081 len. 18]: The good of all evil is to make a way for love , which is essential good .
Parsing [sent. 7082 len. 15]: Therefore evil exists , and will exist until love destroy and cast it out .
Parsing [sent. 7083 len. 12]: Corney could not keep his mother out of his heart now !
Parsing [sent. 7084 len. 22]: She thought there were ten things she could do for him now to one she could have done for him before !
Parsing [sent. 7085 len. 18]: When , oh when would he appear , that her heart might go out to meet him !
Parsing [sent. 7086 len. 3]: CHAPTER LI .
Parsing [sent. 7087 len. 3]: THE RETURN .
Parsing [sent. 7088 len. 4]: The day came .
Parsing [sent. 7089 len. 6]: It was fine in London .
Parsing [sent. 7090 len. 10]: The invalid was carefully wrapt up for the journey .
Parsing [sent. 7091 len. 15]: Hester , the major and Miss Dasomma followed the young couple to the station .
Parsing [sent. 7092 len. 24]: There the latter received the poor little wife , and when the train was out of sight , took her home with her .
Parsing [sent. 7093 len. 41]: The major who got into the next carriage , at every stop ran to see if anything was wanted ; and when they reached the station got on the box of the carriage the mother had sent to meet them .
Parsing [sent. 7094 len. 15]: Thus Hester bore her lost sheep home -- in little triumph and much anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 7095 len. 15]: When they stopped at the door no one was on the outlook for them .
Parsing [sent. 7096 len. 11]: The hall was not lighted and the door was locked .
Parsing [sent. 7097 len. 6]: The major rang the bell .
Parsing [sent. 7098 len. 13]: Ere the door was opened Hester had got down and stood waiting .
Parsing [sent. 7099 len. 25]: The major took the youth in his arms and carried him into the dining-room , so weary that he could scarcely open his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7100 len. 22]: There seemed no light in the house , except the candle the man brought when he came to open the door .
Parsing [sent. 7101 len. 8]: Corney begged to be put to bed .
Parsing [sent. 7102 len. 8]: `` I wish Amy was here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7103 len. 3]: he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 7104 len. 8]: Hester and the major were talking together .
Parsing [sent. 7105 len. 11]: She hurried from the room and returned in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 7106 len. 14]: `` I was sure of it , '' she whispered to the major .
Parsing [sent. 7107 len. 16]: `` There is a glorious fire in his room , and everything ready for him .
Parsing [sent. 7108 len. 20]: The house is my father , but the room is my mother , and my mother is God . ''
Parsing [sent. 7109 len. 20]: The major took him again , and carried him up the stair -- so thin and light was he .
Parsing [sent. 7110 len. 33]: The moment they were past the door of her room , out came the mother behind them in her dressing gown , and glided pale and noiseless as the disembodied after them .
Parsing [sent. 7111 len. 22]: Hester looked round and saw her , but she laid her finger on her lips , and followed without a word .
Parsing [sent. 7112 len. 25]: When they were in the room , she came to the door , looked in , and watched them , but did not enter .
Parsing [sent. 7113 len. 7]: Cornelius did not open his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7114 len. 12]: The major laid him down on the sofa near the fire .
Parsing [sent. 7115 len. 9]: A gleam of it fell on his face .
Parsing [sent. 7116 len. 31]: The mother drew a sharp quick breath and pressed her hands against her heart : there was his sin upon his face , branding him that men might know him .
Parsing [sent. 7117 len. 13]: But therewith came a fresh rush from the inexhaustible fountain of mother-love .
Parsing [sent. 7118 len. 63]: She would have taken him into her anew , with all his sin and pain and sorrow , to clear away in herself brand and pollution , and bear him anew -- even as God bears our griefs , and carries our sorrows , destroys our wrongs , taking their consequences on himself , and gives us the new birth from above .
Parsing [sent. 7119 len. 36]: Her whole wounded heart seemed to go out to him in one trembling sigh , as she turned to go back to the room where her husband sat with hopeless gaze fixed on the fire .
Parsing [sent. 7120 len. 18]: She had but strength to reach the side of the bed , and fell senseless upon it .
Parsing [sent. 7121 len. 31]: He started up with a sting of self-accusation : he had killed her , exacting from her a promise that by no word would she welcome the wanderer that night .
Parsing [sent. 7122 len. 33]: For she would not have her husband imagine in his bitterness that she loved the erring son more than the father whose heart he had all but broken , and had promised .
Parsing [sent. 7123 len. 39]: She was , in truth , nearly as anxious about the one as the other , for was not the unforgivingness of the one as bad -- was it not even worse than the theft of the other .
Parsing [sent. 7124 len. 27]: He lifted her , laid her on the bed , and proceeded to administer the restoratives he now knew better than any other how to employ .
Parsing [sent. 7125 len. 14]: In a little while he was relieved , her eyelids began to tremble .
Parsing [sent. 7126 len. 5]: `` My baby ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7127 len. 10]: she murmured , and the tears began to flow .
Parsing [sent. 7128 len. 5]: `` Thank God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7129 len. 9]: he said , and got her to bed .
Parsing [sent. 7130 len. 25]: But strange to say , for all his stern fulfilment of duty , he did not feel fit to lie down by his wife .
Parsing [sent. 7131 len. 11]: He would watch : she might have another bad turn !
Parsing [sent. 7132 len. 12]: From the exhaustion that followed excess of feeling , she slept .
Parsing [sent. 7133 len. 7]: He sat watchful by the fire .
Parsing [sent. 7134 len. 21]: She was his only friend , he said , and now she and he were no more of one mind !
Parsing [sent. 7135 len. 8]: Never until now had they had difference !
Parsing [sent. 7136 len. 16]: Hester and the major got Corney to bed , and instantly he was fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 7137 len. 25]: The major arranged himself to pass the night by the fire , and Hester went to see what she could do for her mother .
Parsing [sent. 7138 len. 51]: Knocking softly at the door and receiving no answer , she peeped in : there sat her father and there slept her mother : she would not disturb them , but , taking her share in the punishment of him she had brought home , retire without welcome or good-night .
Parsing [sent. 7139 len. 7]: She too was presently fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 7140 len. 19]: There was no gnawing worm of duty undone or wrong unpardoned in her bosom to keep her awake .
Parsing [sent. 7141 len. 10]: Sorrow is sleepy , pride and remorse are wakeful .
Parsing [sent. 7142 len. 3]: CHAPTER LII .
Parsing [sent. 7143 len. 4]: A HEAVENLY VISION .
Parsing [sent. 7144 len. 9]: The night began differently with the two watchers .
Parsing [sent. 7145 len. 26]: The major was troubled in his mind at what seemed the hard-heartedness of the mother , for he loved her with a true brotherly affection .
Parsing [sent. 7146 len. 42]: He had not seen her looking in at the door ; he did not know the cause of her appearing so withdrawn and unmotherly : he forgot his shilling novel and his sherry and water , and brooded over the thing .
Parsing [sent. 7147 len. 60]: He could not endure the low-minded cub , he said to himself ; he would gladly , if only the wretch were well enough , give him a sound horse-whipping ; but to see him so treated by father and mother was more than he could bear : he began to pity a lad born of parents so hard-hearted .
Parsing [sent. 7148 len. 18]: What would have become of himself , he thought , if his mother had treated him so ?
Parsing [sent. 7149 len. 48]: He had never , to be sure , committed any crime against society worse than shocking certain ridiculously proper people ; but if she had made much of his foibles and faults , he might have grown to be capable of doing how could he tell what ?
Parsing [sent. 7150 len. 13]: who would turn out a mangy dog that was his own dog !
Parsing [sent. 7151 len. 14]: If the fellow were his he would know what to do with him !
Parsing [sent. 7152 len. 23]: He did not reflect that just because he was not his , he did not feel the wounds that disabled from action .
Parsing [sent. 7153 len. 17]: It was easy for him unhurt to think what he would do if he were hurt .
Parsing [sent. 7154 len. 12]: Some things seem the harder to forgive the greater the love .
Parsing [sent. 7155 len. 30]: It is but a false seeming , thank God , and comes only of selfishness , which makes both the love and the hurt seem greater than they are .
Parsing [sent. 7156 len. 163]: And as the major sat thinking and thinking , the story came back to him which his mother had so often told him and his brothers , all now gone but himself , as they stood or sat or lay gathered round her on the Sunday evenings in the nursery -- about the boy that was tired of being at home , and asked his father for money to go away ; and how his father gave it him , thinking it better he should go than grumble at the best he could give him ; and how he grew very naughty , and spent his money in buying things that were not worth having , and in eating and drinking with greedy , coarse , ill behaved people , till at last he had nothing left to buy food with , and had to feed swine to earn something ; and how he fell a thinking , and would go home .
Parsing [sent. 7157 len. 67]: It all came back to his mind just as his mother used to tell it -- how the poor prodigal , ragged and dirty and hungry , set out for home , and how his father spied him coming a great way off , and knew him at once , and set out running to meet him , and fell on his neck and kissed him .
Parsing [sent. 7158 len. 19]: This father would not even look at the son that had but just escaped the jaws of death !
Parsing [sent. 7159 len. 32]: True , the prodigal came home repentant ; but the father did not wait to know that , but ran to meet him and fell on his neck and kissed him !
Parsing [sent. 7160 len. 24]: As the major thus reflected , he kept coming nearer and nearer to the individual I lurking at the keyhole of every story .
Parsing [sent. 7161 len. 16]: Only he had to go home , else how was his father to receive him .
Parsing [sent. 7162 len. 22]: `` I wonder now , '' he said , `` if when a man die that is counted for going home !
Parsing [sent. 7163 len. 27]: I hardly think it ; that is a thing the man ca n't help at all ; he has no hand in the doing of it .
Parsing [sent. 7164 len. 18]: Who would come out to meet a fellow because he was flung down dead at his door .
Parsing [sent. 7165 len. 26]: I fear I should find myself in no better box than this young rascal when he comes home because he ca n't help it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7166 len. 50]: The end of it was that the major , there in the middle of the night , went down on his knees , and , as he had not now done since the eve of his last battle , tried to say the prayers his mother had taught him .
Parsing [sent. 7167 len. 46]: Presently he found himself saying things she had not taught him -- speaking from his heart as if one was listening , one who in the dead of the night did not sleep , but kept wide awake lest one of his children should cry .
Parsing [sent. 7168 len. 25]: `` It is time , '' said the major to himself the next day , `` that I began to think about going home .
Parsing [sent. 7169 len. 7]: I will try again to-night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7170 len. 19]: In his wife 's room Gerald Raymount sat on into the dead waste and middle of the night .
Parsing [sent. 7171 len. 31]: At last , as his wife continued quietly asleep , he thought he would go down to his study , and find something to turn his thoughts from his misery .
Parsing [sent. 7172 len. 11]: None such had come to him as to his friend .
Parsing [sent. 7173 len. 66]: He had been much more of a religious man than the major -- had his theories concerning both the first and the second table of the law ; nor had he been merely a talker , though his talk , as with all talkers , was constantly ahead of his deed : well is it for those whose talk is not ahead of their endeavor !
Parsing [sent. 7174 len. 27]: but it was the _ idea _ of religion , and the thousand ideas it broods , more than religion itself , that was his delight .
Parsing [sent. 7175 len. 72]: He philosophized and philosophized well of the relations between man and his maker , of the necessity to human nature of belief in a God , of the disastrous consequences of having none , and such like things ; but having such an interest is a very different thing from being in such relations with the father that the thought of him is an immediate and ever returning joy and strength .
Parsing [sent. 7176 len. 43]: He did not rejoice in the thought of the inheritance of the saints in light , as the inheriting of the nature of God , the being made partaker of the father 's essential blessedness : he was far yet from that .
Parsing [sent. 7177 len. 20]: He was so busy understanding with his intellect , that he missed the better understanding of heart and imagination .
Parsing [sent. 7178 len. 31]: He was always so pleased with the thought of a thing , that he missed the thing itself -- whose _ possession _ , and not its thought is essential .
Parsing [sent. 7179 len. 13]: Thus when the trial came , it found him no true parent .
Parsing [sent. 7180 len. 48]: The youth of course could not be received either as clean-handed or as repentant ; but love is at the heart of every right way , and essential forgiveness at the-heart of every true treatment of the sinner , even in the very refusal of external forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 7181 len. 170]: That the father should not have longed above all things for his son 's repentance ; that he should not have met even a seeming return ; that he should have nourished resentment because the youth had sinned against _ his _ family in which beauty as his he had gloried ; that he should care to devise no measures for generating a sense of the evil he had done , and aiding repentance as makes forgiveness a necessary consequence ; that he should , instead , ruminate how to make him feel most poignantly his absolute scorn of him , his loathing of his all but convict son -- this made the man a kind of paternal Satan who sat watching by the repose of the most Christian , because most loving , most forgiving , most self-forgetting mother , stirring up in himself fresh whirlwinds of indignation at the incredible thing which had become the fact of facts , lying heaviest , stinging deepest , seeming unchangeable .
Parsing [sent. 7182 len. 19]: That it might prove a blessing , he would have spurned as a suggestion equally degrading and absurd .
Parsing [sent. 7183 len. 38]: `` What is done is done , '' he would have said , in the mingled despair of pride and pride of despair ; `` and all the power of God can not make the thing otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 7184 len. 11]: We can hold up our heads no more for ever .
Parsing [sent. 7185 len. 26]: My own son has not only disgraced but fooled me , giving men good cause to say , ` Physician , heal thyself . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 7186 len. 49]: He rose , and treading softly lest he should wake the only being he _ felt _ love for now , and whom he was loving less than before , for self-love and pride are antagonistic to all loves , left the room and went to his study .
Parsing [sent. 7187 len. 34]: The fire was not yet out ; he stirred it and made it blaze , lighted his candles , took a book from a shelf , sat down , and tried to read .
Parsing [sent. 7188 len. 42]: But it was no use ; his thoughts were such that they could hold no company with other thoughts : the world of his kind was shut out ; he was a man alone , because a man unforgiving and unforgiven .
Parsing [sent. 7189 len. 24]: His soul slid into the old groove of miserable self-reiteration whose only result was more friction-heat ; and so the night slid away .
Parsing [sent. 7190 len. 21]: The nominal morning , if not the dawn was near , when , behold , a wonder of the night !
Parsing [sent. 7191 len. 33]: The door between the study and the old library opened so softly that he heard nothing , and ere he was aware a child in long white gown stood by his side .
Parsing [sent. 7192 len. 4]: He started violently .
Parsing [sent. 7193 len. 7]: It was Mark -- but asleep !
Parsing [sent. 7194 len. 52]: He had seen his mother and father even more than usually troubled all day , and their trouble had haunted him in his sleep ; it had roused him without waking him from his dreams , and the spirit of love had directed his feet to the presence of his father .
Parsing [sent. 7195 len. 44]: He stood a little way from him , his face white as his dress , not a word issuing from his mouth , silent , haunted by a smile of intense quiet , as of one who , being comforted , would comfort .
Parsing [sent. 7196 len. 69]: There was also in the look a slight something like idiocy , for his soul was not precisely with his body ; his thoughts , though concerning his father , were elsewhere ; the circumstances of his soul and of his body were not the same ; and so , being twinned , that is , divided , _ twained _ , he was as one beside himself .
Parsing [sent. 7197 len. 19]: His eyes , although open , evidently saw nothing ; and thus he stood for a little time .
Parsing [sent. 7198 len. 22]: There had never been tender relations between Mark and his father like those between the boy and his mother and sister .
Parsing [sent. 7199 len. 24]: His father was always kind to him , but betwixt him and his boys he had let grow a sort of hard skin .
Parsing [sent. 7200 len. 30]: He had not come so near to them as to the feminine portion of his family -- shrank indeed from close relations with their spirits , thoughts or intents .
Parsing [sent. 7201 len. 17]: It arose , I imagine , from an excess of the masculine element in his nature .
Parsing [sent. 7202 len. 27]: Even when as merest children they came to be kissed before going to bed , he did not like the contact of their faces with his .
Parsing [sent. 7203 len. 28]: No woman , and perhaps not many men will understand this ; but it was always a relief to Mr. Raymount to have the nightly ceremony over .
Parsing [sent. 7204 len. 50]: He thought there was nothing he would not do for their good ; and I think his heart must in the main have been right towards them : he could hardly love and honour his wife as he did , and not love the children she had given him .
Parsing [sent. 7205 len. 36]: But the clothes of his affections somehow did not sit easy on him , and there was a good deal in his behaviour to Cornelius that had operated unfavourably on the mind of the youth .
Parsing [sent. 7206 len. 66]: Even Mark , although , as I have said , he loved him as few boys love a father , was yet a little afraid of him -- never went to him with confidence -- never snuggled close to him -- never sat down by his side to read his book in a heaven of twilight peace , as he would by his mother 's .
Parsing [sent. 7207 len. 15]: He would never have gone to his father 's room for refuge from sleeplessness .
Parsing [sent. 7208 len. 29]: Not recognizing his condition his father was surprised and indeed annoyed as well as startled to see him : he was in no mood for such a visit .
Parsing [sent. 7209 len. 16]: He felt also strangely afraid of the child , he could not have told why .
Parsing [sent. 7210 len. 16]: Wretched about one son , he was dismayed at the nocturnal visit of the other .
Parsing [sent. 7211 len. 36]: The cause was of course his wrong condition of mind ; lack of truth and its harmony in ourselves alone can make us miserable ; there is a cure for everything when that is cured .
Parsing [sent. 7212 len. 74]: No ill in our neighbours , if we be right in ourselves , will ever seem hopeless to us ; but while we stand wrapped in our own selfishness , our neighbour may well seem incurable ; for not only is there nothing in us to help their redemption , but there is that in ourselves , and cherished in us , which can not be forgiven , but must be utterly destroyed .
Parsing [sent. 7213 len. 28]: There was an unnatural look , at the same time pitiful and lovely , about the boy , and the father sat and stared in gathering dread .
Parsing [sent. 7214 len. 11]: He had nearly imagined him an angel of some doom .
Parsing [sent. 7215 len. 33]: Suddenly the child stretched out his hands to him , and with upcast , beseeching face , and eyes that seemed to be seeing far off , came close to his knee .
Parsing [sent. 7216 len. 48]: Then the father remembered how once before , when a tiny child , he had walked in his sleep , and how , suddenly wakened from it , he had gone into a kind of fit , and had for a long time ailed from the shock .
Parsing [sent. 7217 len. 34]: Instantly anxious that nothing of the kind should occur again , he took the child softly in his arms , lifted him to his knees , and held him gently to his bosom .
Parsing [sent. 7218 len. 21]: An expression of supreme delight came over the boy 's face -- a look of absolute contentment mingled with hope .
Parsing [sent. 7219 len. 27]: He put his thin hands together , palm to palm , as if saying his prayers , but lifted his countenance to that of his father .
Parsing [sent. 7220 len. 16]: His gaze , however , though not its direction , was still to the infinite .
Parsing [sent. 7221 len. 21]: And now his lips began to move , and a murmur came from them , which grew into words audible .
Parsing [sent. 7222 len. 23]: He was indeed praying to his father , but a father closer to him than the one upon whose knees he sat .
Parsing [sent. 7223 len. 51]: `` Dear God , '' said the child -- and before I blame the familiarity , I must know that God is displeased with such address from the mouth of a child : for this was not a taught prayer he neither meant nor felt -- `` Dear God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7224 len. 26]: said the child , `` I do n't know what to do , for papa and Corney , I am afraid , are both naughty .
Parsing [sent. 7225 len. 32]: I would not say so to anybody but you , God , for papa is your little boy as I am his little boy , and you know all about it .
Parsing [sent. 7226 len. 43]: I do n't know what it is , and I think Corney must be more to blame than my dear papa , but when he came home to-night he did not go to papa , and papa did not go to him .
Parsing [sent. 7227 len. 17]: They never said How do you do , or Good-night -- and Corney very ill too !
Parsing [sent. 7228 len. 16]: and I am always wanting to come to you , God , to see you .
Parsing [sent. 7229 len. 9]: O God , you are our big papa !
Parsing [sent. 7230 len. 6]: please put it all right .
Parsing [sent. 7231 len. 36]: I do n't know how , or I would tell you ; but it does n't matter -- you would only smile at my way , and take a much better one of your own .
Parsing [sent. 7232 len. 26]: But please , dear God , make papa and Corney good , and never mind their naughtiness , only make it just nothing at all .
Parsing [sent. 7233 len. 8]: You know they must love one another .
Parsing [sent. 7234 len. 19]: I will not pray a word more , for I know you will do just what I want .
Parsing [sent. 7235 len. 14]: Good-by , God ; I 'm going to bed now -- down there .
Parsing [sent. 7236 len. 7]: I 'll come again soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 7237 len. 28]: With that he slipped from his father 's knee , who did not dare to detain him , and walked from the room with slow stately step .
Parsing [sent. 7238 len. 26]: By this time the heart of the strong hard man was swelling with the love which , in it all along , was now awake .
Parsing [sent. 7239 len. 21]: He could not weep , but sobbed dry , torturing sobs , that seemed as if they would kill him .
Parsing [sent. 7240 len. 19]: But he must see that the boy was safe in bed , and rising he left the room .
Parsing [sent. 7241 len. 8]: In the corridor he breathed more freely .
Parsing [sent. 7242 len. 43]: Through an old window , the bright moon , shining in peace with nobody to see , threw partly on the wall and partly on the floor , a shadow-cross , the only thing to catch the eye in the thin light .
Parsing [sent. 7243 len. 39]: Severe protestant as Gerald Raymount was , he found himself on his knees in the passage before the shadow -- not praying , not doing anything he knew , but under some spiritual influence known only to God .
Parsing [sent. 7244 len. 61]: When the something had reached its height , and the passion for the time was over -- when the rush of the huge tidal wave of eternity had subsided , and his soul was clearing of the storm that had swept through it , he rose from his knees and went up to Mark 's room , two stories higher .
Parsing [sent. 7245 len. 38]: The moonlight was there too , for the boy had drawn back the window-curtains that from his pillow he might see the stars , and the father saw his child 's white bed glimmering like a tomb .
Parsing [sent. 7246 len. 44]: He drew near , but through the gray darkness it was some seconds before he could rightly see the face of his boy , and for a moment -- I wonder how brief a moment is enough for a death-pang to feel eternal !
Parsing [sent. 7247 len. 36]: -- for an awful moment he felt as if he had lost him : when he left the study he had been lifted straight to the bosom of the Father to whom he had prayed !
Parsing [sent. 7248 len. 8]: Slow through the dusk dawned his face .
Parsing [sent. 7249 len. 8]: He had not then been taken bodily !
Parsing [sent. 7250 len. 8]: -- not the less was he gone !
Parsing [sent. 7251 len. 7]: -- that was a dead face !
Parsing [sent. 7252 len. 24]: But as he gazed in a fascination of fear , his eyes grew abler to distinguish , and he saw that he breathed .
Parsing [sent. 7253 len. 47]: He was astonished to find how weak was the revulsion : we know more about our feelings than about anything else , yet scarcely understand them at all ; they play what seem to us the strangest pranks -- moving all the time by laws divine .
Parsing [sent. 7254 len. 29]: The boy seemed in his usual health , and was sleeping peacefully -- dreaming pleasantly , for the ghost of a smile glinted about his just parted lips .
Parsing [sent. 7255 len. 43]: Then upon the father -- who was not , with all his hardness , devoid of imagination -- came the wonder of watching a dreamer : what might not be going on within that brain , inaccessible as the most distant star ?
Parsing [sent. 7256 len. 19]: -- yea far more inaccessible , for what were gravity and distance compared with difficulties unnamed and unnamable !
Parsing [sent. 7257 len. 25]: No spirit-shallop has yet been found to float us across the gulf , say rather the invisible line , that separates soul from soul .
Parsing [sent. 7258 len. 33]: Splendrous visions might be gliding through the soul of the sleeper -- his child , born of his body and his soul -- and not one of them was open to him !
Parsing [sent. 7259 len. 21]: not one of the thoughts whose lambent smile-flame flitted about his child 's lips would pass from him to him !
Parsing [sent. 7260 len. 30]: Could they be more divided if the child were dead , than now when he lay , in his sight indeed , yet remote in regions of separate existence ?
Parsing [sent. 7261 len. 18]: But how much nearer to him in reality was the child when awake and about the house ?
Parsing [sent. 7262 len. 33]: How much more did he know then of the thoughts , the loves , the imaginations , the desires , the aspirations that moved in the heart and brain of the child ?
Parsing [sent. 7263 len. 17]: For all that his contact with him came to , he might as well be dead !
Parsing [sent. 7264 len. 15]: A phantom of him moving silent about the house fill the part as well !
Parsing [sent. 7265 len. 21]: The boy was sickly : he might be taken from him ere he had made any true acquaintance with him !
Parsing [sent. 7266 len. 9]: he was just the child to die young !
Parsing [sent. 7267 len. 46]: He would see him again , it was to be hoped , in the other world , but the boy would have so few memories of him , so few associations with him that it would be hard to knot the new to the old !
Parsing [sent. 7268 len. 11]: He turned away , and went back to his room .
Parsing [sent. 7269 len. 66]: There , with a sense of loneliness deeper than he had ever before felt , he went down on his knees to beg the company of the great being whose existence he had so often defended as if it were in danger from his creatures , but whom he had so little regarded as actually existent that he had not yet sought refuge with him .
Parsing [sent. 7270 len. 55]: All the house was asleep -- the major had long ended his prayers and was slumbering by the fire -- when Raymount knelt before the living love , the source of his life , and of all the love that makes life a good thing , and rose from his knees a humbler man .
Parsing [sent. 7271 len. 3]: CHAPTER LIII .
Parsing [sent. 7272 len. 4]: A SAD BEGINNING .
Parsing [sent. 7273 len. 19]: Towards morning he went to bed , and slept late -- heavily and unreposefully ; and , alas !
Parsing [sent. 7274 len. 11]: when he woke , there was the old feeling returned !
Parsing [sent. 7275 len. 14]: How _ could _ he forgive the son that had so disgraced him !
Parsing [sent. 7276 len. 90]: Instead of betaking himself afresh to the living strength , he began -- not directly to fight himself , but to try to argue himself right , persuading himself on philosophical grounds that it was better to forgive his son ; that it was the part of a wise man , the part of one who had respect to his own dignity , to abstain from harshness , nor drive the youth to despair : he was his own son -- he must do what he could for him !
Parsing [sent. 7277 len. 5]: -- and so on !
Parsing [sent. 7278 len. 6]: But he had little success .
Parsing [sent. 7279 len. 9]: Anger and pride were too much for him .
Parsing [sent. 7280 len. 24]: His breakfast was taken to him in the study , and there Hester found him , an hour after , with it untasted .
Parsing [sent. 7281 len. 16]: He submitted to her embrace , but scarcely spoke , and asked nothing about Corney .
Parsing [sent. 7282 len. 9]: Hester felt sadly chilled , and very hopeless .
Parsing [sent. 7283 len. 41]: But she had begun to learn that one of the principal parts of faith is patience , and that the setting of wrong things right is so far from easy that not even God can do it all at once .
Parsing [sent. 7284 len. 24]: But time is nothing to him who sees the end from the beginning ; he does not grudge thousands of years of labor .
Parsing [sent. 7285 len. 27]: The things he cares to do for us require our co-operation , and that makes the great difficulty : we are such poor fellow-workers with him !
Parsing [sent. 7286 len. 21]: All that seems to deny his presence and labour only , necessitates a larger theory of that presence and labour .
Parsing [sent. 7287 len. 19]: Yet time lies heavy on the young especially , and Hester left the room with a heavy heart .
Parsing [sent. 7288 len. 101]: The only way in such stubbornnesses of the spirit , when we can not feel that we are wrong , is to open our hearts , in silence and loneliness and prayer , to the influences from above -- stronger for the right than any for the wrong ; to seek the sweet enablings of the living light to see things as they are -- as God sees them , who never is wrong because he has no selfishness , but is the living Love and the living Truth , without whom there would be no love and no truth .
Parsing [sent. 7289 len. 46]: To rise humbly glorious above our low self , to choose the yet infant self that is one with Christ , who sought never his own but the things of his father and brother , is the redemption begun , and the inheritance will follow .
Parsing [sent. 7290 len. 17]: Mr. Raymount , like most of us , was a long way indeed from this yet .
Parsing [sent. 7291 len. 48]: He strove hard to reconcile the memories of the night with the feelings of the morning -- strove to realize a state of mind in which a measure of forgiveness to his son blended with a measure of satisfaction to the wounded pride he called paternal dignity .
Parsing [sent. 7292 len. 13]: How could he take his son to his bosom as he was ?
Parsing [sent. 7293 len. 16]: he asked -- but did not ask how he was to draw him to repentance !
Parsing [sent. 7294 len. 29]: He did not think of the tender entreaty with which , by the mouths of his prophets , God pleads with his people to come back to him .
Parsing [sent. 7295 len. 53]: If the father , instead of holding out his arms to the child he would entice to his bosom , folds them on that bosom and turns his back -- expectant it may be , but giving no sign of expectancy , the child will hardly suppose him longing to be reconciled .
Parsing [sent. 7296 len. 74]: No doubt there are times when and children with whom any show of affection is not only useless but injurious , tending merely to increase their self-importance , and in such case the child should not see the parent at all , but it was the opposite reason that made it better Cornelius should not yet see his father ; he would have treated him so that he would only have hated him .
Parsing [sent. 7297 len. 41]: For a father not to forgive is in truth far worse than for a son to need forgiveness ; and such a father will of course go from bad to worse as well as the son , except he repent .
Parsing [sent. 7298 len. 11]: The shifty , ungenerous spirit of compromise awoke in Raymount .
Parsing [sent. 7299 len. 19]: He would be very good , very gentle , very kind to every one else in the house !
Parsing [sent. 7300 len. 23]: He would , like Ahab , walk softly ; he was not ready to walk uprightly : his forgiveness he would postpone !
Parsing [sent. 7301 len. 22]: He knew his feelings towards Corney were wearing out the heart of his wife -- but not yet would he yield !
Parsing [sent. 7302 len. 26]: There was little Mark , however , he would make more of him , know him better , and make the child know him better !
Parsing [sent. 7303 len. 20]: I doubt if to know his father better just then would have been for Mark to love him more .
Parsing [sent. 7304 len. 9]: He went to see how his wife was .
Parsing [sent. 7305 len. 41]: Finding that , notwithstanding all she had gone through the day before , she was a trifle better , he felt a little angry and not a little annoyed : what added to his misery was a comfort to her !
Parsing [sent. 7306 len. 10]: she was the happier for having her worthless son !
Parsing [sent. 7307 len. 17]: In the selfishness of his misery he looked upon this as lack of sympathy with himself .
Parsing [sent. 7308 len. 29]: Such weakness vexed him too , in the wife to whom he had for so many years looked up with more than respect , with even unacknowledged reverence .
Parsing [sent. 7309 len. 42]: He did not allude to Cornelius , but said he was going for a walk , and went to find Mark -- with a vague hope of consolation in the child who had clung to him so confidently in the night .
Parsing [sent. 7310 len. 22]: He had forgotten it was not to him _ his soul _ had clung , but to the father of both .
Parsing [sent. 7311 len. 15]: Mark was in the nursery , as the children 's room was still called .
Parsing [sent. 7312 len. 24]: The two never quarrelled ; had they been two Saffies , they would have quarrelled and made it up twenty times a day .
Parsing [sent. 7313 len. 70]: When Mark heard his father 's step , he bounded to meet him ; and when his sweet moonlit rather than sunshiny face appeared at the door , the gloom on his father 's yielded a little ; the gleam of a momentary smile broke over it , and he said kindly : `` Come , Mark , I want you to go for a walk with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7314 len. 10]: `` Yes , papa , '' answered the boy .
Parsing [sent. 7315 len. 8]: -- `` May Saffy come too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7316 len. 30]: The father was not equal however to the company of two of his children , and Mark alone proceeded to get ready , while Saffy sulked in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 7317 len. 13]: But he was not doing the right thing in taking him out .
Parsing [sent. 7318 len. 29]: He ought to have known that the boy was not able for anything to be called a walk ; neither was the weather fit for his going out .
Parsing [sent. 7319 len. 28]: But absorbed in his own trouble , the father did not think of his weakness ; and Hester not being by to object , away they went .
Parsing [sent. 7320 len. 30]: Mark was delighted to be his father 's companion , never doubted all was right that he wished , and forgot his weakness as entirely as did his father .
Parsing [sent. 7321 len. 27]: With his heart in such a state the father naturally had next to nothing to say to his boy , and they walked on in silence .
Parsing [sent. 7322 len. 37]: The silence did not affect Mark ; he was satisfied to be with his father whether he spoke to him or not -- too blessed in the long silences between him and God to dislike silence .
Parsing [sent. 7323 len. 15]: It was no separation -- so long as like speech it was between them .
Parsing [sent. 7324 len. 39]: For a long time he was growing tired without knowing it : when weariness became conscious at last , it was all at once , and poor Mark found he could scarcely put one leg past the other .
Parsing [sent. 7325 len. 26]: The sun had been shining when they started -- beautiful though not very warm spring-sun , but now it was clouded and rain was threatened .
Parsing [sent. 7326 len. 32]: They were in the middle of a bare , lonely moor , easily reached from the house , but of considerable extent , and the wind had begun to blow cold .
Parsing [sent. 7327 len. 42]: Sunk in his miserable thoughts , the more miserable that he had now yielded even the pretence of struggle , and relapsed into unforgiving unforgivenness , the father saw nothing of his child 's failing strength , but kept trudging on .
Parsing [sent. 7328 len. 15]: All at once he became aware that the boy was not by his side .
Parsing [sent. 7329 len. 9]: He looked round : he was nowhere visible .
Parsing [sent. 7330 len. 13]: Alarmed , he stopped , and turning , called his name aloud .
Parsing [sent. 7331 len. 20]: The wind was blowing the other way , and that might be the cause of his hearing no reply .
Parsing [sent. 7332 len. 14]: He called again , and this time thought he heard a feeble response .
Parsing [sent. 7333 len. 6]: He retraced his steps rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 7334 len. 36]: Some four or five hundred yards back , he came to a hollow , where on a tuft of brown heather , sat Mark , looking as white as the vapour-like moon in the daytime .
Parsing [sent. 7335 len. 18]: His anxiety relieved , the father felt annoyed , and rated the little fellow for stopping behind .
Parsing [sent. 7336 len. 15]: `` I was n't able to keep up , papa , '' replied Mark .
Parsing [sent. 7337 len. 19]: `` So I thought I would rest a while , and meet you as you came back . ''
Parsing [sent. 7338 len. 8]: `` You ought to have told me .
Parsing [sent. 7339 len. 14]: I should n't have brought you had I known you would behave so .
Parsing [sent. 7340 len. 11]: Come , get up , we must go home . ''
Parsing [sent. 7341 len. 16]: `` I 'm very sorry , papa , but I think I ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 7342 len. 4]: `` Nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7343 len. 11]: `` There 's something gone wrong in my knee . ''
Parsing [sent. 7344 len. 11]: `` Try , '' said his father , again frightened .
Parsing [sent. 7345 len. 7]: Mark had never shown himself whimsical .
Parsing [sent. 7346 len. 15]: He obeyed and rose , but with a little cry dropped on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 7347 len. 14]: He had somehow injured his knee that he could not walk a step .
Parsing [sent. 7348 len. 7]: His father stooped to lift him .
Parsing [sent. 7349 len. 12]: `` I 'll carry you , Markie , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 7350 len. 13]: `` Oh , no , no , you must not , papa !
Parsing [sent. 7351 len. 5]: It will tire you !
Parsing [sent. 7352 len. 10]: Set me on that stone , and send Jacob .
Parsing [sent. 7353 len. 20]: He carries a sack of meal , and I 'm not so heavy as a sack of meal . ''
Parsing [sent. 7354 len. 9]: His father was already walking homeward with him .
Parsing [sent. 7355 len. 11]: The next moment Mark spied the waving of a dress .
Parsing [sent. 7356 len. 12]: `` Oh , '' he cried , `` there 's Hessie !
Parsing [sent. 7357 len. 6]: She will carry me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7358 len. 6]: `` You little goose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7359 len. 16]: said his father tenderly , `` can she carry you better than I can ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7360 len. 27]: `` She is not stronger than you , papa , because you are a big man ; but I think Hessie has more carry in her .
Parsing [sent. 7361 len. 7]: She has such strong arms ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7362 len. 15]: Hester was running , and when she came near was quite out of breath .
Parsing [sent. 7363 len. 53]: She had feared how it would be when she found her father had taken Mark for a walk , and her first feeling was of anger , for she had inherited not a little of her father 's spirit : indirectly the black sheep had roused evils in the flock unknown before .
Parsing [sent. 7364 len. 24]: Never in her life had Hester been aware of such a feeling as that with which she now hurried to meet her father .
Parsing [sent. 7365 len. 60]: When , however , she saw the boy 's arms round his father 's neck , and his cheek laid against his , her anger went from her , and she was sorry and ashamed , notwithstanding that she knew by Mark 's face , of which she understood every light and shade , that he was suffering much .
Parsing [sent. 7366 len. 12]: `` Let me take him , papa , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 7367 len. 11]: The father had no intention of giving up the child .
Parsing [sent. 7368 len. 21]: But before he knew , Mark had stretched his arms to Hester , and was out of his into hers .
Parsing [sent. 7369 len. 18]: Instinctively trying to retain him , he hurt him , and the boy gave a little cry .
Parsing [sent. 7370 len. 34]: Thereupon with a new pang of pain , and a new sting of resentment , which he knew unreasonable but could not help , he let him go and followed in distressed humiliation .
Parsing [sent. 7371 len. 20]: Hester 's heart was very sore because of this new grief , but she saw some hope in it .
Parsing [sent. 7372 len. 15]: `` He is too heavy for you , Hester , '' said her father .
Parsing [sent. 7373 len. 16]: `` Surely as it is my fault , I ought to bear the penalty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7374 len. 12]: `` It 's no penalty -- is it , Markie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7375 len. 4]: said Hester merrily .
Parsing [sent. 7376 len. 13]: `` No , Hessie , '' replied Mark , almost merrily . ''
Parsing [sent. 7377 len. 13]: -- You do n't know how strong Hessie is , papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7378 len. 8]: `` Yes , I am very strong .
Parsing [sent. 7379 len. 12]: And you ai n't heavy -- are you , Markie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7380 len. 33]: `` No , '' answered Mark ; `` I feel so light sometimes , I think I could fly ; only I do n't like to try for fear I could n't .
Parsing [sent. 7381 len. 9]: I like to think perhaps I could . ''
Parsing [sent. 7382 len. 34]: By and by Hester found , with all her good will , that her strength was of the things that can be shaken , and was obliged to yield him to her father .
Parsing [sent. 7383 len. 37]: It was much to his relief , for a sense of moral weakness had invaded him as he followed his children : he was rejected of his family , and had become a nobody in it !
Parsing [sent. 7384 len. 19]: When at length they reached home , Mark was put to bed , and the doctor sent for .
Parsing [sent. 7385 len. 3]: CHAPTER LIV .
Parsing [sent. 7386 len. 4]: MOTHER AND SON .
Parsing [sent. 7387 len. 8]: In the meantime Cornelius kept his bed .
Parsing [sent. 7388 len. 16]: The moment her husband was gone , his mother rose and hastened to her son !
Parsing [sent. 7389 len. 6]: Here again was a discord !
Parsing [sent. 7390 len. 58]: for the first time since their marriage , a jarring action : the wife was glad the husband was gone that she might do what was right without annoying him : with all her strength of principle , she felt too weak to go openly against him , though she never dreamt of concealing what she did .
Parsing [sent. 7391 len. 21]: She tottered across his floor , threw herself on the bed beside him , and took him to her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 7392 len. 32]: With his mother Corney had never pretended to the same degree as with other people , and his behaviour to her was now more genuine than to any but his wife .
Parsing [sent. 7393 len. 33]: He clung to her as he had never clung since his infancy ; and felt that , let his father behave to him as he might , he had yet a home .
Parsing [sent. 7394 len. 75]: All the morning he had been fretting , in the midst of Hester 's kindest attentions , that he had not his wife to do things for him as he liked them done ; -- and in all such things as required for their well-doing a fitting of self to the notions of another , Amy was indeed before Hester -- partly , perhaps , in virtue of having been a little while married .
Parsing [sent. 7395 len. 34]: But now that Cornelius had his mother , he was more content , or rather less discontented -- more agreeable in truth than she had known him since first he went to business .
Parsing [sent. 7396 len. 43]: She felt greatly consoled , and he so happy with her that he began to wish that he had not a secret from her -- for the first time in his life to be sorry that he was in possession of one .
Parsing [sent. 7397 len. 24]: He grew even anxious that she should know it , but none the less anxious that he should not have to tell it .
Parsing [sent. 7398 len. 51]: A great part of the time when her husband supposed her asleep , she had been lying wide awake , thinking of the Corney she had lost , and the Corney that had come home to her instead : she was miserable over the altered looks of her disfigured child .
Parsing [sent. 7399 len. 51]: The truest of mothers , with all her love for the real and indifference to outsides , can hardly be expected to reconcile herself with ease to a new face on her child : she has loved him in one shape , and now has to love him in another !
Parsing [sent. 7400 len. 61]: It was almost as if she had received again another child -- her own indeed , but taken from her the instant he was born and never seen by her since -- whom , now she saw him , she had to learn to love in a shape different from that in which she had been accustomed to imagine him .
Parsing [sent. 7401 len. 12]: His sad , pock-marked face had a torturing fascination for her .
Parsing [sent. 7402 len. 16]: It was almost pure pain , yet she could not turn her eyes from it .
Parsing [sent. 7403 len. 42]: She reproached herself that it gave her pain , yet was almost indignant with the face she saw for usurping the place of her boy 's beauty : through that mask she must force her way to the real beneath it !
Parsing [sent. 7404 len. 25]: At the same time very pity made her love with a new and deeper tenderness the poor spoilt visage , pathetic in its ugliness .
Parsing [sent. 7405 len. 23]: Not a word did she utter of reproach : his father would do -- was doing enough for both in that way !
Parsing [sent. 7406 len. 39]: Every few minutes she would gaze intently in his face for a moment , and then clasp him to her heart as if seeking a shorter way to his presence than through the ruined door of his countenance .
Parsing [sent. 7407 len. 53]: Hester , who had never received from her half so much show of tenderness , could not help , like the elder brother in the divine tale , a little choking at the sight , but she soon consoled herself that the less poor Corney deserved it the more he needed it .
Parsing [sent. 7408 len. 62]: The worst of it to Hester was that she could not with any confidence look on the prodigal as a repentant one ; and if he was not , all this tenderness , she feared and with reason , would do him harm , causing him to think less of his crime , and blinding him to his low moral condition .
Parsing [sent. 7409 len. 53]: But she thought also that God would do what he could to keep the love of such a mother from hurting ; and it was not long before she was encouraged by a softness in Corney 's look , and a humid expression in his eyes which she had never seen before .
Parsing [sent. 7410 len. 67]: Doubtless had he been as in former days , he would have turned from such over flow of love as womanish gush ; but disgraced , worn out , and even to his own eyes an unpleasant object , he was not so much inclined to repel the love of the only one knowing his story who did not feel for him more or less contempt .
Parsing [sent. 7411 len. 70]: Sometimes in those terrible half-dreams in the dark of early morn when suddenly waked by conscience to hold a _ tete-a-tete _ with her , he would imagine himself walking into the bank , and encountering the eyes of all the men on his way to his uncle , whom next to his father he feared -- then find himself running for refuge to the bosom of his mother .
Parsing [sent. 7412 len. 7]: She was true to him yet !
Parsing [sent. 7413 len. 11]: he would say : yes , he used the word !
Parsing [sent. 7414 len. 5]: he said _ true !
Parsing [sent. 7415 len. 35]: _ Slowly , slowly , something was working on him -- now in the imagined judgment of others , now in the thought of his wife , now in the devotion of his mother .
Parsing [sent. 7416 len. 20]: Little result was there for earthly eye , but the mother 's perceived or imagined a difference in him .
Parsing [sent. 7417 len. 12]: If only she could descry something plain to tell her husband !
Parsing [sent. 7418 len. 17]: If the ice that froze up the spring of his love would but begin to melt !
Parsing [sent. 7419 len. 41]: For to whom are we to go for refuge from ourselves if not to those through whom we were born into the world , and who are to blame for more or less of our unfitness for a true life ?
Parsing [sent. 7420 len. 11]: -- `` His father _ must _ forgive him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7421 len. 5]: she said to herself .
Parsing [sent. 7422 len. 10]: She would go down on her knees to him .
Parsing [sent. 7423 len. 13]: Their boy should _ not _ be left out in the cold !
Parsing [sent. 7424 len. 24]: If he had been guilty , what was that to the cruel world so ready to punish , so ready to do worse !
Parsing [sent. 7425 len. 30]: The mother still carried in her soul the child born of her body , preparing for him the new and better , the all-lovely birth of repentance unto life .
Parsing [sent. 7426 len. 12]: Hester had not yet said a word about her own affairs .
Parsing [sent. 7427 len. 15]: No one but the major knew that her engagement to lord Gartley was broken .
Parsing [sent. 7428 len. 24]: She was not willing to add yet an element of perturbance to the overcharged atmosphere ; she would not add disappointment to grief .
Parsing [sent. 7429 len. 36]: In the afternoon the major , who had retired to the village , two miles off , the moment his night-watch was relieved , made his appearance , in the hope of being of use .
Parsing [sent. 7430 len. 14]: He saw only Hester , who could give him but a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 7431 len. 19]: No sooner did he learn of Mark 's condition , than he insisted on taking charge of him .
Parsing [sent. 7432 len. 25]: He would let her know at once if he wanted to see her or any one : she might trust him to his care !
Parsing [sent. 7433 len. 29]: `` I am quite as good at nursing -- I do n't say as you , cousin Hester , or your mother , but as any ordinary woman .
Parsing [sent. 7434 len. 6]: You will see I am !
Parsing [sent. 7435 len. 15]: I know most of the newest wrinkles , and will carry them out . ''
Parsing [sent. 7436 len. 47]: Hester could not be other than pleased with the proposal ; for having both her mother and Corney to look after , and Miss Dasomma or Amy to write to every day , she had feared the patient Mark might run some risk of being neglected .
Parsing [sent. 7437 len. 54]: To be sure Saffy had a great notion of nursing , but her ideas were in some respects , to say the least , a little peculiar ; and though at times she was a great gain in the sick room , she could hardly be intrusted with entire management of the same .
Parsing [sent. 7438 len. 22]: So the major took the position of head-nurse , with Saffy for aid , and one of the servants for orderly .
Parsing [sent. 7439 len. 34]: Hester 's mind was almost constantly occupied with thinking how she was to let her father and mother know what they must know soon , and ought to know as soon as possible .
Parsing [sent. 7440 len. 29]: She would tell her father first ; her mother should not know till he did : she must not have the anxiety of how he would take it !
Parsing [sent. 7441 len. 11]: But she could not see how to set about it .
Parsing [sent. 7442 len. 23]: She had no light , and seemed to have no leading -- felt altogether at a standstill , without impulse or energy .
Parsing [sent. 7443 len. 20]: She waited , therefore , as she ought ; for much harm comes of the impatience that outstrips guidance .
Parsing [sent. 7444 len. 52]: People are too ready to think _ something _ must be done , and forget that the time for action may not have arrived , that there is seldom more than one thing fit to be done , and that the wrong thing must in any case be worse than nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7445 len. 15]: Cornelius grew gradually better , and at last was able to go down stairs .
Parsing [sent. 7446 len. 14]: But the weather continued so far unfavourable that he could not go out .
Parsing [sent. 7447 len. 19]: He had not yet seen his father , and his dread of seeing him grew to a terror .
Parsing [sent. 7448 len. 36]: He never went down until he knew he was not in the house , and then would in general sit at some window that commanded the door by which he was most likely to enter .
Parsing [sent. 7449 len. 23]: He enticed Saffy from attendance on Mark to be his scout , and bring him word in what direction his father went .
Parsing [sent. 7450 len. 7]: This did the child incalculable injury .
Parsing [sent. 7451 len. 25]: The father was just as anxious to avoid him , fully intending , if he met him , to turn his back upon him .
Parsing [sent. 7452 len. 19]: But it was a rambling and roomy old house , and there was plenty of space for both .
Parsing [sent. 7453 len. 25]: A whole week passed and they had not met -- to the disappointment of Hester , who cherished some hope in a chance encounter .
Parsing [sent. 7454 len. 23]: She had just one consolation : ever since she had Cornelius safe under her wing , the mother had been manifestly improving .
Parsing [sent. 7455 len. 17]: But even this was a source of dissatisfaction to the brooding selfishness of the unhealthy-minded father .
Parsing [sent. 7456 len. 42]: He thought with himself -- `` Here have I been heart and soul nursing her through the illness he caused her , and all in vain till she gets the rascal back , and then she begins at once to improve !
Parsing [sent. 7457 len. 18]: She would be perfectly happy with him if she and I never saw each other again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7458 len. 8]: The two brothers had not yet met .
Parsing [sent. 7459 len. 20]: For one thing , Corney disliked the major , and for another , the major objected to an interview .
Parsing [sent. 7460 len. 27]: He felt certain the disfigurement of Corney would distress Mark too much , and retard the possible recovery of which he was already in great doubt .
Parsing [sent. 7461 len. 3]: CHAPTER LV .
Parsing [sent. 7462 len. 5]: MISS DASOMMA AND AMY .
Parsing [sent. 7463 len. 23]: Miss Dasomma was quite as much pleased with Amy as she had expected to be , and that was not a little .
Parsing [sent. 7464 len. 26]: She found her very ignorant in the regions of what is commonly called education , but very quick in understanding where human relation came in .
Parsing [sent. 7465 len. 37]: A point in construction or composition she would forget immediately ; but once shown a possibility of misunderstanding avoidable by a certain arrangement , Amy would recall the fact the moment she made again the mistake .
Parsing [sent. 7466 len. 18]: Her teachableness , coming largely of her trustfulness , was indeed a remarkable point in her character .
Parsing [sent. 7467 len. 24]: It was partly through this that Corney gained his influence over her : superior knowledge was to her a sign of superior goodness .
Parsing [sent. 7468 len. 18]: She began at once to teach her music : the sooner a beginning was made the better !
Parsing [sent. 7469 len. 21]: Her fingers were stiff , but so was her will : the way she stuck to her work was pathetic .
Parsing [sent. 7470 len. 30]: Here also she understood quickly , but the doing of what she understood she found very hard -- the more so that her spirit was but ill at ease .
Parsing [sent. 7471 len. 40]: Corney had deceived her ; he had done something wrong besides ; she was parted from him , and could realize little of his surroundings ; all was very different from what she had expected in marrying her Corney !
Parsing [sent. 7472 len. 27]: Also , from her weariness and anxiety in nursing him , and from other causes as well , her health was not what it had been .
Parsing [sent. 7473 len. 9]: Then Hester 's letters were a little stiff !
Parsing [sent. 7474 len. 16]: She felt it without knowing what she felt , or why they made her uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 7475 len. 55]: It was from no pride or want of love they were such , but from her uncertainty -- the discomfort of knowing they were no nearer a solution of their difficulty than when they parted at the railway : she did not even know yet what she was going to do in the matter !
Parsing [sent. 7476 len. 8]: This prevented all free flow of communication .
Parsing [sent. 7477 len. 36]: Unable to say what she would have liked to say , unwilling to tell the uncomfortable condition of things , there rose a hedge and seemed to sink a gulf between her and her sister .
Parsing [sent. 7478 len. 35]: Amy therefrom , naturally surmised that the family was not willing to receive her , and that the same unwillingness though she was too good to yield to it , was in Hester also .
Parsing [sent. 7479 len. 6]: It was not in her .
Parsing [sent. 7480 len. 52]: How she might have taken his marriage had Corney remained respectable , I am not sure ; but she knew that the main hope for her brother lay in his love for Amy and her devotion to him -- in her common sense , her true , honest , bright nature .
Parsing [sent. 7481 len. 9]: She was only far too good for Corney !
Parsing [sent. 7482 len. 29]: Then again Amy noted , for love and anxiety made her very sharp , that Miss Dasomma did not read to her every word of Hester 's letters .
Parsing [sent. 7483 len. 20]: Once she stopped suddenly in the middle of a sentence , and after a pause went on with another !
Parsing [sent. 7484 len. 9]: Something was there she was not to know !
Parsing [sent. 7485 len. 9]: It might have some reference to her husband !
Parsing [sent. 7486 len. 12]: If so , then something was not going right with him !
Parsing [sent. 7487 len. 18]: Was he worse and were they afraid to tell her , lest she should go to him !
Parsing [sent. 7488 len. 28]: Perhaps they were treating him as her aunts treated her -- making his life miserable -- and she not with him to help him to bear it !
Parsing [sent. 7489 len. 9]: All no doubt because she had married him !
Parsing [sent. 7490 len. 6]: It explained his deceiving her !
Parsing [sent. 7491 len. 35]: If he had told them , as he ought to have done , they would not have let her have him at all , and what would have become of her without her Corney !
Parsing [sent. 7492 len. 47]: He ought not certainly to have told her lies , but if anything could excuse him , so that making the best of things , and excusing her husband all she could , she was in danger of lowering her instinctively high sense of moral obligation .
Parsing [sent. 7493 len. 41]: She brooded over the matter but not long , she threw herself on her knees , and begged her friend to let her know what the part of her sister 's letter she had not read to her was about .
Parsing [sent. 7494 len. 49]: `` But , my dear , '' said Miss Dasomma , `` Hester and I have been friends for many years , and we may well have things to say to each other we should not care that even one we loved so much as you should hear ?
Parsing [sent. 7495 len. 12]: -- A lady must not be inquisitive , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 7496 len. 16]: `` I know that , and I never did pry into other people 's affairs .
Parsing [sent. 7497 len. 17]: Tell me it was nothing about my husband , and I shall be quite content . ''
Parsing [sent. 7498 len. 9]: `` But think a moment , Amy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7499 len. 48]: returned Miss Dasomma , who began to find herself in a difficulty ; `` there might be things between his family and him , who have known him longer than you , which they were not quite prepared to tell you all about before knowing you better .
Parsing [sent. 7500 len. 20]: Some people in the way they treated you would have been very different from that angel sister of yours !
Parsing [sent. 7501 len. 11]: There is nobody like her -- that I know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7502 len. 19]: `` I love her with my whole heart , '' replied Amy sobbing -- `` next to Cornelius .
Parsing [sent. 7503 len. 11]: But even she must not come between him and me .
Parsing [sent. 7504 len. 38]: If it is anything affecting him , his wife has a right to know about it -- a greater right than any one else ; and no one has a right to conceal it from her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7505 len. 8]: `` Why do you think that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7506 len. 36]: asked Miss Dasomma , entirely agreeing with her that she had a right to know , but thinking also , in spite of logic , that one might have a right to conceal it notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 7507 len. 17]: She was anxious to temporize , for she did not see how to answer her appeal .
Parsing [sent. 7508 len. 38]: She could not tell her a story , and she did not feel at liberty to tell her the truth ; and if she declined to answer her question , the poor child might imagine something dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 7509 len. 17]: `` Why , miss , '' answered Amy , `` we ca n't be divided ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7510 len. 30]: I must do what I can -- all I can for him , and I have a right to know what there is to be done for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7511 len. 13]: `` But can you not trust his own father and mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7512 len. 15]: said Miss Dasomma -- and as she said it , her conscience accused her .
Parsing [sent. 7513 len. 22]: `` Yes , surely , '' replied Amy , `` if they were loving him , and not angry with him .
Parsing [sent. 7514 len. 23]: But I have seen even that angel Hester look very vexed with him sometimes , and that when he was ill too !
Parsing [sent. 7515 len. 17]: and I know he will never stand that : he will run away as I did .
Parsing [sent. 7516 len. 13]: I know what your own people can do to make you miserable !
Parsing [sent. 7517 len. 32]: They say a woman must leave all for her husband , and that 's true ; but it is the other way in the Bible -- I read it this morning !
Parsing [sent. 7518 len. 43]: In the Bible it is -- ' a man shall leave father and mother and cleave to his wife ; ' and after that who will say there ought to be anything between him and his parents she do n't know about .
Parsing [sent. 7519 len. 20]: It 's _ she _ that 's got to look after the man given to her like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7520 len. 19]: Miss Dasomma looked with admiration at the little creature -- showing fight like a wren for her nest .
Parsing [sent. 7521 len. 6]: How rapidly she was growing !
Parsing [sent. 7522 len. 7]: how noble she was and free !
Parsing [sent. 7523 len. 6]: She was indeed a treasure !
Parsing [sent. 7524 len. 41]: The man she had married was little worthy of her , but if she rescued him , not from his parents , but from himself , she might perhaps have done as good a work as helping a noble-hearted man !
Parsing [sent. 7525 len. 18]: `` I 've got him to look after , '' she resumed , `` and I will .
Parsing [sent. 7526 len. 6]: He 's mine , miss !
Parsing [sent. 7527 len. 21]: If anybody 's not doing right by him , I ought to be by and see him through it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7528 len. 19]: Here Miss Dasomma 's prudence for a moment forsook her : who shall explain such _ accidents _ !
Parsing [sent. 7529 len. 12]: It stung her to hear her friends suspected of behaving unjustly .
Parsing [sent. 7530 len. 10]: `` That 's all you know , Amy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7531 len. 13]: she blurted out -- and bit her lip in vexation with herself .
Parsing [sent. 7532 len. 11]: Amy was upon her like a cat upon a mouse .
Parsing [sent. 7533 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7534 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 7535 len. 10]: `` I _ must _ know what it is !
Parsing [sent. 7536 len. 11]: You shall _ not _ keep me in the dark !
Parsing [sent. 7537 len. 11]: I _ must _ do my duty by my husband .
Parsing [sent. 7538 len. 14]: If you do not tell me , I will go to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7539 len. 24]: In terror at what might be that result of her hasty remark , Miss Dasomma faltered , reddened , and betrayed considerable embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 7540 len. 13]: A prudent person , lapsing into a dilemma , is specially discomfitted .
Parsing [sent. 7541 len. 23]: She had committed no offence against love , had been guilty of no selfishness or meanness , yet was in miserable predicament .
Parsing [sent. 7542 len. 11]: Amy saw , and was the more convinced and determined .
Parsing [sent. 7543 len. 12]: She persisted , and Miss Dasomma knew that she would persist .
Parsing [sent. 7544 len. 10]: Presently , however , she recovered herself a little .
Parsing [sent. 7545 len. 33]: `` How can you wonder , '' she said with confused vagueness , `` when you know he deceived you , and never told them he was going to marry you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7546 len. 18]: `` But they know nothing of it yet -- at least from the way Hester writes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7547 len. 23]: `` Yes ; but one who could behave like that would be only too likely to give other grounds of offence . ''
Parsing [sent. 7548 len. 16]: `` Then there _ is _ something more -- something I know nothing about ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7549 len. 3]: exclaimed Amy .
Parsing [sent. 7550 len. 16]: `` I suspected it the moment I saw Hester 's face at the door ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7551 len. 8]: -- she might have said before that .
Parsing [sent. 7552 len. 12]: -- `` I _ must _ know what it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7553 len. 4]: she went on .
Parsing [sent. 7554 len. 39]: `` I may be young and silly , but I know what a wife owes to her husband ; and a wife who cares for nothing but her husband can do more for him than anybody else can .
Parsing [sent. 7555 len. 7]: Know all about it I will !
Parsing [sent. 7556 len. 6]: It is my business ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7557 len. 5]: Miss Dasomma was dumb .
Parsing [sent. 7558 len. 31]: She had waked a small but active volcano at her feet , which , though without design against vineyards and villages , would go to its ends regardless of them !
Parsing [sent. 7559 len. 14]: She must either answer her questions or persuade her not to ask any .
Parsing [sent. 7560 len. 18]: `` I beg , Amy , '' she said with entreaty `` you will do nothing rash .
Parsing [sent. 7561 len. 12]: Can you not trust friends who have proved themselves faithful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7562 len. 20]: `` Yes ; for myself , '' answered Amy : `` but it is my _ husband _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7563 len. 7]: -- She almost screamed the word .
Parsing [sent. 7564 len. 16]: -- `` And I will trust nobody to take care enough of _ him _ .
Parsing [sent. 7565 len. 32]: They ca n't know how to treat him or he would love them more , and would not have been afraid to let them know he was marrying a poor girl .
Parsing [sent. 7566 len. 10]: Miss Dasomma , what have you got against him ?
Parsing [sent. 7567 len. 14]: I have no fear you will tell me anything but the truth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7568 len. 6]: `` Of course not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7569 len. 14]: returned Miss Dasomma , offended , but repressing all show of her feeling .
Parsing [sent. 7570 len. 11]: -- `` Why then will you not trust me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7571 len. 30]: `` I will believe whatever you say ; but I will not trust even you to tell or not tell me as you please where my husband is concerned .
Parsing [sent. 7572 len. 11]: That would be to give up my duty to him .
Parsing [sent. 7573 len. 52]: Tell me what it is , or -- '' She did not finish the sentence : the postman 's knock came to the door , and she bounded off to see what he had brought , leaving Miss Dasomma in fear lest she should appropriate a letter not addressed to her .
Parsing [sent. 7574 len. 23]: She returned with a look of triumph -- a look so wildly exultant that her hostess was momentarily alarmed for her reason .
Parsing [sent. 7575 len. 9]: `` Now I shall know the truth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7576 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 7577 len. 7]: `` This is from himself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7578 len. 9]: And with that she flew to her room .
Parsing [sent. 7579 len. 10]: Miss Dasomma should not hear a word of it !
Parsing [sent. 7580 len. 13]: How dared she keep from her what she knew about her husband !
Parsing [sent. 7581 len. 9]: It was Corney 's first letter to her .
Parsing [sent. 7582 len. 14]: It was filled , not with direct complaints , but a general grumble .
Parsing [sent. 7583 len. 7]: Here is a part of it .
Parsing [sent. 7584 len. 14]: `` I do wish you were here , Amy , my own dearest !
Parsing [sent. 7585 len. 12]: I love nobody like you -- I love nobody but you .
Parsing [sent. 7586 len. 25]: If I did wrong in telling you a few diddle-daddies , it was because I loved you so I could not do without you .
Parsing [sent. 7587 len. 16]: And what comforts me for any wrong I have done is that I have you .
Parsing [sent. 7588 len. 14]: That would make up to a man for anything short of being hanged !
Parsing [sent. 7589 len. 18]: You little witch , how did you contrive to make a fool of a man like me !
Parsing [sent. 7590 len. 13]: I should have been in none of this scrape but for you !
Parsing [sent. 7591 len. 19]: My mother is very kind to me , of course -- ever so much better company than Hester !
Parsing [sent. 7592 len. 30]: she never looks as if a fellow had to be put up with , or forgiven , or anything of that sort , in her high and mighty way .
Parsing [sent. 7593 len. 19]: But you do get tired of a mother always keeping on telling you how much she loves you .
Parsing [sent. 7594 len. 13]: You ca n't help thinking there must be something behind it all .
Parsing [sent. 7595 len. 31]: Depend upon it she wants something of you -- wants you to be good , I daresay -- to repent , do n't you know , as they call it !
Parsing [sent. 7596 len. 17]: They 're all right , I suppose , but it ai n't nice for all that .
Parsing [sent. 7597 len. 10]: And that Hester has never told my father yet .
Parsing [sent. 7598 len. 9]: `` I have n't even seen my father .
Parsing [sent. 7599 len. 8]: He has not come near me once !
Parsing [sent. 7600 len. 43]: Saffy would n't look at me for a long time -- that 's the last of the litter , you know ; she shrieked when they called to her to come to me , and cried , ` That 's ugly Corney !
Parsing [sent. 7601 len. 8]: I wo n't have ugly Corney ! '
Parsing [sent. 7602 len. 9]: So you may see how I am used !
Parsing [sent. 7603 len. 16]: But I 've got her under my thumb at last , and she 's useful .
Parsing [sent. 7604 len. 7]: Then there 's that prig Mark !
Parsing [sent. 7605 len. 15]: I always liked the little wretch , though he is such a precious humbug !
Parsing [sent. 7606 len. 13]: He 's in bed -- put out his knee , or something .
Parsing [sent. 7607 len. 8]: He never had any stamina in him !
Parsing [sent. 7608 len. 7]: Scrofulous , do n't you know !
Parsing [sent. 7609 len. 15]: They wo n't let me go near him -- for fear of frightening him !
Parsing [sent. 7610 len. 20]: But that 's that braggart , major Marvel -- and a marvel he is , I can tell you !
Parsing [sent. 7611 len. 33]: He comes to me sometimes , and makes me hate him -- talks as if I was n't as good as he , -- as if I was n't even a gentleman !
Parsing [sent. 7612 len. 16]: Many 's the time I long to be back in the garret -- horrid place !
Parsing [sent. 7613 len. 7]: alone with my little Amy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7614 len. 5]: So went the letter .
Parsing [sent. 7615 len. 14]: When Amy next appeared before Miss Dasomma , she was in another mood .
Parsing [sent. 7616 len. 14]: Her eyes were red with weeping , and her hair was in disorder .
Parsing [sent. 7617 len. 26]: She had been lying now on the bed , now on the floor , tearing her hair , and stuffing her handkerchief in her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 7618 len. 9]: `` Well , what is the news ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7619 len. 22]: asked Miss Dasomma , as kindly as she could speak , and as if she saw nothing particular in her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 7620 len. 22]: `` You must excuse me , '' replied Amy , with the stiffness of a woman of the world resenting intrusion .
Parsing [sent. 7621 len. 33]: But the next moment she said , `` Do not think me unkind , miss ; there is nothing , positively nothing in the letter interesting to any one but myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 7622 len. 6]: Miss Dasomma said nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 7623 len. 10]: Perhaps she was going to escape without further questioning !
Parsing [sent. 7624 len. 36]: and though not a little anxious as to what the letter might contain to have put the poor girl in such a state , she would not risk the asking of a single question more .
Parsing [sent. 7625 len. 38]: The solemn fact was , that his letter , in conjunction with the word Miss Dasomma let slip , had at last begun to open Amy 's eyes a little to the real character of her husband .
Parsing [sent. 7626 len. 44]: She had herself seen a good deal of his family , and found it hard to believe they would treat him unkindly , nor did he exactly say so ; but his father had not been once to see him since his return !
Parsing [sent. 7627 len. 19]: -- Corney had not mentioned that he himself , had all he could , avoided meeting his father .
Parsing [sent. 7628 len. 38]: -- If then they did not yet know he was married , that other thing -- the cause for such treatment of a son just escaped the jaws of death , must be a very serious one !
Parsing [sent. 7629 len. 39]: It might be very hard , it might be even unfair treatment -- she could not tell ; but there must be something to explain it -- something to show it not altogether the monstrous thing it seemed !
Parsing [sent. 7630 len. 16]: I do not say she reasoned thus , but her genius reasoned thus for her .
Parsing [sent. 7631 len. 19]: Of course it must be the same thing that made him take to the garret and hide there !
Parsing [sent. 7632 len. 19]: The more she thought of it the more convinced was she that he had done something hideously wrong .
Parsing [sent. 7633 len. 27]: It was a sore conviction to her , and would have been a sorer yet had she understood his playful blame of her in the letter .
Parsing [sent. 7634 len. 30]: But such was the truth of her devotion that she would only have felt accountable for the wrong , and bent body and soul to make up for it .
Parsing [sent. 7635 len. 21]: From the first glimmer of certainty as to the uncertain facts she saw with absolute clearness what she must do .
Parsing [sent. 7636 len. 64]: There was that in the tone of the letter also , which , while it distressed her more than she was willing to allow , strengthened her determination -- especially the way in which he spoke of his mother , for she not only remembered her kindness at Burcliff , but loved the memory of her own mother with her whole bright soul .
Parsing [sent. 7637 len. 25]: But what troubled her most of all was that he should be so careless about the wrong he had done , whatever it was .
Parsing [sent. 7638 len. 9]: `` I must know all about it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7639 len. 15]: she said to herself , `` or how am I to help him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7640 len. 50]: It seemed to her the most natural thing that when one has done wrong , he should confess it and confess it wrong -- so have done with it , disowning and casting away the cursed thing : this , alas , Cornelius did not seem inclined to do !
Parsing [sent. 7641 len. 24]: But was she , of all women in the world , to condemn him without knowing what he had to say for himself ?
Parsing [sent. 7642 len. 30]: She was bound to learn the truth of the thing , if only to give her husband fair play , which she must give him to the uttermost farthing ?
Parsing [sent. 7643 len. 24]: To wrong him in her thoughts was the greatest wrong woman could do him ; no woman could wrong him as she could !
Parsing [sent. 7644 len. 10]: By degrees her mind grew calm in settled resolve .
Parsing [sent. 7645 len. 63]: It might , she reasoned , be very well for husband and wife to be apart while they were both happy : they had only to think the more of each other ; but when anything was troubling either , still more when it was anything _ in _ either , then it was horrible and unnatural that they should be parted .
Parsing [sent. 7646 len. 14]: What could a heart then do but tear itself to pieces , think-thinking ?
Parsing [sent. 7647 len. 9]: It was enough to make one kill oneself !
Parsing [sent. 7648 len. 11]: Should she tell Miss Dasomma what was in her thoughts ?
Parsing [sent. 7649 len. 13]: Neither she nor Hester had trusted her : needed she trust them ?
Parsing [sent. 7650 len. 18]: She must take her own way in silence , for they would be certain to oppose it !
Parsing [sent. 7651 len. 12]: could there be a design to keep her and Corney apart ?
Parsing [sent. 7652 len. 15]: All the indignant strength and unalterable determination of the little woman rose in arms .
Parsing [sent. 7653 len. 16]: She would see who would keep them asunder now she had made up her mind !
Parsing [sent. 7654 len. 17]: She had money of her own -- and there were the trinkets Corney had given her !
Parsing [sent. 7655 len. 11]: They must be valuable , for Corney hated sham things !
Parsing [sent. 7656 len. 26]: She would walk her way , work her way , or beg her way , if necessary , but nothing should keep her from Corney !
Parsing [sent. 7657 len. 14]: Not a word more concerning their difference passed between her and Miss Dasomma .
Parsing [sent. 7658 len. 14]: They talked cheerfully , and kissed as usual when parting for the night .
Parsing [sent. 7659 len. 16]: The moment she was in her room , Amy began to pack a small carpet-bag .
Parsing [sent. 7660 len. 21]: When that was done she made a bundle of her cloak and shawl , and lay down in her clothes .
Parsing [sent. 7661 len. 14]: Long before dawn she crept softly down the stairs , and stole out .
Parsing [sent. 7662 len. 20]: Thus for the second time was she a fugitive -- then _ from _ , now _ to _ .
Parsing [sent. 7663 len. 34]: When Miss Dasomma had been down some time , she went up to see why Amy was not making her appearance : one glance around her room satisfied her that she was gone .
Parsing [sent. 7664 len. 6]: It caused her terrible anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 7665 len. 58]: She did not suspect at first whither she had gone , but concluded that the letter which had rendered her so miserable contained the announcement that their marriage was not a genuine one , and that , in the dignity of her true heart , she had thereupon at once and forever taken her leave of Cornelius .
Parsing [sent. 7666 len. 26]: She wrote to Hester , but the post did not leave before night , and would not arrive till the afternoon of the next day .
Parsing [sent. 7667 len. 16]: She had thought of sending a telegram , but saw that that might do mischief .
Parsing [sent. 7668 len. 20]: When Amy got to the station she found she was in time for the first train of the day .
Parsing [sent. 7669 len. 37]: There was no third-class to it , but she found she had enough money for a second-class ticket , and without a moment 's hesitation , though it left her almost penniless , she took one .
Parsing [sent. 7670 len. 3]: CHAPTER LVI .
Parsing [sent. 7671 len. 4]: THE SICK ROOM .
Parsing [sent. 7672 len. 45]: At Yrndale things went on in the same dull way , anger burrowing like a devil-mole in the bosom of the father , a dreary spiritual fog hanging over all the souls , and the mother wearying for some glimmer of a heavenly dawn .
Parsing [sent. 7673 len. 26]: Hester felt as if she could not endure it much longer -- as if the place were forgotten of God , and abandoned to chance .
Parsing [sent. 7674 len. 51]: But there was one dayspring in the house yet -- Mark 's room , where the major sat by the bedside of the boy , now reading to him , now telling him stories , and now and then listening to him as he talked childlike wisdom in childish words .
Parsing [sent. 7675 len. 18]: Saffy came and went , by no means so merry now that she was more with Corney .
Parsing [sent. 7676 len. 18]: In Mark 's room she would at times be her old self again , but nowhere else .
Parsing [sent. 7677 len. 25]: Infected by Corney , she had begun to be afraid of her father , and like him watched to keep out of his way .
Parsing [sent. 7678 len. 29]: What seemed to add to the misery , though in reality it operated the other way , was that the weather had again put on a wintry temper .
Parsing [sent. 7679 len. 22]: Sleet and hail , and even snow fell , alternated with rain and wind , day after day for a week .
Parsing [sent. 7680 len. 10]: One afternoon the wind rose almost to a tempest .
Parsing [sent. 7681 len. 20]: The rain drove in sheets , and came against the windows of Mark 's room nearly at right angles .
Parsing [sent. 7682 len. 22]: It was a cheerful room , though low-pitched and very old , with a great beam across the middle of it .
Parsing [sent. 7683 len. 26]: There were coloured prints , mostly of Scripture-subjects , on the walls ; and the beautiful fire burning in the bow-fronted grate shone on them .
Parsing [sent. 7684 len. 10]: It was reflected also from the brown polished floor .
Parsing [sent. 7685 len. 27]: The major sat by it in his easy-chair : he could endure hardship , but saved strength for work , nursing being none of the lightest .
Parsing [sent. 7686 len. 45]: A bedroom had been prepared for him next to the boy 's : Mark had a string close to his hand whose slightest pull sufficed to ring a bell , which woke the major as if it had been the opening of a cannonade .
Parsing [sent. 7687 len. 66]: This afternoon with the rain-charged wind rushing in fierce gusts every now and then against the windows , and the twilight coming on the sooner because the world was wrapt in blanket upon blanket of wet cloud , the major was reading , by no means sure whether his patient waked or slept , and himself very sleepy , longing indeed for a little nap .
Parsing [sent. 7688 len. 40]: A moment and he was far away , following an imaginary tiger , when the voice of Mark woke him with the question : `` What kind of thing do you like best in all the world , majie ?
Parsing [sent. 7689 len. 32]: -- I mean _ this _ world , you know -- and of course I do n't mean God or any_body _ , but things about you , I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 7690 len. 89]: The major sat bolt upright , rubbed his eyes , stretched himself , but quietly that Mark might not know he had waked him , pulled down his waistcoat , gave a hem as if deeply pondering , instead of trying hard to gather wits enough to understand the question put to him , and when he thought his voice sufficiently a waking one not to betray him , answered : `` Well , Mark , I do n't think we can beat this same -- can we ?
Parsing [sent. 7691 len. 6]: What do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7692 len. 11]: `` Let 's see what makes it so nice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7693 len. 3]: returned Mark .
Parsing [sent. 7694 len. 12]: `` First of all , you 're there , majie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7695 len. 13]: `` And you 're there , Markie , '' said the major .
Parsing [sent. 7696 len. 8]: `` Yes , that 's all right !
Parsing [sent. 7697 len. 21]: Next there 's my bed for me , and your easy-chair for you , and the fire for us both !
Parsing [sent. 7698 len. 17]: And the sight of your chair is better to me than the feel of my bed !
Parsing [sent. 7699 len. 37]: And the fire is _ beautiful _ , and though I ca n't _ feel _ that , because they 're not my legs , I know it is making your legs so nice and warm !
Parsing [sent. 7700 len. 13]: And then there are the shines of it all about the room !
Parsing [sent. 7701 len. 11]: `` What a beautiful thing a shine is , majie !
Parsing [sent. 7702 len. 35]: I wish you would put on your grand uniform , and let me see the fire shining on the gold lace and the buttons and the epaulettes and the hilt of your sword ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7703 len. 7]: `` I will , Markie . ''
Parsing [sent. 7704 len. 12]: `` I 've seen your sword , you know , majie !
Parsing [sent. 7705 len. 12]: and I think it is the beautifullest thing in the world .
Parsing [sent. 7706 len. 12]: I wonder why a thing for killing should be so beautiful !
Parsing [sent. 7707 len. 8]: Can you tell me , majie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7708 len. 25]: The major had to think in order to answer that question , but thinking he hit upon something like the truth of the thing .
Parsing [sent. 7709 len. 31]: `` It must be that it is not made for the sake of the killing , but for the sake of the right that would else be trodden down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7710 len. 18]: he said , `` Whatever is on the side of the right ought to be beautiful . ''
Parsing [sent. 7711 len. 10]: `` But ai n't a pirate 's sword beautiful ?
Parsing [sent. 7712 len. 15]: I 've read of precious stones in the hilt of a pirate 's sword !
Parsing [sent. 7713 len. 14]: That 's not for the right -- is it now , majie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7714 len. 37]: The boy was gradually educating the man without either of them knowing it -- for the major had to _ think _ in order to give reasonable answers to not a few of Mark 's questions .
Parsing [sent. 7715 len. 31]: The boy was an unconscious Socrates to the soldier ; for there is a Teacher who , by fitting them right together , can use two ignorances for two teachings .
Parsing [sent. 7716 len. 17]: Here the ostensible master , who was really the principal pupil , had to think hard .
Parsing [sent. 7717 len. 26]: `` Anything , '' he said at last , `` may be turned from its right use , and then it goes all wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 7718 len. 22]: `` But a sword looks all right -- it shines -- even when it is put to a wrong use ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7719 len. 10]: `` For a while , '' answered the major .
Parsing [sent. 7720 len. 17]: `` It takes time for anything that has turned bad to lose its good looks . ''
Parsing [sent. 7721 len. 19]: `` But , majie , '' said Mark , `` how can a sword ever grow ugly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7722 len. 7]: Again the major had to think .
Parsing [sent. 7723 len. 36]: `` When people put things to a bad use , they are not good themselves , '' he said ; `` and when they are not good , they are lazy , and neglect things .
Parsing [sent. 7724 len. 31]: When a soldier takes to drinking or cruelty , he neglects his weapons , and the rust begins to eat them , and at last will eat them up . ''
Parsing [sent. 7725 len. 8]: `` What is rust , majie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7726 len. 12]: `` It is a sword 's laziness , making it rot .
Parsing [sent. 7727 len. 24]: A sword is a very strong thing , but not taken care of will not last so long as a silk handkerchief . ''
Parsing [sent. 7728 len. 26]: At this point the major began to fear Mark was about to lead him into depths and contradictions out of which he would hardly emerge .
Parsing [sent. 7729 len. 12]: `` Sha 'n' t we go on with our reading ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7730 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 7731 len. 25]: Mark , however , had not lost sight of the subject they had started with , and did not want to leave it yet .
Parsing [sent. 7732 len. 20]: `` But , majie , '' he replied , `` we have n't done with what we like best !
Parsing [sent. 7733 len. 41]: We had n't said anything about the thick walls round us -- between us and the wide , with the fire-sun shining on their smooth side , while the rain is beating and the wind blowing on their rough side .
Parsing [sent. 7734 len. 19]: Then there 's the wind and the rain all about us , and ca n't come at us !
Parsing [sent. 7735 len. 41]: I fancy sometimes , as I lie awake in the night , that the wind and the rain are huge packs of wolves howling in a Russian forest , but not able to get into the house to hurt us .
Parsing [sent. 7736 len. 6]: Then I feel so safe !
Parsing [sent. 7737 len. 10]: And that brings me to the best of all .
Parsing [sent. 7738 len. 16]: It is in fancying danger that you know what it is to be safe . ''
Parsing [sent. 7739 len. 15]: `` But , Mark , you know some people are really in danger ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7740 len. 13]: `` Yes , I suppose so -- I do n't quite know !
Parsing [sent. 7741 len. 23]: I know that I am not in danger , because there is the great Think between me and all the danger ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7742 len. 16]: `` How do you know he is between you and _ all _ danger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7743 len. 19]: asked his friend , willing to draw him out , and with no fear of making him uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 7744 len. 23]: `` I do n't know how I know it ; I only know that I 'm not afraid , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 7745 len. 6]: `` I feel so safe !
Parsing [sent. 7746 len. 37]: For you know if God were to go to sleep and forget his little Mark , then he would forget that he was God , and would not wake again ; and that could not be !
Parsing [sent. 7747 len. 18]: He ca n't forget me or you , majie , more than any one of the sparrows .
Parsing [sent. 7748 len. 4]: Jesus said so .
Parsing [sent. 7749 len. 8]: And what Jesus said , lasts forever .
Parsing [sent. 7750 len. 14]: His words never wear out , or need to be made over again .
Parsing [sent. 7751 len. 13]: -- Majie , I do wish everybody was as good as Jesus !
Parsing [sent. 7752 len. 10]: He wo n't be pleased till we all are .
Parsing [sent. 7753 len. 5]: Is n't it glad !
Parsing [sent. 7754 len. 16]: That 's why I feel so safe that I like to hear the wind roaring .
Parsing [sent. 7755 len. 48]: If I did not know that he knows all about the wind , and that it is not the bad man 's wind , but the good man 's wind , I should be unhappy , for it might hurt somebody , and now it can not .
Parsing [sent. 7756 len. 33]: If I thought he did not care whether everybody was good or not , it would make me so miserable that I should like to die and never come to life again !
Parsing [sent. 7757 len. 14]: -- He will make Corney good -- wo n't he , majie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7758 len. 12]: `` I hope so , Markie , '' returned the major .
Parsing [sent. 7759 len. 18]: `` But do n't you think we ought to do something to help to make Corney good ?
Parsing [sent. 7760 len. 17]: You help me to be good , majie -- every day , and all day long !
Parsing [sent. 7761 len. 12]: I know mother teaches him , for he 's her first-born !
Parsing [sent. 7762 len. 11]: He 's like Jesus -- he 's God 's first-born !
Parsing [sent. 7763 len. 12]: I 'm so glad it was Jesus and not me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7764 len. 6]: `` Why , Mark ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7765 len. 18]: `` Because if it had been me , I should n't have had any Jesus to love .
Parsing [sent. 7766 len. 22]: -- But I do n't think we ought to leave Corney to mother all alone : she 's not strong enough !
Parsing [sent. 7767 len. 7]: it 's too hard for her !
Parsing [sent. 7768 len. 8]: Corney never was willing to be good !
Parsing [sent. 7769 len. 7]: I ca n't make it out !
Parsing [sent. 7770 len. 9]: Why should n't he like to be good ?
Parsing [sent. 7771 len. 9]: It 's surely good to be good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7772 len. 32]: `` Yes , Mark ; but some people like their own way when it 's ever so nasty , better than God 's way when it 's ever so nice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7773 len. 19]: `` But God must be able to let them know what foolish creatures they are , majie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7774 len. 23]: It was on the major 's lips to say ` He has sent you to teach it to me , Mark ! '
Parsing [sent. 7775 len. 10]: but he thought it better not to say it .
Parsing [sent. 7776 len. 26]: And indeed it was better the child should not be set thinking about what he could do so much better by not thinking about it !
Parsing [sent. 7777 len. 29]: The major had grown quite knowing in what was lovely in a soul -- could see the same thing lovely in the child and the Ancient of days .
Parsing [sent. 7778 len. 50]: Some foolishly object that the master taught what others had taught before him , as if he should not be the wise householder with his old things as well as new : these recognize the old things -- the new they do not understand , therefore do not consider .
Parsing [sent. 7779 len. 23]: Who first taught that the mighty God , the Lord , the maker of heaven and earth , was like a child !
Parsing [sent. 7780 len. 15]: Who first said , `` Love one another as I have loved you '' ?
Parsing [sent. 7781 len. 33]: Who first dared to say `` He that overcometh shall sit down with me on my throne even as I overcame and am set down with my father on his throne '' ?
Parsing [sent. 7782 len. 28]: -- taught men that the creature who would but be a true creature should share the glory of his creator , sitting with him upon his throne ?
Parsing [sent. 7783 len. 54]: `` You see , majie , '' Mark went on , `` it wo n't do for you and me to be so safe from all the storm and wind , wrapped in God 's cloak , and poor Corney out in the wind and rain , with the wolves howling after him !
Parsing [sent. 7784 len. 39]: You may say it 's his own fault -- it 's because he wo n't let God take him up and carry him : that 's very true , but then that 's just the pity of it !
Parsing [sent. 7785 len. 6]: -- It is so dreadful !
Parsing [sent. 7786 len. 7]: I ca n't understand it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7787 len. 12]: The boy could understand good , but was perplexed with evil .
Parsing [sent. 7788 len. 42]: While they talked thus in their nest of comfort there was one out in the wind and rain , all but spent with their buffeting , who hastened with what poor remaining strength she had to the doing of His will .
Parsing [sent. 7789 len. 46]: Amy , left at the station with an empty purse , had set out to walk through mire and darkness and storm , up hill and down dale , to find her husband -- the man God had given her `` to look after . ''
Parsing [sent. 7790 len. 3]: CHAPTER LVII .
Parsing [sent. 7791 len. 4]: VENGEANCE IS MINE .
Parsing [sent. 7792 len. 54]: That same morning , Mr. Raymount had found it , or chosen to imagine it necessary -- from the instinct , I believe to oppose inner with outer storm , to start pretty early for the county-town , on something he called business , and was not expected home before the next day .
Parsing [sent. 7793 len. 44]: Assuming heart in his absence , Cornelius went freely wandering about the house , many parts of which had not yet lost to him the interest of novelty , and lunched with his mother and Hester and Saffy like one of the family .
Parsing [sent. 7794 len. 88]: His mother , wisely or not , did her best to prevent his feeling any difference from old times : where one half of the parental pair erred so much on the side of severity , perhaps it was well that the other should err on that of leniency -- I do not know ; I doubt if it was right ; I think she ought to have justified her husband 's conduct , to the extent to which it would bear justification , by her own .
Parsing [sent. 7795 len. 23]: But who shall be sure what would have been right for another where so much was wrong and beyond her setting right !
Parsing [sent. 7796 len. 31]: If what is done be done in faith , some good will come out of our mistakes even ; only let no one mistake self-will for that perfect thing faith !
Parsing [sent. 7797 len. 12]: Their converse at table was neither very interesting nor very satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 7798 len. 5]: How could it be ?
Parsing [sent. 7799 len. 36]: As well might a child of Satan be happy in the house of Satan 's maker , as the unrepentant Cornelius in the house of his mother , even in the absence of his father .
Parsing [sent. 7800 len. 7]: Their talk was poor and intermittent .
Parsing [sent. 7801 len. 25]: Well might the youth long for his garret and the company of the wife who had nothing for him but smiles and sweetest attentions !
Parsing [sent. 7802 len. 12]: After dinner he sat for a time at the table alone .
Parsing [sent. 7803 len. 26]: He had been ordered wine during his recovery , and was already in some danger of adding a fondness for that to his other weaknesses .
Parsing [sent. 7804 len. 16]: He was one of those slight natures to which wine may bring a miserable consolation .
Parsing [sent. 7805 len. 23]: But the mother was wise , and aware of the clanger , kept in her own hands the administrating of the medicine .
Parsing [sent. 7806 len. 35]: To-day , however , by some accident called from the room , she had not put away the decanter , and Cornelius had several times filled his glass before she thought of her neglect .
Parsing [sent. 7807 len. 19]: When she re-entered he sat as if he were only finishing the glass she had left him with .
Parsing [sent. 7808 len. 21]: The decanter revealed what had taken place , but the mother blaming herself , thought it better to say nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7809 len. 35]: Cornelius leaving the room in a somewhat excited mood , but concealing it , sauntered into the library , and thence into the study , where was his father 's own collection of books .
Parsing [sent. 7810 len. 39]: Coming there upon a volume by a certain fashionable poet of the day , he lighted the lamp which no one used but his father , threw himself into his father 's chair , and began to read .
Parsing [sent. 7811 len. 28]: He never had been able to read long without weariness , and from the wine he had drunk and his weakness , was presently overcome with sleep .
Parsing [sent. 7812 len. 22]: His mother came and went , and would not disturb him , vexed that she failed in her care over him .
Parsing [sent. 7813 len. 6]: I fear , poor lady !
Parsing [sent. 7814 len. 33]: her satisfaction in having him under her roof was beginning to wane in the continual trouble of a presence that showed no signs of growth any more than one of the dead .
Parsing [sent. 7815 len. 20]: But her faith in the over-care of the father of all was strong , and she waited in hope .
Parsing [sent. 7816 len. 20]: The night now was very dark , `` with hey , ho , the wind and the rain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7817 len. 39]: Up above , the major and the boy talked of sweet , heavenly things , and down below the youth lay snoring , where , had his father been at home , he dared not have showed himself .
Parsing [sent. 7818 len. 32]: The mother was in her own room , and Hester in the drawing-room -- where never now , in the oppression of these latter times , did she open her piano .
Parsing [sent. 7819 len. 22]: The house was quiet but for the noise of the wind and the rain , and those Cornelius did not hear .
Parsing [sent. 7820 len. 9]: He started awake and sat up in terror .
Parsing [sent. 7821 len. 22]: A hand was on his shoulder , gripping him like a metal instrument , not a thing of flesh and blood .
Parsing [sent. 7822 len. 18]: The face of his father was staring at him through the lingering vapours of his stupid sleep .
Parsing [sent. 7823 len. 66]: Mr. Raymount had started with a certain foolish pleasure in the prospect of getting wet through , and being generally ill-used by the weather -- which he called _ atrocious _ , and all manner of evil names , while not the less he preferred its accompaniment to his thoughts to the finest blue sky and sunshine a southern summer itself could have given him .
Parsing [sent. 7824 len. 20]: Thinking to shorten the way he took a certain cut he knew , but found the road very bad .
Parsing [sent. 7825 len. 35]: The mud drew off one of his horse 's shoes , but he did not discover the loss for a long way -- not until he came to a piece of newly mended road .
Parsing [sent. 7826 len. 8]: There the poor animal fell suddenly lame .
Parsing [sent. 7827 len. 19]: There was a roadside smithy a mile or two farther on , and dismounting he made for that .
Parsing [sent. 7828 len. 31]: The smith , however , not having expected anything to do in such weather , and having been drinking hard the night before , was not easily persuaded to appear .
Parsing [sent. 7829 len. 34]: Mr. Raymount , therefore , leaving his horse in the smithy , walked to an inn yet a mile or two farther on , and there dried his clothes and had some refreshment .
Parsing [sent. 7830 len. 51]: By the time his horse was brought him and he was again mounted , the weather was worse than ever ; he thought he had had enough of it ; and it was so late besides that he could not have reached the town in time to do his business .
Parsing [sent. 7831 len. 28]: He gave up his intended journey therefore , and turning aside to see a friend in the neighbourhood , resolved to go home again the same night .
Parsing [sent. 7832 len. 28]: His feelings when he saw his son asleep in his chair , were not like those of the father in that one story of all the world .
Parsing [sent. 7833 len. 32]: He had been giving place to the devil for so long , that the devil was now able to do with him as he would -- for a season at least .
Parsing [sent. 7834 len. 30]: Nor would the possessed ever have been able to recognize the presence of the devil , had he not a minute or two of his full will with them ?
Parsing [sent. 7835 len. 17]: Or is it that the miserable possessed goes farther than the devil means him to go ?
Parsing [sent. 7836 len. 21]: I doubt if he cares that we should murder ; I fancy he is satisfied if only we hate well .
Parsing [sent. 7837 len. 14]: Murder tends a little to repentance , and he does not want that .
Parsing [sent. 7838 len. 22]: Anyhow , we cherish the devil like a spoiled child , till he gets too bad and we find him unendurable .
Parsing [sent. 7839 len. 28]: Departing then , he takes a piece of the house with him , and the tenant is not so likely to mistake him when he comes again .
Parsing [sent. 7840 len. 37]: Must I confess it at this man so much before the multitude of men , that he was annoyed , even angry , to see this unpleasant son of his asleep in _ his _ chair !
Parsing [sent. 7841 len. 5]: `` The sneak ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7842 len. 3]: he said !
Parsing [sent. 7843 len. 31]: `` he dares not show his face when I 'm at home , but the minute he thinks me safe , gets into my room and lies in my chair !
Parsing [sent. 7844 len. 8]: Drunk , too , by Jove ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7845 len. 20]: he added , as a fume from the sleeper 's breath reached the nostrils beginning to dilate with wrath .
Parsing [sent. 7846 len. 18]: `` What can that wife of mine be about , letting the rascal go on like this !
Parsing [sent. 7847 len. 20]: She is faultless except in giving me such a son -- and then helping him to fool me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7848 len. 10]: He forgot the old forger of a bygone century !
Parsing [sent. 7849 len. 31]: His side of the house had , I should say , a good deal more to do with what was unsatisfactory in the lad 's character than his wife 's .
Parsing [sent. 7850 len. 14]: The devil saw his chance , sprang up , and mastered the father .
Parsing [sent. 7851 len. 6]: `` The snoring idiot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7852 len. 19]: he growled , and seizing his boy by the shoulder and the neck , roughly shook him awake .
Parsing [sent. 7853 len. 40]: The father had been drinking , not what would have been by any of the neighbours thought too much , but enough to add to the fierceness of his wrath , and make him yet more capable of injustice .
Parsing [sent. 7854 len. 47]: He had come into the study straight from the stable , and when the poor creature looked up half awake , and saw his father standing over him with a heavy whip in his hand , he was filled with a terror that nearly paralyzed him .
Parsing [sent. 7855 len. 47]: He sat and stared with white , trembling lips , red , projecting eyes , and a look that confirmed the belief of his father that he was drunk , whereas he had only been , like himself , drinking more than was good for him .
Parsing [sent. 7856 len. 10]: `` Get out of there , you dog ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7857 len. 23]: cried his father , and with one sweep of his powerful arm , half dragged , half hurled him from the chair .
Parsing [sent. 7858 len. 17]: He fell on the floor , and in weakness mixed with cowardice lay where he fell .
Parsing [sent. 7859 len. 71]: The devil -- I am sorry to have to refer to the person so often , but he played a notable part in the affair , and I should be more sorry to leave him without his part in it duly acknowledged -- the devil , I say , finding the house abandoned to him , rushed at once into brain and heart and limbs , and _ possessed _ .
Parsing [sent. 7860 len. 69]: When Raymount saw the creature who had turned his hitherto happy life into a shame and a misery lying at his feet thus abject , he became instantly conscious of the whip in his hand , and without a moment 's pause , a moment 's thought , heaved his arm aloft , and brought it down with a fierce lash on the quivering flesh of his son .
Parsing [sent. 7861 len. 16]: He richly deserved the punishment , but God would not have struck him that way .
Parsing [sent. 7862 len. 10]: There was the poison of hate in the blow .
Parsing [sent. 7863 len. 34]: He again raised his arm ; but as it descended , the piercing shriek that broke from the youth startled even the possessing demon , and the violence of the blow was broken .
Parsing [sent. 7864 len. 21]: But the lash of the whip found his face , and marked it for a time worse than the small-pox .
Parsing [sent. 7865 len. 14]: What the unnatural father would have done next , I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 7866 len. 33]: While the cry of his son yet sounded in his ears , another cry like its echo from another world , rang ghastly through the storm like the cry of the banshee .
Parsing [sent. 7867 len. 17]: From far away it seemed to come through the world of wet mist and howling wind .
Parsing [sent. 7868 len. 24]: The next instant a spectral face flitted swift as a bird up to the window , and laid itself close to the glass .
Parsing [sent. 7869 len. 20]: It was a French window , opening to the ground , and neither shutters nor curtains had been closed .
Parsing [sent. 7870 len. 42]: It burst open with a great clang and clash and wide tinkle of shivering and scattering glass , and a small figure leaped into the room with a second cry that sounded like a curse in the ears of the father .
Parsing [sent. 7871 len. 33]: She threw herself on the prostrate youth , and covered his body with hers , then turned her head and looked up at the father with indignant defiance in her flashing eye .
Parsing [sent. 7872 len. 27]: Cowed with terror , and smarting with keenest pain , the youth took his wife in his arms and sobbed like the beaten thing he was .
Parsing [sent. 7873 len. 10]: Amy 's eye gleamed if possible more indignantly still .
Parsing [sent. 7874 len. 12]: Protection grew fierce , and fanned the burning sense of wrong .
Parsing [sent. 7875 len. 38]: The father stood over them like a fury rather than a fate -- stood as the shock of Amy 's cry , and her stormy entrance , like that of an avenging angel , had fixed him .
Parsing [sent. 7876 len. 46]: But presently he began to recover his senses , and not unnaturally sprang to the conclusion that here was the cause of all his misery -- some worthless girl that had drawn Cornelius into her toils , and ruined him and his family for ever !
Parsing [sent. 7877 len. 17]: The thought set the geyser of his rage roaring and spouting in the face of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 7878 len. 31]: He heaved his whip , and the devil having none of the respect of the ordinary well bred Englishman for even the least adorable of women , the blow fell .
Parsing [sent. 7879 len. 36]: But instead of another and shriller shriek following the lash , came nothing but a shudder and a silence and the unquailing eye of the girl fixed like that of a spectre upon her assailant .
Parsing [sent. 7880 len. 5]: He struck her again .
Parsing [sent. 7881 len. 24]: Again came the shivering shudder and the silence : the sense that the blows had not fallen upon Corney upheld the brave creature .
Parsing [sent. 7882 len. 10]: Cry she would not , if he killed her !
Parsing [sent. 7883 len. 27]: She once drew in her breath sharply , but never took her eyes from his face -- lay expecting the blow that was to come next .
Parsing [sent. 7884 len. 37]: Suddenly the light in them began to fade , and went quickly out ; her head dropped like a stone upon the breast of her cowardly husband , and there was not even mute defiance more .
Parsing [sent. 7885 len. 8]: What if he had killed the woman !
Parsing [sent. 7886 len. 4]: At an inquest !
Parsing [sent. 7887 len. 5]: A trial for murder !
Parsing [sent. 7888 len. 21]: -- In lowest depths Raymount saw a lower deep , and stood looking down on the pair with subsiding passion .
Parsing [sent. 7889 len. 20]: Amy had walked all the long distance from the station and more , for she had lost her way .
Parsing [sent. 7890 len. 36]: Again and again she had all but lain down to die on the moorland waste on to which she had wandered , when the thought of Corney and his need of her roused her again .
Parsing [sent. 7891 len. 59]: Wet through and through , buffeted by the wind so that she could hardly breathe , having had nothing but a roll to eat since the night before , but aware of the want of food only by its faintness , cold to the very heart , and almost unconscious of her numbed limbs , she struggled on .
Parsing [sent. 7892 len. 33]: When at last she got to the lodge gate , the woman in charge of it took her for a common beggar , and could hardly be persuaded to let her pass .
Parsing [sent. 7893 len. 16]: She was just going up to the door when she heard her husband 's cry .
Parsing [sent. 7894 len. 17]: She saw the lighted window , flew to it , dashed it open , and entered .
Parsing [sent. 7895 len. 14]: It was the last expiring effort of the poor remnant of her strength .
Parsing [sent. 7896 len. 16]: She had not life enough left to resist the shock of her father-in-law 's blows .
Parsing [sent. 7897 len. 21]: While still the father stood looking down on his children , the door softly opened , and the mother entered .
Parsing [sent. 7898 len. 29]: She knew nothing , not even that her husband had returned , came merely to know how her unlovely but beloved child was faring in his heavy sleep .
Parsing [sent. 7899 len. 4]: She stood arrested .
Parsing [sent. 7900 len. 37]: She saw what looked like a murdered heap on the floor , and her husband standing over it , like the murderer beginning to doubt whether the deed was as satisfactory as the doing of it .
Parsing [sent. 7901 len. 15]: But behind her came Hester , and peeping over her shoulder understood at once .
Parsing [sent. 7902 len. 13]: Almost she pushed her mother aside , as she sprang to help .
Parsing [sent. 7903 len. 7]: Her father would have prevented her .
Parsing [sent. 7904 len. 6]: `` No , father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7905 len. 11]: she said , `` it is time to disobey . ''
Parsing [sent. 7906 len. 17]: A pang as of death went through her at the thought that she had not spoken .
Parsing [sent. 7907 len. 4]: All was clear !
Parsing [sent. 7908 len. 13]: Amy had come , and died defending her husband from his father !
Parsing [sent. 7909 len. 34]: She put her strong arms round the dainty little figure , and lifted it like a seaweed hanging limp , its long wet hair continuing the hang of the body and helpless head .
Parsing [sent. 7910 len. 6]: Hester gave a great sob .
Parsing [sent. 7911 len. 13]: Was this what Amy 's lovely brave womanhood had brought her to !
Parsing [sent. 7912 len. 5]: What creatures men were !
Parsing [sent. 7913 len. 18]: As the thought passed through her , she saw on Amy 's neck a frightful upswollen wale .
Parsing [sent. 7914 len. 6]: She looked at her father .
Parsing [sent. 7915 len. 8]: There was the whip in his hand !
Parsing [sent. 7916 len. 6]: `` Oh , papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7917 len. 31]: she screamed , and dropped her eyes for shame : she could not look him in the face -- not for his shame , but for her shame through him .
Parsing [sent. 7918 len. 16]: And as she dropped them she saw the terrified face of Cornelius open its eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7919 len. 6]: `` Oh , Corney ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7920 len. 19]: said Hester , in the tone of an accusing angel , and ran with her from the room .
Parsing [sent. 7921 len. 7]: The mother darted to her son .
Parsing [sent. 7922 len. 16]: But the wrath of the father rose afresh at sight of her `` infatuation . ''
Parsing [sent. 7923 len. 7]: `` Let the hound lie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7924 len. 7]: he said , and stepped between .
Parsing [sent. 7925 len. 13]: `` What right has he to walk the earth like a man !
Parsing [sent. 7926 len. 12]: He is but fit to go on all fours -- Ha !
Parsing [sent. 7927 len. 3]: ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7928 len. 18]: he went on , laughing wildly , `` I begin to believe in the transmigration of souls !
Parsing [sent. 7929 len. 18]: I shall one day see that son of yours running about the place a mangy mongrel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7930 len. 8]: `` You 've killed him , Gerald !
Parsing [sent. 7931 len. 6]: -- your own son ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7932 len. 11]: said the mother , with a cold , still voice .
Parsing [sent. 7933 len. 23]: She saw the dread mark on his face , felt like one of the dead -- staggered , and would have fallen .
Parsing [sent. 7934 len. 17]: But the arm that through her son had struck her heart , caught and supported her .
Parsing [sent. 7935 len. 51]: The husband bore the wife once more to her chamber , and the foolish son , the heaviness of his mother , was left alone on the floor , smarting , ashamed , and full of fear for his wife , yet in ignorance that his father had hurt her .
Parsing [sent. 7936 len. 6]: A moment and he rose .
Parsing [sent. 7937 len. 14]: But , lo , in that shameful time a marvel had been wrought !
Parsing [sent. 7938 len. 12]: The terror of his father which had filled him was gone .
Parsing [sent. 7939 len. 21]: They had met ; his father had put himself in the wrong ; he was no more afraid of him .
Parsing [sent. 7940 len. 10]: It was not hate that had cast out fear .
Parsing [sent. 7941 len. 54]: I do not say that he felt no resentment , he is a noble creature who , deserving to be beaten , approves and accepts : there are not a few such children : Cornelius was none of such ; but it consoled him that he had been hardly used by his father .
Parsing [sent. 7942 len. 82]: He had been accustomed to look vaguely up to his father as a sort of rigid but righteous divinity ; and in a disobedient , self-indulgent , poverty-stricken nature like his , reverence could only take the form of fear ; and now that he had seen his father in a rage , the feeling of reverence , such as it was , had begun to give way , and with it the fear : they were more upon a level .
Parsing [sent. 7943 len. 35]: Then again , his father 's unmerciful use of the whip to him seemed a sort of settling of scores , thence in a measure , a breaking down of the wall between them .
Parsing [sent. 7944 len. 23]: He seemed thereby to have even some sort of claim upon his father : so cruelly beaten he seemed now near him .
Parsing [sent. 7945 len. 28]: A weight as of a rock was lifted from his mind by this violent blowing up of the horrible negation that had been between them so long .
Parsing [sent. 7946 len. 24]: He felt -- as when punished in boyhood -- as if the storm had passed , and the sun had begun to appear .
Parsing [sent. 7947 len. 9]: Life seemed a trifle less uninteresting than before .
Parsing [sent. 7948 len. 14]: He did not yet know to what a state his wife was brought .
Parsing [sent. 7949 len. 8]: He knew she was safe with Hester .
Parsing [sent. 7950 len. 42]: He listened , and finding all quiet , stole , smarting and aching , yet cherishing his hurts like a possession , slowly to his room , there tumbled himself into bed , and longed for Amy to come to him .
Parsing [sent. 7951 len. 14]: He was an invalid , and could not go about looking for her !
Parsing [sent. 7952 len. 8]: it was her part to find him !
Parsing [sent. 7953 len. 22]: In a few minutes he was fast asleep once more , and forgot everything in dreams of the garret with Amy .
Parsing [sent. 7954 len. 14]: When Mrs. Raymount came to herself , she looked up at her husband .
Parsing [sent. 7955 len. 17]: He stood expecting such reproaches as never yet in their married life had she given him .
Parsing [sent. 7956 len. 16]: But she stretched out her arms to him , and drew him to her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 7957 len. 51]: Her pity for the misery which could have led him to behave so ill , joined to her sympathy in the distressing repentance which she did not doubt must have already begun , for she knew her husband , made her treat him much as she treated her wretched Corney .
Parsing [sent. 7958 len. 9]: It went deep to the man 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 7959 len. 58]: In the deep sense of degredation that had seized him -- not for striking his son , who , he said , and said over and over to himself , entirely deserved it , but for striking a woman , be she who she might -- his wife 's embrace was like balm to a stinging wound .
Parsing [sent. 7960 len. 42]: But it was only when , through Hester 's behaviour to her and the words that fell from her , he came to know who she was , that the iron , the beneficent spear-head of remorse , entered his soul .
Parsing [sent. 7961 len. 32]: Strange that the mere fact of our knowing _ who a person is _ , should make such a difference in the way we think of and behave to that person !
Parsing [sent. 7962 len. 34]: A person is a person just the same , whether one of the few of our acquaintances or not , and his claim on us for all kinds of humanities just the same .
Parsing [sent. 7963 len. 24]: Our knowledge of any one is a mere accident in the claim , and can at most only make us feel it more .
Parsing [sent. 7964 len. 10]: But recognition of Amy showed his crime more heinous .
Parsing [sent. 7965 len. 55]: It brought back to Mr. Raymount 's mind the vision of the bright girl he used to watch in her daft and cheerful service , and with that vision came the conviction that not she but Corney must be primarily to blame : he had twice struck the woman his son had grievously wronged !
Parsing [sent. 7966 len. 36]: He must make to her whatever atonement was possible -- first for having brought the villain into the world to do her such wrong , then for his own cruelty to her in her faithfulness !
Parsing [sent. 7967 len. 42]: He pronounced himself the most despicable and wretched of men : he had lifted his hand against a woman that had been but in her right in following his son , and had shown herself ready to die in his defence !
Parsing [sent. 7968 len. 31]: His wife 's tenderness confirmed the predominance of these feelings , and he lay down in his dressing-room a humbler man than he had ever been in his life before .
Parsing [sent. 7969 len. 3]: CHAPTER LVIII .
Parsing [sent. 7970 len. 4]: FATHER AND DAUGHTER-IN-LAW .
Parsing [sent. 7971 len. 31]: Hester carried poor little Amy to her own room , laid her on her own bed , and did for her all one child of God could do for another .
Parsing [sent. 7972 len. 62]: With hands tender as a mother 's , and weeping as she had never wept before , she undressed her , put her in a warm bath , then got her into bed , and used every enticement and persuasion to induce her to take some nourishment -- with poor success : the heart seemed to have gone out of her .
Parsing [sent. 7973 len. 20]: But instinctively Amy asked for milk , and that brought her round better than anything else could have done .
Parsing [sent. 7974 len. 13]: Still she lay like one dead , seeming to care for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7975 len. 28]: She scarcely answered Hester when she spoke , though she tried to smile to her : the most pitiful thing was that smile Hester had ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 7976 len. 15]: Her very brain and blood were haunted with the presence of Corney 's father .
Parsing [sent. 7977 len. 17]: He seemed ever and always to be standing over her and Corney with that terrible whip .
Parsing [sent. 7978 len. 14]: All her thought was how to get him away from the frightful place .
Parsing [sent. 7979 len. 8]: Hester did her best to reassure her .
Parsing [sent. 7980 len. 35]: She told her Corney was fast asleep and little the worse ; did all she could to keep her quiet , and soothe her to sleep ; and a little after midnight was successful .
Parsing [sent. 7981 len. 15]: Then she lay down herself on the sofa beside her bed , sorely exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 7982 len. 10]: In the gray of the morning Mr. Raymount woke .
Parsing [sent. 7983 len. 10]: He was aware of a great hush about him .
Parsing [sent. 7984 len. 19]: He looked from the window , and saw in the east the first glimmer of a lovely spring-day .
Parsing [sent. 7985 len. 8]: The stillness awed , almost frightened him .
Parsing [sent. 7986 len. 28]: It was not around him only but in him ; his very soul seemed hushed , as if in his sleep the Voice had said `` Peace !
Parsing [sent. 7987 len. 4]: be still ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7988 len. 20]: He felt like a naughty child , who , having slept , seems to have slept away his naughtiness .
Parsing [sent. 7989 len. 29]: Yesterday seemed far away -- only the shudder of it was left ; but he knew if he began to think it would be back with its agony .
Parsing [sent. 7990 len. 11]: Had some angel been by his bedside to soothe him ?
Parsing [sent. 7991 len. 7]: A demon had surely possessed him !
Parsing [sent. 7992 len. 32]: Had it been but hinted as within the bounds of possibility that he should behave to a woman as he had behaved , he would have laughed the idea to scorn !
Parsing [sent. 7993 len. 9]: He had always thought himself a chivalrous gentleman !
Parsing [sent. 7994 len. 10]: This was the end of his faith in himself !
Parsing [sent. 7995 len. 11]: His grand Hester would not feel herself safe from him !
Parsing [sent. 7996 len. 19]: Truly a demon had possessed him : might not an angel have been by him as he slept ?
Parsing [sent. 7997 len. 8]: What had become of the poor girl ?
Parsing [sent. 7998 len. 25]: But he needed not to be anxious about her : neither his wife nor his daughter would have turned her out into the night !
Parsing [sent. 7999 len. 11]: He would still be able to do something for her !
Parsing [sent. 8000 len. 10]: He must make atonement for treating her so brutally !
Parsing [sent. 8001 len. 8]: Hope dawned feebly on his murky horizon .
Parsing [sent. 8002 len. 20]: He would be good to her as he would never have thought of had he not ill-used her so !
Parsing [sent. 8003 len. 17]: There was something to be done for everybody -- for himself and for poor Amy Amber !
Parsing [sent. 8004 len. 15]: If she was gone he would spend every penny he had to find her !
Parsing [sent. 8005 len. 5]: But Cornelius would know !
Parsing [sent. 8006 len. 5]: He must see him !
Parsing [sent. 8007 len. 12]: He would tell him he was sorry he had struck him !
Parsing [sent. 8008 len. 16]: In the yet dark gray of the morning he went to his son 's room .
Parsing [sent. 8009 len. 16]: When he had all but reached the door he saw it was a little open .
Parsing [sent. 8010 len. 12]: The next instant he heard a soft voice within speaking persuadingly .
Parsing [sent. 8011 len. 6]: He went close and listened .
Parsing [sent. 8012 len. 6]: It was Amy 's voice !
Parsing [sent. 8013 len. 5]: -- In his house !
Parsing [sent. 8014 len. 6]: In his son 's room !
Parsing [sent. 8015 len. 13]: And after the lesson he had given them but the night before !
Parsing [sent. 8016 len. 5]: This was too bad !
Parsing [sent. 8017 len. 9]: He pushed the door -- and looked in !
Parsing [sent. 8018 len. 24]: The dainty little figure that had haunted his dreams was half lying on the bed , with an arm thrown round his son .
Parsing [sent. 8019 len. 20]: He could not see her face , but he could hear perfectly the words that came through the dusk .
Parsing [sent. 8020 len. 5]: `` Corney darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8021 len. 9]: she said , `` you must get up .
Parsing [sent. 8022 len. 5]: You must come away .
Parsing [sent. 8023 len. 9]: Here I am to take you from them .
Parsing [sent. 8024 len. 10]: I was sure they were not treating you well !
Parsing [sent. 8025 len. 7]: That was what made me come .
Parsing [sent. 8026 len. 17]: I did not know how cruel they were , or I would have come long ago .
Parsing [sent. 8027 len. 12]: But , Corney , you must have done something very wrong !
Parsing [sent. 8028 len. 22]: I do n't mean to me ; I do n't care what you do to me ; I am your own .
Parsing [sent. 8029 len. 17]: But you must have done something very wrong to make your father so angry with you !
Parsing [sent. 8030 len. 17]: And you can not have said you were sorry , or he would have forgiven you !
Parsing [sent. 8031 len. 15]: He ca n't be a bad man -- though he does hurt dreadfully ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8032 len. 9]: `` He is a very good man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8033 len. 6]: muttered Corney from the pillow .
Parsing [sent. 8034 len. 30]: `` But I 'm afraid , '' continued Amy , `` if he has n't been able to make you sorry before , he will never be able now !
Parsing [sent. 8035 len. 15]: To beat you as he did last night will never make you repent . ''
Parsing [sent. 8036 len. 10]: `` Oh , he did n't hurt me much !
Parsing [sent. 8037 len. 29]: You do n't think a fellow would mind that sort of thing from his own father -- when he was in a passion , do n't you know ?
Parsing [sent. 8038 len. 20]: Besides , Amy -- to you I will confess it -- I only gave him too good reason . ''
Parsing [sent. 8039 len. 7]: `` Come , then , come .
Parsing [sent. 8040 len. 5]: We will go somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 8041 len. 28]: I want to make you think the right way about the thing ; and when you are sorry , we will come back and tell him so .
Parsing [sent. 8042 len. 15]: Then perhaps he will forgive me and we shall be all happy again . ''
Parsing [sent. 8043 len. 6]: What was this he heard !
Parsing [sent. 8044 len. 4]: The cunning creature !
Parsing [sent. 8045 len. 11]: This was her trick to entice him from his home !
Parsing [sent. 8046 len. 13]: -- And just as the poor boy was beginning to repent too !
Parsing [sent. 8047 len. 5]: She knew her trade !
Parsing [sent. 8048 len. 12]: She would fall in with his better mood and pretend goodness !
Parsing [sent. 8049 len. 10]: She would help him to do what he ought !
Parsing [sent. 8050 len. 8]: She would be his teacher in righteousness !
Parsing [sent. 8051 len. 13]: Deep , deep she was -- beyond anything he had dreamed possible !
Parsing [sent. 8052 len. 30]: No doubt the fellow was just as bad as she , but not the less must he do what little he yet might for the redemption of his son !
Parsing [sent. 8053 len. 54]: But as he thought thus it smote him that Cornelius could not but prefer going with one who loved him , and talked to him like that , let her be what she might , to staying with a father who treated him as he had been doing ever since he came home !
Parsing [sent. 8054 len. 10]: He would behave to him very differently after this !
Parsing [sent. 8055 len. 11]: But he must interfere now , cost what it might !
Parsing [sent. 8056 len. 7]: What else was he father for !
Parsing [sent. 8057 len. 9]: He pushed the door wide and went in .
Parsing [sent. 8058 len. 16]: Amy heard and raised herself from the bed , stood upright and faced the comer .
Parsing [sent. 8059 len. 13]: There was just light enough to see that it was the father .
Parsing [sent. 8060 len. 27]: The horrid idea shot through her mind that it was his custom to come thus to his son 's room in the night and lash him .
Parsing [sent. 8061 len. 16]: She roused every fevered nerve to do battle with the strong man for his son .
Parsing [sent. 8062 len. 20]: Clenching her little hands hard , she stood like a small David between the bed and the coming Goliath .
Parsing [sent. 8063 len. 17]: `` Get out of this , '' he said , with the sternness of wrath suppressed .
Parsing [sent. 8064 len. 22]: `` I came to take him away , '' said Amy , who had begun to tremble from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 8065 len. 12]: `` It is my business to take care of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 8066 len. 23]: `` Your business to take care of him from his own '' -- he hesitated , then said -- `` mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8067 len. 8]: which certainly was the more fitting word .
Parsing [sent. 8068 len. 41]: `` If , '' answered Amy , `` a man is to leave father and mother and cleave to his wife , it 's the least thing the wife can do to take care of him from his father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8069 len. 11]: Mr. Raymount stood confounded : what could the hussey mean ?
Parsing [sent. 8070 len. 11]: Was she going to pretend she was married to him ?
Parsing [sent. 8071 len. 24]: Indignation and rage began to rise afresh ; but if he gave way what might he not be guilty of a second time !
Parsing [sent. 8072 len. 29]: A rush of shame choked the words that crowded to his lips ; and with the self-restraint came wholesome doubt : was it possible he had married her ?
Parsing [sent. 8073 len. 5]: Was it not possible ?
Parsing [sent. 8074 len. 20]: Would it not be just worthy of him to have done so and never told one of his family !
Parsing [sent. 8075 len. 10]: At least there need be nothing incredible in it !
Parsing [sent. 8076 len. 25]: This girl -- yes -- plainly she had both cunning and fascination enough to make him not only run after her but marry her !
Parsing [sent. 8077 len. 12]: How was he to come at the truth of the thing ?
Parsing [sent. 8078 len. 20]: The coward would not have the courage to contradict her , but he would know if he were lying !
Parsing [sent. 8079 len. 30]: `` Do you mean to tell me , '' he said , `` that he has married you -- without a word to his own father or mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8080 len. 34]: Then out at last spoke Cornelius , rising on his elbow in the bed : `` Yes , father , '' he said , with slow determination , `` I have married her .
Parsing [sent. 8081 len. 11]: It is all my fault , not one bit hers .
Parsing [sent. 8082 len. 23]: I could never have persuaded her had I not made her believe you knew all about it and had no objection . ''
Parsing [sent. 8083 len. 11]: `` Why did you not let us know then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8084 len. 15]: cried the father in a voice which ill suited the tameness of the question .
Parsing [sent. 8085 len. 17]: `` Because I was a coward , '' answered Corney , speaking the truth with courage .
Parsing [sent. 8086 len. 10]: `` I knew you would not like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8087 len. 14]: `` Little _ you _ know of what I like or dislike ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8088 len. 11]: `` You can soon prove him wrong , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8089 len. 21]: said Amy , clasping her hands , and looking up in his face through the growing light of the morning .
Parsing [sent. 8090 len. 24]: `` Forgive us , and take me too ; I was so happy to think I was going to belong to you all !
Parsing [sent. 8091 len. 19]: I would never have married him , if I had known -- without your consent , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 8092 len. 19]: It was very wrong of Corney , but I will try to make him sorry for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8093 len. 6]: `` You never will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8094 len. 11]: said Corney , again burying his head in the pillow .
Parsing [sent. 8095 len. 18]: Now first the full horror of what he had done broke upon the mind of Mr. Raymount .
Parsing [sent. 8096 len. 7]: He stood for a moment appalled .
Parsing [sent. 8097 len. 11]: `` You will let me take him away then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8098 len. 10]: said Amy , thinking he hesitated to receive her .
Parsing [sent. 8099 len. 39]: Now whether it was from an impulse of honesty towards her , or of justification of himself , I can not tell , but he instantly returned : `` Do you know that his money is stolen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8100 len. 18]: `` If he stole it , '' she replied , `` he will never steal again . ''
Parsing [sent. 8101 len. 8]: `` He will never get another chance .
Parsing [sent. 8102 len. 9]: He can not get a situation now . ''
Parsing [sent. 8103 len. 7]: `` I will work for both .
Parsing [sent. 8104 len. 27]: It will only be me instead of him , and that 's no difference ; he belongs to me as much as I do to him .
Parsing [sent. 8105 len. 16]: If he had only kept nothing from me , nothing of this would have happened .
Parsing [sent. 8106 len. 24]: -- Do come , Corney , while I am able to walk ; I feel as if I were going to die . ''
Parsing [sent. 8107 len. 16]: `` And this is the woman I was such a savage to last night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8108 len. 6]: said Mr. Raymount to himself .
Parsing [sent. 8109 len. 7]: `` Forgive me , Amy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8110 len. 10]: he cried , stretching out his arms to her .
Parsing [sent. 8111 len. 8]: `` I have behaved like a brute !
Parsing [sent. 8112 len. 7]: To strike my son 's wife !
Parsing [sent. 8113 len. 8]: I deserve to be hanged for it !
Parsing [sent. 8114 len. 6]: I shall never forgive myself !
Parsing [sent. 8115 len. 11]: But you must forgive me for Christ 's sake . ''
Parsing [sent. 8116 len. 23]: Long ere he had ended Amy was in his arms , clinging to him -- he holding her fast to his bosom .
Parsing [sent. 8117 len. 16]: The strong man was now the weaker ; the father and not the daughter wept .
Parsing [sent. 8118 len. 6]: She drew back her head .
Parsing [sent. 8119 len. 13]: `` Come , Corney , '' she cried ; `` come directly !
Parsing [sent. 8120 len. 20]: Out of your bed and down on your knees to your own blessed father , and confess your sins .
Parsing [sent. 8121 len. 17]: Tell him you 're sorry for them , and you 'll never do them again . ''
Parsing [sent. 8122 len. 23]: Corney obeyed : in some strange , lovely way she had got the mistressship of his conscience as well as his heart .
Parsing [sent. 8123 len. 33]: He got out of bed at once , went straight down on his knees as she told him , and though he did not speak , was presently weeping like a child .
Parsing [sent. 8124 len. 23]: It was a strange group in the gray of the new morning -- ah , indeed , a new morning for them !
Parsing [sent. 8125 len. 27]: -- the girl in the arms of the elderly man , and the youth kneeling at their feet , both men weeping and the girl radiant .
Parsing [sent. 8126 len. 24]: Gerald Raymount closed the door on his son and his son 's wife , and hastened to his own to tell her all .
Parsing [sent. 8127 len. 18]: `` Then surely will the forgiveness of God and his father take away Corney 's disgrace ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8128 len. 4]: said the mother .
Parsing [sent. 8129 len. 25]: The arrival of this state of things was much favoured by the severe illness into which Amy fell immediately the strain was off her .
Parsing [sent. 8130 len. 9]: She was brought almost to death 's door .
Parsing [sent. 8131 len. 36]: Corney in his turn became nurse , and improved not a little from his own anxiety , her sweetness , and the sympathy of every one , his father included , with both of them .
Parsing [sent. 8132 len. 32]: But such was her constitution that when she began to recover she recovered rapidly , and was soon ready for the share lovingly allotted her in the duties of the house .
Parsing [sent. 8133 len. 3]: CHAPTER LIX .
Parsing [sent. 8134 len. 3]: THE MESSAGE .
Parsing [sent. 8135 len. 36]: But the precious little Mark did not get better ; and it soon became very clear to the major that , although months might elapse ere he left them , go he must before long .
Parsing [sent. 8136 len. 12]: It was the sole cloud that now hung over the family .
Parsing [sent. 8137 len. 59]: But the parting drew nigh so softly and with so little increase of suffering , also with such a changeless continuance of sweet , loving ways , and mild but genuine enjoyment of existence , that of those who would most feel the loss of him , he only was thoroughly aware that death was at the door .
Parsing [sent. 8138 len. 25]: The rest said the summer would certainly restore him ; but the major expected him to die in the first of the warm weather .
Parsing [sent. 8139 len. 9]: The child himself believed he was going soon .
Parsing [sent. 8140 len. 15]: His patience , resting upon entire satisfaction with what God pleased , was wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 8141 len. 41]: `` Is n't it nice , majie , '' he said more than once , in differing forms , `` that I have nothing to do with anything -- that there is no preparation , no examination wanted for dying ?
Parsing [sent. 8142 len. 7]: It 's all done for you !
Parsing [sent. 8143 len. 15]: You have just to be lifted and taken -- and that 's so nice !
Parsing [sent. 8144 len. 24]: I do n't know what it will feel like , but when God is with you , you do n't mind anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 8145 len. 46]: Another time he said , `` I was trying , while you were resting , majie , to tell Saffy a dream I had ; and when I had told her she said , ` But it 's all nonsense , you know , Mark !
Parsing [sent. 8146 len. 7]: It 's only a dream ! '
Parsing [sent. 8147 len. 9]: -- What do you think , majie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8148 len. 9]: `` Was it a dream , Mark ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8149 len. 4]: asked the major .
Parsing [sent. 8150 len. 19]: `` Yes , it was a dream , but do you think a dream is nothing at all ?
Parsing [sent. 8151 len. 16]: I think , if it is a good dream , it must be God 's .
Parsing [sent. 8152 len. 18]: For you know every good as well as every perfect gift is from the father of lights !
Parsing [sent. 8153 len. 39]: He made the thing that dreams and the things that set it dreaming ; so he must be the master of the dreams -- at least when he pleases -- and surely always of those who mind him !
Parsing [sent. 8154 len. 7]: -- The father of lights ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8155 len. 9]: he repeated ; `` what a beautiful name !
Parsing [sent. 8156 len. 11]: The father of all the bright things in the world !
Parsing [sent. 8157 len. 10]: Hester 's eyes , and your teeth , majie !
Parsing [sent. 8158 len. 14]: and all the shines of the fire on the things in the room !
Parsing [sent. 8159 len. 17]: and the sun and the far-away stars that I shall know more about by and by !
Parsing [sent. 8160 len. 28]: and all the glad things that come and go in my mind , as I lie here and you are sitting quiet in your chair , majie !
Parsing [sent. 8161 len. 11]: -- and sometimes at night , oh , so many !
Parsing [sent. 8162 len. 7]: when you think I am sleeping !
Parsing [sent. 8163 len. 13]: Oh , I will love him , and be afraid of nothing !
Parsing [sent. 8164 len. 22]: I know he is in it all , and the dark is only the box he keeps his bright things in !
Parsing [sent. 8165 len. 12]: `` Oh , he is such a good father of lights !
Parsing [sent. 8166 len. 25]: Do you know , majie , I used to think he came and talked to me in the window-seat when I was a child !
Parsing [sent. 8167 len. 48]: What if he really did , and I should be going to be made sure that he did -- up there , I mean , you know -- I do n't know where , but it 's where Jesus went when he went back to his papa !
Parsing [sent. 8168 len. 17]: Oh , how happy Jesus must have been when he got back to his papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8169 len. 68]: Here he began to cough , and could not talk more ; but the major did not blame himself that he had not found the heart to stop him , though he knew it was not what is called _ good _ for him : the child when moved to talk must be happier talking , and what if he died a few minutes sooner for it !
Parsing [sent. 8170 len. 6]: -- was born again rather !
Parsing [sent. 8171 len. 20]: thought the major to himself -- and almost added , `` I would that my time were come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8172 len. 29]: For the child 's and the soldier 's souls had got nearer to each other , than were yet any two souls in that house in absolute love .
Parsing [sent. 8173 len. 20]: A great silent change , not the less a development , had been and was passing in the major .
Parsing [sent. 8174 len. 95]: Mark not only was an influence on him altogether new , but had stirred up and brought alive in him a thousand influences besides , not merely of things hitherto dormant in him , but of memories never consciously , operant -- words of his mother ; a certain Sunday-evening with her ; her last blessing on his careless head ; the verse of a well-known hymn she repeated as she was dying ; old scraps of things she had taught him ; dying little Mark gave life to these and many other things .
Parsing [sent. 8175 len. 23]: The major had never been properly a child , but now lived his childness over again with Mark in a better fashion .
Parsing [sent. 8176 len. 16]: `` I have had such a curious , such a beautiful dream , majie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8177 len. 11]: he said , waking in the middle of one night .
Parsing [sent. 8178 len. 15]: The major was sitting up with him : he was never left alone now .
Parsing [sent. 8179 len. 8]: `` What was it , Markie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8180 len. 4]: asked the major .
Parsing [sent. 8181 len. 13]: `` I should like Corney to hear it , '' returned Mark .
Parsing [sent. 8182 len. 16]: `` I will call him , and you can then tell it us together . ''
Parsing [sent. 8183 len. 15]: `` Oh , I do n't think it would do to wake Corney up !
Parsing [sent. 8184 len. 6]: He would not like that !
Parsing [sent. 8185 len. 29]: He must hear it sometime -- but it must be at the right time , else he would laugh at it , and I could not bear that .
Parsing [sent. 8186 len. 19]: You know Corney always laughs , without thinking first whether the thing was made for laughing at ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8187 len. 11]: By this time Corney had been to see Mark often .
Parsing [sent. 8188 len. 54]: He always spoke kindly to him now , but always as a little goose , and Mark , the least assuming of mortals , being always in earnest , did not like the things he wanted `` to go in at Corney 's ears to be blown away by Corney 's nose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8189 len. 31]: For Corney had a foolish way of laughing through his nose , and it sounded so scornful , that the poor child would not expose to it what he loved .
Parsing [sent. 8190 len. 22]: Hence he was not often ready to speak freely to Corney -- or to another when he was within hearing distance .
Parsing [sent. 8191 len. 45]: `` But I 'll tell you what , majie , '' he went on '' -- I 'll tell _ you _ the dream , and then , if I should go away without having told him , you must tell it to Corney .
Parsing [sent. 8192 len. 15]: He wo n't laugh then -- at least I do n't think he will .
Parsing [sent. 8193 len. 12]: Do you promise to tell it to him , majie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8194 len. 32]: `` I will , '' answered the major , drawing himself up with a mental military salute , and ready to obey to the letter whatever Mark should require of him .
Parsing [sent. 8195 len. 7]: Without another word the child began .
Parsing [sent. 8196 len. 30]: `` I was somewhere , '' he said , '' -- I do n't know where , and it do n't matter where , for Jesus was there too .
Parsing [sent. 8197 len. 18]: And Jesus gave a little laugh , such a beautiful little laugh , when he saw me !
Parsing [sent. 8198 len. 15]: And he said , ` Ah , little one , now you see me !
Parsing [sent. 8199 len. 16]: I have been getting your eyes open as fast as I could all the time !
Parsing [sent. 8200 len. 10]: We 're in our father 's house together now !
Parsing [sent. 8201 len. 11]: But , Markie , where 's your brother Corney ? '
Parsing [sent. 8202 len. 20]: And I answered and said , ` Jesus , I 'm very sorry , but I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 8203 len. 22]: I know very well that I 'm my brother 's keeper , but I ca n't tell where he is . '
Parsing [sent. 8204 len. 14]: Then Jesus smiled again , and said , ` Never mind , then .
Parsing [sent. 8205 len. 12]: I did n't ask you because I did n't know myself .
Parsing [sent. 8206 len. 21]: But we must have Corney here -- only we ca n't get him till he sets himself to be good !
Parsing [sent. 8207 len. 15]: You must tell Corney , only not just yet , that I want him .
Parsing [sent. 8208 len. 35]: Tell him that he and I have got one father , and I could n't bear to have him out in the cold , with all the horrid creatures that wo n't be good !
Parsing [sent. 8209 len. 24]: Tell him I love him so that I will be very sharp with him if he do n't make haste and come home .
Parsing [sent. 8210 len. 21]: Our father is _ so _ good , and it is dreadful to me that Corney wo n't mind him !
Parsing [sent. 8211 len. 13]: He is _ so _ patient with him , Markie ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 8212 len. 85]: I know that , Jesus , ' I said ; ' I know that he could easily take him to pieces again because he do n't go well , but he would much rather make him go right ' -- I suppose I was thinking of mamma 's beautiful gold watch , with the wreath of different-coloured gold round the face of it : that would n't go right , and papa wanted to change it , but mamma liked the old one best .
Parsing [sent. 8213 len. 9]: And I do n't know what came next .
Parsing [sent. 8214 len. 10]: -- Now what am I to do , majie ?
Parsing [sent. 8215 len. 13]: You see I could n't bear to have that dream laughed at .
Parsing [sent. 8216 len. 18]: Yet I must tell it to Corney because there is a message in it for him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8217 len. 29]: Whether the boy plainly believed that the Lord had been with him , and had given him a message to his brother , the major dared not inquire .
Parsing [sent. 8218 len. 10]: `` Let the boy think what he thinks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8219 len. 5]: he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 8220 len. 11]: `` I dare not look as if I doubted . ''
Parsing [sent. 8221 len. 18]: Therefore he did not speak , but looked at the child with his soul in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 8222 len. 43]: `` I do not think , '' Mark went on , `` that he wanted me to tell Corney the minute I woke : he knows how sore it would make me to have him laugh at what _ he _ said !
Parsing [sent. 8223 len. 15]: I think when the time comes he will let me know it is come .
Parsing [sent. 8224 len. 32]: But if I found I was dying , you know , I would try and tell him , whether he laughed or not , rather than go without having done it .
Parsing [sent. 8225 len. 17]: But if Corney knew I was going , I do n't think he would laugh . ''
Parsing [sent. 8226 len. 13]: `` I do n't think he would , '' returned the major .
Parsing [sent. 8227 len. 20]: `` Corney is a better boy -- a little -- I do think , than he used to be .
Parsing [sent. 8228 len. 16]: You will be able to speak to him by and by , I fancy . ''
Parsing [sent. 8229 len. 68]: A feeling had grown upon the household as if there were in the house a strange lovely spot whence was direct communication with heaven -- a little piece cut out of the new paradise and set glowing in the heart of the old house of Yrndale -- the room where Mark lay shining in his bed , a Christ-child , if ever child might bear the name .
Parsing [sent. 8230 len. 35]: As often as the door opened loving eyes would seek first the spot where the sweet face , the treasure of the house , lay , reflecting already the light of the sunless kingdom .
Parsing [sent. 8231 len. 48]: That same afternoon , as the major , his custom always of an afternoon , dozed in his chair , the boy suddenly called out in a clear voice , `` Oh , majie , there was one bit of my dream I did not tell you !
Parsing [sent. 8232 len. 11]: I 've just remembered it now for the first time !
Parsing [sent. 8233 len. 12]: -- After what I told you , -- do you remember ?
Parsing [sent. 8234 len. 13]: -- '' `` I do indeed , '' answered the major . ''
Parsing [sent. 8235 len. 58]: -- After that , Jesus looked at me for one minute -- no , not a minute , for a minute -- on mamma 's watch at least -- is much longer , but say perhaps for three seconds of a minute , and then said just one word , -- ` Our father , Markie ! '
Parsing [sent. 8236 len. 9]: and I could not see him any more .
Parsing [sent. 8237 len. 12]: But it did not seem to matter the least tiny bit .
Parsing [sent. 8238 len. 57]: There was a stone near me , and I sat down upon it , feeling as if I could sit there without moving to all eternity , so happy was I , and it was because Jesus 's father was touching me everywhere ; my head felt as if he were counting the hairs of it .
Parsing [sent. 8239 len. 21]: And he was not only close to me , but far and far and farther away , and all between .
Parsing [sent. 8240 len. 8]: Near and far there was the father !
Parsing [sent. 8241 len. 31]: I neither saw nor felt nor heard him , and yet I saw and heard and felt him so near that I could neither see nor hear nor feel him .
Parsing [sent. 8242 len. 17]: I am talking very like nonsense , majie , but I ca n't do it better .
Parsing [sent. 8243 len. 57]: It was God , God everywhere , and there was no nowhere anywhere , but all was God , God , God ; and my heart was nothing , knew nothing but him ; and I felt I could sit there for ever , because I was right in the very middle of God 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 8244 len. 19]: That was what made everything look so all right that I was anxious about nothing and nobody . ''
Parsing [sent. 8245 len. 6]: Here he paused a little .
Parsing [sent. 8246 len. 10]: `` He had a sleeping draught last night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8247 len. 7]: said the major to himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 8248 len. 31]: -- But the sleeping draught was God 's , and who can tell whether God may not have had it given to him just that he might talk with him !
Parsing [sent. 8249 len. 21]: Some people may be better to talk to when they are asleep , and others when they are awake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8250 len. 26]: `` And then , after a while , '' the boy resumed , `` I seemed to see a black speck somewhere in the all-blessed .
Parsing [sent. 8251 len. 70]: And I could not understand it , and I did not like it ; but always I kept seeing this black speck -- only one ; and it made me at last , in spite of my happiness , almost miserable , ` Only , ' I said to myself , ` whatever the black speck may be , God will rub it white when he is ready ! '
Parsing [sent. 8252 len. 22]: for , you knew , he could n't go on for ever with a black speck going about in his heart !
Parsing [sent. 8253 len. 23]: And when I said this , all at once I knew the black speck was Corney , and I gave a cry .
Parsing [sent. 8254 len. 51]: But with that the black speck began to grow thin , and it grew thin and thin till all at once I could see it no more , and the same instant Corney stood beside me with a smile on his face , and the tears running clown his cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 8255 len. 44]: I stretched out my arms to him , and he caught me up in his , and then it was all right ; I was Corney 's keeper , and Corney was my keeper , and God was all of us 's keeper .
Parsing [sent. 8256 len. 13]: And it was then I woke , majie , not before . ''
Parsing [sent. 8257 len. 5]: The days went on .
Parsing [sent. 8258 len. 30]: Every new day Mark said , `` Now , majie , I do think to-day I shall tell Corney my dream and the message I have for him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8259 len. 15]: But the day grew old and passed , and the dream was not told .
Parsing [sent. 8260 len. 27]: The next and the next and the next passed , and he seemed to the major not likely ever to have the strength to tell Corney .
Parsing [sent. 8261 len. 40]: Still even his mother , who was now hardly out of his room during the day , though the major would never yield the active part of the nursing , did not perceive that his time was drawing nigh .
Parsing [sent. 8262 len. 50]: Hester , also , was much with him now , and sometimes his father , occasionally Corney and Mrs. Corney , as Mark called her with a merry look -- very pathetic on his almost transparent face ; but none of them seemed to think his end quite near .
Parsing [sent. 8263 len. 15]: One of the marvellous things about the child was his utter lack of favouritism .
Parsing [sent. 8264 len. 44]: He had got so used to the major 's strong arms and systematic engineering way of doing things as to prefer his nursing to that of any one else ; yet he never objected to the substitution of another when occasion might require .
Parsing [sent. 8265 len. 14]: He took everything that came to him as in itself right and acceptable .
Parsing [sent. 8266 len. 16]: He seemed in his illness to love everybody more than even while he was well .
Parsing [sent. 8267 len. 11]: For every one he kept his or her own place .
Parsing [sent. 8268 len. 60]: His mother was the queen ; but he was nearly as happy with Hester as with her ; and the major was great ; but he never showed any discomfort , not to say unhappiness , when left alone for a while with Saffy -- who was not always so reasonable as he would have liked her to be .
Parsing [sent. 8269 len. 27]: When several were in the room , he would lie looking from one to another like a miser contemplating his riches -- and well he might !
Parsing [sent. 8270 len. 18]: for such riches neither moth nor rust corrupt , and they are the treasures of heaven also .
Parsing [sent. 8271 len. 33]: One evening most of the family were in the room : a vague sense had diffused itself that the end was not far off , and an unconfessed instinct had gathered them .
Parsing [sent. 8272 len. 11]: A lamp was burning , but the fire-light was stronger .
Parsing [sent. 8273 len. 3]: Mark spoke .
Parsing [sent. 8274 len. 10]: In a moment the major was bending over him .
Parsing [sent. 8275 len. 12]: `` Majie , '' he said , `` I want Corney .
Parsing [sent. 8276 len. 7]: I want to tell him . ''
Parsing [sent. 8277 len. 18]: The major , on his way to Corney , told the father that the end was nigh .
Parsing [sent. 8278 len. 31]: With sorely self-accusing heart , for the vision of the boy on the stone in the middle of the moor haunted him , he repaired to the anteroom of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 8279 len. 18]: Mark kept looking for Corney 's coming , his eyes turning every other moment to the door .
Parsing [sent. 8280 len. 12]: When his father entered he stretched out his arms to him .
Parsing [sent. 8281 len. 12]: The strong man bending over him could not repress a sob .
Parsing [sent. 8282 len. 27]: The boy pushed him gently away far enough to see his face , and looked at him as if he could not quite believe his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 8283 len. 26]: `` Father , '' he said -- he had never called him _ father _ before -- `` you must be glad , not sorry .
Parsing [sent. 8284 len. 16]: I am going to your father and my father -- to our great father . ''
Parsing [sent. 8285 len. 21]: Then seeing Corney come in , he stretched his arms towards him past his father , crying , `` Corney !
Parsing [sent. 8286 len. 3]: Corney ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8287 len. 14]: just as he used to call him when he was a mere child .
Parsing [sent. 8288 len. 18]: Corney bent over him , but the outstretched arms did not close upon him ; they fell .
Parsing [sent. 8289 len. 7]: But he was not yet ascended .
Parsing [sent. 8290 len. 18]: With a strength seeming wonderful when they thought of it afterwards , he signed to the major .
Parsing [sent. 8291 len. 31]: `` Majie , '' he whispered , with a look and expression into the meaning of which the major all his life long had never done inquiring , `` Majie !
Parsing [sent. 8292 len. 2]: Corney !
Parsing [sent. 8293 len. 4]: you tell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8294 len. 4]: Then he went .
Parsing [sent. 8295 len. 21]: I think it was the grief at the grave of Lazarus that made our Lord weep , not his death .
Parsing [sent. 8296 len. 19]: One with eyes opening into both worlds could hardly weep over any law of the Father of Lights !
Parsing [sent. 8297 len. 45]: I think it was the impossibility of getting them comforted over this thing death , which looked to him so different from what they thought it , that made the fearless weep , and give them in Lazarus a foretaste of his own resurrection .
Parsing [sent. 8298 len. 7]: The major alone did not weep .
Parsing [sent. 8299 len. 18]: He stood with his arms folded , like a sentry relieved , and waiting the next order .
Parsing [sent. 8300 len. 17]: Even Corney 's eyes filled with tears , and he murmured , `` Poor Markie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8301 len. 9]: It should have been `` Poor Corney ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8302 len. 32]: He stooped and kissed the insensate face , then drew back and gazed with the rest on the little pilgrim-cloak the small prophet had dropped as he rose to his immortality .
Parsing [sent. 8303 len. 31]: Saffy , who had been seated gazing into the fire , and had no idea of what had taken place , called out in a strange voice , `` Markie !
Parsing [sent. 8304 len. 3]: Markie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8305 len. 27]: Hester turned to her at the cry , and saw her apparently following something with her eyes along the wall from the bed to the window .
Parsing [sent. 8306 len. 25]: At the curtained window she gazed for a moment , and then her eyes fell , and she sat like one in a dream .
Parsing [sent. 8307 len. 21]: A moment more and she sprang to her feet and ran to the bed , crying again , `` Markie !
Parsing [sent. 8308 len. 3]: Markie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8309 len. 14]: Hester lifted her , and held her to kiss the sweet white face .
Parsing [sent. 8310 len. 34]: It seemed to content her ; she went back to her stool by the fire ; and there sat staring at the curtained window with the look of one gazing into regions unknown .
Parsing [sent. 8311 len. 43]: That same night , ere the solemn impression should pass , the major took Corney to his room , and recalling every individual expression he could of the little prophet-dreamer , executed , not without tears , the commission intrusted to him .
Parsing [sent. 8312 len. 6]: And Corney did not laugh .
Parsing [sent. 8313 len. 23]: He listened with a grave , even sad face ; and when the major ceased , his eyes were full of tears .
Parsing [sent. 8314 len. 13]: `` I shall not forget Markie 's dream , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 8315 len. 16]: Thus came everything in to help the youth who had begun to mend his ways .
Parsing [sent. 8316 len. 16]: And shall we think the boy found God not equal to his dream of him ?
Parsing [sent. 8317 len. 15]: He made our dreaming : shall it surpass in its making his mighty self ?
Parsing [sent. 8318 len. 7]: Shall man dream better than God ?
Parsing [sent. 8319 len. 14]: or God 's love be inferior to man 's imagination or his own ?
Parsing [sent. 8320 len. 3]: CHAPTER LX .
Parsing [sent. 8321 len. 4]: A BIRTHDAY GIFT .
Parsing [sent. 8322 len. 29]: When Mark 's little cloak was put in the earth , for a while the house felt cold -- as if the bit of Paradise had gone out .
Parsing [sent. 8323 len. 12]: Mark 's room was like a temple forsaken of its divinity .
Parsing [sent. 8324 len. 14]: But it was not to be drifted up with the sand of forgetfulness !
Parsing [sent. 8325 len. 42]: The major put in a petition that it might continue to be called Mark 's , but should be considered the major 's : he would like to put some of his things in it and occupy it when he came !
Parsing [sent. 8326 len. 8]: Every one was pleased with the idea .
Parsing [sent. 8327 len. 20]: They no longer would feel so painfully that Mark was not there when his dear majie occupied the room !
Parsing [sent. 8328 len. 12]: To the major it was thenceforth chamber and chapel and monument .
Parsing [sent. 8329 len. 18]: It should not be a tomb save as upon the fourth day the sepulchre in the garden !
Parsing [sent. 8330 len. 12]: he would fill it with live memories of the risen child !
Parsing [sent. 8331 len. 19]: Very different was his purpose from that sickly haunting of the grave in which some loving hearts indulge !
Parsing [sent. 8332 len. 13]: We are bound to be hopeful , nor wrong our great-hearted father .
Parsing [sent. 8333 len. 8]: Mark 's books and pictures remained undisturbed .
Parsing [sent. 8334 len. 9]: The major dusted them with his own hands .
Parsing [sent. 8335 len. 9]: Every day he read in Mark 's bible .
Parsing [sent. 8336 len. 74]: He never took it away with him , but always when he returned in whatever part of the bible he might have read in the meantime , he resumed his reading where he had left off in it , The sword the boy used so to admire for its brightness that he had placed it unsheathed upon the wall for the firelight to play upon it , he left there , shining still .
Parsing [sent. 8337 len. 22]: In Mark 's bed the major slept , and to Mark 's chamber he went always to shut to the door .
Parsing [sent. 8338 len. 17]: In solitude there he learned a thousand things his busy life had prepared him for learning .
Parsing [sent. 8339 len. 10]: The master had come to him in the child .
Parsing [sent. 8340 len. 25]: In him was fulfilled a phase of the promise that whosoever receives a child in the name of Jesus receives Jesus and his father .
Parsing [sent. 8341 len. 18]: Through ministering to the child he had come to know the child 's elder brother and master .
Parsing [sent. 8342 len. 33]: It was the presence of the master in the child , that without his knowing it , opened his heart to him , and he had thus entertained more than an angel .
Parsing [sent. 8343 len. 37]: Time passed , and their hearts began , not through any healing power in time , but under the holy influences of duty and love and hope , to cover with flowers their furrows of grief .
Parsing [sent. 8344 len. 7]: Hester 's birthday was at hand .
Parsing [sent. 8345 len. 12]: The major went up to London to bring her a present .
Parsing [sent. 8346 len. 16]: He was determined to make the occasion , if he could , a cheerful one .
Parsing [sent. 8347 len. 16]: He wrote to his cousin Helen asking if he might bring a friend with him .
Parsing [sent. 8348 len. 31]: He did not think , he said , his host or hostess knew him , but Hester did : he was a young doctor , and his name was Christopher .
Parsing [sent. 8349 len. 18]: He had met him amongst `` Hester 's friends , '' and was much taken with him .
Parsing [sent. 8350 len. 10]: He would be a great acquisition to their party .
Parsing [sent. 8351 len. 28]: He had been rather ailing for some time , and as there was much less sickness now , he had persuaded him to take a little relaxation .
Parsing [sent. 8352 len. 33]: Hester said for her part she would be most happy to see Mr. Christopher ; she had the highest esteem for him ; and therewith she told them something of his history .
Parsing [sent. 8353 len. 22]: Mr. Raymount had known his grandfather a little in the way of business , and was the more interested in him .
Parsing [sent. 8354 len. 45]: I may mention here that Corney soon began to show a practical interest in the place -- first in the look of it -- its order and tidiness , and then in its yield , beginning to develop a faculty for looking after property .
Parsing [sent. 8355 len. 8]: Next he took to measuring the land .
Parsing [sent. 8356 len. 42]: Here the major could give him no end of help ; and having thus found a point of common interest , they began to be drawn a little together , and to conceive a mild liking for each other 's company .
Parsing [sent. 8357 len. 23]: Corney saw by degrees that the major knew much more than he ; and the major discovered that Corney had some brains .
Parsing [sent. 8358 len. 37]: Everything was now going on well at Yrndale -- thanks to the stormy and sorrowful weather that had of late so troubled its spiritual atmosphere , and killed so many evil worms in its moral soil !
Parsing [sent. 8359 len. 38]: As soon as the distress caused by Corney 's offences was soothed by reviving love for the youth and fresh hope in him , Hester informed her parents of the dissolution of her engagement to lord Gartley .
Parsing [sent. 8360 len. 30]: The mother was troubled : it is the girl that suffers evil judgment in such a case , and she knew how the tongue of the world would wag .
Parsing [sent. 8361 len. 27]: But those who despise the ways of the world need not fret that low minds attribute to them the things of which low minds are capable .
Parsing [sent. 8362 len. 26]: The world and its judgments will pass : the poisonous tongue will one day become pure , and make ample apology for its evil speaking .
Parsing [sent. 8363 len. 16]: The tongue is a fire , but there is a stronger fire than the tongue .
Parsing [sent. 8364 len. 69]: Her father and the major cared little for this aspect of the matter , for they had both come to the conclusion that the public is only a sort of innocent , whose behaviour may be troublesome or pleasant , but whose opinion is worth considerably less than that of a wise hound , The world is a fine thing to save , but a wretch to worship .
Parsing [sent. 8365 len. 28]: Neither did the father care much for lord Gartley , though he had liked him ; the major , we know , both despised and detested him .
Parsing [sent. 8366 len. 38]: Hester herself was annoyed to find how soon the idea of his lordship came to be altogether a thing of her past , looking there in its natural place , a thing to trouble her no more .
Parsing [sent. 8367 len. 46]: At his natural distance from her , she could not fail to see what a small creature her imagination , and the self that had mingled with her noblest feelings concerning him , had chosen as her companion and help in her schemes of good .
Parsing [sent. 8368 len. 36]: But she was able to look on the whole blunder with calmness , and a thankfulness that kept growing as the sting of her fault lost its burning , lenified in the humility it brought .
Parsing [sent. 8369 len. 29]: There was nothing left her now , she said to herself , but the best of all -- a maiden life devoted to the work of her master .
Parsing [sent. 8370 len. 39]: She was not willing any more to run the risk of loosing her power to help the Lord 's creatures , down trodden of devils , _ well-to-do _ people , and their own miserable weaknesses and vices .
Parsing [sent. 8371 len. 44]: Even remaining constant to duty , she must , in continuous disappointment and the mockery of a false unity , have lost the health , and worse , the spirits necessary to wholesome contact and such work as she was fain to do .
Parsing [sent. 8372 len. 60]: In constant opposition to her husband , spending the best part of her strength in resistance ere it could reach the place where it ought to be applied entire , with strife consciously destroying her love and keeping her in a hopeless unrest , how could any light have shone from her upon those whose darkness made her miserable !
Parsing [sent. 8373 len. 7]: Now she would hold herself free !
Parsing [sent. 8374 len. 21]: What a blessed thing it was to be her own mistress and the slave of the Lord , externally free !
Parsing [sent. 8375 len. 16]: To be the slave of a husband was the worst of all slavery except self-slavery !
Parsing [sent. 8376 len. 15]: Nor was there in this her conclusion anything of chagrin , or pettish self-humiliation .
Parsing [sent. 8377 len. 19]: St. Paul abstained from marriage that he might the better do the work given him by the Lord .
Parsing [sent. 8378 len. 20]: For his perilous and laborious work it was better , he judged , that he should not be married .
Parsing [sent. 8379 len. 10]: It was for the kingdom of heaven 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 8380 len. 9]: Her spirits soon returned more buoyant than before .
Parsing [sent. 8381 len. 5]: Her health was better .
Parsing [sent. 8382 len. 26]: She found she had been suffering from an oppression she had refused to recognize -- already in no small measure yoked , and right unequally .
Parsing [sent. 8383 len. 29]: Only a few weeks passed , and , in the prime of health and that glorious thing feminine strength , she looked a yet grander woman than before .
Parsing [sent. 8384 len. 15]: There was greater freedom in her carriage , and she seemed to have grown .
Parsing [sent. 8385 len. 23]: The humility that comes with the discovery of error had made her yet more dignified : true dignity comes only of humility .
Parsing [sent. 8386 len. 22]: Pride is the ruin of dignity , for it is a worshipping of self , and that involves a continuous sinking .
Parsing [sent. 8387 len. 25]: Humility , the worship of the Ideal -- that is , of the man Christ Jesus , is the only lifter-up of the head .
Parsing [sent. 8388 len. 8]: Everybody felt her more lovable than before .
Parsing [sent. 8389 len. 13]: Her mother began to feel an enchantment of peace in her presence .
Parsing [sent. 8390 len. 46]: Her father sought her company more than ever in his walks , and not only talked to her about Corney , but talked about his own wrong feelings towards him , and how he had been punished for them by what they wrought in him .
Parsing [sent. 8391 len. 28]: He had begun , he told her , to learn many things he had supposed he knew he had only thought and written and talked about them !
Parsing [sent. 8392 len. 11]: Father and daughter were therefore much to each other now .
Parsing [sent. 8393 len. 8]: Even Corney perceived a change in her .
Parsing [sent. 8394 len. 29]: For one thing , scarce a shadow of that `` superiority '' remained which used to irritate him so much , making him rebel against whatever she said .
Parsing [sent. 8395 len. 26]: She became more and more Amy 's ideal of womanhood , and by degrees she taught her husband to read more justly his beautiful sister .
Parsing [sent. 8396 len. 40]: She pointed out to him how few would have tried to protect and deliver him as she had done ; how few would have so generously taken herself , a poor uneducated girl , to a sister 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 8397 len. 20]: So altogether things were going well in the family : it was bidding fair to be a family forevermore .
Parsing [sent. 8398 len. 35]: Miss Dasomma came to spend a few days with Hester and help celebrate her birthday : she was struck with improvement where she would have been loath to allow it either necessary or possible .
Parsing [sent. 8399 len. 24]: Compelled to admit its presence , she loved her yet more -- for the one a fact , the other was a necessity .
Parsing [sent. 8400 len. 17]: Her birthday was the sweetest of summer days , and she looked a perfect summer-born woman .
Parsing [sent. 8401 len. 23]: She dressed herself in white , but not so much for her own birthday as for Mark 's into the heavenly kingdom .
Parsing [sent. 8402 len. 9]: After breakfast all except the mother went out .
Parsing [sent. 8403 len. 18]: Hester was little inclined to talk , and the major was in a thoughtful , brooding mood .
Parsing [sent. 8404 len. 8]: Miss Dasomma and Mr. Raymount alone conversed .
Parsing [sent. 8405 len. 35]: When the rest reached a certain spot whither Mr. Raymount had led them for the sake of the view , Hester had fallen a little behind , and Christopher went back to meet her .
Parsing [sent. 8406 len. 21]: `` You are thinking of your brother , '' he said , in a tone that made her feel grateful .
Parsing [sent. 8407 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 8408 len. 11]: `` I knew by your eyes , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 8409 len. 11]: `` I wish I could talk to you about him .
Parsing [sent. 8410 len. 15]: The right way of getting used to death is to go nearer the dead .
Parsing [sent. 8411 len. 8]: Suppose you tell me something about him !
Parsing [sent. 8412 len. 5]: Such children are rare !
Parsing [sent. 8413 len. 12]: They are prophets to whose word we have to listen . ''
Parsing [sent. 8414 len. 42]: He went on like this , drawing her from sadness with gentle speech about children and death , and the look and reality of things ; and so they wandered about the moor for a little while before joining the rest .
Parsing [sent. 8415 len. 35]: Mr. Raymount was much pleased with Christopher , and even Corney found himself drawn to his side , feeling , though he did not know it , a strength in him that offered protection .
Parsing [sent. 8416 len. 11]: The day went on in the simplest , pleasantest intercourse .
Parsing [sent. 8417 len. 38]: After lunch , Hester opened her piano , and asked Miss Dasomma , gifted in her art even to the pitch prophetic , to sit down and play -- `` upon _ us _ '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 8418 len. 32]: And in truth she did : for what the hammers were to the strings , such were the sounds she drew from them to the human chords stretched expectant before her .
Parsing [sent. 8419 len. 10]: Vibrating souls responded in the music that is unheard .
Parsing [sent. 8420 len. 77]: A rosy conscious silence pervaded the summer afternoon and the ancient drawing-room , in which the listeners were one here and one there , all apart -- except Corney and `` Mrs. Corney , '' as for love of Mark she liked to be called , on a sofa side by side , and Saffy playing with a white kitten , neither attending to the music , which may have been doing something for both notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 8421 len. 77]: Mr. Raymount sat in a great soft chair with a book in his hand , listening more than reading : his wife lay on a couch , and soon passed into dreams of pleasant sounds ; the major stood erect by Miss Dasomma , a little behind her , with his arms folded across his chest ; and Christopher sat on a low window-seat in an oriel , where the balmiest of perfumed airs freely entered .
Parsing [sent. 8422 len. 35]: Between him and all the rest hung the heavy folds of a curtain , which every now and then swelled out like the sail of Cleopatra 's barge `` upon the river Cydnus . ''
Parsing [sent. 8423 len. 27]: He sat with the tears rolling down his face , for the music to which he listened seemed such as he had only dreamed of before .
Parsing [sent. 8424 len. 21]: It was the music of climes where sorrow is but the memory of that which has been turned into joy .
Parsing [sent. 8425 len. 68]: He thought no one saw him , and no one would have seen him but for the traitor wind seeming only to play with the curtain but every now and then blowing it wide out , as if the sheet of the sail had been let go , and revealing him to Hester where she sat on a stool beside her mother and held her sleeping hand .
Parsing [sent. 8426 len. 16]: It was to her the revelation of a heart , and she saw with reverence .
Parsing [sent. 8427 len. 72]: Lord Gartley could sing , lord Gartley could play , lord Gartley understood the technicalities of music ; Christopher could neither play nor sing -- at least anything more than a common psalm-tune to lead the groans of his poor -- and understood nothing of music ; but there was in him a whole sea of musical delight , to be set in motion by the enchantress who knew the spell !
Parsing [sent. 8428 len. 29]: Such an enchantress might float in the bark of her own will across the heaving waves of that sea , moon and wind of its tides and currents !
Parsing [sent. 8429 len. 13]: When the music ceased she saw him go softly from the room .
Parsing [sent. 8430 len. 39]: After an early dinner , early that they might have room for a walk in the twilight , the major proposed the health of his cousin Hester , and made a little speech in her honour and praise .
Parsing [sent. 8431 len. 22]: Nor did his praise make Hester feel awkward , for praise which is the odour of love neither fevers nor sickens .
Parsing [sent. 8432 len. 26]: `` And now , cousin Hester , '' concluded the major , `` you know that I love you like a child of my own !
Parsing [sent. 8433 len. 37]: It is a good thing you are not , for if you were then you would not be half so good , or so beautiful , or so wise , or so accomplished as you are !
Parsing [sent. 8434 len. 39]: Will you oblige me by accepting this foolscap , which , I hope , will serve to make this blessed day yet a trifle more pleasant to look back upon when Mark has got his old majie again .
Parsing [sent. 8435 len. 15]: It represents a sort of nut , itself too bulky for a railway truck .
Parsing [sent. 8436 len. 34]: If my Hester choose to call it an empty nut , I do n't mind : the good of it to her will be in the filling of it with many kernels . ''
Parsing [sent. 8437 len. 32]: With this enigmatical peroration the major made Hester a low bow , and handed her a sheet of foolscap , twice folded , and tied with a bit of white ribbon .
Parsing [sent. 8438 len. 9]: She took it with a sweetly radiant curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 8439 len. 11]: It was the title-deed of the house in Addison square .
Parsing [sent. 8440 len. 22]: She gave a cry of joy , got up , threw her arms round majie 's neck , and kissed him .
Parsing [sent. 8441 len. 4]: `` Aha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8442 len. 21]: said the major , `` if I had been a young man now , I should not have had that !
Parsing [sent. 8443 len. 42]: But I will not be conceited ; I know what it is she means it for : the kiss collective of all the dirty men and women in her dear slums , glorified into that of an angel of God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8444 len. 19]: Hester was not a young lady given to weeping , but she did here break down and cry .
Parsing [sent. 8445 len. 6]: Her long-cherished dream come true !
Parsing [sent. 8446 len. 27]: She had no money , but that did not trouble her : there was always a way of doing when one was willing to begin small !
Parsing [sent. 8447 len. 7]: This is indeed a divine law !
Parsing [sent. 8448 len. 16]: There shall be no success to the man who is not willing to begin small .
Parsing [sent. 8449 len. 11]: Small is strong , for it only can grow strong .
Parsing [sent. 8450 len. 10]: Big at the outset is but bloated and weak .
Parsing [sent. 8451 len. 31]: There are thousands willing to do great things for one willing to do a small thing ; but there never was any truly great thing that did not begin small .
Parsing [sent. 8452 len. 40]: In her delight Hester , having read the endorsement , handed the paper , without opening it , to Christopher , who sat next her , with the unconscious conviction that he would understand the delight it gave her .
Parsing [sent. 8453 len. 16]: He took it and , with a look asking if he might , opened it .
Parsing [sent. 8454 len. 64]: The major had known for some time that Mr. Raymount wanted to sell the house , and believed , from the way Hester spent herself in London , he could not rejoice her better than by purchasing it for her ; so , just as it was , with everything as it stood in it , he made it his birthday-gift to her .
Parsing [sent. 8455 len. 19]: `` There is more here than you know , '' said Christopher , handing her back the paper .
Parsing [sent. 8456 len. 21]: She opened it and saw something about a thousand pounds , for which again she gave joyous and loving thanks .
Parsing [sent. 8457 len. 39]: But before the evening was over she learned that it was not a thousand pounds the dear majie had given her , but the thousand a year he had offered her if she would give up lord Gartley .
Parsing [sent. 8458 len. 14]: Thus a new paradise of God-labour opened on the delighted eyes of Hester .
Parsing [sent. 8459 len. 16]: In the evening , when the sun was down , they went for another walk .
Parsing [sent. 8460 len. 26]: I suspect the major , but am not sure : -- anyhow , in the middle of a fir-wood Hester found herself alone with Christopher .
Parsing [sent. 8461 len. 15]: The wood rose towards the moor , growing thinner and thinner as it ascended .
Parsing [sent. 8462 len. 44]: They were climbing westward full in face of the sunset , which was barred across the trees in gold , blue , rosy pink , and a lovely indescribable green , such as is not able to live except in the after sunset .
Parsing [sent. 8463 len. 17]: The west lay like the beautiful dead not yet faded into the brown dark of mother-earth .
Parsing [sent. 8464 len. 13]: The fir-trees and bars of sunset made a glorious gate before them .
Parsing [sent. 8465 len. 6]: `` Oh , Hester ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8466 len. 59]: said Christopher -- he had been hearing her called _ Hester _ on all sides all day long , and it not only came of itself , but stayed unnoticed of either -- `` if that were the gate of heaven , and we climbing to it now to go in and see all the dear people ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8467 len. 7]: `` That would be joy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8468 len. 3]: responded Hester .
Parsing [sent. 8469 len. 11]: `` Come then : let us imagine it a while .
Parsing [sent. 8470 len. 8]: There is no harm in dreaming . ''
Parsing [sent. 8471 len. 39]: `` Sometimes when Mark would tell me one of his dreams , I could not help thinking , '' said Hester , `` how much more of reality there was in it than in most so-called realities . ''
Parsing [sent. 8472 len. 5]: Then came a silence .
Parsing [sent. 8473 len. 96]: `` Suppose , '' began Christopher again , `` one claiming to be a prophet appeared , saying that in the life to come we were to go on living just such a life as here , with the one difference that we should be no longer deluded with the idea of something better ; that all our energies would then be , and ought now to be spent in making the best of what we had -- without any foolish indulgence in hope or aspiration : -- what would you say to that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8474 len. 68]: `` I would say , '' answered Hester , `` he must have had his revelation either from God , from a demon , or from his own heart : it could not be from God , because it made the idea of a God an impossibility ; it must come from a demon or from himself , and in neither case was worth paying attention to .
Parsing [sent. 8475 len. 27]: -- I think , '' she went on , `` my own feeling or imagination must be better worth my own heeding than that of another .
Parsing [sent. 8476 len. 19]: The essential delight of this world seems to me to lie in the expectation of a better . ''
Parsing [sent. 8477 len. 26]: They emerged from the wood , the bare moor spread on all sides before them , and lo , the sunset was countless miles away !
Parsing [sent. 8478 len. 11]: Hills , fields , rivers , mountains , lay between !
Parsing [sent. 8479 len. 10]: Christopher stopped , and turning , looked at Hester .
Parsing [sent. 8480 len. 7]: `` Is this the reality ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8481 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 8482 len. 16]: `` We catch sight of the gate of heaven , and set out for it .
Parsing [sent. 8483 len. 6]: It comes nearer and nearer .
Parsing [sent. 8484 len. 24]: All at once a something they call a reality of life comes between , and the shining gate is millions of miles away !
Parsing [sent. 8485 len. 14]: Then cry some of its pilgrims , ` Alas , we are fooled !
Parsing [sent. 8486 len. 11]: There is no such thing as the gate of heaven !
Parsing [sent. 8487 len. 18]: Let us eat and drink and do what good we can , for to-morrow we die ! '
Parsing [sent. 8488 len. 21]: But is there no gate because we find none on the edge of the wood where it seemed to lie ?
Parsing [sent. 8489 len. 15]: There it is , before us yet , though a long way farther back .
Parsing [sent. 8490 len. 10]: What has space or time to do with being ?
Parsing [sent. 8491 len. 5]: Can distance destroy fact ?
Parsing [sent. 8492 len. 40]: What if one day the chain of gravity were to break , and , starting from the edge of the pine wood , we fared or flew farther and farther towards the bars of gold and rose and green !
Parsing [sent. 8493 len. 43]: And what if even then we found them recede and recede as we advanced , until heart was gone out of us , and we could follow no longer , but , sitting down on some wayside cloud , fell a thinking !
Parsing [sent. 8494 len. 24]: Should we not say -- Justly are we punished , and our punishment was to follow the vain thing we took for heaven-gate !
Parsing [sent. 8495 len. 13]: Heaven-gate is too grand a goal to be reached foot or wing .
Parsing [sent. 8496 len. 34]: High above us , it yet opens inside us ; and when it opens , down comes the gate of amber and rose , and we step through both , at once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8497 len. 4]: He was silent .
Parsing [sent. 8498 len. 9]: They were on the top of the ridge .
Parsing [sent. 8499 len. 11]: A little beyond stood the dusky group of their companions .
Parsing [sent. 8500 len. 7]: And the world lay beneath them .
Parsing [sent. 8501 len. 12]: `` Who would live in London who might live here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8502 len. 4]: said the major .
Parsing [sent. 8503 len. 11]: `` No one , '' answered Hester and Christopher together .
Parsing [sent. 8504 len. 11]: The major turned and looked at them almost in alarm .
Parsing [sent. 8505 len. 12]: `` But I _ may not _ , '' said Hester .
Parsing [sent. 8506 len. 10]: `` God chooses that I live in London . ''
Parsing [sent. 8507 len. 34]: Said Christopher , -- `` Christ would surely have liked better to go on living in his father 's house than go where so many did not know either him or his father !
Parsing [sent. 8508 len. 19]: But he could not go on enjoying his heaven while those many lived only a death in life .
Parsing [sent. 8509 len. 9]: He must go and start them for home !
Parsing [sent. 8510 len. 30]: Who in any measure seeing what Christ sees and feeling as Christ feels , would rest in the enjoyment of beauty while so many are unable to desire it ?
Parsing [sent. 8511 len. 16]: We are not real human beings until we are of the same mind with Christ .
Parsing [sent. 8512 len. 21]: There are many who would save the pathetic and interesting and let the ugly and provoking take care of themselves !
Parsing [sent. 8513 len. 13]: Not so Christ , nor those who have learned of him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8514 len. 19]: Christopher spoke so quietly there seemed even a contrast between his manner and the fervour of his words .
Parsing [sent. 8515 len. 56]: `` I would take as many in with me , '' he said , turning to Hester , `` as I might , should it be after a thousand years I went in at the gate of the sunset -- the sunrise rather , of which the sunset is a leaf of the folding door !
Parsing [sent. 8516 len. 9]: It would be sorrow to go in alone .
Parsing [sent. 8517 len. 27]: My people , my own , my own humans , my men , my women , my little ones , must go in with me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8518 len. 7]: Hester laboured , and Christopher laboured .
Parsing [sent. 8519 len. 19]: And if one was the heart and the other the head , the major was the right hand .
Parsing [sent. 8520 len. 23]: But what they did and how they did it , would require a book , and no small one , to itself .
Parsing [sent. 8521 len. 13]: It is no matter that here I can not tell their story .
Parsing [sent. 8522 len. 11]: No man ever did the best work who copied another .
Parsing [sent. 8523 len. 12]: Let every man work out the thing that is in him !
Parsing [sent. 8524 len. 35]: Who , according to the means he has , great or small , does the work given him to do , stands by the side of the Saviour , is a fellow-worker with him .
Parsing [sent. 8525 len. 17]: Be a brother after thy own fashion , only see it be a brother thou art .
Parsing [sent. 8526 len. 29]: The one who weighed , is found wanting the most , is the one whose tongue and whose life do not match -- who says , `` Lord !
Parsing [sent. 8527 len. 3]: Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8528 len. 90]: and does not the thing the Lord says ; the deacon who finds a good seat for the man in goodly apparel , and lets the poor widow stand in the aisle unheeded ; the preacher who descants on the love of God in the pulpit , and looks out for a rich wife in his flock ; the missionary who would save the heathen , but gives his own soul to merchandize ; the woman who spends her strength for the poor , and makes discord at home .
