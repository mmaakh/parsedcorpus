Parsing [sent. 1 len. 72]: THE HOPE OF THE GOSPEL BY GEORGE MACDONALD CONTENTS SALVATION FROM SIN THE REMISSION OF SINS JESUS IN THE WORLD JESUS AND HIS FELLOW TOWNSMEN THE HEIRS OF HEAVEN AND EARTH SORROW THE PLEDGE OF JOY GOD 'S FAMILY THE REWARD OF OBEDIENCE THE YOKE OF JESUS THE SALT AND THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD THE RIGHT HAND AND THE LEFT THE HOPE OF THE UNIVERSE _ SALVATION FROM SIN _ .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 19]: -- and thou shalt call his name Jesus ; for he shall save his people from their sins .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 7]: -- _ Matthew _ i. 21 .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 24]: I would help some to understand what Jesus came from the home of our Father to be to us and do for us .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 39]: Everything in the world is more or less misunderstood at first : we have to learn what it is , and come at length to see that it must be so , that it could not be otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 20]: Then we know it ; and we never know a thing _ really _ until we know it thus .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 54]: I presume there is scarce a human being who , resolved to speak openly , would not confess to having something that plagued him , something from which he would gladly be free , something rendering it impossible for him , at the moment , to regard life as an altogether good thing .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 30]: Most men , I presume , imagine that , free of such and such things antagonistic , life would be an unmingled satisfaction , worthy of being prolonged indefinitely .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 40]: The causes of their discomfort are of all kinds , and the degrees of it reach from simple uneasiness to a misery such as makes annihilation the highest hope of the sufferer who can persuade himself of its possibility .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 23]: Perhaps the greater part of the energy of this world 's life goes forth in the endeavour to rid itself of discomfort .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 53]: Some , to escape it , leave their natural surroundings behind them , and with strong and continuous effort keep rising in the social scale , to discover at every new ascent fresh trouble , as they think , awaiting them , whereas in truth they have brought the trouble with them .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 35]: Others , making haste to be rich , are slow to find out that the poverty of their souls , none the less that their purses are filling , will yet keep them unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 20]: Some court endless change , nor know that on themselves the change must pass that will set them free .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 23]: Others expand their souls with knowledge , only to find that content will not dwell in the great house they have built .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 28]: To number the varieties of human endeavour to escape discomfort would be to enumerate all the modes of such life as does not know how to live .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 54]: All seek the thing whose defect appears the _ cause _ of their misery , and is but the variable _ occasion _ of it , the cause of the shape it takes , not of the misery itself ; for , when one apparent cause is removed , another at once succeeds .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 32]: The real cause of his trouble is a something the man has not perhaps recognized as even existent ; in any case he is not yet acquainted with its true nature .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 91]: However absurd the statement may appear to one who has not yet discovered the fact for himself , the cause of every man 's discomfort is evil , moral evil -- first of all , evil in himself , his own sin , his own wrongness , his own unrightness ; and then , evil in those he loves : with this latter I have not now to deal ; the only way to get rid of it , is for the man to get rid of his own sin .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 62]: No special sin may be recognizable as having caused this or that special physical discomfort -- which may indeed have originated with some ancestor ; but evil in ourselves is the cause of its continuance , the source of its necessity , and the preventive of that patience which would soon take from it , or at least blunt its sting .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 58]: The evil is _ essentially _ unnecessary , and passes with the attainment of the object for which it is permitted -- namely , the development of pure will in man ; the suffering also is essentially unnecessary , but while the evil lasts , the suffering , whether consequent or merely concomitant , is absolutely necessary .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 62]: Foolish is the man , and there are many such men , who would rid himself or his fellows of discomfort by setting the world right , by waging war on the evils around him , while he neglects that integral part of the world where lies his business , his first business -- namely , his own character and conduct .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 70]: Were it possible -- an absurd supposition -- that the world should thus be righted from the outside , it would yet be impossible for the man who had contributed to the work , remaining what he was , ever to enjoy the perfection of the result ; himself not in tune with the organ he had tuned , he must imagine it still a distracted , jarring instrument .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 99]: The philanthropist who regards the wrong as in the race , forgetting that the race is made up of conscious and wrong individuals , forgets also that wrong is always generated in and done by an individual ; that the wrongness exists in the individual , and by him is passed over , as tendency , to the race ; and that no evil can be cured in the race , except by its being cured in its individuals : tendency is not absolute evil ; it is there that it may be resisted , not yielded to .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 42]: There is no way of making three men right but by making right each one of the three ; but a cure in one man who repents and turns , is a beginning of the cure of the whole human race .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 48]: Even if a man 's suffering be a far inheritance , for the curing of which by faith and obedience this life would not be sufficiently long , faith and obedience will yet render it endurable to the man , and overflow in help to his fellow-sufferers .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 25]: The groaning body , wrapt in the garment of hope , will , with outstretched neck , look for its redemption , and endure .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 36]: The one cure for any organism , is to be set right -- to have all its parts brought into harmony with each other ; the one comfort is to know this cure in process .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 5]: Rightness alone is cure .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 16]: The return of the organism to its true self , is its only possible ease .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 44]: To free a man from suffering , he must be set right , put in health ; and the health at the root of man 's being , his rightness , is to be free from wrongness , that is , from sin .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 12]: A man is right when there is no wrong in him .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 17]: The wrong , the evil is in him ; he must be set free from it .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 66]: I do not mean set free from the sins he has done : that will follow ; I mean the sins he is doing , or is capable of doing ; the sins in his being which spoil his nature -- the wrongness in him -- the evil he consents to ; the sin he is , which makes him do the sin he does .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 26]: To save a man from his sins , is to say to him , in sense perfect and eternal , ` Rise up and walk .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 8]: Be at liberty in thy essential being .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 11]: Be free as the son of God is free . '
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 18]: To do this for us , Jesus was born , and remains born to all the ages .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 57]: When misery drives a man to call out to the source of his life , -- and I take the increasing outcry against existence as a sign of the growth of the race toward a sense of the need of regeneration -- the answer , I think , will come in a quickening of his conscience .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 58]: This earnest of the promised deliverance may not , in all probability will not be what the man desires ; he will want only to be rid of his suffering ; but that he can not have , save in being delivered from its essential root , a thing infinitely worse than any suffering it can produce .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 14]: If he will not have that deliverance , he must keep his suffering .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 23]: Through chastisement he will take at last the only way that leads into the liberty of that which is and must be .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 19]: There can be no deliverance but to come out of his evil dream into the glory of God .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 26]: It is true that Jesus came , in delivering us from our sins , to deliver us also from the painful consequences of our sins .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 19]: But these consequences exist by the one law of the universe , the true will of the Perfect .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 53]: That broken , that disobeyed by the creature , disorganization renders suffering inevitable ; it is the natural consequence of the unnatural -- and , in the perfection of God 's creation , the result is curative of the cause ; the pain at least tends to the healing of the breach .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 48]: The Lord never came to deliver men from the consequences of their sins while yet those sins remained : that would be to cast out of window the medicine of cure while yet the man lay sick ; to go dead against the very laws of being .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 45]: Yet men , loving their sins , and feeling nothing of their dread hatefulness , have , consistently with their low condition , constantly taken this word concerning the Lord to mean that he came to save them from the punishment of their sins .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 17]: The idea -- the miserable fancy rather -- has terribly corrupted the preaching of the gospel .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 12]: The message of the good news has not been truly delivered .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 86]: Unable to believe in the forgiveness of their Father in heaven , imagining him not at liberty to forgive , or incapable of forgiving forthright ; not really believing him God our Saviour , but a God bound , either in his own nature or by a law above him and compulsory upon him , to exact some recompense or satisfaction for sin , a multitude of teaching men have taught their fellows that Jesus came to bear our punishment and save us from hell .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 32]: They have represented a result as the object of his mission -- the said result nowise to be desired by true man save as consequent on the gain of his object .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 21]: The mission of Jesus was from the same source and with the same object as the punishment of our sins .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 9]: He came to work along with our punishment .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 15]: He came to side with it , and set us free from our sins .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 68]: No man is safe from hell until he is free from his sins ; but a man to whom his sins , that is the evil things in him , are a burden , while he may indeed sometimes feel as if he were in hell , will soon have forgotten that ever he had any other hell to think of than that of his sinful condition .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 33]: For to him his sins are hell ; he would go to the other hell to be free of them ; free of them , hell itself would be endurable to him .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 11]: For hell is God 's and not the devil 's .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 22]: Hell is on the side of God and man , to free the child of God from the corruption of death .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 23]: Not one soul will ever be redeemed from hell but by being saved from his sins , from the evil in him .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 31]: If hell be needful to save him , hell will blaze , and the worm will writhe and bite , until he takes refuge in the will of the Father .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 22]: ` Salvation from hell , is salvation as conceived by such to whom hell and not evil is the terror . '
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 44]: But if even for dread of hell a poor soul seek the Father , he will be heard of him in his terror , and , taught of him to seek the immeasurably greater gift , will in the greater receive the less .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 50]: There is another important misapprehension of the words of the messengers of the good tidings -- that they threaten us with punishment because of the sins we have committed , whereas their message is of forgiveness , not of vengeance ; of deliverance , not of evil to come .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 16]: Not for anything he has committed do they threaten a man with the outer darkness .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 29]: Not for any or all of his sins that are past shall a man be condemned ; not for the worst of them needs he dread remaining unforgiven .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 23]: The sin he dwells in , the sin he will not come out of , is the sole ruin of a man .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 69]: His present , his live sins -- those pervading his thoughts and ruling his conduct ; the sins he keeps doing , and will not give up ; the sins he is called to abandon , and clings to ; the same sins which are the cause of his misery , though he may not know it -- these are they for which he is even now condemned .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 52]: It is true the memory of the wrongs we have done is , or will become very bitter ; but not for those is condemnation ; and if that in our character which made them possible were abolished , remorse would lose its worst bitterness in the hope of future amends .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 29]: ` This is the condemnation , that light is come into the world , and men loved darkness rather than light , because their deeds were evil . '
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 20]: It is the indwelling badness , ready to produce bad actions , that we need to be delivered from .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 21]: Against this badness if a man will not strive , he is left to commit evil and reap the consequences .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 22]: To be saved from these consequences , would be no deliverance ; it would be an immediate , ever deepening damnation .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 17]: It is the evil in our being -- no essential part of it , thank God !
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 80]: -- the miserable fact that the very child of God does not care for his father and will not obey him , causing us to desire wrongly , act wrongly , or , where we try not to act wrongly , yet making it impossible for us not to feel wrongly -- this is what he came to deliver us from ; -- not the things we have done , but the possibility of doing such things any more .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 45]: With the departure of this possibility , and with the hope of confession hereafter to those we have wronged , will depart also the power over us of the evil things we have done , and so we shall be saved from them also .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 70]: The bad that lives in us , our evil judgments , our unjust desires , our hate and pride and envy and greed and self-satisfaction -- these are the souls of our sins , our live sins , more terrible than the bodies of our sins , namely the deeds we do , inasmuch as they not only produce these loathsome things , but make us loathsome as they .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 16]: Our wrong deeds are our dead works ; our evil thoughts are our live sins .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 30]: These , the essential opposites of faith and love , the sins that dwell and work in us , are the sins from which Jesus came to deliver us .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 25]: When we turn against them and refuse to obey them , they rise in fierce insistence , but the same moment begin to die .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 26]: We are then on the Lord 's side , as he has always been on ours , and he begins to deliver us from them .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 29]: Anything in you , which , in your own child , would make you feel him not so pleasant as you would have him , is something wrong .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 13]: This may mean much to one , little or nothing to another .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 20]: Things in a child which to one parent would not seem worth minding , would fill another with horror .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 30]: After his moral development , where the one parent would smile , the other would look aghast , perceiving both the present evil , and the serpent-brood to follow .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 44]: But as the love of him who is love , transcends ours as the heavens are higher than the earth , so must he desire in his child infinitely more than the most jealous love of the best mother can desire in hers .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 42]: He would have him rid of all discontent , all fear , all grudging , all bitterness in word or thought , all gauging and measuring of his own with a different rod from that he would apply to another 's .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 38]: He will have no curling of the lip ; no indifference in him to the man whose service in any form he uses ; no desire to excel another , no contentment at gaining by his loss .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 40]: He will not have him receive the smallest service without gratitude ; would not hear from him a tone to jar the heart of another , a word to make it ache , be the ache ever so transient .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 32]: From such , as from all other sins , Jesus was born to deliver us ; not , primarily , or by itself , from the punishment of any of them .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 13]: When all are gone , the holy punishment will have departed also .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 12]: He came to make us good , and therein blessed children .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 11]: One master-sin is at the root of all the rest .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 59]: It is no individual action , or anything that comes of mood , or passion ; it is the non-recognition by the man , and consequent inactivity in him , of the highest of all relations , that relation which is the root and first essential condition of every other true relation of or in the human soul .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 30]: It is the absence in the man of harmony with the being whose thought is the man 's existence , whose word is the man 's power of thought .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 98]: It is true that , being thus his offspring , God , as St Paul affirms , can not be far from any one of us : were we not in closest contact of creating and created , we could not exist ; as we have in us no power to be , so have we none to continue being ; but there is a closer contact still , as absolutely necessary to our well-being and highest existence , as the other to our being at all , to the mere capacity of faring well or ill .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 34]: For the highest creation of God in man is his will , and until the highest in man meets the highest in God , their true relation is not yet a spiritual fact .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 15]: The flower lies in the root , but the root is not the flower .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 31]: The relation exists , but while one of the parties neither knows , loves , nor acts upon it , the relation is , as it were , yet unborn .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 60]: The highest in man is neither his intellect nor his imagination nor his reason ; all are inferior to his will , and indeed , in a grand way , dependent upon it : his will must meet God 's -- a will _ distinct _ from God 's , else were no _ harmony _ possible between them .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 15]: Not the less , therefore , but the more , is all God 's .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 13]: For God creates in the man the power to will His will .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 80]: It may cost God a suffering man can never know , to bring the man to the point at which he will will His will ; but when he is brought to that point , and declares for the truth , that is , for the will of God , he becomes one with God , and the end of God in the man 's creation , the end for which Jesus was born and died , is gained .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 18]: The man is saved from his sins , and the universe flowers yet again in his redemption .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 43]: But I would not be supposed , from what I have said , to imagine the Lord without sympathy for the sorrows and pains which reveal what sin is , and by means of which he would make men sick of sin .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 6]: With everything human he sympathizes .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 59]: Evil is not human ; it is the defect and opposite of the human ; but the suffering that follows it is human , belonging of necessity to the human that has sinned : while it is by cause of sin , suffering is _ for _ the sinner , that he may be delivered from his sin .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 10]: Jesus is in himself aware of every human pain .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 5]: He feels it also .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 7]: In him too it is pain .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 28]: With the energy of tenderest love he wills his brothers and sisters free , that he may fill them to overflowing with that essential thing , joy .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 7]: For that they were indeed created .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 22]: But the moment they exist , truth becomes the first thing , not happiness ; and he must make them true .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 28]: Were it possible , however , for pain to continue after evil was gone , he would never rest while one ache was yet in the world .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 23]: Perfect in sympathy , he feels in himself , I say , the tortured presence of every nerve that lacks its repose .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 32]: The man may recognize the evil in him only as pain ; he may know little and care nothing about his sins ; yet is the Lord sorry for his pain .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 26]: He cries aloud , ` Come unto me , all ye that labour and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest . '
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 40]: He does not say , ` Come unto me , all ye that feel the burden of your sins ; ' he opens his arms to all weary enough to come to him in the poorest hope of rest .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 41]: Right gladly would he free them from their misery -- but he knows only one way : he will teach them to be like himself , meek and lowly , bearing with gladness the yoke of his father 's will .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 26]: This is the one , the only right , the only possible way of freeing them from their sins , the cause of their unrest .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 26]: With them the weariness comes first ; with him the sins : there is but one cure for both -- the will of the Father .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 10]: That which is his joy will be their deliverance !
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 72]: He might indeed , it may be , take from them the human , send them down to some lower stage of being , and so free them from suffering -- but that must be either a descent toward annihilation , or a fresh beginning to grow up again toward the region of suffering they have left ; for that which is not growing must at length die out of creation .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 55]: The disobedient and selfish would fain in the hell of their hearts possess the liberty and gladness that belong to purity and love , but they can not have them ; they are weary and heavy-laden , both with what they are , and because of what they were made for but are not .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 14]: The Lord knows what they need ; they know only what they want .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 10]: They want ease ; he knows they need purity .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 25]: Their very existence is an evil , of which , but for his resolve to purify them , their maker must rid his universe .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 11]: How can he keep in his sight a foul presence ?
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 33]: Must the creator send forth his virtue to hold alive a thing that will be evil -- a thing that ought not to be , that has no claim but to cease ?
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 13]: The Lord himself would not live save with an existence absolutely good .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 22]: It may be my reader will desire me to say _ how _ the Lord will deliver him from his sins .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 13]: That is like the lawyer 's ` Who is my neighbour ? '
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 41]: The spirit of such a mode of receiving the offer of the Lord 's deliverance , is the root of all the horrors of a corrupt theology , so acceptable to those who love weak and beggarly hornbooks of religion .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 24]: Such questions spring from the passion for the fruit of the tree of knowledge , not the fruit of the tree of life .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 26]: Men would understand : they do not care to _ obey _ , -- understand where it is impossible they should understand save by obeying .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 46]: They would search into the work of the Lord instead of doing their part in it -- thus making it impossible both for the Lord to go on with his work , and for themselves to become capable of seeing and understanding what he does .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 64]: Instead of immediately obeying the Lord of life , the one condition upon which he can help them , and in itself the beginning of their deliverance , they set themselves to question their unenlightened intellects as to his plans for their deliverance -- and not merely how he means to effect it , but how he can be able to effect it .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 14]: They would bind their Samson until they have scanned his limbs and thews .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 91]: Incapable of understanding the first motions of freedom in themselves , they proceed to interpret the riches of his divine soul in terms of their own beggarly notions , to paraphrase his glorious verse into their own paltry commercial prose ; and then , in the growing presumption of imagined success , to insist upon their neighbours ' acceptance of their distorted shadows of ` the plan of salvation ' as the truth of him in whom is no darkness , and the one condition of their acceptance with him .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 32]: They delay setting their foot on the stair which alone can lead them to the house of wisdom , until they shall have determined the material and mode of its construction .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 35]: For the sake of knowing , they postpone that which alone can enable them to know , and substitute for the true understanding which lies beyond , a false persuasion that they already understand .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 23]: They will not accept , that is , act upon , their highest privilege , that of obeying the Son of God .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 23]: It is on them that do his will , that the day dawns ; to them the day-star arises in their hearts .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 7]: Obedience is the soul of knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 24]: By obedience , I intend no kind of obedience to man , or submission to authority claimed by man or community of men .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 16]: I mean obedience to the will of the Father , however revealed in our conscience .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 9]: God forbid I should seem to despise understanding .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 10]: The New Testament is full of urgings to understand .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 17]: Our whole life , to be life at all , must be a growth in understanding .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 20]: What I cry out upon is the misunderstanding that comes of man 's endeavour to understand while not obeying .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 12]: Upon obedience our energy must be spent ; understanding will follow .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 33]: Not anxious to know our duty , or knowing it and not doing it , how shall we understand that which only a true heart and a clean soul can ever understand ?
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 29]: The power in us that would understand were it free , lies in the bonds of imperfection and impurity , and is therefore incapable of judging the divine .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 7]: It can not see the truth .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 18]: If it could see it , it would not know it , and would not have it .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 16]: Until a man begins to obey , the light that is in him is darkness .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 42]: Any honest soul may understand this much , however -- for it is a thing we may of ourselves judge to be right -- that the Lord can not save a man from his sins while he holds to his sins .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 78]: An omnipotence that could do and not do the same thing at the same moment , were an idea too absurd for mockery ; an omnipotence that could at once make a man a free man , and leave him a self-degraded slave -- make him the very likeness of God , and good only because he could not help being good , would be an idea of the same character -- equally absurd , equally self-contradictory .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 19]: But the Lord is not unreasonable ; he requires no high motives where such could not yet exist .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 51]: He does not say , ` You must be sorry for your sins , or you need not come to me : ' to be sorry for his sins a man must love God and man , and love is the very thing that has to be developed in him .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 34]: It is but common sense that a man , longing to be freed from suffering , or made able to bear it , should betake himself to the Power by whom he is .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 38]: Equally is it common sense that , if a man would be delivered from the evil in him , he must himself begin to cast it out , himself begin to disobey it , and work righteousness .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 25]: As much as either is it common sense that a man should look for and expect the help of his Father in the endeavour .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 12]: Alone , he might labour to all eternity and not succeed .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 18]: He who has not made himself , can not set himself right without him who made him .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 12]: But his maker is in him , and is his strength .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 46]: The man , however , who , instead of doing what he is told , broods speculating on the metaphysics of him who calls him to his work , stands leaning his back against the door by which the Lord would enter to help him .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 39]: The moment he sets about putting straight the thing that is crooked -- I mean doing right where he has been doing wrong , he withdraws from the entrance , gives way for the Master to come in .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 52]: He can not make himself pure , but he can leave that which is impure ; he can spread out the ` defiled , discoloured web ' of his life before the bleaching sun of righteousness ; he can not save himself , but he can let the Lord save him .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 26]: The struggle of his weakness is as essential to the coming victory as the strength of Him who resisted unto death , striving against sin .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 43]: The sum of the whole matter is this : -- The Son has come from the Father to set the children free from their sins ; the children must hear and obey him , that he may send forth judgment unto victory .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 34]: Son of our Father , help us to do what thou sayest , and so with thee die unto sin , that we may rise to the sonship for which we were created .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 13]: Help us to repent even to the sending away of our sins .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 6]: _ THE REMISSION OF SINS .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 20]: _ John did baptize in the wilderness , and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 7]: -- _ Mark _ i. 4 .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 41]: God and man must combine for salvation from sin , and the same word , here and elsewhere translated _ remission _ , seems to be employed in the New Testament for the share of either in the great deliverance .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 17]: But first let me say something concerning the word here and everywhere translated _ repentance _ .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 45]: I would not even suggest a mistranslation ; but the idea intended by the word has been so misunderstood and therefore mistaught , that it requires some consideration of the word itself to get at a right recognition of the moral fact it represents .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 47]: The Greek word then , of which the word _ repentance _ is the accepted synonym and fundamentally the accurate rendering , is made up of two words , the conjoint meaning of which is , _ a change of mind _ or _ thought _ .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 48]: There is in it no intent of , or hint at _ sorrow _ or _ shame _ , or any other of the mental conditions that , not unfrequently accompanying repentance , have been taken for essential parts of it , sometimes for its very essence .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 77]: Here , the last of the prophets , or the evangelist who records his doings , qualifies the word , as if he held it insufficient in itself to convey the Baptist 's meaning , with the three words that follow it -- _ -LSB- Greek : eis aPhesin amartiôn : -- kaerussôn Baptisma metauoias eis aphesin amartiôn -RSB- _ -- ` preaching a baptism of repentance -- _ unto a sending away of sins ' .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 163]: _ I do not say the phrase _ -LSB- Greek : aphesis amartiôn -RSB- _ never means _ forgiveness , _ one form at least of _ God 's _ sending away of sins ; neither do I say that the taking of the phrase to mean _ repentance for the remission of sins _ , namely , repentance in order to obtain the pardon of God , involves any inconsistency ; but I say that the word _ -LSB- Greek : eis -RSB- _ rather _ unto _ than _ for ; _ that the word _ -LSB- Greek : aphesis -RSB- , _ translated _ remission _ , means , fundamentally , a _ sending away , _ a _ dismissal ; _ and that the writer seems to use the added phrase to make certain what he means by _ repentance ; _ a repentance , namely , that reaches to the sending away , or abjurement of sins .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 36]: I do not think _ a change of mind unto the remission or pardon of sin _ would be nearly so logical a phrase as _ a change of mind unto the dismission of sinning .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 37]: _ The revised version refuses the word _ for _ and chooses _ unto , _ though it retains _ remission , _ which word , now , conveys no meaning except the forgiveness of God .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 30]: I think that here the same word is used for man 's dismission of his sins , as is elsewhere used for God 's dismission or remission of them .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 27]: In both uses , it is a sending away of sins , with the difference of meaning that comes from the differing sources of the action .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 34]: Both God and man send away sins , but in the one case God sends away the sins of the man , and in the other the man sends away his own sins .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 64]: I do not enter into the question whether God 's aphesis may or may not mean as well the sending of his sins out of a man , as the pardon of them ; whether it may not sometimes mean _ dismission , _ and sometimes _ remission _ : I am sure the one deed can not be separated from the other .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 29]: That the phrase here intends repentance unto the ceasing from sin , the giving up of what is wrong , I will try to show at least probable .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 52]: In the first place , the user of the phrase either defines the change of mind he means as one that has for its object the pardon of God , or as one that reaches to a new life : the latter seems to me the more natural interpretation by far .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 23]: The kind and scope of the repentance or change , and not any end to be gained by it , appears intended .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 61]: The change must be one of will and conduct -- a radical change of life on the part of the man : he must repent -- that is , change his mind -- not to a different opinion , not even to a mere betterment of his conduct -- not to anything less than a sending away of his sins .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 28]: This interpretation of the preaching of the Baptist seems to me , I repeat , the more direct , the fuller of meaning , the more logical .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 54]: Next , in St Matthew 's gospel , the Baptist 's buttressing argument , or imminent motive for the change he is pressing upon the people is , that the kingdom of heaven is at hand : ` Because the king of heaven is coming , you must give up your sinning . '
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 35]: The same argument for immediate action lies in his quotation from Isaiah , -- ` Prepare ye the way of the Lord ; make straight in the desert a highway for our God . '
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 31]: The only true , the only possible preparation for the coming Lord , is to cease from doing evil , and begin to do well -- to send away sin .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 29]: They must cleanse , not the streets of their cities , not their houses or their garments or even their persons , but their hearts and their doings .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 83]: It is true the Baptist did not see that the kingdom coming was not of this world , but of the higher world in the hearts of men ; it is true that his faith failed him in his imprisonment , because he heard of no martial movement on the part of the Lord , no assertion of his sovereignty , no convincing show of his power ; but he did see plainly that righteousness was essential to the kingdom of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 45]: That he did not yet perceive that righteousness _ is _ the kingdom of heaven ; that he did not see that the Lord was already initiating his kingdom by sending away sin out of the hearts of his people , is not wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 83]: The Lord 's answer to his fore-runner 's message of doubt , was to send his messenger back an eye-witness of what he was doing , so to wake or clarify in him the perception that his kingdom was not of this world -- that he dealt with other means to another end than John had yet recognized as his mission or object ; for obedient love in the heart of the poorest he healed or persuaded , was his kingdom come .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 45]: Again , observe that , when the Pharisees came to John , he said to them , ` Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance : ' is not this the same as , ` Repent unto the sending away of your sins ' ?
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 77]: Note also , that , when the multitudes came to the prophet , and all , with the classes most obnoxious to the rest , the publicans and the soldiers , asked what he would have them do -- thus plainly recognizing that something was required of them -- his instruction was throughout in the same direction : they must send away their sins ; and each must begin with the fault that lay next him .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 28]: The kingdom of heaven was at hand : they must prepare the way of the Lord by beginning to do as must be done in his kingdom .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 49]: They could not rid themselves of their sins , but they could set about sending them away ; they could quarrel with them , and proceed to turn them out of the house : the Lord was on his way to do his part in their final banishment .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 25]: Those who had repented to the sending away of their sins , he would baptize with a holy power to send them away indeed .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 20]: The operant will to get rid of them would be baptized with a fire that should burn them up .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 32]: When a man breaks with his sins , then the wind of the Lord 's fan will blow them away , the fire of the Lord 's heart will consume them .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 31]: I think , then , that the part of the repentant man , and not the part of God , in the sending away of sins , is intended here .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 20]: It is the man 's one preparation for receiving the power to overcome them , the baptism of fire .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 35]: Not seldom , what comes in the name of the gospel of Jesus Christ , must seem , even to one not far from the kingdom of heaven , no good news at all .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 15]: It does not draw him ; it wakes in him not a single hope .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 12]: He has no desire after what it offers him as redemption .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 18]: The God it gives him news of , is not one to whom he would draw nearer .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 105]: But when such a man comes to see that the very God must be his Life , the heart of his consciousness ; when he perceives that , rousing himself to put from him what is evil , and do the duty that lies at his door , he may fearlessly claim the help of him who ` loved him into being , ' then his will immediately sides with his conscience ; he begins to try to _ be _ ; and -- first thing toward being -- to rid himself of what is antagonistic to all being , namely _ wrong _ .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 18]: Multitudes will not even approach the appalling task , the labour and pain of _ being _ .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 58]: God is doing his part , is undergoing the mighty toil of an age-long creation , endowing men with power to be ; but few as yet are those who take up their part , who respond to the call of God , who will to be , who put forth a divine effort after real existence .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 20]: To the many , the spirit of the prophet cries , ` Turn ye , and change your way !
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 8]: The kingdom of heaven is near you .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 7]: Let your king possess his own .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 19]: Let God throne himself in you , that his liberty be your life , and you free men .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 11]: That he may enter , clear the house for him .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 9]: Send away the bad things out of it .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 8]: Depart from evil , and do good .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 18]: The duty that lieth at thy door , do it , be it great or small . '
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 12]: For indeed in this region there is no great or small .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 15]: ` Be content with your wages , ' said the Baptist to the soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 53]: To many people now , the word would be , ` Rule your temper ; ' or , ` Be courteous to all ; ' or , ` Let each hold the other better than himself ; ' or , ` Be just to your neighbour that you may love him . '
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 45]: To make straight in the desert a highway for our God , we must bestir ourselves in the very spot of the desert on which we stand ; we must cast far from us our evil thing that blocks the way of his chariot-wheels .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 23]: If we do not , never will those wheels roll through our streets ; never will our desert blossom with his roses .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 38]: The message of John to his countrymen , was then , and is yet , the one message to the world : -- ` Send away your sins , for the kingdom of heaven is near . '
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 50]: Some of us -- I can not say _ all _ , for I do not know -- who have already repented , who have long ago begun to send away our sins , need fresh repentance every day -- how many times a day , God only knows .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 28]: We are so ready to get upon some path that seems to run parallel with the narrow way , and then take no note of its divergence !
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 23]: What is there for us when we discover that we are out of the way , but to bethink ourselves and turn ?
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 56]: By those ` who need no repentance , ' the Lord may have meant such as had repented perfectly , had sent away all their sins , and were now with him in his Father 's house ; also such as have never sinned , and such as no longer turn aside for any temptation .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 22]: We shall now , perhaps , be able to understand the relation of the Lord himself to the baptism of John .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 26]: He came to John to be baptized ; and most would say John 's baptism was of repentance for the remission or pardon of sins .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 29]: But the Lord could not be baptized for the remission of sins , for he had never done a selfish , an untrue , or an unfair thing .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 17]: He had never wronged his Father , any more than ever his Father had wronged him .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 24]: Happy , happy Son and Father , who had never either done the other wrong , in thought , word , or deed !
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 9]: As little had he wronged brother or sister .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 11]: He needed no forgiveness ; there was nothing to forgive .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 20]: No more could he be baptized for repentance : in him repentance would have been to turn to evil !
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 22]: Where then was the propriety of his coming to be baptized by John , and insisting on being by him baptized ?
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 5]: It must lie elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 99]: If we take the words of John to mean ` the baptism of repentance unto the sending away of sins ; ' and if we bear in mind that in his case repentance could not be , inasmuch as what repentance is necessary to bring about in man , was already existent in Jesus ; then , altering the words to fit the case , and saying , ` the baptism of willed devotion to the sending away of sin , ' we shall see at once how the baptism of Jesus was a thing right and fit .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 57]: That he had no sin to repent of , was not because he was so constituted that he could not sin if he would ; it was because , of his own will and judgment , he sent sin away from him -- sent it from him with the full choice and energy of his nature .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 16]: God knows good and evil , and , blessed be his name , chooses good .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 19]: Never will his righteous anger make him unfair to us , make him forget that we are dust .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 29]: Like him , his son also chose good , and in that choice resisted all temptation to help his fellows otherwise than as their and his father would .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 145]: Instead of crushing the power of evil by divine force ; instead of compelling justice and destroying the wicked ; instead of making peace on the earth by the rule of a perfect prince ; instead of gathering the children of Jerusalem under his wings whether they would or not , and saving them from the horrors that anguished his prophetic soul -- he let evil work its will while it lived ; he contented himself with the slow unencouraging ways of help essential ; making men good ; casting out , not merely controlling Satan ; carrying to their perfect issue on earth the old primeval principles because of which the Father honoured him : ` Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity ; therefore God , even thy God , hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows . '
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 37]: To love righteousness is to make it grow , not to avenge it ; and to win for righteousness the true victory , he , as well as his brethren , had to send away evil .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 35]: Throughout his life on earth , he resisted every impulse to work more rapidly for a lower good , -- strong perhaps when he saw old age and innocence and righteousness trodden under foot .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 36]: What but this gives any worth of reality to the temptation in the wilderness , to the devil 's departing from him for a season , to his coming again to experience a like failure ?
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 67]: Ever and ever , in the whole attitude of his being , in his heart always lifted up , in his unfailing readiness to pull with the Father 's yoke , he was repelling , driving away sin -- away from himself , and , as Lord of men , and their saviour , away from others also , bringing them to abjure it like himself .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 31]: No man , least of all any lord of men , can be good without willing to be good , without setting himself against evil , without sending away sin .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 30]: Other men have to send it away out of them ; the Lord had to send it away from before him , that it should not enter into him .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 18]: Therefore is the stand against sin common to the captain of salvation and the soldiers under him .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 10]: What did Jesus come into the world to do ?
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 48]: The will of God in saving his people from their sins -- not from the punishment of their sins , that blessed aid to repentance , but from their sins themselves , the paltry as well as the heinous , the venial as well as the loathsome .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 34]: His whole work was and is to send away sin -- to banish it from the earth , yea , to cast it into the abyss of non-existence behind the back of God .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 59]: His was the holy war ; he came carrying it into our world ; he resisted unto blood ; the soldiers that followed him he taught and trained to resist also unto blood , striving against sin ; so he became the captain of their salvation , and they , freed themselves , fought and suffered for others .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 17]: This was the task to which he was baptized ; this is yet his enduring labour .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 22]: ` This is my blood of the new covenant which is shed for many unto the sending away of sins . '
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 7]: What was the new covenant ? '
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 61]: I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah ; not according to the covenant which they brake , but this : I will put my law in their inward parts , and write it in their hearts , and will be their God , and they shall be my people . '
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 15]: John baptized unto repentance because those to whom he was sent had to repent .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 15]: They must bethink themselves , and send away the sin that was in them .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 58]: But had there been a man , aware of no sin in him , but aware that life would be no life were not sin kept out of him , that man would have been right in receiving the baptism of John unto the continuous dismission of the sin ever wanting to enter in at his door .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 30]: The object of the baptism was the sending away of sin ; its object was repentance only where necessary to , only as introducing , as resulting in that .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 61]: He to whom John was not sent , He whom he did not call , He who needed no repentance , was baptized for the same object , to the same conflict for the same end -- the banishment of sin from the dominions of his father -- and that first by his own sternest repudiation of it in himself .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 19]: Thence came his victory in the wilderness : he would have his fathers way , not his own .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 39]: Could he be less fitted to receive the baptism of John , that the object of it was no new thing with him , who had been about it from the beginning , yea , from all eternity ?
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 13]: We shall be about it , I presume , to all eternity .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 44]: Such , then , as were baptized by John , were initiated into the company of those whose work was to send sin out of the world , and first , by sending it out of themselves , by having done with it .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 90]: Their earliest endeavour in this direction would , as I have said , open the door for that help to enter without which a man could never succeed in the divinely arduous task -- could not , because the region in which the work has to be wrought lies in the very roots of his own being , where , knowing nothing of the secrets of his essential existence , he can immediately do nothing , where the maker of him alone is potent , alone is consciously present .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 22]: The change that must pass in him more than equals a new creation , inasmuch as it is a higher creation .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 39]: But its necessity is involved in the former creation ; and thence we have a right to ask help of our creator , for he requires of us what he has created us unable to effect without him .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 4]: Nay , nay !
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 16]: -- could we do anything without him , it were a thing to leave undone .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 11]: Blessed fact that he hath made us so near him !
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 21]: that the scale of our being is so large , that we are completed only by his presence in it !
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 8]: that we are not men without him !
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 10]: that we can be one with our self-existent creator !
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 11]: that we are not cut off from the original Infinite !
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 15]: that in him we must share infinitude , or be enslaved by the finite !
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 30]: The very patent of our royalty is , that not for a moment can we live our true life without the eternal life present in and with our spirits .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 12]: Without him at our unknown root , we cease to be .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 81]: True , a dog can not live without the presence of God ; but I presume a dog may live a good dog-life without knowing the presence of his origin : man is dead if he know not the Power which is his cause , his deepest selfing self ; the Presence which is not himself , and is nearer to him than himself ; which is infinitely more himself , more his very being , than he is himself .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 58]: The being of which we are conscious , is not our full self ; the extent of our consciousness of our self is no measure of our self ; our consciousness is infinitely less than we ; while God is more necessary even to that poor consciousness of self than our self-consciousness is necessary to our humanity .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 55]: Until a man become the power of his own existence , become his own God , the sole thing necessary to his existing is the will of God ; for the well-being and perfecting of that existence , the sole thing necessary is , that the man should know his maker present in him .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 9]: All that the children want is their Father .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 49]: The one true end of all speech concerning holy things is -- the persuading of the individual man to cease to do evil , to set himself to do well , to look to the lord of his life to be on his side in the new struggle .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 37]: Supposing the suggestions I have made correct , I do not care that my reader should understand them , except it be to turn against the evil in him , and begin to cast it out .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 22]: If this be not the result , it is of no smallest consequence whether he agree with my interpretation or not .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 32]: If he do thus repent , it is of equally little consequence ; for , setting himself to do the truth , he is on the way to know all things .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 10]: Real knowledge has begun to grow possible for him .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 23]: I am not sure what the Lord means in the words , ` Thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness . '
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 10]: Baptism could not be the fulfilling of all righteousness !
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 22]: Perhaps he means , ` We must , by a full act of the will , give ourselves altogether to righteousness .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 22]: We must make it the business of our lives to send away sin , and do the will of the Father .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 20]: That is my work as much as the work of any man who must repent ere he can begin .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 20]: I will not be left out when you call men to be pure as our father is pure . '
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 19]: To be certain whom he intends by _ us _ might perhaps help us to see his meaning .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 10]: Does he intend _ all of us men _ ?
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 10]: Does he intend ` my father and me ' ?
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 12]: Or does he intend ` you and me , John ' ?
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 27]: If the saying mean what I have suggested , then the _ us _ would apply to all that have the knowledge of good and evil .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 12]: ` Every being that can , must devote himself to righteousness .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 19]: To be right is no adjunct of completeness ; it is the ground and foundation of existence . '
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 30]: But perhaps it was a lesson for John himself , who , mighty preacher of righteousness as he was , did not yet count it the all of life .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 5]: I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 39]: Note that when the Lord began his teaching , he employed , neither using nor inculcating any rite , the same words as John , -- ` Repent , for the kingdom of heaven is at hand . '
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 35]: That kingdom had been at hand all his infancy , boyhood , and young manhood : he was in the world with his father in his heart : that was the kingdom of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 36]: Lonely man on the hillside , or boy the cynosure of doctor-eyes , his father was everything to him : -- ` Wist ye not that I must be in my father 's things ? '
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 6]: _ JESUS IN THE WORLD .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 12]: _ ` Son , why hast thou thus dealt with us ?
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 12]: behold , thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing . '
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 15]: And he said unto them , ` How is it that ye sought me ?
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 14]: wist ye not that I must be about my father 's business ? '
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 12]: And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 6]: -- _ Luke _ ii .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 2]: 48-50 .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 5]: Was that his saying ?
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 7]: Why did they not understand it ?
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 5]: Do we understand it ?
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 6]: What did his saying mean ?
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 7]: The Greek is not absolutely clear .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 17]: Whether the Syriac words he used were more precise , who in this world can tell ?
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 24]: But had we heard his very words , we too , with his father and mother , would have failed to understand them .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 5]: Must we fail still ?
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 55]: It will show at once where our initial difficulty lies , if I give the latter half of the saying as presented in the revised English version : its departure from the authorized reveals the point of obscurity : -- ` Wist ye not that I must be in my father 's house ? '
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 12]: His parents had his exact words , yet did not understand .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 21]: We have not his exact words , and are in doubt as to what the Greek translation of them means .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 92]: If the authorized translation be true to the intent of the Greek , and therefore to that of the Syriac , how could his parents , knowing him as they did from all that had been spoken before concerning him , from all they had seen in him , from the ponderings in Mary 's own heart , and from the precious thoughts she and Joseph cherished concerning him , have failed to understand him when he said that wherever he was , he must be about his father 's business ?
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 60]: On the other hand , supposing them to know and feel that he must be about his father 's business , would that have been reason sufficient , in view of the degree of spiritual development to which they had attained , for the Lord 's expecting them not to be anxious about him when they had lost him ?
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 29]: Thousands on thousands who trust God for their friends in things spiritual , do not trust him for them in regard of their mere health or material well-being .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 95]: His parents knew how prophets had always been treated in the land ; or if they did not think in that direction , there were many dangers to which a boy like him would seem exposed , to rouse an anxiety that could be met only by a faith equal to saying , ` Whatever has happened to him , death itself , it can be no evil to one who is about his father 's business ; ' and such a faith I think the Lord could not yet have expected of them .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 63]: That what the world counts misfortune might befall him on his father 's business , would have been recognized by him , I think , as reason for their parental anxiety -- so long as they had not learned God -- that he is what he is -- the thing the Lord had come to teach his father 's men and women .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 19]: His words seem rather to imply that there was no need to be anxious about his personal safety .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 53]: Fear of some accident to him seems to have been the cause of their trouble ; and he did not mean , I think , that they ought not to mind if he died doing his father 's will , but that he was in no danger as regarded accident or misfortune .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 9]: This will appear more plainly as we proceed .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 7]: So much for the authorized version .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 28]: Let us now take the translation given us by the Revisers : -- ` Wist ye not that I must be in my father 's house ? '
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 9]: Are they authorized in translating the Greek thus ?
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 18]: I know no justification for it , but am not learned enough to say they have none .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 22]: That the Syriac has it so , is of little weight ; seeing it is no original Syriac , but retranslation .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 29]: If he did say ' _ my father 's house _ ' , could he have meant the temple and his parents not have known what he meant ?
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 27]: And why should he have taken it for granted they would know , or judge that they ought to have known , that he was there ?
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 38]: So little did the temple suggest itself to them , that either it was the last place in which they sought him , or they had been there before , and had _ not _ found him .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 33]: If he meant that they might have known this without being told , why was it that , even when he set the thing before them , they did not understand him ?
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 26]: I do not believe he meant the temple ; I do not think he said or meant ' _ in my fathers house ' _ .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 30]: What then makes those who give us this translation , prefer it to the phrase in the authorized version , ' _ about my Father 's business _ ' ?
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 28]: One or other of two causes -- most likely both together : an ecclesiastical fancy , and the mere fact that he was found in the temple .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 143]: A mind ecclesiastical will presume the temple the fittest , therefore most likely place , for the Son of God to betake himself to , but such a mind would not be the first to reflect that the temple was a place where the Father was worshipped neither in spirit nor in truth -- a place built by one of the vilest rulers of this world , less fit than many another spot for the special presence of him of whom the prophet bears witness : ` Thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity , whose name is Holy ; I dwell in the high and holy place , with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit , to revive the spirit of the humble , and to revive the heart of the contrite ones . '
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 25]: Jesus himself , with the same breath in which once he called it his father 's house , called it a den of thieves .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 29]: His expulsion from it of the buyers and sellers , was the first waft of the fan with which he was come to purge his father 's dominions .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 24]: Nothing could ever cleanse that house ; his fanning rose to a tempest , and swept it out of his father 's world .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 88]: For the second possible cause of the change from _ business _ to _ temple _ -- the mere fact that he was found in the temple , can hardly be a reason for his expecting his parents to know that he was there ; and if it witnessed to some way of thought or habit of his with which they were acquainted , it is , I repeat , difficult to see why the parents should fail to perceive what the interpreters have found so easily .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 30]: But the parents looked for a larger meaning in the words of such a son -- whose meaning at the same time was too large for them to find .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 43]: When , according to the Greek , the Lord , on the occasion already alluded to , says ` my father 's house , ' he says it plainly ; he uses the word _ house _ : here he does not .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 33]: Let us see what lies in the Greek to guide us to the thought in the mind of the Lord when he thus reasoned with the apprehensions of his father and mother .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 24]: The Greek , taken literally , says , ` Wist ye not that I must be in the -- of my father ? '
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 15]: The authorized version supplies _ business _ ; the revised , _ house _ .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 19]: There is no noun in the Greek , and the article ` the ' is in the plural .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 38]: To translate it as literally as it can be translated , making of it an English sentence , the saying stands , ` Wist ye not that I must be in the things of my father ? '
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 24]: The plural article implies the English _ things _ ; and the question is then , What _ things _ does he mean ?
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 33]: The word might mean _ affairs _ or _ business _ ; but why the plural article should be contracted to mean _ house _ , _ I _ do not know .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 33]: In a great wide sense , no doubt , the word _ house _ might be used , as I am about to show , but surely not as meaning the temple .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 22]: He was arguing for confidence in God on the part of his parents , not for a knowledge of his whereabout .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 27]: The same thing that made them anxious concerning him , prevented them from understanding his words -- lack , namely , of faith in the Father .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 23]: This , the one thing he came into the world to teach men , those words were meant to teach his parents .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 16]: They are spirit and life , involving the one principle by which men shall live .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 23]: They hold the same core as his words to his disciples in the storm , ` Oh ye of little faith ! '
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 8]: Let us look more closely at them .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 8]: ` Why did you look for me ?
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 15]: Did you not know that I must be among my father 's things ? '
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 13]: What are we to understand by ` my father 's things ' ?
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 82]: The translation given in the authorized version is , I think , as to the words themselves , a thoroughly justifiable one : ' I must be about my father 's business , ' or ` my father 's affairs ' ; I refuse it for no other reason than that it does not fit the logic of the narrative , as does the word _ things _ , which besides opens to us a door of large and joyous prospect .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 31]: Of course he was about his father 's business , and they might know it and yet be anxious about him , not having a perfect faith in that father .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 149]: But , as I have said already , it was not anxiety as to what might befall him because of doing the will of the Father ; he might well seem to them as yet too young for danger from that source ; it was but the vague perils of life beyond their sight that appalled them ; theirs was just the uneasiness that possesses every parent whose child is missing ; and if they , like him , had trusted in their father , they would have known what their son now meant when he said that he was in the midst of his father 's things -- namely , that the very things from which they dreaded evil accident , were his own home-surroundings ; that he was not doing the Father 's business in a foreign country , but in the Father 's own house .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 62]: Understood as meaning the world , or the universe , the phrase , ` my father 's house , ' would be a better translation than the authorized ; understood as meaning the poor , miserable , God-forsaken temple -- no more the house of God than a dead body is the house of a man -- it is immeasurably inferior .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 71]: It seems to me , I say , that the Lord meant to remind them , or rather to make them feel , for they had not yet learned the fact , that he was never away from home , could not be lost , as they had thought him ; that he was in his father 's house all the time , where no hurt could come to him .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 26]: ` The things ' about him were the furniture and utensils of his home ; he knew them all and how to use them . '
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 10]: I must be among my father 's belongings . '
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 11]: The world was his home because his father 's house .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 15]: He was not a stranger who did not know his way about in it .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 14]: He was no lost child , but with his father all the time .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 28]: Here we find one main thing wherein the Lord differs from us : we are not at home in this great universe , our father 's house .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 18]: We ought to be , and one day we shall be , but we are not yet .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 15]: This reveals Jesus more than man , by revealing him more man than we .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 35]: We are not complete men , we are not anything near it , and are therefore out of harmony , more or less , with everything in the house of our birth and habitation .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 16]: Always struggling to make our home in the world , we have not yet succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 39]: We are not at home in it , because we are not at home with the lord of the house , the father of the family , not one with our elder brother who is his right hand .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 16]: It is only the son , the daughter , that abideth ever in the house .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 37]: When we are true children , if not the world , then the universe will be our home , felt and known as such , the house we are satisfied with , and would not change .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 58]: Hence , until then , the hard struggle , the constant strife we hold with _ Nature _ -- as we call the things of our father ; a strife invaluable for our development , at the same time manifesting us not yet men enough to be lords of the house built for us to live in .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 36]: We can not govern or command in it as did the Lord , because we are not at one with his father , therefore neither in harmony with his things , nor rulers over them .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 33]: Our best power in regard to them is but to find out wonderful facts concerning them and their relations , and turn these facts to our uses on systems of our own .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 49]: For we discover what we seem to discover , by working inward from without , while he works outward from within ; and we shall never understand the world , until we see it in the direction in which he works making it -- namely from within outward .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 14]: This of course we can not do until we are one with him .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 53]: In the meantime , so much are both we and his things his , that we can err concerning them only as he has made it possible for us to err ; we can wander only in the direction of the truth -- if but to find that we can find nothing .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 16]: Think for a moment how Jesus was at home among the things of his father .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 28]: It seems to me , I repeat , a spiritless explanation of his words -- that the temple was the place where naturally he was at home .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 10]: Does he make the least lamentation over the temple ?
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 18]: It is Jerusalem he weeps over -- the men of Jerusalem , the killers , the stoners .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 7]: What was his place of prayer ?
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 8]: Not the temple , but the mountain-top .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 25]: Where does he find symbols whereby to speak of what goes on in the mind and before the face of his father in heaven ?
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 93]: Not in the temple ; not in its rites ; not on its altars ; not in its holy of holies ; he finds them in the world and its lovely-lowly facts ; on the roadside , in the field , in the vineyard , in the garden , in the house ; in the family , and the commonest of its affairs -- the lighting of the lamp , the leavening of the meal , the neighbour 's borrowing , the losing of the coin , the straying of the sheep .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 35]: Even in the unlovely facts also of the world which he turns to holy use , such as the unjust judge , the false steward , the faithless labourers , he ignores the temple .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 22]: See how he drives the devils from the souls and bodies of men , as we the wolves from our sheepfolds !
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 14]: how before him the diseases , scaly and spotted , hurry and flee !
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 10]: The world has for him no chamber of terror .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 26]: He walks to the door of the sepulchre , the sealed cellar of his father 's house , and calls forth its four days dead .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 22]: He rebukes the mourners , he stays the funeral , and gives back the departed children to their parents ' arms .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 39]: The roughest of its servants do not make him wince ; none of them are so arrogant as to disobey his word ; he falls asleep in the midst of the storm that threatens to swallow his boat .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 13]: Hear how , on that same occasion , he rebukes his disciples !
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 13]: The children to tremble at a gust of wind in the house !
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 9]: God 's little ones afraid of a storm !
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 17]: Hear him tell the watery floor to be still , and no longer toss his brothers !
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 10]: see the watery floor obey him and grow still !
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 12]: See how the wandering creatures under it come at his call !
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 23]: See him leave his mountain-closet , and go walking over its heaving surface to the help of his men of little faith !
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 10]: See how the world 's water turns to wine !
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 10]: how its bread grows more bread at his word !
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 38]: See how he goes from the house for a while , and returning with fresh power , takes what shape he pleases , walks through its closed doors , and goes up and down its invisible stairs !
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 32]: All his life he was among his father 's things , either in heaven or in the world -- not then only when they found him in the temple at Jerusalem .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 21]: He is still among his father 's things , everywhere about in the world , everywhere throughout the wide universe .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 54]: Whatever he laid aside to come to us , to whatever limitations , for our sake , he stooped his regal head , he dealt with the things about him in such lordly , childlike manner as made it clear they were not strange to him , but the things of his father .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 22]: He claimed none of them as his own , would not have had one of them his except through his father .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 36]: Only as his father 's could he enjoy them ; -- only as coming forth from the Father , and full of the Father 's thought and nature , had they to him any existence .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 14]: That the things were his fathers , made them precious things to him .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 12]: He had no care for having , as men count having .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 8]: All his having was in the Father .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 18]: I wonder if he ever put anything in his pocket : I doubt if he had one .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 14]: Did he ever say , ` This is mine , not yours ' ?
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 17]: Did he not say , ` All things are mine , therefore they are yours ' ?
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 11]: Oh for his liberty among the things of the Father !
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 18]: Only by knowing them the things of our Father , can we escape enslaving ourselves to them .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 35]: Through the false , the infernal idea of _ having _ , of _ possessing _ them , we make them our tyrants , make the relation between them and us an evil thing .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 18]: The world was a blessed place to Jesus , because everything in it was his father 's .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 33]: What pain must it not have been to him , to see his brothers so vilely misuse the Father 's house by grasping , each for himself , at the family things !
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 70]: If the knowledge that a spot in the landscape retains in it some pollution , suffices to disturb our pleasure in the whole , how must it not have been with him , how must it not be with him now , in regard to the disfigurements and defilements caused by the greed of men , by their haste to be rich , in his father 's lovely house !
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 42]: Whoever is able to understand Wordsworth , or Henry Vaughan , when either speaks of the glorious insights of his childhood , will be able to imagine a little how Jesus must , in his eternal childhood , regard the world .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 74]: Hear what Wordsworth says : -- Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting : The Soul that rises with us , our life 's Star , Hath had elsewhere its setting , And cometh from afar : Not in entire forgetfulness , And not in utter nakedness , But trailing clouds of glory do we come From God , who is our home : Heaven lies about us in our infancy !
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 77]: Shades of the prison-house begin to close Upon the growing Boy , But he beholds the light , and whence it flows , He sees it in his joy ; The Youth , who daily farther from the east Must travel , still is Nature 's Priest , And by the vision splendid Is on his way attended ; At length the Man perceives it die away , And fade into the light of common day .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 20]: Hear what Henry Vaughan says : -- Happy those early dayes , when I Shin 'd in my angell-infancy !
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 128]: Before I understood this place Appointed for my second race , Or taught my soul to fancy ought But a white , celestiall thought ; When yet I had not walkt above A mile or two , from my first love , And looking back -- at that short space -- Could see a glimpse of His bright-face ; When on some gilded cloud , or flowre My gazing soul would dwell an houre , And in those weaker glories spy Some shadows of eternity ; Before I taught my tongue to wound My conscience with a sinfull sound , Or had the black art to dispence A sev ` rall sinne to ev'ry sence , But felt through all this fleshly dresse Bright shootes of everlastingnesse .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 15]: O how I long to travell back , And tread again that ancient track !
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 31]: That I might once more reach that plaine , Where first I left my glorious traine ; From whence th ' inlightned spirit sees That shady City of palme trees .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 51]: Whoever has thus gazed on flower or cloud ; whoever can recall poorest memory of the trail of glory that hung about his childhood , must have some faint idea how his father 's house and the things in it always looked , and must still look to the Lord .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 13]: With him there is no fading into the light of common day .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 58]: He has never lost his childhood , the very essence of childhood being nearness to the Father and the outgoing of his creative love ; whence , with that insight of his eternal childhood of which the insight of the little ones here is a fainter repetition , he must see everything as the Father means it .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 23]: The child sees things as the Father means him to see them , as he thought of them when he uttered them .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 30]: For God is not only the father of the child , but of the childhood that constitutes him a child , therefore the childness is of the divine nature .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 54]: The child may not indeed be capable of looking into the father 's method , but he can in a measure understand his work , has therefore free entrance to his study and workshop both , and is welcome to find out what he can , with fullest liberty to ask him questions .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 29]: There are men too , who , at their best , see , in their lower measure , things as they are -- as God sees them always .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 25]: Jesus saw things just as his father saw them in his creative imagination , when willing them out to the eyes of his children .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 35]: But if he could always see the things of his father even as some men and more children see them at times , he might well feel _ almost _ at home among them .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 12]: He could not cease to admire , cease to love them .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 26]: I say _ love _ , because the life in them , the presence of the creative one , would ever be plain to him .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 17]: In the Perfect , would familiarity ever destroy wonder at things essentially wonderful because essentially divine ?
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 23]: To cease to wonder is to fall plumb-down from the childlike to the commonplace -- the most undivine of all moods intellectual .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 16]: Our nature can never be at home among things that are not wonderful to us .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 32]: Could we see things always as we have sometimes seen them -- and as one day we must always see them , only far better -- should we ever know dullness ?
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 41]: Greatly as we might enjoy all forms of art , much as we might learn through the eyes and thoughts of other men , should we fly to these for deliverance from _ ennui _ , from any haunting discomfort ?
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 19]: Should we not just open our own child-eyes , look upon the things themselves , and be consoled ?
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 53]: Jesus , then , would have his parents understand that he was in his father 's world among his father 's things , where was nothing to hurt him ; he knew them all , was in the secret of them all , could use and order them as did his father .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 13]: To this same I think all we humans are destined to rise .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 50]: Though so many of us now are ignorant what kind of home we need , what a home we are capable of having , we too shall inherit the earth with the Son eternal , doing with it as we would -- willing with the will of the Father .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 40]: To such a home as we now inhabit , only perfected , and perfectly beheld , we are travelling -- never to reach it save by the obedience that makes us the children , therefore the heirs of God .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 5]: And , thank God !
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 18]: there the father does not die that the children may inherit ; for , bliss of heaven !
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 6]: we inherit with the Father .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 31]: All the dangers of Jesus came from the priests , and the learned in the traditional law , whom his parents had not yet begun to fear on his behalf .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 17]: They feared the dangers of the rugged way , the thieves and robbers of the hill-road .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 26]: For the scribes and the pharisees , the priests and the rulers -- they would be the first to acknowledge their Messiah , their king !
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 38]: Little they imagined , when they found him where he ought to have been safest had it been indeed his father 's house , that there he sat amid lions -- the great doctors of the temple !
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 34]: He could rule all the _ things _ in his father 's house , but not the men of religion , the men of the temple , who called his father their Father .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 39]: True , he might have compelled them with a word , withered them by a glance , with a finger-touch made them grovel at his feet ; but such supremacy over his brothers the Lord of life despised .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 62]: He must rule them as his father ruled himself ; he would have them know themselves of the same family with himself ; have them at home among the things of God , caring for the things he cared for , loving and hating as he and his father loved and hated , ruling themselves by the essential laws of being .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 35]: Because they would not be such , he let them do to him as they would , that he might get at their hearts by some unknown unguarded door in their diviner part . '
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 14]: I will be God among you ; I will be myself to you .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 7]: -- You will not have me ?
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 8]: Then do to me as you will .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 25]: The created shall have power over him through whom they were created , that they may be compelled to know him and his father .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 11]: They shall look on him whom they have pierced . '
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 25]: His parents found him in the temple ; they never really found him until he entered the true temple -- their own adoring hearts .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 18]: The temple that knows not its builder , is no temple ; in it dwells no divinity .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 56]: But at length he comes to his own , and his own receive him ; -- comes to them in the might of his mission to preach good tidings to the poor , to heal the broken-hearted , to preach deliverance , and sight , and liberty , and the Lord 's own good time .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 7]: _ JESUS AND HIS FELLOW TOWNSMEN .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 38]: _ And he came to Nazareth , where he had been brought up : and , as his custom was , he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and stood up for to read .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 13]: And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 83]: And when he had opened the book , he found the place where it was written , ` The spirit of the Lord is upon me , because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor ; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted , to preach deliverance to the captives , and recovering of sight to the blind , to set at liberty them that are bruised , to preach the acceptable year of the Lord . '
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 19]: And he closed the book , and he gave it again to the minister , and sat down .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 16]: And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 20]: And he began to say unto them , ` This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears . '
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 6]: -- _ Luke _ iv .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 2]: 14-21 .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 43]: The Lord 's sermon upon the mount seems such an enlargement of these words of the prophet as might , but for the refusal of the men of Nazareth to listen to him , have followed his reading of them here recorded .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 45]: That , as given by the evangelist , they correspond to neither of the differing originals of the English and Greek versions , ought to be enough in itself to do away with the spiritually vulgar notion of the verbal inspiration of the Scriptures .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 134]: The point at which the Lord stops in his reading , is suggestive : he closes the book , leaving the words ` and the day of vengeance of our God , ' or , as in the Septuagint , ` the day of recompense , ' unread : God 's vengeance is as holy a thing as his love , yea , is love , for God is love and God is not vengeance ; but , apparently , the Lord would not give the word a place in his announcement of his mission : his hearers would not recognize it as a form of the Father 's love , but as vengeance on their enemies , not vengeance on the selfishness of those who would not be their brother 's keeper .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 12]: He had not begun with Nazareth , neither with Galilee . '
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 28]: A prophet has no honour in his own country , ' he said , and began to teach where it was more likely he would be heard .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 36]: It is true that he wrought his first miracle in Cana , but that was at his mother 's request , not of his own intent , and he did not begin his teaching there .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 56]: He went first to Jerusalem , there cast out the buyers and sellers from the temple , and did other notable things alluded to by St John ; then went back to Galilee , where , having seen the things he did in Jerusalem , his former neighbours were now prepared to listen to him .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 29]: Of these the Nazarenes , to whom the sight of him was more familiar , retained the most prejudice against him : he belonged to their very city !
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 8]: they had known him from a child !
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 17]: -- and low indeed are they in whom familiarity with the high and true breeds contempt !
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 5]: they are judged already .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 42]: Yet such was the fame of the new prophet , that even they were willing to hear in the synagogue what he had to say to them -- thence to determine for themselves what claim he had to an honourable reception .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 18]: But the eye of their judgment was not single , therefore was their body full of darkness .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 55]: Should Nazareth indeed prove , to their self-glorifying satisfaction , the city of the great Prophet , they were more than ready to grasp at the renown of having produced him : he was indeed the great Prophet , and within a few minutes they would have slain him for the honour of Israel .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 15]: In the ignoble even the love of their country partakes largely of the ignoble .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 84]: There was a shadow of the hateless vengeance of God in the expulsion of the dishonest dealers from the temple with which the Lord initiated his mission : that was his first parable to Jerusalem ; to Nazareth he comes with the sweetest words of the prophet of hope in his mouth -- good tidings of great joy -- of healing and sight and liberty ; followed by the godlike announcement , that what the prophet had promised he was come to fulfil .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 33]: His heart , his eyes , his lips , his hands -- his whole body is full of gifts for men , and that day was that scripture fulfilled in their ears .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 51]: The prophecy had gone before that he should save his people from their sins ; he brings an announcement they will better understand : he is come , he says , to deliver men from sorrow and pain , ignorance and oppression , everything that makes life hard and unfriendly .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 18]: What a gracious speech , what a daring pledge to a world whelmed in tyranny and wrong !
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 21]: To the women of it , I imagine , it sounded the sweetest , in them woke the highest hopes .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 36]: They had scarce had a hearing when the Lord came ; and thereupon things began to mend with them , and are mending still , for the Lord is at work , and will be .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 8]: He is the refuge of the oppressed .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 21]: By its very woes , as by bitterest medicine , he is setting the world free from sin and woe .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 45]: This very hour he is curing its disease , the symptoms of which are so varied and so painful ; working none the less faithfully that the sick , taking the symptoms for the disease , cry out against the incompetence of their physician .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 9]: ` What power can heal the broken-hearted ? '
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 3]: they cry .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 16]: And indeed it takes a God to do it , but the God is here !
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 42]: In yet better words than those of the prophet , spoken straight from his own heart , he cries : ` Come unto me , all ye that labour and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest . '
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 23]: He calls to him every heart knowing its own bitterness , speaks to the troubled consciousness of every child of the Father .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 16]: He is come to free us from everything that makes life less than bliss essential .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 13]: No other could be a gospel worthy of the God of men .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 14]: Every one will , I presume , confess to more or less misery .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 33]: Its apparent source may be this or that ; its real source is , to use a poor figure , a dislocation of the juncture between the created and the creating life .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 52]: This primal evil is the parent of evils unnumbered , hence of miseries multitudinous , under the weight of which the arrogant man cries out against life , and goes on to misuse it , while the child looks around for help -- and who shall help him but his father !
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 23]: The Father is with him all the time , but it may be long ere the child knows himself in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 13]: His heart may be long troubled as well as his outer life .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 22]: The dank mists of doubtful thought may close around his way , and hide from him the Light of the world !
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 50]: cold winds from the desert of foiled endeavour may sorely buffet and for a time baffle his hope ; but every now and then the blue pledge of a great sky will break through the clouds over his head ; and a faint aurora will walk his darkest East .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 20]: Gradually he grows more capable of imagining a world in which every good thing thinkable may be a fact .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 56]: Best of all , the story of him who is himself the good news , the gospel of God , becomes not only more and more believable to his heart , but more and more ministrant to his life of conflict , and his assurance of a living father who hears when his children cry .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 36]: The gospel according to this or that expounder of it , may repel him unspeakably ; the gospel according to Jesus Christ , attracts him supremely , and ever holds where it has drawn him .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 32]: To the priest , the scribe , the elder , exclaiming against his self-sufficiency in refusing what they teach , he answers , ` It is life or death to me .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 7]: Your gospel I can not take .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 16]: To believe as you would have me believe , would be to lose my God .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 8]: Your God is no God to me .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 6]: I do not desire him .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 13]: I would rather die the death than believe in such a God .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 37]: In the name of the true God , I cast your gospel from me ; it is no gospel , and to believe it would be to wrong him in whom alone lies my hope . '
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 38]: ` But to believe in such a man , ' he might go on to say , ` with such a message , as I read of in the New Testament , is life from the dead .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 22]: I have yielded myself , to live no more in the idea of self , but with the life of God .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 37]: To him I commit the creature he has made , that he may live in it , and work out its life -- develop it according to the idea of it in his own creating mind .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 9]: I fall in with his ways for me .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 5]: I believe in him .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 4]: I trust him .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 6]: I try to obey him .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 32]: I look to be rendered capable of and receive a pure vision of his will , freedom from the prison-house of my limitation , from the bondage of a finite existence .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 20]: For the finite that dwells in the infinite and in which the infinite dwells , is finite no longer .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 19]: Those who are thus children indeed , are little Gods , the divine brood of the infinite Father .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 18]: No mere promise of deliverance from the consequences of sin , would be any gospel to me .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 25]: Less than the liberty of a holy heart , less than the freedom of the Lord himself , will never satisfy one human soul .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 21]: Father , set me free in the glory of thy will , so that I will only as thou willest .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 10]: Thy will be at once thy perfection and mine .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 31]: Thou alone art deliverance -- absolute safety from every cause and kind of trouble that ever existed , anywhere now exists , or ever can exist in thy universe . '
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 34]: But the people of the Lord 's town , to whom he read , appropriating them , the gracious words of the prophet , were of the wise and prudent of their day .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 30]: With one and the same breath , they seem to cry , ` These things are good , it is true , but they must come after our way .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 29]: We must have the promise to our fathers fulfilled -- that we shall rule the world , the chosen of God , the children of Abraham and Israel .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 23]: We want to be a free people , manage our own affairs , live in plenty , and do as we please .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 12]: Liberty alone can ever cure the woes of which you speak .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 13]: We do not need to be better ; we are well enough .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 31]: Give us riches and honour , and keep us content with ourselves , that we may be satisfied with our own likeness , and thou shalt be the Messiah . '
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 28]: Never , perhaps , would such be men 's spoken words , but the prevailing condition of their minds might often well take form in such speech .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 15]: Whereon will they ground their complaint should God give them their hearts ' desire ?
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 68]: When that desire given closes in upon them with a torturing sense of slavery ; when they find that what they have imagined their own will , was but a suggestion they knew not whence ; when they discover that life is not good , yet they can not die ; will they not then turn and entreat their maker to save them after his own fashion ?
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 31]: Let us try to understand the brief , elliptical narrative of what took place in the synagogue of Nazareth on the occasion of our Lord 's announcement of his mission .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 26]: ` This day , ' said Jesus , ` is this scripture fulfilled in your ears ; ' and went on with his divine talk .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 47]: We shall yet know , I trust , what ` the gracious words ' were ` which proceeded out of his mouth ' : surely some who heard them , still remember them , for ` all bare him witness , and wondered at ' them !
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 7]: How did they bear him witness ?
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 11]: Surely not alone by the intensity of their wondering gaze !
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 43]: Must not the narrator mean that their hearts bore witness to the power of his presence , that they felt the appeal of his soul to theirs , that they said in themselves , ` Never man spake like this man ' ?
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 27]: Must not the light of truth in his face , beheld of such even as knew not the truth , have lifted their souls up truthward ?
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 24]: Was it not the something true , common to all hearts , that bore the wondering witness to the graciousness of his words ?
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 21]: Had not those words found a way to the pure human , that is , the divine in the men ?
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 18]: Was it not therefore that they were drawn to him -- all but ready to accept him ?
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 11]: -- on their own terms , alas , not his !
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 37]: For a moment he seemed to them a true messenger , but truth in him was not truth to them : had he been what they took him for , he would have been no saviour .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 52]: They were , however , though partly by mistake , well disposed toward him , and it was with a growing sense of being honoured by his relation to them , and the property they had in him , that they said , ` Is not this Joseph 's son ? '
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 46]: But the Lord knew what was in their hearts ; he knew the false notion with which they were almost ready to declare for him ; he knew also the final proof to which they were in their wisdom and prudence about to subject him .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 33]: He did not look likely to be a prophet , seeing he had grown up among them , and had never shown any credentials : they had a right to proof positive !
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 28]: They had heard of wonderful things he had done in other places : why had they not first of all been done in _ their _ sight ?
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 8]: Who had a claim equal to theirs ?
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 24]: who so capable as they to pronounce judgment on his mission whether false or true : had they not known him from childhood ?
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 20]: His words were gracious , but words were nothing : he must _ do _ something -- something wonderful !
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 15]: Without such conclusive , satisfying proof , Nazareth at least would never acknowledge him !
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 54]: They were quite ready for the honour of having any true prophet , such as it seemed not impossible the son of Joseph might turn out to be , recognized as their towns-man , one of their own people : if he were such , theirs was the credit of having produced him !
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 28]: Then indeed they were ready to bear witness to him , take his part , adopt his cause , and before the world stand up for him !
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 23]: As to his being the Messiah , that was merest absurdity : did they not all know his father , the carpenter ?
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 23]: He might , however , be the prophet whom so many of the best in the nation were at the moment expecting !
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 6]: Let him do something wonderful !
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 11]: They were not a gracious people , or a good .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 16]: The Lord saw their thought , and it was far from being to his mind .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 16]: He desired no such reception as they were at present equal to giving a prophet .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 24]: His mighty works were not meant for such as they -- to convince them of what they were incapable of understanding or welcoming !
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 27]: Those who would not believe without signs and wonders , could never believe worthily with any number of them , and none should be given them !
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 41]: His mighty works were to rouse the love , and strengthen the faith of the meek and lowly in heart , of such as were ready to come to the light , and show that they were of the light .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 32]: He knew how poor the meaning the Nazarenes put on the words he had read ; what low expectations they had of the Messiah when most they longed for his coming .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 12]: They did not hear the prophet while he read the prophet !
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 71]: At sight of a few poor little wonders , nothing to him , to them sufficient to prove him such a Messiah as _ they _ looked for , they would burst into loud acclaim , and rush to their arms , eager , his officers and soldiers , to open the one triumphant campaign against the accursed Romans , and sweep them beyond the borders of their sacred country .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 27]: Their Messiah would make of their nation the redeemed of the Lord , themselves the favourites of his court , and the tyrants of the world !
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 22]: Salvation from their sins was not in their hearts , not in their imaginations , not at all in their thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 22]: They had heard him read his commission to heal the broken-hearted ; they would rush to break hearts in his name .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 10]: The Lord knew them , and their vain expectations .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 23]: He would have no such followers -- no followers on false conceptions -- no followers whom wonders would delight but nowise better !
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 18]: The Nazarenes were not yet of the sort that needed but one change to be his people .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 21]: He had come to give them help ; until they accepted his , they could have none to give him .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 28]: The Lord never did mighty work in proof of his mission ; to help a growing faith in himself and his father , he would do anything !
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 29]: He healed those whom healing would deeper heal -- those in whom suffering had so far done its work , that its removal also would carry it on .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 33]: To the Nazarenes he would not manifest his power ; they were not in a condition to get good from such manifestation : it would but confirm their present arrogance and ambition .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 25]: Wonderful works can only nourish a faith already existent ; to him who believes without it , a miracle _ may _ be granted .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 30]: It was the Israelite indeed , whom the Lord met with miracle : ` Because I said unto thee , I saw thee under the fig-tree , believest thou ?
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 17]: Thou shalt see the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man . '
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 20]: Those who laughed him to scorn were not allowed to look on the resurrection of the daughter of Jairus .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 21]: Peter , when he would walk on the water , had both permission and power given him to do so .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 21]: The widow received the prophet , and was fed ; the Syrian went to the prophet , and was cured .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 44]: In Nazareth , because of unbelief , the Lord could only lay his hands on a few sick folk ; in the rest was none of that leaning toward the truth , which alone can make room for the help of a miracle .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 6]: This they soon made manifest .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 23]: The Lord saw them on the point of challenging a display of his power , and anticipated the challenge with a refusal .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 64]: For the better understanding of his words , let me presume to paraphrase them : ' I know you will apply to me the proverb , Physician , heal thyself , requiring me to prove what is said of me in Capernaum , by doing the same here ; but there is another proverb , No prophet is accepted in his own country .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 6]: Unaccepted I do nothing wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 38]: In the great famine , Elijah was sent to no widow of the many in Israel , but to a Sidonian ; and Elisha cured no leper of the many in Israel , but Naaman the Syrian .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 21]: There are those fit to see signs and wonders ; they are not always the kin of the prophet . '
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 6]: The Nazarenes heard with indignation .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 12]: Their wonder at his gracious words was changed to bitterest wrath .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 90]: The very beams of their ugly religion were party-spirit , exclusiveness , and pride in the fancied favour of God for them only of all the nations : to hint at the possibility of a revelation of the glory of God to a stranger ; far more , to hint that a stranger might be fitter to receive such a revelation than a Jew , was an offence reaching to the worst insult ; and it was cast in their teeth by a common man of their own city !
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 18]: ` Thou art but a well-known carpenter 's son , and dost thou teach _ us _ !
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 12]: Darest thou imply a divine preference for Capernaum over Nazareth ? '
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 17]: In bad odour with the rest of their countrymen , they were the prouder of themselves .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 13]: The _ whole _ synagogue , observe , rose in a fury .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 6]: Such a fellow a prophet !
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 9]: He was worse than the worst of Gentiles !
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 6]: he was a false Jew !
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 6]: a traitor to his God !
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 7]: a friend of the idol-worshipping Romans !
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 4]: Away with him !
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 12]: His townsmen led the van in his rejection by his own .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 14]: The men of Nazareth would have forestalled his crucifixion by them of Jerusalem .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 12]: a Sidonian woman fitter to receive the prophet than any Jewess !
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 22]: a heathen worthier to be kept alive by miracle in time of famine , than a worshipper of the true God !
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 16]: a leper of Damascus less displeasing to God than the lepers of his chosen race !
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 12]: It was no longer condescending approval that shone in their eyes .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 4]: He a prophet !
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 6]: They had seen through him !
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 7]: Soon had they found him out !
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 31]: The moment he perceived it useless to pose for a prophet with them , who had all along known the breed of him , he had turned to insult them !
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 34]: He dared not attempt in his own city the deceptions with which , by the help of Satan , he had made such a grand show , and fooled the idiots of Capernaum !
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 31]: He saw they knew him too well , were too wide-awake to be cozened by him , and to avoid their expected challenge , fell to reviling the holy nation .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 6]: Let him take the consequences !
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 9]: To the brow of the hill with him !
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 9]: How could there be any miracle for such !
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 15]: They were well satisfied with themselves , and Nothing almost sees miracles But misery .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 33]: Need and the upward look , the mood ready to believe when and where it can , the embryonic faith , is dear to Him whose love would have us trust him .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 54]: Let any man seek him -- not in curious inquiry whether the story of him may be true or can not be true -- in humble readiness to accept him altogether if only he can , and he shall find him ; we shall not fail of help to believe because we doubt .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 31]: But if the questioner be such that the dispersion of his doubt would but leave him in disobedience , the Power of truth has no care to effect his conviction .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 18]: Why cast out a devil that the man may the better do the work of the devil ?
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 41]: The childlike doubt will , as it softens and yields , minister nourishment with all that was good in it to the faith-germ at its heart ; the wise and prudent unbelief will be left to develop its own misery .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 32]: The Lord could easily have satisfied the Nazarenes that he was the Messiah : they would but have hardened into the nucleus of an army for the subjugation of the world .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 36]: To a warfare with their own sins , to the subjugation of their doing and desiring to the will of the great Father , all the miracles in his power would never have persuaded them .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 13]: A true convincement is not possible to hearts and minds like theirs .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 36]: Not only is it impossible for a low man to believe a thousandth part of what a noble man can , but a low man can not believe anything as a noble man believes it .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 35]: The men of Nazareth could have believed in Jesus as their saviour from the Romans ; as their saviour from their sins they could not believe in him , for they loved their sins .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 32]: The king of heaven came to offer them a share in his kingdom ; but they were not poor in spirit , and the kingdom of heaven was not for them .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 27]: Gladly would they have inherited the earth ; but they were not meek , and the earth was for the lowly children of the perfect Father .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 8]: _ THE HEIRS OF HEAVEN AND EARTH .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 29]: _ And he opened his mouth and taught them , saying , ` Blessed are the poor in spirit ; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven . '
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 15]: ... ` Blessed are the meek ; for they shall inherit the earth . '
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 11]: -- _ Matthew _ v. 2 , 3 , 5 .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 13]: The words of the Lord are the seed sown by the sower .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 11]: Into our hearts they must fall that they may grow .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 15]: Meditation and prayer must water them , and obedience keep them in the sunlight .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 11]: Thus will they bear fruit for the Lord 's gathering .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 45]: Those of his disciples , that is , obedient hearers , who had any experience in trying to live , would , in part , at once understand them ; but as they obeyed and pondered , the meaning of them would keep growing .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 10]: This we see in the writings of the apostles .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 84]: It will be so with us also , who need to understand everything he said neither more nor less than they to whom first he spoke ; while our obligation to understand is far greater than theirs at the time , inasmuch as we have had nearly two thousand years ' experience of the continued coming of the kingdom he then preached : it is not yet come ; it has been all the time , and is now , drawing slowly nearer .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 36]: The sermon on the mount , as it is commonly called , seems the Lord 's first free utterance , in the presence of any large assembly , of the good news of the kingdom .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 75]: He had been teaching his disciples and messengers ; and had already brought the glad tidings that his father was their father , to many besides -- to Nathanael for one , to Nicodemus , to the woman of Samaria , to every one he had cured , every one whose cry for help he had heard : his epiphany was a gradual thing , beginning , where it continues , with the individual .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 69]: It is impossible even to guess at what number may have heard him on this occasion : he seems to have gone up the mount because of the crowd -- to secure a somewhat opener position whence he could better speak ; and thither followed him those who desired to be taught of him , accompanied doubtless by not a few in whom curiosity was the chief motive .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 17]: Disciple or gazer , he addressed the individuality of every one that had ears to hear .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 84]: Peter and Andrew , James and John , are all we know as his recognized disciples , followers , and companions , at the time ; but , while his words were addressed to such as had come to him desiring to learn of him , the things he uttered were eternal truths , life in which was essential for every one of his father 's children , therefore they were for all : he who heard to obey , was his disciple .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 29]: How different , at the first sound of it , must the good news have been from the news anxiously expected by those who waited for the Messiah !
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 14]: Even the Baptist in prison lay listening after something of quite another sort .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 50]: The Lord had to send him a message , by eye-witnesses of his doings , to remind him that God 's thoughts are not as our thoughts , or his ways as our ways -- that the design of God is other and better than the expectation of men .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 23]: His summary of the gifts he was giving to men , culminated with the preaching of the good news to the poor .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 82]: If John had known these his doings before , he had not recognized them as belonging to the Lord 's special mission : the Lord tells him it is not enough to have accepted him as the Messiah ; he must recognize his doings as the work he had come into the world to do , and as in their nature so divine as to be the very business of the Son of God in whom the Father was well pleased .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 17]: Wherein then consisted the goodness of the news which he opened his mouth to give them ?
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 11]: What was in the news to make the poor glad ?
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 19]: Why was his arrival with such words in his heart and mouth , the coming of the kingdom ?
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 29]: All good news from heaven , is of _ truth _ -- essential truth , involving duty , and giving and promising help to the performance of it .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 27]: There can be no good news for us men , except of uplifting love , and no one can be lifted up who will not rise .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 22]: If God himself sought to raise his little ones without their consenting effort , they would drop from his foiled endeavour .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 39]: He will carry us in his arms till we are able to walk ; he will carry us in his arms when we are weary with walking ; he will not carry us if we will not walk .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 68]: Very different are the good news Jesus brings us from certain prevalent representations of the gospel , founded on the pagan notion that suffering is an offset for sin , and culminating in the vile assertion that the suffering of an innocent man , just because he is innocent , yea perfect , is a satisfaction to the holy Father for the evil deeds of his children .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 44]: As a theory concerning the atonement nothing could be worse , either intellectually , morally , or spiritually ; announced as the gospel itself , as the good news of the kingdom of heaven , the idea is monstrous as any Chinese dragon .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 21]: Such a so-called gospel is no gospel , however accepted as God sent by good men of a certain development .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 20]: It is evil news , dwarfing , enslaving , maddening -- news to the child-heart of the dreariest damnation .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 29]: Doubtless some elements of the gospel are mixed up with it on most occasions of its announcement ; none the more is it the message received from him .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 38]: It can be good news only to such as are prudently willing to be delivered from a God they fear , but unable to accept the gospel of a perfect God , in whom to trust perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 24]: The good news of Jesus was just the news of the thoughts and ways of the Father in the midst of his family .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 82]: He told them that the way men thought for themselves and their children was not the way God thought for himself and his children ; that the kingdom of heaven was founded , and must at length show itself founded on very different principles from those of the kingdoms and families of the world , meaning by the world that part of the Father 's family which will not be ordered by him , will not even try to obey him .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 57]: The world 's man , its great , its successful , its honorable man , is he who may have and do what he pleases , whose strength lies in money and the praise of men ; the greatest in the kingdom of heaven is the man who is humblest and serves his fellows the most .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 37]: Multitudes of men , in no degree notable as ambitious or proud , hold the ambitious , the proud man in honour , and , for all deliverance , hope after some shadow of his prosperity .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 39]: How many even of those who look for the world to come , seek to the powers of this world for deliverance from its evils , as if God were the God of the world to come only !
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 53]: The oppressed of the Lord 's time looked for a Messiah to set their nation free , and make it rich and strong ; the oppressed of our time believe in money , knowledge , and the will of a people which needs but power to be in its turn the oppressor .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 93]: The first words of the Lord on this occasion were : -- ` Blessed are the poor in spirit , for theirs is the kingdom of heaven , ' It is not the proud , it is not the greedy of distinction , it is not those who gather and hoard , not those who lay down the law to their neighbours , not those that condescend , any more than those that shrug the shoulder and shoot out the lip , that have any share in the kingdom of the Father .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 30]: That kingdom has no relation with or resemblance to the kingdoms of this world , deals with no one thing that distinguishes their rulers , except to repudiate it .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 23]: The Son of God will favour no smallest ambition , be it in the heart of him who leans on his bosom .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 64]: The kingdom of God , the refuge of the oppressed , the golden age of the new world , the real Utopia , the newest yet oldest Atlantis , the home of the children , will not open its gates to the most miserable who would rise above his equal in misery , who looks down on any one more miserable than himself .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 8]: It is the home of perfect brotherhood .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 77]: The poor , the beggars in spirit , the humble men of heart , the unambitious , the unselfish ; those who never despise men , and never seek their praises ; the lowly , who see nothing to admire in themselves , therefore can not seek to be admired of others ; the men who give themselves away -- these are the freemen of the kingdom , these are the citizens of the new Jerusalem .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 109]: The men who are aware of their own essential poverty ; not the men who are poor in friends , poor in influence , poor in acquirements , poor in money , but those who are poor in spirit , who _ feel themselves poor creatures _ ; who know nothing to be pleased with themselves for , and desire nothing to make them think well of themselves ; who know that they need much to make their life worth living , to make their existence a good thing , to make them fit to live ; these humble ones are the poor whom the Lord calls blessed .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 41]: When a man says , I am low and worthless , then the gate of the kingdom begins to open to him , for there enter the true , and this man has begun to know the truth concerning himself .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 40]: Whatever such a man has attained to , he straightway forgets ; it is part of him and behind him ; his business is with what he has not , with the things that lie above and before him .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 18]: The man who is proud of anything he thinks he has reached , has not reached it .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 15]: He is but proud of himself , and imagining a cause for his pride .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 13]: If he had reached , he would already have begun to forget .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 25]: He who delights in contemplating whereto he has attained , is not merely sliding back ; he is already in the dirt of self-satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 12]: The gate of the kingdom is closed , and he outside .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 42]: The child who , clinging to his Father , dares not think he has in any sense attained while as yet he is not as his Father -- his Father 's heart , his Father 's heaven is his natural home .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 34]: To find himself thinking of himself as above his fellows , would be to that child a shuddering terror ; his universe would contract around him , his ideal wither on its throne .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 29]: The least motion of self-satisfaction , the first thought of placing himself in the forefront of estimation , would be to him a flash from the nether abyss .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 8]: God is his life and his lord .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 14]: That his father should be content with him must be all his care .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 18]: Among his relations with his neighbour , infinitely precious , comparison with his neighbour has no place .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 9]: Which is the greater is of no account .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 22]: He would not choose to be less than his neighbour ; he would choose his neighbour to be greater than he .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 7]: He looks up to every man .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 12]: Otherwise gifted than he , his neighbour is more than he .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 25]: All come from the one mighty father : shall he judge the live thoughts of God , which is greater and which is less ?
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 28]: In thus denying , thus turning his back on himself , he has no thought of saintliness , no thought but of his father and his brethren .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 11]: To such a child heaven 's best secrets are open .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 67]: He clambers about the throne of the Father unrebuked ; his back is ready for the smallest heavenly playmate ; his arms are an open refuge for any blackest little lost kid of the Father 's flock ; he will toil with it up the heavenly stair , up the very steps of the great white throne , to lay it on the Father 's knees .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 28]: For the glory of that Father is not in knowing himself God , but in giving himself away -- in creating and redeeming and glorifying his children .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 23]: The man who does not house self , has room to be his real self -- God 's eternal idea of him .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 24]: He lives eternally ; in virtue of the creative power present in him with momently , unimpeded creation , he _ is _ .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 15]: How should there be in him one thought of ruling or commanding or surpassing !
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 16]: He can imagine no bliss , no good in being greater than some one else .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 31]: He is unable to wish himself other than he is , except more what God made him for , which is indeed the highest willing of the will of God .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 10]: His brother 's wellbeing is essential to his bliss .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 19]: The thought of standing higher in the favour of God than his brother , would make him miserable .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 12]: He would lift every brother to the embrace of the Father .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 27]: Blessed are the poor in spirit , for they are of the same spirit as God , and of nature the kingdom of heaven is theirs .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 33]: ` Blessed are the meek , for they shall inherit the earth , ' expresses the same principle : the same law holds in the earth as in the kingdom of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 6]: How should it be otherwise ?
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 38]: Has the creator of the ends of the earth ceased to rule it after his fashion , because his rebellious children have so long , to their own hurt , vainly endeavoured to rule it after theirs ?
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 16]: The kingdom of heaven belongs to the poor ; the meek shall inherit the earth .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 70]: The earth as God sees it , as those to whom the kingdom of heaven belongs also see it , is good , all good , very good , fit for the meek to inherit ; and one day they shall inherit it -- not indeed as men of the world count inheritance , but as the maker and owner of the world has from the first counted it .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 40]: So different are the two ways of inheriting , that one of the meek may be heartily enjoying his possession , while one of the proud is selfishly walling him out from the spot in it he loves best .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 30]: The meek are those that do not assert themselves , do not defend themselves , never dream of avenging themselves , or of returning aught but good for evil .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 13]: They do not imagine it their business to take care of themselves .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 17]: The meek man may indeed take much thought , but it will not be for himself .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 13]: He never builds an exclusive wall , shuts any honest neighbour out .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 16]: He will not always serve the wish , but always the good of his neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 7]: His service must be true service .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 10]: Self shall be no umpire in affair of his .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 25]: Man 's consciousness of himself is but a shadow : the meek man 's self always vanishes in the light of a real presence .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 21]: His nature lies open to the Father of men , and to every good impulse is as it were empty .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 35]: No bristling importance , no vain attendance of fancied rights and wrongs , guards his door , or crowds the passages of his house ; they are for the angels to come and go .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 75]: Abandoned thus to the truth , as the sparks from the gleaming river dip into the flowers of Dante 's unperfected vision , so the many souls of the visible world , lights from the father of lights , enter his heart freely ; and by them he inherits the earth he was created to inherit -- possesses it as his father made him capable of possessing , and the earth of being possessed .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 39]: Because the man is meek , his eye is single ; he sees things as God sees them , as he would have his child see them : to confront creation with pure eyes is to possess it .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 16]: How little is the man able to make his own , who would ravish all !
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 33]: The man who , by the exclusion of others from the space he calls his , would grasp any portion of the earth as his own , befools himself in the attempt .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 16]: The very bread he has swallowed can not so in any real sense be his .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 14]: There does not exist such a power of possessing as he would arrogate .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 24]: There is not such a sense of having as that of which he has conceived the shadow in his degenerate and lapsing imagination .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 50]: The real owner of his demesne is that pedlar passing his gate , into a divine soul receiving the sweetnesses which not all the greed of the so-counted possessor can keep within his walls : they overflow the cup-lip of the coping , to give themselves to the footfarer .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 30]: The motions aerial , the sounds , the odours of those imprisoned spaces , are the earnest of a possession for which is ever growing his power of possessing .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 18]: In no wise will such inheritance interfere with the claim of the man who calls them his .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 20]: Each possessor has them his , as much as each in his own way is capable of possessing them .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 34]: For possession is determined by the kind and the scope of the power of possessing ; and the earth has a fourth dimension of which the mere owner of its soil knows nothing .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 10]: The child of the maker is naturally the inheritor .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 26]: But if the child try to possess as a house the thing his father made an organ , will he succeed in so possessing it ?
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 52]: Or if he do nestle in a corner of its case , will he oust thereby the Lord of its multiplex harmony , sitting regnant on the seat of sway , and drawing with ` volant touch ' from the house of the child the liege homage of its rendered wealth ?
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 28]: To the poverty of such a child are all those left , who think to have and to hold after the corrupt fancies of a greedy self .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 20]: We can not see the world as God means it , save in proportion as our souls are meek .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 8]: In meekness only are we its inheritors .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 27]: Meekness alone makes the spiritual retina pure to receive God 's things as they are , mingling with them neither imperfection nor impurity of its own .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 36]: A thing so beheld that it conveys to me the divine thought issuing in its form , is mine ; by nothing but its mediation between God and my life , can anything be mine .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 74]: The man so dull as to insist that a thing is his because he has bought it and paid for it , had better bethink himself that not all the combined forces of law , justice , and goodwill , can keep it his ; while even death can not take the world from the man who possesses it as alone the maker of him and it cares that he should possess it .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 20]: This man leaves it , but carries it with him ; that man carries with him only its loss .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 15]: He passes , unable to close hand or mouth upon any portion of it .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 32]: Its _ ownness _ to him was but the changes he could make in it , and the nearness into which he could bring it to the body he lived in .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 23]: That body the earth in its turn possesses now , and it lies very still , changing nothing , but being changed .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 21]: Is this the fine of the great buyer of land , to have his fine pate full of fine dirt ?
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 36]: In the soul of the meek , the earth remains an endless possession -- his because he who made it is his -- his as nothing but his maker could ever be the creature 's .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 24]: He has the earth by his divine relation to him who sent it forth from him as a tree sends out its leaves .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 31]: To inherit the earth is to grow ever more alive to the presence , in it and in all its parts , of him who is the life of men .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 79]: How far one may advance in such inheritance while yet in the body , will simply depend on the meekness he attains while yet in the body ; but it may be , as Frederick Denison Maurice , the servant of God , thought while yet he was with us , that the new heavens and the new earth are the same in which we now live , righteously inhabited by the meek , with their deeper-opened eyes .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 14]: What if the meek of the dead be thus possessing it even now !
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 8]: But I do not care to speculate .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 62]: It is enough that the man who refuses to assert himself , seeking no recognition by men , leaving the care of his life to the Father , and occupying himself with the will of the Father , shall find himself , by and by , at home in the Father 's house , with all the Father 's property his .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 42]: Which is more the possessor of the world -- he who has a thousand houses , or he who , without one house to call his own , has ten in which his knock at the door would rouse instant jubilation ?
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 30]: Which is the richer -- the man who , his large money spent , would have no refuge ; or he for whose necessity a hundred would sacrifice comfort ?
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 14]: Which of the two possessed the earth -- king Agrippa or tent-maker Paul ?
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 139]: Which is the real possessor of a book -- the man who has its original and every following edition , and shows , to many an admiring and envying visitor , now this , now that , in binding characteristic , with possessor-pride ; yea , from secret shrine is able to draw forth and display the author 's manuscript , with the very shapes in which his thoughts came forth to the light of day , -- or the man who cherishes one little , hollow-backed , coverless , untitled , bethumbed copy , which he takes with him in his solitary walks and broods over in his silent chamber , always finding in it some beauty or excellence or aid he had not found before -- which is to him in truth as a live companion ?
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 8]: For what makes the thing a book ?
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 20]: Is it not that it has a soul -- the mind in it of him who wrote the book ?
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 18]: Therefore only can the book be possessed , for life alone can be the possession of life .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 10]: The dead possess their dead only to bury them .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 24]: Does not he then , who loves and understands his book , possess it with such possession as is impossible to the other ?
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 44]: Just so may the world itself be possessed -- either as a volume unread , or as the wine of a soul , ` the precious life-blood of a master-spirit , embalmed and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life . '
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 44]: It may be possessed as a book filled with words from the mouth of God , or but as the golden-clasped covers of that book ; as an embodiment or incarnation of God himself ; or but as a house built to sell .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 36]: The Lord loved the world and the things of the world , not as the men of the world love them , but finding his father in everything that came from his father 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 21]: The same spirit , then , is required for possessing the kingdom of heaven , and for inheriting the earth .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 18]: How should it not be so , when the one Power is the informing life of both ?
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 20]: If we are the Lord 's , we possess the kingdom of heaven , and so inherit the earth .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 24]: How many who call themselves by his name , would have it otherwise : they would possess the earth and inherit the kingdom !
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 16]: Such fill churches and chapels on Sundays : anywhere suits for the worship of Mammon .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 15]: Yet verily , earth as well as heaven may be largely possessed even now .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 123]: Two men are walking abroad together ; to the one , the world yields thought after thought of delight ; he sees heaven and earth embrace one another ; he feels an indescribable presence over and in them ; his joy will afterward , in the solitude of his chamber , break forth in song ; -- to the other , oppressed with the thought of his poverty , or ruminating how to make much into more , the glory of the Lord is but a warm summer day ; it enters in at no window of his soul ; it offers him no gift ; for , in the very temple of God , he looks for no God in it .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 14]: Nor must there needs be two men to think and feel thus differently .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 23]: In what diverse fashion will any one _ subject _ to ever-changing mood see the same world of the same glad creator !
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 20]: Alas for men , if it changed as we change , if it grew meaningless when we grow faithless !
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 40]: Thought for a morrow that may never come , dread of the dividing death which works for endless companionship , anger with one we love , will cloud the radiant morning , and make the day dark with night .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 65]: At evening , having bethought ourselves , and returned to him that feeds the ravens , and watches the dying sparrow , and says to his children ` Love one another , ' the sunset splendour is glad over us , the western sky is refulgent as the court of the Father when the glad news is spread abroad that a sinner has repented .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 33]: We have mourned in the twilight of our little faith , but , having sent away our sin , the glory of God 's heaven over his darkening earth has comforted us .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 7]: _ SORROW THE PLEDGE OF JOY .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 15]: _ ` Blessed are they that mourn , for they shall be comforted . '
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 7]: -- _ Matthew _ v. 4 .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 20]: Grief , then , sorrow , pain of heart , mourning , is no partition-wall between man and God .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 28]: So far is it from opposing any obstacle to the passage of God 's light into man 's soul , that the Lord congratulates them that mourn .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 7]: There is no evil in sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 46]: True , it is not an essential good , a good in itself , like love ; but it will mingle with any good thing , and is even so allied to good that it will open the door of the heart for any good .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 24]: More of sorrowful than of joyful men are always standing about the everlasting doors that open into the presence of the Most High .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 66]: It is true also that joy is in its nature more divine than sorrow ; for , although man must sorrow , and God share in his sorrow , yet in himself God is not sorrowful , and the ` glad creator ' never made man for sorrow : it is but a stormy strait through which he must pass to his ocean of peace .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 12]: He ` makes the joy the last in every song . '
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 21]: Still , I repeat , a man in sorrow is in general far nearer God than a man in joy .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 16]: Gladness may make a man forget his thanksgiving ; misery drives him to his prayers .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 15]: For we _ are _ not yet , we are only _ becoming _ .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 52]: The endless day will at length dawn whose every throbbing moment will heave our hearts Godward ; we shall scarce need to lift them up : now , there are two door-keepers to the house of prayer , and Sorrow is more on the alert to open than her grandson Joy .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 15]: The gladsome child runs farther afield ; the wounded child turns to go home .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 20]: The weeper sits down close to the gate ; the lord of life draws nigh to him from within .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 34]: God loves not sorrow , yet rejoices to see a man sorrowful , for in his sorrow man leaves his heavenward door on the latch , and God can enter to help him .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 30]: He loves , I say , to see him sorrowful , for then he can come near to part him from that which makes his sorrow a welcome sight .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 11]: When Ephraim bemoans himself , he is a pleasant child .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 32]: So good a medicine is sorrow , so powerful to slay the moths that infest and devour the human heart , that the Lord is glad to see a man weep .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 7]: He congratulates him on his sadness .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 20]: Grief is an ill-favoured thing , but she is Love 's own child , and her mother loves her .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 30]: The promise to them that mourn , is not _ the kingdom of heaven _ , but that their mourning shall be ended , that they shall be comforted .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 19]: To mourn is not to fight with evil ; it is only to miss that which is good .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 15]: It is not an essential heavenly condition , like poorness of spirit or meekness .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 39]: No man will carry his mourning with him into heaven -- or , if he does , it will speedily be turned either into joy , or into what will result in joy , namely , redemptive action .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 11]: Mourning is a canker-bitten blossom on the rose-tree of love .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 15]: Is there any mourning worthy the name that has not love for its root ?
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 6]: Men mourn because they love .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 19]: Love is the life out of which are fashioned all the natural feelings , every emotion of man .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 32]: Love modelled by faith , is hope ; love shaped by wrong , is anger -- verily anger , though pure of sin ; love invaded by loss , is grief .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 27]: The garment of mourning is oftenest a winding-sheet ; the loss of the loved by death is the main cause of the mourning of the world .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 24]: The Greek word here used to describe the blessed of the Lord , generally means _ those that mourn for the dead _ .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 93]: It is not in the New Testament employed exclusively in this sense , neither do I imagine it stands here for such only : there are griefs than death sorer far , and harder far to comfort -- harder even for God himself , with whom all things are possible ; but it may give pleasure to know that the promise of comfort to those that mourn , may specially apply to those that mourn because their loved have gone out of their sight , and beyond the reach of their cry .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 23]: Their sorrow , indeed , to the love divine , involves no difficulty ; it is a small matter , easily met .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 54]: The father , whose elder son is ever with him , but whose younger is in a far country , wasting his substance with riotous living , is unspeakably more to be pitied , and is harder to help , than that father both of whose sons lie in the sleep of death .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 30]: Much of what goes by the name of comfort , is merely worthless ; and such as could be comforted by it , I should not care to comfort .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 56]: Let time do what it may to bring the ease of oblivion ; let change of scene do what in it lies to lead thought away from the vanished ; let new loves bury grief in the grave of the old love : consolation of such sort could never have crossed the mind of Jesus .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 54]: Would The Truth call a man blessed because his pain would sooner or later depart , leaving him at best no better than before , and certainly poorer -- not only the beloved gone , but the sorrow for him too , and with the sorrow the love that had caused the sorrow ?
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 11]: Blessed of God because restored to an absence of sorrow ?
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 18]: Such a God were fitly adored only where not one heart worshipped in spirit and in truth .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 31]: ` The Lord means of course , ' some one may say , ` that the comfort of the mourners will be the restoration of that which they have lost .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 22]: He means , `` Blessed are ye although ye mourn , for your sorrow will be turned into joy . '' '
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 12]: Happy are they whom nothing less than such restoration will comfort !
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 15]: But would such restoration be comfort enough for the heart of Jesus to give ?
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 20]: Was ever love so deep , so pure , so perfect , as to be good enough for him ?
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 58]: And suppose the love between the parted two had been such , would the mere restoration in the future of that which once he had , be ground enough for so emphatically proclaiming the man blessed now , blessed while yet in the midnight of his loss , and knowing nothing of the hour of his deliverance ?
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 29]: To call a man _ blessed _ in his sorrow because of something to be given him , surely implies a something better than what he had before !
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 43]: True , the joy that is past may have been so great that the man might well feel blessed in the merest hope of its restoration ; but would that be meaning enough for the word in the mouth of the Lord ?
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 26]: That the interruption of his blessedness was but temporary , would hardly be fit ground for calling the man _ blessed _ in that interruption .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 20]: _ Blessed _ is a strong word , and in the mouth of Jesus means all it can mean .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 34]: Can his saying here mean less than -- ` Blessed are they that mourn , for they shall be comforted with a bliss well worth all the pain of the medicinal sorrow ' ?
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 26]: Besides , the benediction surely means that the man is blessed _ because _ of his condition of mourning , not in spite of it .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 31]: His mourning is surely a part at least of the Lord 's ground for congratulating him : is it not the present operative means whereby the consolation is growing possible ?
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 86]: In a word , I do not think the Lord would be content to call a man blessed on the mere ground of his going to be restored to a former bliss by no means perfect ; I think he congratulated the mourners upon the grief they were enduring , because he saw the excellent glory of the comfort that was drawing nigh ; because he knew the immeasurably greater joy to which the sorrow was at once clearing the way and conducting the mourner .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 15]: When I say _ greater _ , God forbid I should mean _ other !
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 23]: _ I mean the same bliss , divinely enlarged and divinely purified -- passed again through the hands of the creative Perfection .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 23]: The Lord knew all the history of love and loss ; beheld throughout the universe the winged Love discrowning the skeleton Fear .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 20]: God 's comfort must ever be larger than man 's grief , else were there gaps in his Godhood .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 18]: Mere restoration would leave a hiatus , barren and growthless , in the development of his children .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 29]: But , alas , what a pinched hope , what miserable expectations , most who call themselves the Lord 's disciples derive from their notions of his teaching !
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 21]: Well may they think of death as the one thing to be right zealously avoided , and for ever lamented !
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 22]: Who would forsake even the window-less hut of his sorrow for the poor mean place they imagine the Father 's house !
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 15]: Why , many of them do not even expect to know their friends there !
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 14]: do not expect to distinguish one from another of all the holy assembly !
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 16]: They will look in many faces , but never to recognize old friends and lovers !
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 9]: A fine saviour of men is their Jesus !
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 22]: Glorious lights they shine in the world of our sorrow , holding forth a word of darkness , of dismallest death !
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 9]: Is the Lord such as they believe him ?
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 9]: ` Good-bye , then , good Master ! '
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 6]: cries the human heart . '
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 15]: I thought thou couldst save me , but , alas , thou canst not .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 37]: If thou savest the part of our being which can sin , thou lettest the part that can love sink into hopeless perdition : thou art not he that should come ; I look for another !
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 8]: Thou wouldst destroy and not save me !
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 14]: Thy father is not my father ; thy God is not my God !
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 8]: Ah , to whom shall we go ?
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 20]: He has not the words of eternal life , this Jesus , and the universe is dark as chaos !
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 18]: O father , this thy son is good , but we need a greater son than he .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 28]: Never will thy children love thee under the shadow of this new law , that they are not to love one another as thou lovest them ! '
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 34]: How does that man love God -- of what kind is the love he bears him -- who is unable to believe that God loves every throb of every human heart toward another ?
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 34]: Did not the Lord die that we should love one another , and be one with him and the Father , and is not the knowledge of difference essential to the deepest love ?
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 7]: Can there be oneness without difference ?
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 4]: harmony without distinction ?
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 8]: Are all to have the same face ?
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 6]: then why faces at all ?
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 34]: If the plains of heaven are to be crowded with the same one face over and over for ever , but one moment will pass ere by monotony bliss shall have grown ghastly .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 16]: Why not perfect spheres of featureless ivory rather than those multitudinous heads with one face !
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 75]: Or are we to start afresh with countenances all new , each beautiful , each lovable , each a revelation of the infinite father , each distinct from every other , and therefore all blending toward a full revealing -- but never more the dear old precious faces , with its whole story in each , which seem , at the very thought of them , to draw our hearts out of our bosoms ?
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 12]: Were they created only to become dear , and be destroyed ?
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 11]: Is it in wine only that the old is better ?
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 13]: Would such a new heaven be a thing to thank God for ?
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 29]: Would this be a prospect on which the Son of Man would congratulate the mourner , or at which the mourner for the dead would count himself blessed ?
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 16]: It is a shame that such a preposterous , monstrous unbelief should call for argument .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 32]: A heaven without human love it were inhuman , and yet more undivine to desire ; it ought not to be desired by any being made in the image of God .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 41]: The lord of life died that his father 's children might grow perfect in love -- might love their brothers and sisters as he loved them : is it to this end that they must cease to know one another ?
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 30]: To annihilate the past of our earthly embodiment , would be to crush under the heel of an iron fate the very idea of tenderness , human or divine .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 12]: We shall all doubtless be changed , but in what direction ?
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 10]: -- to something less , or to something greater ?
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 12]: -- to something that is less we , which means degradation ?
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 11]: to something that is not we , which means annihilation ?
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 42]: or to something that is more we , which means a farther development of the original idea of us , the divine germ of us , holding in it all we ever were , all we ever can and must become ?
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 9]: What is it constitutes this or that man ?
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 9]: Is it what he himself thinks he is ?
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 3]: Assuredly not .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 12]: Is it what his friends at any given moment think him ?
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 4]: Far from it .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 11]: In which of his changing moods is he more himself ?
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 31]: Loves any lover so little as to desire _ no _ change in the person loved -- no something different to bring him or her closer to the indwelling ideal ?
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 35]: In the loveliest is there not something not like her -- something less lovely than she -- some little thing in which a change would make her , not less , but more herself ?
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 24]: Is it not of the very essence of the Christian hope , that we shall be changed from much bad to all good ?
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 37]: If a wife so love that she would keep every opposition , every inconsistency in her husband 's as yet but partially harmonious character , she does not love well enough for the kingdom of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 72]: If its imperfections be essential to the individuality she loves , and to the repossession of her joy in it , she may be sure that , if he were restored to her as she would have him , she would soon come to love him less -- perhaps to love him not at all ; for no one who does not love perfection , will ever keep constant in loving .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 26]: Fault is not lovable ; it is only the good in which the alien fault dwells that causes it to seem capable of being loved .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 21]: Neither is it any man 's peculiarities that make him beloved ; it is the essential humanity underlying those peculiarities .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 34]: They may make him interesting , and , where not offensive , they may come to be loved for the sake of the man ; but in themselves they are of smallest account .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 9]: We must not however confound peculiarity with diversity .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 13]: Diversity is in and from God ; peculiarity in and from man .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 51]: The real man is the divine idea of him ; the man God had in view when he began to send him forth out of thought into thinking ; the man he is now working to perfect by casting out what is not he , and developing what is he .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 45]: But in God 's real men , that is , his ideal men , the diversity is infinite ; he does not repeat his creations ; every one of his children differs from every other , and in every one the diversity is lovable .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 18]: God gives in his children an analysis of himself , an analysis that will never be exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 27]: It is the original God-idea of the individual man that will at length be given , without spot or blemish , into the arms of love .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 97]: Such , surely , is the heart of the comfort the Lord will give those whose love is now making them mourn ; and their present blessedness must be the expectation of the time when the true lover shall find the restored the same as the lost -- with precious differences : the things that were not like the true self , gone or going ; the things that were loveliest , lovelier still ; the restored not merely more than the lost , but more the person lost than he or she that was lost .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 36]: For the things which made him or her what he or she was , the things that rendered lovable , the things essential to the person , will be more present , because more developed .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 52]: Whether or not the Lord was here thinking specially of the mourners for the dead , as I think he was , he surely does not limit the word of comfort to them , or wish us to believe less than that his father has perfect comfort for every human grief .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 86]: Out upon such miserable theologians as , instead of receiving them into the good soil of a generous heart , to bring forth truth an hundred fold , so cut and pare the words of the Lord as to take the very life from them , quenching all their glory and colour in their own inability to believe , and still would have the dead letter of them accepted as the comfort of a creator to the sore hearts he made in his own image !
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 36]: Here , ` as if they were God 's spies , ' some such would tell us that the Lord proclaims the blessedness of those that mourn for their sins , and of them only .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 20]: What mere honest man would make a promise which was all a reservation , except in one unmentioned point !
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 24]: Assuredly they who mourn for their sins will be gloriously comforted , but certainly such also as are bowed down with any grief .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 30]: The Lord would have us know that sorrow is not a part of life ; that it is but a wind blowing throughout it , to winnow and cleanse .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 31]: Where shall the woman go whose child is at the point of death , or whom the husband of her youth has forsaken , but to her Father in heaven ?
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 13]: Must she keep away until she knows herself sorry for her sins ?
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 32]: How should that woman care to be delivered from her sins , how could she accept any comfort , who believed the child of her bosom lost to her for ever ?
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 23]: Would the Lord have such a one be of good cheer , of merry heart , because her sins were forgiven her ?
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 18]: Would such a mother be a woman of whom the saviour of men might have been born ?
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 25]: If a woman forget the child she has borne and nourished , how shall she remember the father from whom she has herself come ?
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 19]: The Lord came to heal the broken-hearted ; therefore he said , ` Blessed are the mourners . '
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 22]: Hope in God , mother , for the deadest of thy children , even for him who died in his sins .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 15]: Thou mayest have long to wait for him -- but he will be found .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 18]: It may be , thou thyself wilt one day be sent to seek him and find him .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 37]: Rest thy hope on no excuse thy love would make for him , neither upon any quibble theological or sacerdotal ; hope on in him who created him , and who loves him more than thou .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 20]: God will excuse him better than thou , and his uncovenanted mercy is larger than that of his ministers .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 16]: Shall not _ the _ Father do _ his _ best to find his prodigal ?
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 9]: the good shepherd to find his lost sheep ?
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 15]: The angels in his presence know the Father , and watch for the prodigal .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 5]: Thou shalt be comforted .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 62]: There is one phase of our mourning for the dead which I must not leave unconsidered , seeing it is the pain within pain of all our mourning -- the sorrow , namely , with its keen recurrent pangs because of things we have said or done , or omitted to say or do , while we companied with the departed .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 29]: The very life that would give itself to the other , aches with the sense of having , this time and that , not given what it might .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 17]: We cast ourselves at their feet , crying , Forgive me , my heart 's own !
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 14]: but they are pale with distance , and do not seem to hear .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 38]: It may be that they are longing in like agony of love after us , but know better , or perhaps only are more assured than we , that we shall be comforted together by and by .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 47]: Bethink thee , brother , sister , I say ; bethink thee of the splendour of God , and answer -- Would he be perfect if in his restitution of all things there were no opportunity for declaring our bitter grief and shame for the past ?
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 16]: no moment in which to sob -- Sister , brother , I am thy slave ?
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 6]: no room for making amends ?
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 32]: At the same time , when the desired moment comes , one look in the eyes may be enough , and we shall know one another even as God knows us .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 25]: Like the purposed words of the prodigal in the parable , it may be that the words of our confession will hardly find place .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 14]: Heart may so speak to heart as to forget there were such things .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 26]: Mourner , hope in God , and comfort where thou canst , and the lord of mourners will be able to comfort thee the sooner .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 19]: It may be thy very severity with thyself , has already moved the Lord to take thy part .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 31]: Such as mourn the loss of love , such from whom the friend , the brother , the lover , has turned away -- what shall I cry to them ?
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 45]: -- You too shall be comforted -- only hearken : Whatever selfishness clouds the love that mourns the loss of love , that selfishness must be taken out of it -- burned out of it even by pain extreme , if such be needful .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 38]: By cause of that in thy love which was not love , it may be thy loss has come ; anyhow , because of thy love 's defect , thou must suffer that it may be supplied .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 19]: God will not , like the unjust judge , avenge thee to escape the cry that troubles him .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 9]: No crying will make him comfort thy selfishness .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 10]: He will not render thee incapable of loving truly .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 34]: He despises neither thy love though mingled with selfishness , nor thy suffering that springs from both ; he will disentangle thy selfishness from thy love , and cast it into the fire .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 42]: His cure for thy selfishness at once and thy suffering , is to make thee love more -- and more truly ; not with the love of love , but with the love of the person whose lost love thou bemoanest .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 11]: For the love of love is the love of thyself .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 20]: Begin to love as God loves , and thy grief will assuage ; but for comfort wait his time .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 11]: What he will do for thee , he only knows .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 32]: It may be thou wilt never know what he will do , but only what he has done : it was too good for thee to know save by receiving it .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 13]: The moment thou art capable of it , thine it will be .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 24]: One thing is clear in regard to every trouble -- that the natural way with it is straight to the Father 's knee .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 19]: The Father is father _ for _ his children , else why did he make himself their father ?
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 45]: Wouldst thou not , mourner , be comforted rather after the one eternal fashion -- the child by the father -- than in such poor temporary way as would but leave thee the more exposed to thy worst enemy , thine own unreclaimed self ?
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 22]: -- an enemy who has but this one good thing in him -- that he will always bring thee to sorrow !
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 10]: The Lord has come to wipe away our tears .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 51]: He is doing it ; he will have it done as soon as he can ; and until he can , he would have them flow without bitterness ; to which end he tells us it is a blessed thing to mourn , because of the comfort on its way .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 14]: Accept his comfort now , and so prepare for the comfort at hand .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 25]: He is getting you ready for it , but you must be a fellow worker with him , or he will never have done .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 23]: He _ must _ have you pure in heart , eager after righteousness , a very child of his father in heaven .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 5]: _ GOD 'S FAMILY .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 16]: _ ` Blessed are the pure in heart , for they shall see God . '
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 19]: ` Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness , for they shall be filled . '
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 17]: ` Blessed are the peace-makers , for they shall be called the children of God . '
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 11]: -- _ Matthew _ v. 8 , 6 , 9 .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 15]: The cry of the deepest in man has always been , to see God .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 38]: It was the cry of Moses and the cry of Job , the cry of psalmist and of prophet ; and to the cry , there has ever been faintly heard a far approach of coming answer .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 42]: In the fullness of time the Son appears with the proclamation that a certain class of men shall behold the Father : ` Blessed are the pure in heart , ' he cries , ` for they shall see God . '
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 33]: He who saw God , who sees him now , who always did and always will see him , says , ` Be pure , and you also shall see him . '
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 33]: To see God was the Lord 's own , eternal , one happiness ; therefore he knew that the essential bliss of the creature is to behold the face of the creator .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 22]: In that face lies the mystery of a man 's own nature , the history of a man 's own being .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 31]: He who can read no line of it , can know neither himself nor his fellow ; he only who knows God a little , can at all understand man .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 17]: The blessed in Dante 's Paradise ever and always read each other 's thoughts in God .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 9]: Looking to him , they find their neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 29]: All that the creature needs to see or know , all that the creature can see or know , is the face of him from whom he came .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 38]: Not seeing and knowing it , he will never be at rest ; seeing and knowing it , his existence will yet indeed be a mystery to him and an awe , but no more a dismay .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 47]: To know that it is , and that it has power neither to continue nor to cease , must to any soul alive enough to appreciate the fact , be merest terror , save also it knows one with it the Power by which it exists .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 49]: From the man who comes to know and feel that Power in him and one with him , loneliness , anxiety , and fear vanish ; he is no more an orphan without a home , a little one astray on the cold waste of a helpless consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 39]: ` Father , ' he cries , ` hold me fast to thy creating will , that I may know myself one with it , know myself its outcome , its willed embodiment , and rejoice without trembling .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 32]: Be this the delight of my being , that thou hast willed , hast loved me forth ; let me know that I am thy child , born to obey thee .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 14]: Dost thou not justify thy deed to thyself by thy tenderness toward me ?
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 33]: dost thou not justify it to thy child by revealing to him his claim on thee because of thy disparture of him from thyself , because of his utter dependence on thee ?
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 65]: Father , thou art in me , else I could not be in thee , could have no house for my soul to dwell in , or any world in which to walk abroad , ' These truths are , I believe , the very necessities of fact , but a man does not therefore , at a given moment , necessarily know them .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 64]: It is absolutely necessary , none the less , to his real being , that he should know these spiritual relations in which he stands to his Origin ; yea , that they should be always present and potent with him , and become the heart and sphere and all-pervading substance of his consciousness , of which they are the ground and foundation .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 13]: Once to have seen them , is not always to see them .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 94]: There are times , and those times many , when the cares of this world -- with no right to any part in our thought , seeing either they are unreasonable or God imperfect -- so blind the eyes of the soul to the radiance of the eternally true , that they see it only as if it ought to be true , not as if it must be true ; as if it might be true in the region of thought , but could not be true in the region of fact .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 40]: Our very senses , filled with the things of our passing sojourn , combine to cast discredit upon the existence of any world for the sake of which we are furnished with an inner eye , an eternal ear .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 22]: But had we once seen God face to face , should we not be always and for ever sure of him ?
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 9]: we have had but glimpses of the Father .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 42]: Yet , if we had seen God face to face , but had again become impure of heart -- if such a fearful thought be a possible idea -- we should then no more believe that we had ever beheld him .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 17]: A sin-beclouded soul could never recall the vision whose essential verity was its only possible proof .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 17]: None but the pure in heart see God ; only the growing-pure hope to see him .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 19]: Even those who saw the Lord , the express image of his person , did not see God .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 17]: They only saw Jesus -- and then but the outside Jesus , or a little more .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 16]: They were not pure in heart ; they saw him and did not see him .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 18]: They saw him with their eyes , but not with those eyes which alone can see God .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 8]: Those were not born in them yet .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 46]: Neither the eyes of the resurrection-body , nor the eyes of unembodied spirits can see God ; only the eyes of that eternal something that is of the very essence of God , the thought-eyes , the truth-eyes , the love-eyes , can see him .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 33]: It is not because we are created and he uncreated , it is not because of any difference involved in that difference of all differences , that we can not see him .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 30]: If he pleased to take a shape , and that shape were presented to us , and we saw that shape , we should not therefore be seeing God .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 85]: Even if we knew it was a shape of God -- call it even God himself our eyes rested upon ; if we had been told the fact and believed the report ; yet , if we did not see the _ Godness _ , were not capable of recognizing him , so as without the report to know the vision him , we should not be seeing God , we should only be seeing the tabernacle in which for the moment he dwelt .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 33]: In other words , not seeing what in the form made it a form fit for him to take , we should not be seeing a presence which could only be God .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 14]: To see God is to stand on the highest point of created being .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 46]: Not until we see God -- no partial and passing embodiment of him , but the abiding presence -- do we stand upon our own mountain-top , the height of the existence God has given us , and up to which he is leading us .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 13]: That there we should stand , is the end of our creation .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 36]: This truth is at the heart of everything , means all kinds of completions , may be uttered in many ways ; but language will never compass it , for form will never contain it .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 12]: Nor shall we ever see , that is know God perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 32]: We shall indeed never absolutely know man or woman or child ; but we may know God as we never can know human being -- as we never can know ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 24]: We not only may , but we must so know him , and it can never be until we are pure in heart .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 13]: Then shall we know him with the infinitude of an ever-growing knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 14]: ` What is it , then , to be pure in heart ? '
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 24]: I answer , It is not necessary to define this purity , or to have in the mind any clear form of it .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 25]: For even to know perfectly , were that possible , what purity of heart is , would not be to be pure in heart .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 10]: ` How then am I to try after it ?
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 11]: can I do so without knowing what it is ? '
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 19]: Though you do not know any definition of purity , you know enough to begin to be pure .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 26]: You do not know what a man is , but you know how to make his acquaintance -- perhaps even how to gain his friendship .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 18]: Your brain does not know what purity is ; your heart has some acquaintance with purity itself .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 22]: Your brain in seeking to know what it is , may even obstruct your heart in bettering its friendship with it .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 36]: To know what purity is , a man must already be pure ; but he who can put the question , already knows enough of purity , I repeat , to begin to become pure .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 21]: If this moment you determine to start for purity , your conscience will at once tell you where to begin .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 24]: If you reply , ` My conscience says nothing definite ' ; I answer , ` You are but playing with your conscience .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 8]: Determine , and it will speak . '
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 10]: If you care to see God , be pure .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 54]: If you will not be pure , you will grow more and more impure ; and instead of seeing God , will at length find yourself face to face with a vast inane -- a vast inane , yet filled full of one inhabitant , that devouring monster , your own false self .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 36]: If for this neither do you care , I tell you there is a Power that will not have it so ; a Love that will make you care by the consequences of not caring .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 62]: You who seek purity , and would have your fellow-men also seek it , spend not your labour on the stony ground of their intellect , endeavouring to explain what purity is ; give their imagination the one pure man ; call up their conscience to witness against their own deeds ; urge upon them the grand resolve to be pure .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 58]: With the first endeavour of a soul toward her , Purity will begin to draw nigh , calling for admittance ; and never will a man have to pause in the divine toil , asking what next is required of him ; the demands of the indwelling Purity will ever be in front of his slow-labouring obedience .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 16]: If one should say , ` Alas , I am shut out from this blessing !
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 14]: I am not pure in heart : never shall I see God ! '
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 20]: here is another word from the same eternal heart to comfort him , making his grief its own consolation .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 14]: For this man also there is blessing with the messenger of the Father .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 24]: Unhappy men were we , if God were the God of the perfected only , and not of the growing , the becoming !
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 32]: ` Blessed are they , ' says the Lord , concerning the not yet pure , ` which do hunger and thirst after righteousness , for they shall be filled . '
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 15]: Filled with righteousness , they are pure ; pure , they shall see God .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 51]: Long ere the Lord appeared , ever since man was on the earth , nay , surely , from the very beginning , was his spirit at work in it for righteousness ; in the fullness of time he came in his own human person , to fulfil all righteousness .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 19]: He came to his own of the same mind with himself , who hungered and thirsted after righteousness .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 7]: They should be fulfilled of righteousness !
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 23]: To hunger and thirst after anything , implies a sore personal need , a strong desire , a passion for that thing .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 19]: Those that hunger and thirst after righteousness , seek with their whole nature the design of that nature .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 15]: Nothing less will give them satisfaction ; that alone will set them at ease .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 45]: They long to be delivered from their sins , to send them away , to be clean and blessed by their absence -- in a word to become men , God 's men ; for , sin gone , all the rest is good .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 23]: It was not in such hearts , it was not in any heart that the revolting legal fiction of imputed righteousness arose .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 25]: Righteousness itself , God 's righteousness , rightness in their own being , in heart and brain and hands , is what they desire .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 33]: Of such men was Nathanael , in whom was no guile ; such , perhaps , was Nicodemus too , although he did come to Jesus by night ; such was Zacchaeus .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 53]: The temple could do nothing to deliver them ; but , by their very futility , its observances had done their work , developing the desires they could not meet , making the men hunger and thirst the more after genuine righteousness : the Lord must bring them this bread from heaven .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 19]: With him , the live , original rightness , in their hearts , they must speedily become righteous .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 31]: With that Love their friend , who is at once both the root and the flower of things , they would strive vigorously as well as hunger eagerly after righteousness .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 7]: Love is the father of righteousness .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 16]: It could not be , and could not be hungered after , but for love .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 17]: The lord of righteousness himself could not live without Love , without the Father in him .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 29]: Every heart was created for , and can live no otherwise than in and upon love eternal , perfect , pure , unchanging ; and love necessitates righteousness .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 28]: In how many souls has not the very thought of a real God waked a longing to be different , to be pure , to be right !
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 118]: The fact that this feeling is possible , that a soul can become dissatisfied with itself , and desire a change in itself , reveals God as an essential part of its being ; for in itself the soul is aware that it can not be what it would , what it ought -- that it can not set itself right : a need has been generated in the soul for which the soul can generate no supply ; a presence higher than itself must have caused that need ; a power greater than itself must supply it , for the soul knows its very need , its very lack , is of something greater than itself .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 49]: But the primal need of the human soul is yet greater than this ; the longing after righteousness is only one of the manifestations of it ; the need itself is that of _ existence not self-existent _ for the consciousness of the presence of the causing Self-existent .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 9]: It is the man 's need of God .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 23]: A moral , that is , a human , a spiritual being , must either be God , or one with God .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 31]: This truth begins to reveal itself when the man begins to feel that he can not cast out the thing he hates , can not be the thing he loves .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 27]: That he hates thus , that he loves thus , is because God is in him , but he finds he has not enough of God .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 19]: His awaking strength manifests itself in his sense of weakness , for only strength can know itself weak .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 9]: The negative can not know itself at all .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 7]: Weakness can not know itself weak .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 19]: It is a little strength that longs for more ; it is infant righteousness that hungers after righteousness .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 43]: To every soul dissatisfied with itself , comes this word , at once rousing and consoling , from the Power that lives and makes him live -- that in his hungering and thirsting he is blessed , for he shall be filled .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 13]: His hungering and thirsting is the divine pledge of the divine meal .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 35]: The more he hungers and thirsts the more blessed is he ; the more room is there in him to receive that which God is yet more eager to give than he to have .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 30]: It is the miserable emptiness that makes a man hunger and thirst ; and , as the body , so the soul hungers after what belongs to its nature .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 28]: A man hungers and thirsts after righteousness because his nature needs it -- needs it because it was made for it ; his soul desires its own .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 10]: His nature is good , and desires more good .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 24]: Therefore , that he is empty of good , needs discourage no one ; for what is emptiness but room to be filled ?
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 16]: Emptiness is need of good ; the emptiness that desires good , is itself good .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 25]: Even if the hunger after righteousness should in part spring from a desire after self-respect , it is not therefore _ all _ false .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 22]: A man could not even be ashamed of himself , without some ` feeling sense ' of the beauty of rightness .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 42]: By divine degrees the man will at length grow sick of himself , and desire righteousness with a pure hunger -- just as a man longs to eat that which is good , nor thinks of the strength it will restore .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 28]: To be filled with righteousness , will be to forget even righteousness itself in the bliss of being righteous , that is , a child of God .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 12]: The thought of righteousness will vanish in the fact of righteousness .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 36]: When a creature is just what he is meant to be , what only he is fit to be ; when , therefore , he is truly himself , he never thinks what he is .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 12]: He _ is _ that thing ; why think about it ?
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 15]: It is no longer outside of him that he should contemplate or desire it .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 23]: God made man , and woke in him the hunger for righteousness ; the Lord came to enlarge and rouse this hunger .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 20]: The first and lasting effect of his words must be to make the hungering and thirsting long yet more .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 48]: If their passion grow to a despairing sense of the unattainable , a hopelessness of ever gaining that without which life were worthless , let them remember that the Lord congratulates the hungry and thirsty , so sure does he know them of being one day satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 22]: Their hunger is a precious thing to have , none the less that it were a bad thing to retain unappeased .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 24]: It springs from the lack but also from the love of good , and its presence makes it possible to supply the lack .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 8]: Happy , then , ye pining souls !
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 26]: The food you would have , is the one thing the Lord would have you have , the very thing he came to bring you !
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 31]: Fear not , ye hungering and thirsting ; you shall have righteousness enough , though none to spare -- none to spare , yet enough to overflow upon every man .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 23]: See how the Lord goes on filling his disciples , John and Peter and James and Paul , with righteousness from within !
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 45]: What honest soul , interpreting the servant by the master , and unbiassed by the tradition of them that would shut the kingdom of heaven against men , can doubt what Paul means by ` the righteousness which is of God by faith ' ?
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 29]: He was taught of Jesus Christ through the words he had spoken ; and the man who does not understand Jesus Christ , will never understand his apostles .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 28]: What righteousness could St Paul have meant but the same the Lord would have men hunger and thirst after -- the very righteousness wherewith God is righteous !
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 21]: They that hunger and thirst after such only righteousness , shall become pure in heart , and shall see God .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 17]: If your hunger seems long in being filled , it is well it should seem long .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 16]: But what if your righteousness tarry , because your hunger after it is not eager ?
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 26]: There are who sit long at the table because their desire is slow ; they eat as who should say , We need no food .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 15]: In things spiritual , increasing desire is the sign that satisfaction is drawing nearer .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 62]: But it were better to hunger after righteousness for ever than to dull the sense of lack with the husks of the Christian scribes and lawyers : he who trusts in the atonement instead of in the father of Jesus Christ , fills his fancy with the chimeras of a vulgar legalism , not his heart with the righteousness of God .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 8]: Hear another like word of the Lord .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 30]: He assures us that the Father hears the cries of his elect -- of those whom he seeks to worship him because they worship in spirit and in truth .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 23]: ` Shall not God avenge his own elect , ' he says , ` which cry day and night unto him ? '
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 20]: Now what can God 's elect have to keep on crying for , night and day , but righteousness ?
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 20]: He allows that God seems to put off answering them , but assures us he will answer them speedily .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 23]: Even now he must be busy answering their prayers ; increasing hunger is the best possible indication that he is doing so .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 67]: For some divine reason it is well they should not yet know in themselves that he is answering their prayers ; but the day must come when we shall be righteous even as he is righteous ; when no word of his will miss being understood because of our lack of righteousness ; when no unrighteousness shall hide from our eyes the face of the Father .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 79]: These two promises , of seeing God , and being filled with righteousness , have place between the individual man and his father in heaven directly ; the promise I now come to , has place between a man and his God as the God of other men also , as the father of the whole family in heaven and earth : ` Blessed are the peace-makers , for they shall be called the children of God . '
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 75]: Those that are on their way to see God , those who are growing pure in heart through hunger and thirst after righteousness , are indeed the children of God ; but specially the Lord calls those his children who , on their way home , are peace-makers in the travelling company ; for , surely , those in any family are specially the children , who make peace with and among the rest .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 15]: The true idea of the universe is the whole family in heaven and earth .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 66]: All the children in this part of it , the earth , at least , are not good children ; but however far , therefore , the earth is from being a true portion of a real family , the life-germ at the root of the world , that by and for which it exists , is its relation to God the father of men .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 44]: For the development of this germ in the consciousness of the children , the church -- whose idea is the purer family within the more mixed , ever growing as leaven within the meal by absorption , but which itself is , alas !
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 17]: not easily distinguishable from the world it would change -- is one of the passing means .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 31]: For the same purpose , the whole divine family is made up of numberless human families , that in these , men may learn and begin to love one another .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 15]: God , then , would make of the world a true , divine family .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 14]: Now the primary necessity to the very existence of a family is peace .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 22]: Many a human family is no family , and the world is no family yet , for the lack of peace .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 28]: Wherever peace is growing , there of course is the live peace , counteracting disruption and disintegration , and helping the development of the true essential family .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 58]: The one question , therefore , as to any family is , whether peace or strife be on the increase in it ; for peace alone makes it possible for the binding grass-roots of life -- love , namely , and justice -- to spread throughout what were else but a wind-blown heap of still drifting sand .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 76]: The peace-makers quiet the winds of the world ever ready to be up and blowing ; they tend and cherish the interlacing roots of the ministering grass ; they spin and twist many uniting cords , and they weave many supporting bands ; they are the servants , for the truth 's sake , of the individual , of the family , of the world , of the great universal family of heaven and earth .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 49]: They are the true children of that family , the allies and ministers of every clasping and consolidating force in it ; fellow-workers they are with God in the creation of the family ; they help him to get it to his mind , to perfect his father-idea .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 19]: Ever radiating peace , they welcome love , but do not seek it ; they provoke no jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 18]: They are the children of God , for like him they would be one with his creatures .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 15]: His eldest son , his very likeness , was the first of the family-peace-makers .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 49]: Preaching peace to them that were afar off and them that were nigh , he stood undefended in the turbulent crowd of his fellows , and it was only over his dead body that his brothers began to come together in the peace that will not be broken .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 37]: He rose again from the dead ; his peace-making brothers , like himself , are dying unto sin ; and not yet have the evil children made their father hate , or their elder brother flinch .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 56]: On the other hand , those whose influence is to divide and separate , causing the hearts of men to lean away from each other , make themselves the children of the evil one : born of God and not of the devil , they turn from God , and adopt the devil their father .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 41]: They set their God-born life against God , against the whole creative , redemptive purpose of his unifying will , ever obstructing the one prayer of the first-born -- that the children may be one with him in the Father .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 29]: Against the heart-end of creation , against that for which the Son yielded himself utterly , the sowers of strife , the fomenters of discord , contend ceaseless .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 40]: They do their part with all the other powers of evil to make the world which the love of God holds together -- a world at least , though not yet a family -- one heaving mass of dissolution .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 6]: But they labour in vain .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 77]: Through the mass and through it , that it may cohere , this way and that , guided in dance inexplicable of prophetic harmony , move the children of God , the lights of the world , the lovers of men , the fellow-workers with God , the peace-makers -- ever weaving , after a pattern devised by , and known only to him who orders their ways , the web of the world 's history .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 20]: But for them the world would have no history ; it would vanish , a cloud of windborne dust .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 23]: As in his labour , so shall these share in the joy of God , in the divine fruition of victorious endeavour .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 31]: Blessed are the peace-makers , for they shall be called the children of God -- _ the _ children because they set the Father on the throne of the Family .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 30]: The main practical difficulty , with some at least of the peace-makers , is , how to carry themselves toward the undoers of peace , the disuniters of souls .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 85]: Perhaps the most potent of these are not those powers of the church visible who care for canon and dogma more than for truth , and for the church more than for Christ ; who take uniformity for unity ; who strain at a gnat and swallow a camel , nor knowing what spirit they are of ; such men , I say , are perhaps neither the most active nor the most potent force working for the disintegration of the body of Christ .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 44]: I imagine also that neither are the party-liars of politics the worst foes to divine unity , ungenerous , and often knowingly false as they are to their opponents , to whom they seem to have no desire to be honest and fair .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 28]: I think , rather , they must be the babbling liars of the social circle , and the faithless brothers and unloving sisters of disunited human families .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 4]: But why inquire ?
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 23]: Every self-assertion , every form of self-seeking however small or poor , world-noble or grotesque , is a separating and scattering force .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 30]: And these forces are multitudinous , these points of radial repulsion are innumerable , because of the prevailing passion of mean souls to seem great , and feel important .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 74]: If such can not hope to attract the attention of the great-little world , if they can not even become ` the cynosure of neighbouring eyes , ' they will , in what sphere they may call their own , however small it be , try to make a party for themselves ; each , revolving on his or her own axis , will attempt to self-centre a private whirlpool of human monads .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 27]: To draw such a surrounding , the partisan of self will sometimes gnaw asunder the most precious of bonds , poison whole broods of infant loves .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 26]: Such real schismatics go about , where not inventing evil , yet rejoicing in iniquity ; mishearing ; misrepresenting ; paralyzing affection ; separating hearts .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 16]: Their chosen calling is that of the strife-maker , the child of the dividing devil .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 24]: They belong to the class of _ the perfidious _ , whom Dante places in the lowest infernal gulf as their proper home .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 38]: Many a woman who now imagines herself standing well in morals and religion , will find herself at last just such a child of the devil ; and her misery will be the hope of her redemption .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 36]: But it is not for her sake that I write these things : would such a woman recognize her own likeness , were I to set it down as close as words could draw it ?
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 17]: I am rather as one groping after some light on the true behaviour toward her kind .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 19]: Are we to treat persons known for liars and strife-makers as the children of the devil or not ?
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 24]: Are we to turn away from them , and refuse to acknowledge them , rousing an ignorant strife of tongues concerning our conduct ?
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 21]: Are we guilty of connivance , when silent as to the ambush whence we know the wicked arrow privily shot ?
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 9]: Are we to call the traitor to account ?
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 10]: or are we to give warning of any sort ?
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 5]: I have no answer .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 14]: Each must carry the question that perplexes to the Light of the World .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 25]: To what purpose is the spirit of God promised to them that ask it , if not to help them order their way aright ?
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 50]: One thing is plain -- that we must love the strife-maker ; another is nearly as plain -- that , if we do not love him , we must leave him alone ; for without love there can be no peace-making , and words will but occasion more strife .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 8]: To be kind neither hurts nor compromises .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 20]: Kindness has many phases , and the fitting form of it may avoid offence , and must avoid untruth .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 22]: We must not fear what man can do to us , but commit our way to the Father of the Family .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 24]: We must be nowise anxious to defend ourselves ; and if not ourselves because God is our defence , then why our friends ?
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 10]: is he not their defence as much as ours ?
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 12]: Commit thy friend 's cause also to him who judgeth righteously .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 34]: Be ready to bear testimony for thy friend , as thou wouldst to receive the blow struck at him ; but do not plunge into a nest of scorpions to rescue his handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 27]: Be true to him thyself , nor spare to show thou lovest and honourest him ; but defence may dishonour : men may say , What !
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 9]: is thy friend 's esteem then so small ?
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 12]: He is unwise who drags a rich veil from a cactus-bush .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 48]: Whatever our relation , then , with any peace-breaker , our mercy must ever be within call ; and it may help us against an indignation too strong to be pure , to remember that when any man is reviled for righteousness-sake , then is he blessed .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 6]: _ THE REWARD OF OBEDIENCE .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 14]: _ ` Blessed are the merciful , for they shall obtain mercy . '
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 20]: ` Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness ' sake , for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 27]: Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you , and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely , for my sake .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 26]: Rejoice and be exceeding glad , for great is your reward in heaven ; for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you . '
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 13]: -- _ Matthew _ , v. 7 , 10 11 , 12 .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 11]: Mercy can not get in where mercy goes not out .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 8]: The outgoing makes way for the incoming .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 10]: God takes the part of humanity against the man .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 13]: The man must treat men as he would have God treat him .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 39]: ` If ye forgive men their trespasses , ' the Lord says , ` your heavenly father will also forgive you ; but if ye forgive not men their trespasses , neither will your father forgive your trespasses .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 44]: And in the prophecy of the judgment of the Son of man , he represents himself as saying , ` Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren , ye have done it unto me . '
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 39]: But the demand for mercy is far from being for the sake only of the man who needs his neighbour 's mercy ; it is greatly more for the sake of the man who must show the mercy .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 35]: It is a small thing to a man whether or not his neighbour be merciful to him ; it is life or death to him whether or not he be merciful to his neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 34]: The greatest mercy that can be shown to man , is to make him merciful ; therefore , if he will not be merciful , the mercy of God must compel him thereto .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 33]: In the parable of the king taking account of his servants , he delivers the unmerciful debtor to the tormentors , 'till he should pay all that was due unto him . '
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 37]: The king had forgiven his debtor , but as the debtor refuses to pass on the forgiveness to his neighbour -- the only way to make a return in kind -- the king withdraws his forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 12]: If we forgive not men their trespasses , our trespasses remain .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 23]: For how can God in any sense forgive , remit , or send away the sin which a man insists on retaining ?
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 17]: Unmerciful , we must be given up to the tormentors until we learn to be merciful .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 9]: God is merciful : we must be merciful .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 21]: There is no blessedness except in being such as God ; it would be altogether unmerciful to leave us unmerciful .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 31]: The reward of the merciful is , that by their mercy they are rendered capable of receiving the mercy of God -- yea , God himself , who is Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 19]: That men may be drawn to taste and see and understand , the Lord associates reward with righteousness .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 21]: The Lord would have men love righteousness , but how are they to love it without being acquainted with it ?
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 15]: How are they to go on loving it without a growing knowledge of it ?
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 47]: To draw them toward it that they may begin to know it , and to encourage them when assailed by the disappointments that accompany endeavour , he tells them simply a truth concerning it -- that in the doing of it , there is great reward .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 22]: Let no one start with dismay at the idea of a reward of righteousness , saying virtue is its own reward .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 7]: Is not virtue then a reward ?
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 10]: Is any other imaginable reward worth mentioning beside it ?
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 28]: True , the man may , after this mode or that , mistake the reward promised ; not the less must he have it , or perish .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 8]: Who will count himself deceived by overfulfilment ?
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 45]: Would a parent be deceiving his child in saying , ` My boy , you will have a great reward if you learn Greek , ' foreseeing his son 's delight in Homer and Plato -- now but a valueless waste in his eyes ?
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 19]: When his reward comes , will the youth feel aggrieved that it is Greek , and not bank-notes ?
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 64]: The nature indeed of the Lord 's promised rewards is hardly to be mistaken ; yet the foolish remarks one sometimes hears , make me wish to point out that neither is the Lord proclaiming an ethical system , nor does he make the blunder of representing as righteousness the doing of a good thing because of some advantage to be thereby gained .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 53]: When he promises , he only states some fact that will encourage his disciples -- that is , all who learn of him -- to meet the difficulties in the way of doing right and so learning righteousness , his object being to make men righteous , not to teach them philosophy .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 36]: I doubt if those who would , on the ground of mentioned reward , set aside the teaching of the Lord , are as anxious to be righteous as they are to prove him unrighteous .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 63]: If they were , they would , I think , take more care to represent him truly ; they would make farther search into the thing , nor be willing that he whom the world confesses its best man , and whom they themselves , perhaps , confess their superior in conduct , should be found less pure in theory than they .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 20]: Must the Lord hide from his friends that they will have cause to rejoice that they have been obedient ?
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 18]: Must he give them no help to counterbalance the load with which they start on their race ?
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 25]: Is he to tell them the horrors of the persecutions that await them , and not the sweet sympathies that will help them through ?
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 16]: Was it wrong to assure them that where he was going they should go also ?
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 59]: The Lord could not demand of them more righteousness than he does : ` Be ye therefore perfect as your father in heaven is perfect ; ' but not to help them by word of love , deed of power , and promise of good , would have shown him far less of a brother and a saviour .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 31]: It is the part of the enemy of righteousness to increase the difficulties in the way of becoming righteous , and to diminish those in the way of seeming righteous .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 48]: Jesus desires no righteousness for the pride of being righteous , any more than for advantage to be gained by it ; therefore , while requiring such purity as the man , beforehand , is unable to imagine , he gives him all the encouragement he can .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 19]: He will not enhance his victory by difficulties -- of them there are enough -- but by completeness .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 22]: He will not demand the loftiest motives in the yet far from loftiest soul : to those the soul must grow .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 18]: He will hearten the child with promises , and fulfil them to the contentment of the man .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 42]: Men can not be righteous without love ; to love a righteous man is the best , the only way to learn righteousness : the Lord gives us himself to love , and promises his closest friendship to them that overcome .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 9]: God 's rewards are always in kind . '
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 17]: I am your father ; be my children , and I will be your father . '
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 15]: Every obedience is the opening of another door into the boundless universe of life .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 30]: So long as the constitution of that universe remains , so long as the world continues to be made by God , righteousness can never fail of perfect reward .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 15]: Before it could be otherwise , the government must have passed into other hands .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 12]: The idea of merit is nowise essential to that of reward .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 58]: Jesus tells us that the lord who finds his servant faithful , will make him sit down to meat , and come forth and serve him ; he says likewise , ` When ye have done all , say we are unprofitable servants ; we have done only that which it was our duty to do . '
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 29]: Reward is the rebound of Virtue 's well-served ball from the hand of Love ; a sense of merit is the most sneaking shape that self-satisfaction can assume .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 50]: God 's reward lies closed in all well-doing : the doer of right grows better and humbler , and comes nearer to God 's heart as nearer to his likeness ; grows more capable of God 's own blessedness , and of inheriting the kingdoms of heaven and earth .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 40]: To be made greater than one 's fellows is the offered reward of hell , and involves no greatness ; to be made greater than one 's self , is the divine reward , and involves a real greatness .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 41]: A man might be set above all his fellows , to be but so much less than he was before ; a man can not be raised a hair 's - breadth above himself , without rising nearer to God .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 47]: The reward itself , then , is righteousness ; and the man who was righteous for the sake of such reward , knowing what it was , would be righteous for the sake of righteousness , -- which yet , however , would not be perfection .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 10]: But I must distinguish and divide no farther now .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 33]: The reward of mercy is not often of this world ; the merciful do not often receive mercy in return from their fellows ; perhaps they do not often receive much gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 26]: None the less , being the children of their father in heaven , will they go on to show mercy , even to their enemies .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 14]: They must give like God , and like God be blessed in giving .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 43]: There is a mercy that lies in the endeavour to share with others the best things God has given : they who do so will be persecuted , and reviled , and slandered , as well as thanked and loved and befriended .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 21]: The Lord not only promises the greatest possible reward ; he tells his disciples the worst they have to expect .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 30]: He not only shows them the fair countries to which they are bound ; he tells them the truth of the rough weather and the hardships of the way .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 9]: He will not have them choose in ignorance .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 20]: At the same time he strengthens them to meet coming difficulty , by instructing them in its real nature .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 31]: All this is part of his preparation of them for his work , for taking his yoke upon them , and becoming fellow-labourers with him in his father 's vineyard .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 31]: They must not imagine , because they are the servants of his father , that therefore they shall find their work easy ; they shall only find the reward great .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 24]: Neither will he have them fancy , when evil comes upon them , that something unforeseen , unprovided for , has befallen them .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 32]: It is just then , on the contrary , that their reward comes nigh : when men revile them and persecute them , then they may know that they are blessed .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 11]: Their suffering is ground for rejoicing , for exceeding gladness .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 34]: The ignominy cast upon them leaves the name of the Lord 's Father written upon their foreheads , the mark of the true among the false , of the children among the slaves .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 41]: With all who suffer for the world , persecution is the seal of their patent , a sign that they were sent : they fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ for his body 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 44]: Let us look at the similar words the Lord spoke in a later address to his disciples , in the presence of thousands , on the plain , -- supplemented with lamentation over such as have what they desire : St Luke vi .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 4]: 20 -- 26 .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 15]: _ ` Blessed be ye poor , for yours is the kingdom of God .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 13]: Blessed are ye that hunger now , for ye shall be filled .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 12]: Blessed are ye that weep now , for ye shall laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 40]: Blessed are ye when men shall hate you , and when they shall separate you from their company , and shall reproach you , and cast out your name as evil , for the Son of Man 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 32]: Rejoice ye in that day , and leap for joy , for behold your reward is great in heaven ; for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 11]: _ _ ` But woe unto you that are rich !
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 7]: for ye have received your consolation .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 12]: Woe unto you that are full , for ye shall hunger .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 14]: Woe unto you that laugh now , for ye shall mourn and weep .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 23]: Woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you ; for so did their fathers to the false prophets . '
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 14]: _ On this occasion he uses the word _ hunger _ without limitation .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 51]: Every true want , every genuine need , every God-created hunger , is a thing provided for in the idea of the universe ; but no attempt to fill a void otherwise than the Heart of the Universe intended and intends , is or can be anything but a woe .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 16]: God forgets none of his children -- the naughty ones any more than the good .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 15]: Love and reward is for the good : love and correction for the bad .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 15]: The bad ones will trouble the good , but shall do them no hurt .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 34]: The evil a man does to his neighbour , shall do his neighbour no harm , shall work indeed for his good ; but he himself will have to mourn for his doing .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 43]: A sore injury to himself , it is to his neighbour a cause of jubilation -- not for the evil the man does to himself -- over that there is sorrow in heaven -- but for the good it occasions his neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 33]: The poor , the hungry , the weeping , the hated , may lament their lot as if God had forgotten them ; but God is all the time caring for them .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 13]: Blessed in his sight now , they shall soon know themselves blessed .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 14]: ` Blessed are ye that weep now , for ye shall laugh . '
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 11]: -- Welcome words from the glad heart of the Saviour !
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 10]: Do they not make our hearts burn within us ?
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 9]: -- They shall be comforted even to laughter !
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 57]: The poor , the hungry , the weeping , the hated , the persecuted , are the powerful , the opulent , the merry , the loved , the victorious of God 's kingdom , -- to be filled with good things , to laugh for very delight , to be honoured and sought and cherished !
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 15]: But such as have their poor consolation in this life -- alas for them !
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 12]: -- for those who have yet to learn what hunger is !
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 11]: for those whose laughter is as the crackling of thorns !
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 12]: for those who have loved and gathered the praises of men !
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 10]: for the rich , the jocund , the full-fed !
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 10]: Silent-footed evil is on its way to seize them .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 9]: Dives must go without ; Lazarus must have .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 9]: God 's education makes use of terrible extremes .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 15]: There are last that shall be first , and first that shall be last .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 44]: The Lord knew what trials , what tortures even awaited his disciples after his death ; he knew they would need every encouragement he could give them to keep their hearts strong , lest in some moment of dismay they should deny him .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 12]: If they had denied him , where would our gospel be ?
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 21]: If there are none able and ready to be crucified for him now , alas for the age to come !
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 16]: What a poor travesty of the good news of God will arrive at their doors !
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 28]: Those whom our Lord felicitates are all the children of one family ; and everything that can be called blessed or blessing comes of the same righteousness .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 40]: If a disciple be blessed because of any one thing , every other blessing is either his , or on the way to become his ; for he is on the way to receive the very righteousness of God .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 18]: Each good thing opens the door to the one next it , so to all the rest .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 108]: But as if these his assurances and promises and comfortings were not large enough ; as if the mention of any condition whatever might discourage some humble man of heart with a sense of unfitness , with the fear , perhaps conviction that the promise was not for him ; as if some one might say , ` Alas , I am proud , and neither poor in spirit nor meek ; I am at times not at all hungry after righteousness ; I am not half merciful , and am very ready to feel hurt and indignant : I am shut out from every blessing ! '
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 78]: the Lord , knowing the multitudes that can urge nothing in their own favour , and sorely feel they are not blessed , looks abroad over the wide world of his brothers and sisters , and calls aloud , including in the boundless invitation every living soul with but the one qualification of unrest or discomfort , ` Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest . '
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 6]: _ THE YOKE OF JESUS .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 59]: _ At that time Jesus answered and said , -- according to Luke , In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit , and said , -- ' I thank thee , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto babes .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 14]: Even so , Father , for so it seemed good in thy sight .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 74]: ` All things are delivered unto me of my father ; and no man knoweth the son , ' -- according to Luke , ` who the son is , ' -- ` but the father ; neither knoweth any man the father , ' -- according to Luke , ` who the father is , ' -- ` save the son , and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him . '
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 6]: -- _ Matthew _ xi .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 12]: 25 -- 27 ; _ Luke _ x. 21 , 22 .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 22]: ` Come unto me , all ye that labour , and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 29]: Take my yoke upon you , and learn of me , for I am meek and lowly in heart ; and ye shall find rest unto your souls .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 13]: For my yoke is easy , and my burden is light . '
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 5]: _ Matthew _ xi .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 4]: 28 -- 30 .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 79]: The words of the Lord in the former two of these paragraphs , are represented , both by Matthew and by Luke , as spoken after the denunciation of the cities of Chorazin , Bethsaida , and Capernaum ; only in Luke 's narrative , the return of the seventy is mentioned between ; and there the rejoicing of the Lord over the Father 's revelation of himself to babes , appears to have reference to the seventy .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 28]: The fact that the return of the seventy is not mentioned elsewhere , leaves us free to suppose that the words were indeed spoken on that occasion .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 25]: The circumstances , however , as circumstances , are to us of little importance , not being necessary to the understanding of the words .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 46]: The Lord makes no complaint against the wise and prudent ; he but recognizes that they are not those to whom his father reveals his best things ; for which fact and the reasons of it , he thanks , or praises his father . '
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 37]: I bless thy will : I see that thou art right : I am of one mind with thee : ' something of each of these phases of meaning seems to belong to the Greek word .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 12]: ` But why not reveal true things first to the wise ?
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 10]: Are they not the fittest to receive them ? '
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 17]: Yes , if these things and their wisdom lie in the same region -- not otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 80]: No amount of knowledge or skill in physical science , will make a man the fitter to argue a metaphysical question ; and the wisdom of this world , meaning by the term , the philosophy of prudence , self-protection , precaution , specially unfits a man for receiving what the Father has to reveal : in proportion to our care about our own well being , is our incapability of understanding and welcoming the care of the Father .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 28]: The wise and the prudent , with all their energy of thought , could never see the things of the Father sufficiently to recognize them as true .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 42]: Their sagacity labours in earthly things , and so fills their minds with their own questions and conclusions , that they can not see the eternal foundations God has laid in man , or the consequent necessities of their own nature .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 20]: They are proud of finding out things , but the things they find out are all less than themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 20]: Because , however , they have discovered them , they imagine such things the goal of the human intellect .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 36]: If they grant there may be things beyond those , they either count them beyond their reach , or declare themselves uninterested in them : for the wise and prudent , they do not exist .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 30]: They work only to gather by the senses , and deduce from what they have so gathered , the prudential , the probable , the expedient , the protective .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 14]: They never think of the essential , of what in itself must be .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 16]: They are cautious , wary , discreet , judicious , circumspect , provident , temporizing .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 40]: They have no enthusiasm , and are shy of all forms of it -- a clever , hard , thin people , who take _ things _ for the universe , and love of facts for love of truth .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 15]: They know nothing deeper in man than mere surface mental facts and their relations .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 19]: They do not perceive , or they turn away from any truth which the intellect can not formulate .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 13]: Zeal for God will never eat them up : why should it ?
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 18]: he is not interesting to them : theology may be ; to such men religion means theology .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 12]: How should the treasure of the Father be open to such ?
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 16]: In their hands his rubies would draw in their fire , and cease to glow .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 11]: The roses of paradise in their gardens would blow withered .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 38]: They never go beyond the porch of the temple ; they are not sure whether there be any _ adytum _ , and they do not care to go in and see : why indeed should they ?
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 11]: it would but be to turn and come out again .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 28]: Even when they know their duty , they must take it to pieces , and consider the grounds of its claim before they will render it obedience .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 32]: All those evil doctrines about God that work misery and madness , have their origin in the brains of the wise and prudent , not in the hearts of the children .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 77]: These wise and prudent , careful to make the words of his messengers rime with their conclusions , interpret the great heart of God , not by their own hearts , but by their miserable intellects ; and , postponing the obedience which alone can give power to the understanding , press upon men 's minds their wretched interpretations of the will of the Father , instead of the doing of that will upon their hearts .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 20]: They call their philosophy the truth of God , and say men must hold it , or stand outside .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 34]: They are the slaves of the letter in all its weakness and imperfection , -- and will be until the spirit of the Word , the spirit of obedience shall set them free .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 16]: The babes must beware lest the wise and prudent come between them and the Father .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 25]: They must yield no claim to authority over their belief , made by man or community , by church any more than by synagogue .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 32]: That alone is for them to believe which the Lord reveals to their souls as true ; that alone is it possible for them to believe with what he counts belief .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 34]: The divine object for which teacher or church exists , is the persuasion of the individual heart to come to Jesus , the spirit , to be taught what he alone can teach .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 38]: Terribly has his gospel suffered in the mouths of the wise and prudent : how would it be faring now , had its first messages been committed to persons of repute , instead of those simple fishermen ?
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 12]: It would be nowhere , or , if anywhere , unrecognizable .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 30]: From the first we should have had a system founded on a human interpretation of the divine gospel , instead of the gospel itself , which would have disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 27]: As it is , we have had one dull miserable human system after another usurping its place ; but , thank God , the gospel remains !
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 35]: The little child , heedless of his trailing cloud of glory , and looking about him aghast in an unknown world , may yet see and run to the arms open to the children .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 63]: How often has not some symbol employed in the New Testament been forced into the service of argument for one or another contemptible scheme of redemption , which were no redemption ; while the truth for the sake of which the symbol was used , the thing meant to be conveyed by it , has lain unregarded beside the heap of rubbish !
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 76]: Had the wise and prudent been the confidants of God , I repeat , the letter would at once have usurped the place of the spirit ; the ministering slave would have been set over the household ; a system of religion , with its rickety , malodorous plan of salvation , would not only have at once been put in the place of a living Christ , but would yet have held that place .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 60]: The great brother , the human God , the eternal Son , the living one , would have been as utterly hidden from the tearful eyes and aching hearts of the weary and heavy-laden , as if he had never come from the deeps of love to call the children home out of the shadows of a self-haunted universe .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 76]: But the Father revealed the Father 's things to his babes ; the babes loved , and began to do them , therewith began to understand them , and went on growing in the knowledge of them and in the power of communicating them ; while to the wise and prudent , the deepest words of the most babe-like of them all , John Boanerges , even now appear but a finger-worn rosary of platitudes .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 16]: The babe understands the wise and prudent , but is understood only by the babe .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 38]: The Father , then , revealed his things to babes , because the babes were his own little ones , uncorrupted by the wisdom or the care of this world , and therefore able to receive them .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 21]: The others , though his children , had not begun to be like him , therefore could not receive them .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 27]: The Father 's things could not have got anyhow into their minds without leaving all their value , all their spirit , outside the unchildlike place .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 35]: The babes are near enough whence they come , to understand a little how things go in the presence of their father in heaven , and thereby to interpret the words of the Son .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 33]: The child who has not yet ` walked above a mile or two from ' his ` first love , ' is not out of touch with the mind of his Father .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 50]: Quickly will he seal the old bond when the Son himself , the first of the babes , the one perfect babe of God , comes to lead the children out of the lovely ` shadows of eternity ' into the land of the ` white celestial thought . '
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 24]: As God is the one only real father , so is it only to God that any one can be a perfect child .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 8]: In his garden only can childhood blossom .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 72]: The leader of the great array of little ones , himself , in virtue of his firstborn childhood , the first recipient of the revelations of his father , having thus given thanks , and said why he gave thanks , breaks out afresh , renewing expression of delight that God had willed it thus : ` Even so , father , for so it seemed good in thy sight ! '
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 20]: I venture to translate , ` Yea , O Father , for thus came forth satisfaction before thee ! '
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 70]: and think he meant , ` Yea , Father , for thereat were all thy angels filled with satisfaction , ' The babes were the prophets in heaven , and the angels were glad to find it was to be so upon the earth also ; they rejoiced to see that what was bound in heaven , was bound on earth ; that the same principle held in each .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 5]: Compare Matt , xviii .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 8]: 10 and 14 ; also Luke xv .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 2]: 10 .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 78]: ` See that ye despise not one of these little ones ; for I say unto you that their angels in heaven do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven ... Thus it is not the will before your father which is in heaven , ' -- _ among the angels who stand before him _ , I think he means , -- ` that one of these little ones should perish . '
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 27]: ` Even so , I say unto you , there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth . '
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 98]: Having thus thanked his father that he has done after his own ` good and acceptable and perfect will ' , he turns to his disciples , and tells them that he knows the Father , being his Son , and that he only can reveal the Father to the rest of his children : ` All things are delivered unto me of my father ; and no one knoweth the son but the father ; neither knoweth any one the father save the son , and he to whomsoever the son willeth to reveal him . '
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 37]: It is almost as if his mention of the babes brought his thoughts back to himself and his father , between whom lay the secret of all life and all sending -- yea , all loving .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 15]: The relation of the Father and the Son contains the idea of the universe .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 24]: Jesus tells his disciples that his father had no secrets from him ; that he knew the Father as the Father knew him .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 43]: The Son must know the Father ; he only could know him -- and knowing , he could reveal him ; the Son could make the other , the imperfect children , know the Father , and so become such as he .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 38]: All things were given unto him by the Father , because he was the Son of the Father : for the same reason he could reveal the things of the Father to the child of the Father .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 14]: The child-relation is the one eternal , ever enduring , never changing relation .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 51]: Note that , while the Lord here represents the knowledge his father and he have each of the other as limited to themselves , the statement is one of fact only , not of design or intention : his presence in the world is for the removal of that limitation .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 28]: The Father knows the Son and sends him to us that we may know him ; the Son knows the Father , and dies to reveal him .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 18]: The glory of God 's mysteries is -- that they are for his children to look into .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 39]: When the Lord took the little child in the presence of his disciples , and declared him his representative , he made him the representative of his father also ; but the eternal child alone can reveal him .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 25]: To reveal is immeasurably more than to represent ; it is to present to the eyes that know the true when they see it .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 11]: Jesus represented God ; the spirit of Jesus reveals God .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 31]: The represented God a man may refuse ; many refused the Lord ; the revealed God no one can refuse ; to see God and to love him are one .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 17]: He can be revealed only to the child ; perfectly , to the pure child only .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 20]: All the discipline of the world is to make men children , that God may be revealed to them .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 28]: No man , when first he comes to himself , can have any true knowledge of God ; he can only have a desire after such knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 30]: But while he does not know him at all , he can not become in his heart God 's child ; so the Father must draw nearer to him .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 23]: He sends therefore his first born , who does know him , is exactly like him , and can represent him perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 21]: Drawn to him , the children receive him , and then he is able to reveal the Father to them .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 19]: No wisdom of the wise can find out God ; no words of the God-loving can reveal him .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 14]: The simplicity of the whole natural relation is too deep for the philosopher .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 13]: The Son alone can reveal God ; the child alone understand him .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 18]: The elder brother companies with the younger , and makes him yet more a child like himself .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 10]: He interpenetrates his willing companion with his obedient glory .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 22]: He lets him see how he delights in his father , and lets him know that God is his father too .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 40]: He rouses in his little brother the sense of their father 's will ; and the younger , as he hears and obeys , begins to see that his elder brother must be the very image of their father .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 21]: He becomes more and more of a child , and more and more the Son reveals to him the Father .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 32]: For he knows that to know the Father is the one thing needful to every child of the Father , the one thing to fill the divine gulf of his necessity .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 31]: To see the Father is the cry of every child-heart in the universe of the Father -- is the need , where not the cry , of every living soul .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 33]: Comfort yourselves then , brothers and sisters ; he to whom the Son will reveal him shall know the Father ; and the Son came to us that he might reveal him .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 14]: ` Eternal Brother , ' we cry , ` show us the Father .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 13]: Be thyself to us , that in thee we may know him .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 21]: We too are his children : let the other children share with thee in the things of the Father . '
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 61]: Having spoken to his father first , and now to his disciples , the Lord turns to the whole world , and lets his heart overflow : -- St Matthew alone has saved for us the eternal cry : -- ` Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest . '
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 22]: -- ' I know the Father ; come then to me , all ye that labour and are heavy laden . '
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 29]: He does not here call those who want to know the Father ; his cry goes far beyond them ; it reaches to the ends of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 31]: He calls those who are weary ; those who do not know that ignorance of the Father is the cause of all their labour and the heaviness of their burden .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 18]: ` Come unto me , ' he says , ` and I will give you rest . '
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 65]: This is the Lord 's own form of his gospel , more intensely personal and direct , at the same time of yet wider inclusion , than that which , at Nazareth , he appropriated from Isaiah ; differing from it also in this , that it is interfused with strongest persuasion to the troubled to enter into and share his own eternal rest .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 9]: I will turn his argument a little . '
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 9]: I have rest because I know the Father .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 26]: Be meek and lowly of heart toward him as I am ; let him lay his yoke upon you as he lays it on me .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 9]: I do his will , not my own .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 26]: Take on you the yoke that I wear ; be his child like me ; become a babe to whom he can reveal his wonders .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 29]: Then shall you too find rest to your souls ; you shall have the same peace I have ; you will be weary and heavy laden no more .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 11]: I find my yoke easy , my burden light . '
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 71]: We must not imagine that , when the Lord says , ` Take my yoke upon you , ' he means a yoke which he lays on those that come to him ; ` my yoke ' is the yoke he wears himself , the yoke his father lays upon him , the yoke out of which , that same moment , he speaks , bearing it with glad patience .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 20]: ` You must take on you the yoke I have taken : the Father lays it upon us . '
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 16]: The best of the good wine remains ; I have kept it to the last .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 34]: A friend pointed out to me that the Master does not mean we must take on us a yoke like his ; we must take on us the very yoke he is carrying .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 90]: Dante , describing how , on the first terrace of Purgatory , he walked stooping , to be on a level with Oderisi , who went bowed to the ground by the ponderous burden of the pride he had cherished on earth , says -- ' I went walking with this heavy-laden soul , just as oxen walk in the yoke ' : this picture almost always comes to me with the words of the Lord , ` Take my yoke upon you , and learn of me . '
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 24]: Their intent is , ` Take the other end of my yoke , doing as I do , being as I am . '
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 37]: Think of it a moment : -- to walk in the same yoke with the Son of Man , doing the same labour with him , and having the same feeling common to him and us !
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 53]: This , and nothing else , is offered the man who would have rest to his soul ; is required of the man who would know the Father ; is by the Lord pressed upon him to whom he would give the same peace which pervades and sustains his own eternal heart .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 17]: But a yoke is for drawing withal : what load is it the Lord is drawing ?
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 14]: Wherewith is the cart laden which he would have us help him draw ?
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 13]: With what but the will of the eternal , the perfect Father ?
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 29]: How should the Father honour the Son , but by giving him his will to embody in deed , by making him hand to his father 's heart !
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 12]: -- and hardest of all , in bringing home his children !
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 10]: Specially in drawing this load must his yoke-fellow share .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 16]: How to draw it , he must learn of him who draws by his side .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 62]: Whoever , in the commonest duties that fall to him , does as the Father would have him do , bears His yoke along with Jesus ; and the Father takes his help for the redemption of the world -- for the deliverance of men from the slavery of their own rubbish-laden waggons , into the liberty of God 's husbandmen .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 41]: Bearing the same yoke with Jesus , the man learns to walk step for step with him , drawing , drawing the cart laden with the will of the father of both , and rejoicing with the joy of Jesus .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 54]: The glory of existence is to take up its burden , and exist for Existence eternal and supreme -- for the Father who does his divine and perfect best to impart his glad life to us , making us sharers of that nature which is bliss , and that labour which is peace .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 11]: He lives for us ; we must live for him .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 24]: The little ones must take their full share in the great Father 's work : his work is the business of the family .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 26]: Starts thy soul , trembles thy brain at the thought of such a burden as the will of the eternally creating , eternally saving God ?
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 27]: ` How shall mortal man walk in such a yoke , ' sayest thou , ` even with the Son of God bearing it also ? '
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 23]: Why , brother , sister , it is the only burden bearable -- the only burden that can be borne of mortal !
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 21]: Under any other , the lightest , he must at last sink outworn , his very soul gray with sickness !
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 52]: He on whom lay the other half of the burden of God , the weight of his creation to redeem , says , ` The yoke I bear is easy ; the burden I draw is light ' ; and this he said , knowing the death he was to die .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 30]: The yoke did not gall his neck , the burden did not overstrain his sinews , neither did the goal on Calvary fright him from the straight way thither .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 23]: He had the will of the Father to work out , and that will was his strength as well as his joy .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 9]: He had the same will as his father .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 23]: To him the one thing worth living for , was the share the love of his father gave him in his work .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 17]: He loved his father even to the death of the cross , and eternally beyond it .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 55]: When we give ourselves up to the Father as the Son gave himself , we shall not only find our yoke easy and our burden light , but that they communicate ease and lightness ; not only will they not make us weary , but they will give us rest from all other weariness .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 28]: Let us not waste a moment in asking how this can be ; the only way to know that , is to take the yoke on us .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 18]: That rest is a secret for every heart to know , for never a tongue to tell .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 9]: Only by having it can we know it .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 39]: If it seem impossible to take the yoke on us , let us attempt the impossible ; let us lay hold of the yoke , and bow our heads , and try to get our necks under it .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 14]: Giving our Father the opportunity , he will help and not fail us .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 39]: He is helping us every moment , when least we think we need his help ; when most we think we do , then may we most boldly , as most earnestly we must , cry for it .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 46]: What or how much his creatures can do or bear , God only understands ; but when most it seems impossible to do or bear , we must be most confident that he will neither demand too much , nor fail with the vital creator-help .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 18]: That help will be there when wanted -- that is , the moment it can be help .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 18]: To be able beforehand to imagine ourselves doing or bearing , we have neither claim nor need .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 38]: It is vain to think that any weariness , however caused , any burden , however slight , may be got rid of otherwise than by bowing the neck to the yoke of the Father 's will .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 15]: There can be no other rest for heart and soul that he has created .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 29]: From every burden , from every anxiety , from all dread of shame or loss , even loss of love itself , that yoke will set us free .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 65]: These words of the Lord -- so many as are reported in common by St Matthew and St Luke , namely his thanksgiving , and his statement concerning the mutual knowledge of his father and himself , meet me like a well known face unexpectedly encountered : they come to me like a piece of heavenly bread cut from the gospel of St John .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 33]: The words are not in that gospel , and in St Matthew 's and St Luke 's there is nothing more of the kind -- in St Mark 's nothing like them .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 36]: The passage seems to me just one solitary flower testifying to the presence in the gospels of Matthew and Luke of the same root of thought and feeling which everywhere blossoms in that of John .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 47]: It looks as if it had crept out of the fourth gospel into the first and third , and seems a true sign , though no proof , that , however much the fourth be unlike the other gospels , they have all the same origin .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 22]: Some disciple was able to remember one such word of which the promised comforter brought many to the remembrance of John .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 46]: I do not see how the more phenomenal gospels are ever to be understood , save through a right perception of the relation in which the Lord stands to his father , which relation is the main subject of the gospel according to St John .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 43]: As to the loving cry of the great brother to the whole weary world which Matthew alone has set down , I seem aware of a certain indescribable individuality in its tone , distinguishing it from all his other sayings on record .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 43]: Those who come at the call of the Lord , and take the rest he offers them , learning of him , and bearing the yoke of the Father , are the salt of the earth , the light of the world .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 10]: _ THE SALT AND THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 25]: _ ` Ye are the salt of the earth ; but if the salt have lost his savour , wherewith shall it be salted ?
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 22]: It is thenceforth good for nothing , but to be cast out , and to be trodden under foot of men .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 8]: Ye are the light of the world .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 14]: A city that is set on an hill , can not be hid .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 31]: Neither do men light a candle , and put it under a bushel , but on a candlestick , and it giveth light unto all that are in the house .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 26]: Let your light so shine before men , that they may see your good works , and glorify your father which is in heaven . '
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 9]: -- _ Matthew _ v. 3 -- 16 .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 34]: The Lord knew these men , and had their hearts in his hand ; else would he have told them they were the salt of the earth and the light of the world ?
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 38]: They were in danger , it is true , of pluming themselves on what he had said of them , of taking their importance to their own credit , and seeing themselves other than God saw them .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 41]: Yet the Lord does not hesitate to call his few humble disciples the salt of the earth ; and every century since has borne witness that such indeed they were -- that he spoke of them but the simple fact .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 14]: Where would the world be now but for their salt and their light !
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 53]: The world that knows neither their salt nor their light may imagine itself now at least greatly retarded by the long-drawn survival of their influences ; but such as have chosen aspiration and not ambition , will cry , But for those men , whither should we at this moment be bound !
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 39]: Their Master set them to be salt against corruption , and light against darkness ; and our souls answer and say , Lord , they have been the salt , they have been the light of the world !
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 20]: No sooner has he used the symbol of the salt , than the Lord proceeds to supplement its incompleteness .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 24]: They were salt which must remember that it is salt ; which must live salt , and choose salt , and be salt .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 28]: For the whole worth of salt lies in its being salt ; and all the saltness of the moral salt lies in the will to be salt .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 24]: To lose its saltness , then , is to cease to exist , save as a vile thing whose very being is unjustifiable .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 9]: What is to be done with saltless salt !
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 13]: -- with such as would teach religion , and know not God !
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 26]: Having thus carried the figure as far as it will serve him , the Master changes it for another , which he can carry farther .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 17]: For salt only preserves from growing bad ; it does not cause anything to grow better .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 14]: His disciples are the salt of the world , but they are more .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 58]: Therefore , having warned the human salt to look to itself that it be indeed salt , he proceeds : ` Ye are the light of the world , a city , a candle , ' and so resumes his former path of persuasion and enforcement : ` It is so , therefore make it so . '
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 15]: -- ` Ye are the salt of the earth ; therefore be salt . '
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 14]: -- ` Ye are the light of the world ; therefore shine . '
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 14]: -- ` Ye are a city ; be seen upon your hill . '
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 15]: -- ` Ye are the Lord 's candles ; let no bushels cover you .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 6]: Let your light shine . '
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 12]: Every disciple of the Lord must be a preacher of righteousness .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 30]: Cities are the best lighted portions of the world ; and perhaps the Lord meant , ` You are a live city , therefore light up your city . '
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 44]: Some connection of the city with light seems probably in his thought , seeing the allusion to the city on the hill comes in the midst of what he says about light in relation to his disciples as the light of the world .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 21]: Anyhow the city is the best circle in which , and the best centre from which to diffuse moral light .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 26]: A man brooding in the desert may find the very light of light , but he must go to the city to let it shine .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 91]: From the general idea of light , however , associated with the city as visible to all the country around , the Lord turns at once , in this probably fragmentary representation of his words , to the homelier , the more individual and personally applicable figure of the lamp : ` Neither do men light a lamp , and put it under a bushel , but on a lampstand , and it giveth light to all that are in the house , ' Here let us meditate a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 10]: For what is a lamp or a man lighted ?
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 10]: For them that need light , therefore for all .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 13]: A candle is not lighted for itself ; neither is a man .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 23]: The light that serves self only , is no true light ; its one virtue is that it will soon go out .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 16]: The bushel needs to be lighted , but not by being put over the lamp .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 30]: The man 's own soul needs to be lighted , but light for itself only , light covered by the bushel , is darkness whether to soul or bushel .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 5]: Light unshared is darkness .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 10]: To be light indeed , it must shine out .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 15]: It is of the very essence of light , that it is for others .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 21]: The thing is true of the spiritual as of the physical light -- of the truth as of its type .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 9]: The lights of the world are live lights .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 21]: The lamp that the Lord kindles is a lamp that can will to shine , a soul that must shine .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 19]: Its true relation to the spirits around it -- to God and its fellows , is its light .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 46]: Then only does it fully shine , when its love , which is its light , shows it to all the souls within its scope , and all those souls to each other , and so does its part to bring all together toward one .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 17]: In the darkness each soul is alone ; in the light the souls are a family .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 34]: Men do not light a lamp to kill it with a bushel , but to set it on a stand , that it may give light to all that are in the house .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 30]: The Lord seems to say , ` So have I lighted you , not that you may shine for yourselves , but that you may give light unto all .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 23]: I have set you like a city on a hill , that the whole earth may see and share in your light .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 29]: Shine therefore ; so shine before men , that they may see your good things and glorify your father for the light with which he has lighted you .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 50]: Take heed to your light that it be such , that it so shine , that in you men may see the Father -- may see your works so good , so plainly his , that they recognize his presence in you , and thank him for you . '
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 38]: There was the danger always of the shadow of the self-bushel clouding the lamp the Father had lighted ; and the moment they ceased to show the Father , the light that was in them was darkness .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 19]: God alone is the light , and our light is the shining of his will in our lives .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 30]: If our light shine at all , it must be , it can be only in showing the Father ; nothing is light that does not bear him witness .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 35]: The man that sees the glory of God , would turn sick at the thought of glorifying his own self , whose one only possible glory is to shine with the glory of God .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 32]: When a man tries to shine from the self that is not one with God and filled with his light , he is but making ready for his own gathering contempt .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 26]: The man who , like his Lord , seeks not his own , but the will of him who sent him , he alone shines .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 30]: He who would shine in the praises of men , will , sooner or later , find himself but a Gideon 's - pitcher left broken on the field .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 27]: Let us bestir ourselves then to keep this word of the Lord ; and to this end inquire how we are to let our light shine .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 37]: To the man who does not try to order his thoughts and feelings and judgments after the will of the Father , I have nothing to say ; he can have no light to let shine .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 53]: For to let our light shine is to see that in every , even the smallest thing , our lives and actions correspond to what we know of God ; that , as the true children of our father in heaven , we do everything as he would have us do it .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 53]: Need I say that to let our light shine is to be just , honourable , true , courteous , more careful over the claim of our neighbour than our own , as knowing ourselves in danger of overlooking it , and not bound to insist on every claim of our own !
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 32]: The man who takes no count of what is fair , friendly , pure , unselfish , lovely , gracious , -- where is his claim to call Jesus his master ?
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 6]: where his claim to Christianity ?
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 9]: What saves his claim from being merest mockery ?
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 35]: The outshining of any human light must be obedience to truth recognized as such ; our first show of light as the Lord 's disciples must be in doing the things he tells us .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 59]: Naturally thus we declare him our master , the ruler of our conduct , the enlightener of our souls ; and while in the doing of his will a man is learning the loveliness of righteousness , he can hardly fail to let some light shine across the dust of his failures , the exhalations from his faults .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 18]: Thus will his disciples shine as lights in the world , holding forth the Word of life .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 32]: To shine , we must keep in his light , sunning our souls in it by thinking of what he said and did , and would have us think and do .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 19]: So shall we drink the light like some diamonds , keep it , and shine in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 29]: Doing his will , men will see in us that we count the world his , hold that his will and not ours must be done in it .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 21]: Our very faces will then shine with the hope of seeing him , and being taken home where he is .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 20]: Only let us remember that trying to look what we ought to be , is the beginning of hypocrisy .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 17]: If we do indeed expect better things to come , we must let our hope appear .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 42]: A Christian who looks gloomy at the mention of death , still more , one who talks of his friends as if he had lost them , turns the bushel of his little-faith over the lamp of the Lord 's light .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 18]: Death is but our visible horizon , and our look ought always to be focussed beyond it .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 13]: We should never talk as if death were the end of anything .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 32]: To let our light shine , we must take care that we have no respect for riches : if we have none , there is no fear of our showing any .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 23]: To treat the poor man with less attention or cordiality than the rich , is to show ourselves the servants of Mammon .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 21]: In like manner we must lay no value on the praise of men , or in any way seek it .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 14]: We must honour no man because of intellect , fame , or success .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 42]: We must not shrink , in fear of the judgment of men , from doing openly what we hold right ; or at all acknowledge as a law-giver what calls itself Society , or harbour the least anxiety for its approval .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 35]: In business , the custom of the trade must be understood by both contracting parties , else it can have no place , either as law or excuse , with the disciple of Jesus .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 17]: The man to whom business is one thing and religion another , is not a disciple .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 31]: If he refuses to harmonize them by making his business religion , he has already chosen Mammon ; if he thinks not to settle the question , it is settled .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 15]: The most futile of all human endeavours is , to serve God and Mammon .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 36]: The man who makes the endeavour , betrays his Master in the temple and kisses him in the garden ; takes advantage of him in the shop , and offers him ` divine service ! '
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 3]: on Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 11]: His very church-going is but a further service of Mammon !
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 29]: But let us waste no strength in despising such men ; let us rather turn the light upon ourselves : are we not in some way denying him ?
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 6]: Is our light bearing witness ?
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 13]: Is it shining before men so that they glorify God for it ?
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 10]: If it does not shine , it is darkness .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 21]: In the darkness which a man takes for light , he will thrust at the heart of the Lord himself .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 26]: He who goes about his everyday duty as the work the Father has given him to do , is he who lets his light shine .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 19]: But such a man will not be content with this : he must yet let his light shine .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 13]: Whatever makes his heart glad , he will have his neighbour share .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 24]: The body is a lantern ; it must not be a dark lantern ; the glowing heart must show in the shining face .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 28]: His glad thought may not be one to impart to his neighbour , but he must not quench the vibration of its gladness ere it reach him .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 28]: What shall we say of him who comes from his closet , his mountain-top , with such a veil over his face as masks his very humanity ?
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 31]: Is it with the Father that man has had communion , whose every movement is self-hampered , and in whose eyes dwell no smiles for the people of his house ?
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 36]: The man who receives the quiet attentions , the divine ministrations , of wife or son or daughter , without token of pleasure , without sign of gratitude , can hardly have been with Jesus .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 17]: Or can he have been with him , and have left him behind in his closet ?
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 22]: If his faith in God take from a man his cheerfulness , how shall the face of a man ever shine ?
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 15]: And why are they always glad before the face of the Father in heaven ?
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 45]: It is true that pain or inward grief may blameless banish all smiling , but even heaviness of heart has no right so to tumble the bushel over the lamp that no ray can get out to tell that love is yet burning within .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 25]: The man must at least let his dear ones know that something else than displeasure with them is the cause of his clouded countenance .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 29]: What a sweet colour the divine light takes to itself in courtesy , whose perfection is the recognition of every man as a temple of the living God .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 27]: Sorely ruined , sadly defiled the temple may be , but if God had left it , it would be a heap and not a house .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 13]: Next to love , specially will the light shine out in fairness .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 28]: What light can he have in him who is always on his own side , and will never descry reason or right on that of his adversary ?
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 23]: And certainly , if he that showeth mercy , as well he that showeth justice , ought to do it with cheerfulness .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 24]: But if all our light shine out , and none of our darkness , shall we not be in utmost danger of hypocrisy ?
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 34]: Yes , if we but hide our darkness , and do not strive to slay it with our light : what way have we to show it , while struggling to destroy it ?
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 13]: Only when we cherish evil , is there hypocrisy in hiding it .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 29]: A man who is honestly fighting it and showing it no quarter , is already conqueror in Christ , or will soon be -- and more than innocent .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 29]: But our good feelings , those that make for righteousness and unity , we ought to let shine ; they claim to commune with the light in others .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 24]: Many parents hold words unsaid which would lift hundred-weights from the hearts of their children , yea , make them leap for joy .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 20]: A stern father and a silent mother make mournful , or , which is far worse , hard children .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 33]: Need I add that , if any one , hearing the injunction to let his light shine , makes himself shine instead , it is because the light is not in him !
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 34]: But what shall I say of such as , in the name of religion , let only their darkness out -- the darkness of worshipped opinion , the darkness of lip-honour and disobedience !
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 34]: Such are those who tear asunder the body of Christ with the explosives of dispute , on the plea of such a unity as alone they can understand , namely a paltry uniformity .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 45]: What have not the ` good church-man ' and the ` strong dissenter ' to answer for , who , hiding what true light they have , if indeed they have any , each under the bushel of his party-spirit , radiate only repulsion !
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 23]: There is no schism , none whatever , in using diverse forms of thought or worship : true honesty is never schismatic .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 63]: The real schismatic is the man who turns away love and justice from the neighbour who holds theories in religious philosophy , or as to church-constitution , different from his own ; who denies or avoids his brother because he follows not with him ; who calls him a schismatic because he prefers this or that mode of public worship not his .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 15]: The other _ may _ be schismatic ; he himself certainly _ is _ .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 24]: He walks in the darkness of opinion , not in the light of life , not in the faith which worketh by love .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 16]: Worst of all is division in the name of Christ who came to make one .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 96]: Neither Paul nor Apollos nor Cephas would -- least of all will Christ be the leader of any party save that of his own elect , the party of love -- of love which suffereth long and is kind ; which envieth not , is not puffed up , doth not behave itself unseemly , seeketh not its own , is not easily provoked , thinketh no evil , rejoiceth not in iniquity , but rejoiceth in the truth , beareth all things , believeth all things , hopeth all things , endureth all things .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 51]: ` Let your light shine , ' says the Lord : -- if I have none , the call can not apply to me ; but I must bethink me , lest , in the night I am cherishing about me , the Lord come upon me like a thief .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 42]: There may be those , however , and I think they are numerous , who , having some , or imagining they have much light , yet have not enough to know the duty of letting it shine on their neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 36]: The Lord would have his men so alive with his light , that it should for ever go flashing from each to all , and all , with eternal response , keep glorifying the Father .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 20]: Dost thou look for a good time coming , friend , when thou shalt know as thou art known ?
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 12]: Let the joy of thy hope stream forth upon thy neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 10]: Fold them round in that which maketh thyself glad .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 9]: Let thy nature grow more expansive and communicative .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 15]: Look like the man thou art -- a man who knows something very good .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 30]: Thou believest thyself on the way to the heart of things : walk so , shine so , that all that see thee shall want to go with thee .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 36]: What light issues from such as make their faces long at the very name of death , and look and speak as if it were the end of all things and the worst of evils ?
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 65]: Jesus told his men not to fear death ; told them his friends should go to be with him ; told them they should live in the house of his father and their father ; and since then he has risen himself from the tomb , and gone to prepare a place for them : who , what are these miserable refusers of comfort ?
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 5]: Not Christians , surely !
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 8]: Oh , yes , they are Christians !
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 43]: ` They are gone , ' they say , ` to be for ever with the Lord ; ' and then they weep and lament , and seem more afraid of starting to join them than of aught else under the sun !
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 13]: To the last attainable moment they cling to what they call life .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 12]: They are children -- were there ever any other such children ?
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 20]: -- who hang crying to the skirts of their mother , and will not be lifted to her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 16]: They are not of Paul 's mind : to be with Him is not better !
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 22]: They worship their physician ; and their prayer to the God of their life is to spare them from more life .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 7]: What sort of Christians are they ?
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 5]: Where shines their light ?
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 15]: Alas for thee , poor world , hadst thou no better lights than these !
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 27]: You who have light , show yourselves the sons and daughters of Light , of God , of Hope -- the heirs of a great completeness .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 6]: Freely let your light shine .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 18]: Only take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men , to be seen of them .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 8]: _ THE RIGHT HAND AND THE LEFT .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 69]: _ Take heed that ye do not your righteousness before men to be seen of them ; otherwise ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven ... But when thou doest alms , let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth ; that thine alms may be in secret ; and thy father which seeth in secret , himself shall reward thee .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 6]: -- _ Matthew _ vi .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 3]: I ,3 .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 20]: Let your light out freely , that men may see it , but not that men may see you .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 117]: If I do anything , not because it has to be done , not because God would have it so , not that I may do right , not because it is honest , not that I love the thing , not that I may be true to my Lord , not that the truth may be recognized as truth and as his , but that I may be seen as the doer , that I may be praised of men , that I may gain repute or fame ; be the thing itself ever so good , I may look to men for my reward , for there is none for me with the Father .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 99]: If , that light being my pleasure , I do it that the light may shine , and that men may know _ the _ Light , the father of lights , I do well ; but if I do it that I may be seen shining , that the light may be noted as emanating from me and not from another , then am I of those that seek glory of men , and worship Satan ; the light that through me may possibly illuminate others , will , in me and for me , be darkness .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 20]: _ But when thou doest alms , let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth _ .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 22]: How , then , am I to let my light shine , if I take pains to hide what I do ?
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 19]: The injunction is not to hide what you do from others , but to hide it from yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 30]: The Master would have you not plume yourself upon it , not cherish the thought that you have done it , or confer with yourself in satisfaction over it .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 9]: You must not count it to your praise .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 11]: A man must not desire to be satisfied with himself .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 13]: His right hand must not seek the praise of his left hand .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 8]: His doing must not invite his after-thinking .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 15]: The right hand must let the thing done go , as a thing done-with .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 24]: We must meditate nothing either as a fine thing for us to do , or a fine thing for us to have done .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 30]: We must not imagine any merit in us : it would be to love a lie , for we can have none ; there is no such thing possible .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 14]: Is there anything to be proud of in refusing to worship the devil ?
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 17]: Is it a grand thing , is it a meritorious thing , not to be vile ?
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 11]: When we have done all , we are unprofitable servants .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 7]: Our very best is but decent .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 6]: What more could it be ?
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 9]: Why then think of it as anything more ?
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 17]: What things could we or any one do , worthy of being brooded over as possessions .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 16]: Good to do , they were ; bad to pride ourselves upon , they are .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 24]: Why should a man meditate with satisfaction on having denied himself some selfish indulgence , any more than on having washed his hands ?
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 16]: May we roll the rejection of a villainy as a sweet morsel under our tongues ?
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 40]: They were the worst villains of all who could be proud of not having committed a villainy ; and their pride would but render them the more capable of the villainy , when next the temptation to it came .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 38]: Even if our supposed merit were of the positive order , and we did every duty perfectly , the moment we began to pride ourselves upon the fact , we should drop into a hell of worthlessness .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 10]: What are we for but to do our duty ?
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 23]: We must do it , and think nothing of ourselves for that , neither care what men think of us for anything .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 13]: With the praise or blame of men we have nought to do .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 14]: Their blame may be a good thing , their praise can not be .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 16]: But the worst sort of the praise of men is the praise we give ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 10]: We must do nothing to be seen of ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 24]: We must seek no approbation even , but that of God , else we shut the door of the kingdom from the outside .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 10]: His approbation will but quicken our sense of unworthiness .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 15]: seek the praise of men for being fair to our own brothers and sisters ?
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 20]: seek the praise of God for laying our hearts at the feet of him to whom we utterly belong ?
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 33]: There is no pride so mean -- and all pride is absolutely , essentially mean -- as the pride of being holier than our fellow , except the pride of being holy .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 6]: Such imagined holiness is foulness .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 28]: Religion itself in the hearts of the unreal , is a dead thing ; what seems life in it , is the vermiculate life of a corpse .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 90]: There is one word in the context , as we have it in the authorized version , that used to trouble me , seeming to make its publicity a portion of the reward for doing certain right things in secret : I mean the word _ openly _ , at the ends of the fourth , the sixth , and the eighteenth verses , making the Lord seem to say , ` Avoid the praise of men , and thou shalt at length have the praise of men . '
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 16]: -- ` Thy father , which seeth in secret , shall reward thee openly . '
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 9]: _ Thy reward shall be seen of men !
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 10]: and thou seen as the receiver of the reward !
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 17]: _ In what other way could the word , then or now , be fairly understood ?
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 46]: It must be the interpolation of some Jew scribe , who , even after learning a little of the Christ , continued unable to conceive as reward anything that did not draw part at least of its sweetness from the gazing eyes of the multitude .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 29]: Glad was I to find that the word is not in the best manuscripts ; and God be thanked that it is left out in the revised version .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 12]: What shall we think of the daring that could interpolate it !
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 16]: But of like sort is the daring of much exposition of the Master 's words .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 23]: What men have not faith enough to receive , they will still dilute to the standard of their own faculty of reception .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 25]: If any one say , ` Why did the Lord let the word remain there so long , if he never said it ? '
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 39]: I answer : Perhaps that the minds of his disciples might be troubled at its presence , arise against it , and do him right by casting it out -- and so Wisdom be justified of her children .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 61]: But there are some who , if the notion of reward is not naturally a trouble to them , yet have come to feel it such , because of the words of certain objectors who think to take a higher stand than the Christian , saying the idea of reward for doing right is a low , an unworthy idea .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 67]: Now , verily , it would be a low thing for any child to do his father 's will in the hope that his father would reward him for it ; but it is quite another thing for a father whose child endeavours to please him , to let him know that he recognizes his childness toward him , and will be fatherly good to him .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 41]: What kind of a father were the man who , because there could be no merit or desert in doing well , would not give his child a smile or a pleased word when he saw him trying his best ?
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 17]: Would not such acknowledgment from the father be the natural correlate of the child 's behaviour ?
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 16]: and what would the father 's smile be but the perfect reward of the child ?
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 60]: Suppose the father to love the child so that he wants to give him everything , but dares not until his character is developed : must he not be glad , and show his gladness , at every shade of a progress that will at length set him free to throne his son over all that he has ? '
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 48]: I am an unprofitable servant , ' says the man who has done his duty ; but his lord , coming unexpectedly , and finding him at his post , girds himself , and makes him sit down to meat , and comes forth and serves him .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 28]: How could the divine order of things , founded for growth and gradual betterment , hold and proceed without the notion of return for a thing done ?
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 9]: Must there be only current and no tide ?
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 23]: How can we be workers with God at his work , and he never say ` Thank you , my child ' ?
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 11]: Will he take joy in his success and give none ?
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 18]: Is he the husbandman to take all the profit , and muzzle the mouth of his ox ?
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 30]: When a man does work for another , he has his wages for it , and society exists by the dependence of man upon man through work and wages .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 59]: The devil is not the inventor of this society ; he has invented the notion of a certain degradation in work , a still greater in wages ; and following this up , has constituted a Society after his own likeness , which despises work , leaves it undone , and so can claim its wages without disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 38]: If you say , ` No one ought to do right for the sake of reward , ' I go farther and say , ` No man _ can _ do right for the sake of reward .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 45]: A man may do a thing indifferent , he may do a thing wrong , for the sake of reward ; but a thing in itself right , done for reward , would , in the very doing , cease to be right . '
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 38]: At the same time , if a man does right , he can not escape being rewarded for it ; and to refuse the reward , would be to refuse life , and foil the creative love .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 11]: The whole question is of the kind of reward expected .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 12]: What first reward for doing well , may I look for ?
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 17]: To grow purer in heart , and stronger in the hope of at length seeing God .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 14]: If a man be not after this fashion rewarded , he must perish .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 71]: As to happiness or any lower rewards that naturally follow the first -- is God to destroy the law of his universe , the divine sequence of cause and effect in order to say : ` You must do well , but you shall gain no good by it ; you must lead a dull joyless existence to all eternity , that lack of delight may show you pure ' ?
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 9]: Could Love create with such end in view ?
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 19]: Righteousness does not demand creation ; it is Love , not Righteousness , that can not live alone .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 14]: The creature must already be , ere Righteousness can put in a claim .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 24]: But , hearts and souls there , Love itself , which created for love and joy , presses the demand of Righteousness first .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 19]: A righteousness that created misery in order to up-hold itself , would be a righteousness that was unrighteous .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 14]: God will die for righteousness , but never create for a joyless righteousness .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 20]: To call into being the necessarily and hopelessly incomplete , would be to wrong creation in its very essence .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 57]: To create for the knowledge of himself , and then not give himself , would be injustice even to cruelty ; and if God give himself , what other reward -- there can be no _ further _ -- is not included , seeing he is Life and all her children -- the All in all ?
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 30]: It will take the utmost joy God can give , to let men know him ; and what man , knowing him , would mind losing every other joy ?
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 17]: Only what other joy could keep from entering , where the God of joy already dwelt ?
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 33]: The law of the universe holds , and will hold , the name of the Father be praised : -- ` Whatsoever a man soweth , that shall he also reap . '
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 15]: ` They have sown the wind , and they shall reap the whirlwind . '
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 32]: ` He that soweth to his flesh , shall of the flesh reap corruption ; but he that soweth to the spirit , shall of the spirit reap life everlasting . '
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 34]: ` Whosoever hath , to him shall be given , and he shall have more abundance ; but whosoever hath not , from him shall be taken away even that he hath . '
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 21]: To object to Christianity as selfish , is utter foolishness ; Christianity alone gives any hope of deliverance from selfishness .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 8]: Is it selfish to desire to love ?
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 13]: Is it selfish to hope for purity and the sight of God ?
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 16]: What better can we do for our neighbour than to become altogether righteous toward him ?
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 20]: Will he not be the nearer sharing in the exceeding great reward of a return to the divine idea ?
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 30]: Where is the evil toward God , where the wrong to my neighbour , if I think sometimes of the joys to follow in the train of perfect loving ?
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 38]: Is not the atmosphere of God , love itself , the very breath of the Father , wherein can float no thinnest pollution of selfishness , the only material wherewithal to build the airy castles of heaven ?
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 29]: ` Creator , ' the childlike heart might cry , ` give me all the wages , all the reward thy perfect father-heart can give thy unmeriting child .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 22]: My fit wages may be pain , sorrow , humiliation of soul : I stretch out my hands to receive them .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 31]: Thy reward will be to lift me out of the mire of self-love , and bring me nearer to thyself and thy children : welcome , divinest of good things !
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 46]: Thy highest reward is thy purest gift ; thou didst make me for it from the first ; thou , the eternal life , hast been labouring still to fit me for receiving it -- the vision , the knowledge , the possession of thyself .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 24]: I can seek but what thou waitest and watchest to give : I would be such into whom thy love can flow . '
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 49]: It seems to me that the only merit that could live before God , is the merit of Jesus -- who of himself , at once , untaught , unimplored , laid himself aside , and turned to the Father , refusing his life save in the Father .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 20]: Like God , of himself he chose righteousness , and so merited to sit on the throne of God .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 46]: In the same spirit he gave himself afterward to his father 's children , and merited the power to transfuse the life-redeeming energy of his spirit into theirs : made perfect , he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 36]: But it is a word of little daring , that Jesus had no thought of merit in what he did -- that he saw only what he had to be , what he must do .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 25]: -- I speak after the poor fashion of a man lost in what is too great for him , yet is his very life .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 35]: -- Where can be a man 's merit in refusing to go down to an abyss of loss -- loss of the right to be , loss of his father , loss of himself ?
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 28]: Would Satan , with all the instincts and impulses of his origin in him , have _ merited _ eternal life by refusing to be a devil ?
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 27]: Not the less would he have had eternal life ; not the less would he have been wrapt in the love and confidence of the Father .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 7]: He would have had his reward .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 13]: I can not imagine thing created meriting aught save by divine courtesy .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 29]: I suspect the notion of merit belongs to a low development , and the higher a man rises , the less will he find it worth a thought .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 27]: Perhaps we shall come to see that it owes what being it has , to man , that it is a thing thinkable only by man .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 29]: I suspect it is not a thought of the eternal mind , and has in itself no existence , being to God merely a thing thought by man .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 19]: For merit lives from man to man , And not from man , O Lord , to thee .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 38]: The man , then , who does right , and seeks no praise from men , while he merits nothing , shall be rewarded by his Father , and his reward will be right precious to him .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 37]: We must let our light shine , make our faith , our hope , our love , manifest -- that men may praise , not us for shining , but the Father for creating the light .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 61]: No man with faith , hope , love , alive in his soul , could make the divine possessions a show to gain for himself the admiration of men : not the less must they appear in our words , in our looks , in our carriage -- above all , in honourable , unselfish , hospitable , helpful deeds .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 49]: Our light must shine in cheerfulness , in joy , yea , where a man has the gift , in merriment ; in freedom from care save for one another , in interest in the things of others , in fearlessness and tenderness , in courtesy and graciousness .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 13]: In our anger and indignation , specially , must our light shine .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 19]: But we must give no quarter to the most shadowy thought of how this or that will look .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 15]: From the faintest thought of the praise of men , we must turn away .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 12]: No man can be the disciple of Christ and desire fame .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 12]: To desire fame is ignoble ; it is a beggarly greed .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 13]: In the noble mind , it is the more of an infirmity .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 11]: There is no aspiration in it -- nothing but ambition .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 12]: It is simply selfishness that would be proud if it could .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 43]: Fame is the applause of the many , and the judgment of the many is foolish ; therefore the greater the fame , the more is the foolishness that swells it , and the worse is the foolishness that longs after it .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 8]: Aspiration is the sole escape from ambition .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 32]: He who aspires -- that is , does his endeavour to rise above himself -- neither lusts to be higher than his neighbour , nor seeks to mount in his opinion .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 19]: What light there is in him shines the more that he does nothing to be seen of men .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 16]: He stands in the mist between the gulf and the glory , and looks upward .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 13]: He loves not his own soul , but longs to be clean .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 18]: Out of the gulf into the glory , Father , my soul cries out to be lifted .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 15]: Dark is the woof of my dismal story , Thorough thy sun-warp stormily drifted !
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 17]: -- Out of the gulf into the glory , Lift me , and save my story .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 17]: I have done many things merely shameful ; I am a man ashamed , my father !
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 20]: My life is ashamed and broken and blameful -- The broken and blameful , oh , cleanse and gather !
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 10]: Heartily shame me , Lord , of the shameful !
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 9]: To my judge I flee with my blameful .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 19]: Saviour , at peace in thy perfect purity , Think what it is , not to be pure !
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 16]: Strong in thy love 's essential security , Think upon those who are never secure .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 18]: Full fill my soul with the light of thy purity ; Fold me in love 's security .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 39]: O Father , O Brother , my heart is sore aching Help it to ache as much as is needful ; Is it you cleansing me , mending , remaking , Dear potter-hands , so tender and heedful ?
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 21]: Sick of my past , of my own self aching -- Hurt on , dear hands , with your making .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 39]: Proud of the form thou hadst given thy vessel , Proud of myself , I forgot my donor ; Down in the dust I began to nestle , Poured thee no wine , and drank deep of dishonour !
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 11]: Lord , thou hast broken , thou mendest thy vessel !
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 9]: In the dust of thy glory I nestle .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 19]: O Lord , the earnest expectation of thy creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 7]: _ THE HOPE OF THE UNIVERSE .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 18]: _ For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 6]: -- _ Romans _ viii .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 2]: 19 .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 29]: Let us try , through these words , to get at the idea in St Paul 's mind for which they stand , and have so long stood .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 31]: It can be no worthless idea they represent -- no mere platitude , which a man , failing to understand it at once , may without loss leave behind him .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 18]: The words mean something which Paul believes vitally associated with the life and death of his Master .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 81]: He had seen Jesus with his bodily eyes , I think , but he had not seen him with those alone ; he had seen and saw him with the real eyes , the eyes that do not see except they understand ; and the sight of him had uplifted his whole nature -- first his pure will for righteousness , and then his hoping imagination ; and out of these , in the knowledge of Jesus , he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 50]: The letters he has left behind him , written in the power of this uplifting , have waked but poor ideas in poor minds ; for words , if they seem to mean anything , must always seem to mean something within the scope of the mind hearing them .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 38]: Words can not convey the thought of a thinker to a no-thinker ; of a largely aspiring and self-discontented soul , to a creature satisfied with his poverty , and counting his meagre faculty the human standard .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 23]: Neither will they readily reveal the mind of one old in thought , to one who has but lately begun to think .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 52]: The higher the reader 's notion of what St Paul intends -- the higher the idea , that is , which his words wake in him , the more likely is it to be the same which moved the man who had seen Jesus , and was his own no more .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 22]: If a man err in his interpretation , it will hardly be by attributing to his words an intent too high .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 24]: First then , what does Paul , the slave of Christ , intend by ` the creature ' or ` the creation ' ?
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 31]: If he means the _ visible world _ , he did not surely , and without saying so , mean to exclude the noblest part of it -- the sentient !
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 33]: If he did , it is doubly strange that he should immediately attribute not merely sense , but conscious sense , to that part , the insentient , namely , which remained .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 33]: If you say he does so but by a figure of speech , I answer that a figure that meant less than it said -- and how much less would not this ?
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 12]: -- would be one altogether unworthy of the Lord 's messenger .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 76]: First , I repeat , to exclude the sentient from the term common to both in the word _ creation _ or _ creature _ -- and then to attribute the capabilities of the sentient to the insentient , as a mere figure to express the hopes of men with regard to the perfecting of the insentient for the comfort of men , were a violence as unfit in rhetoric as in its own nature .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 58]: Take another part of the same utterance : ` For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now : ' is it not manifest that to interpret such words as referring to the mere imperfections of the insensate material world , would be to make of the phrase a worthless hyperbole ?
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 80]: I am inclined to believe the apostle regarded the whole visible creation as , in far differing degrees of consciousness , a live outcome from the heart of the living one , who is all and in all : such view , at the same time , I do not care to insist upon ; I only care to argue that the word _ creature _ or _ creation _ must include everything in creation that has sentient life .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 106]: That I should in the class include a greater number of phenomena than a reader may be prepared to admit , will nowise affect the force of what I have to say , seeing my point is simply this : that in the term _ creation _ , Paul comprises all creatures capable of suffering ; the condition of which sentient , therefore superior portion , gives him occasion to speak of the whole creation as suffering in the process of its divine evolution or development , groaning and travailing as in the pangs of giving birth to a better self , a nobler world .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 29]: It is not necessary to the idea that the creation should know what it is groaning after , or wherein the higher condition constituting its deliverance must consist .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 30]: The human race groans for deliverance : how much does the race know that its redemption lies in becoming one with the Father , and partaking of his glory ?
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 47]: Here and there one of the race knows it -- which is indeed a pledge for the race -- but the race can not be said to know its own lack , or to have even a far-off notion of what alone can stay its groaning .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 50]: In like manner the whole creation is groaning after an unforeseen yet essential birth -- groans with the necessity of being freed from a state that is but a transitional and not a true one , from a condition that nowise answers to the intent in which existence began .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 47]: In both the lower creation and the higher , this same groaning of the fettered idea after a freer life , seems the first enforced decree of a holy fate , and itself the first movement of the hampered thing toward the liberty of another birth .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 100]: To believe that God made many of the lower creatures merely for prey , or to be the slaves of a slave , and writhe under the tyrannies of a cruel master who will not serve his own master ; that he created and is creating an endless succession of them to reap little or no good of life but its cessation -- a doctrine held by some , and practically accepted by multitudes -- is to believe in a God who , so far as one portion at least of his creation is concerned , is a demon .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 34]: But a creative demon is an absurdity ; and were such a creator possible , he would not be God , but must one day be found and destroyed by the real God .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 38]: Not the less the fact remains , that miserable suffering abounds among them , and that , even supposing God did not foresee how creation would turn out for them , the thing lies at his door .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 41]: He has besides made them so far dumb that they can not move the hearts of the oppressors into whose hands he has given them , telling how hard they find the world , how sore their life in it .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 24]: The apostle takes up their case , and gives us material for an answer to such as blame God for their sad condition .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 68]: There are many , I suspect , who from the eighth chapter of St Paul 's epistle to the Romans , gather this much and no more : -- that the lower animals alive at the coming of the Lord , whensoever that may be , will thenceforward , with such as thereafter may come into existence , lead a happy life for the time allotted them !
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 9]: Strong champions of God , these profound believers !
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 32]: What lovers of life , what disciples of St Paul , nay , what disciples of Jesus , to whom such a gloss is consolation for the moans of a universe !
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 19]: Truly , the furnace of affliction they would extinguish thus , casts out the more an evil odour !
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 40]: For all the creatures who through ages of misery have groaned and travailed and died , to these mild Christians it is enough that they are dead , therefore , as they would argue , out of it now !
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 38]: ` It is well with them , ' I seem to hear such say ; ` they are mercifully dealt with ; their sufferings are over ; they had not to live on for ever in oppression .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 20]: The God of their life has taken from them their past , and troubles them with no future ! '
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 15]: It is true this were no small consolation concerning such as are gone away !
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 10]: Surely rest is better than ceaseless toil and pain !
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 18]: But what shall we say of such a heedless God as those Christians are content to worship !
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 6]: Is he a merciful God ?
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 6]: Is he a loving God ?
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 16]: How shall he die to escape the remorse of the authorship of so much misery ?
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 35]: Our pity turns from the dead creature to the live creator who could live and know himself the maker of so many extinguished hearts , whose friend was -- not he , but Death .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 16]: Blessed be the name of the Father of Jesus , there is no such creator !
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 39]: Be we have not to do with the dead only ; there are those which live and suffer : is there no comfort concerning them , but that they too shall at length die and leave their misery ?
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 30]: And what shall we say of those coming , and yet to come and pass -- evermore issuing from the fountain of life , daily born into evil things ?
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 40]: Will the consolation that they will soon die , suffice for the heart of the child who laments over his dead bird or rabbit , and would fain love that father in heaven who keeps on making the creatures ?
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 19]: Alas , they are crowding in ; they can not help themselves ; their misery is awaiting them !
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 53]: Would those Christians have me believe in a God who differentiates creatures from himself , only that they may be the prey of other creatures , or spend a few hours or years , helpless and lonely , speechless and without appeal , in merciless hands , then pass away into nothingness ?
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 14]: I will not ; in the name of Jesus , I will not .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 23]: Had he not known something better , would he have said what he did about the father of men and the sparrows ?
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 36]: What many men call their beliefs , are but the prejudices they happen to have picked up : why should such believers waste a thought as to how their paltry fellow-inhabitants of the planet fare ?
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 35]: Many indeed have all their lives been too busy making their human fellows groan and sweat for their own fancied well-being , to spare a thought for the fate of the yet more helpless .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 48]: But there are not a few , who would be indignant at having their belief in God questioned , who yet seem greatly to fear imagining him better than he is : whether is it he or themselves they dread injuring by expecting too much of him ?
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 11]: ` You see the plain facts of the case ! '
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 3]: they say .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 7]: ` There is no questioning them !
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 31]: What can be done for the poor things -- except indeed you take the absurd notion into your head , that they too have a life beyond the grave ? '
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 10]: Why should such a notion seem to you absurd ?
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 3]: I answer .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 47]: The teachers of the nation have unwittingly , it seems to me through unbelief , wronged the animals deeply by their silence anent the thoughtless popular presumption that they have no hereafter ; thus leaving them deprived of a great advantage to their position among men .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 55]: But I suppose they too have taken it for granted that the Preserver of man and beast never had a thought of keeping one beast alive beyond a certain time ; in which case heartless men might well argue he did not care how they wronged them , for he meant them no redress .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 16]: Their immortality is no new faith with me , but as old as my childhood .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 8]: Do you believe in immortality for yourself ?
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 17]: I would ask any reader who is not in sympathy with my hope for the animals .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 10]: If not , I have no argument with you .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 13]: But if you do , why not believe in it for them ?
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 37]: Verily , were immortality no greater a thing for the animals than it seems for men to some who yet profess to expect it , I should scarce care to insist upon their share in it .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 29]: But if the thought be anywise precious to you , is it essential to your enjoyment in it , that nothing less than yourself should share its realization ?
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 16]: Are you the lowest kind of creature that _ could _ be permitted to live ?
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 26]: Had God been of like heart with you , would he have given life and immortality to creatures so much less than himself as we ?
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 7]: Are these not worth making immortal ?
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 15]: How , then , were they worth calling out of the depth of no-being ?
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 33]: It is a greater deed , to make be that which was not , than to seal it with an infinite immortality : did God do that which was not worth doing ?
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 13]: What he thought worth making , you think not worth continuing made !
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 39]: You would have him go on for ever creating new things with one hand , and annihilating those he had made with the other -- for I presume you would not prefer the earth to be without animals !
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 41]: If it were harder for God to make the former go on living , than to send forth new , then his creatures were no better than the toys which a child makes , and destroys as he makes them .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 29]: For what good , for what divine purpose is the maker of the sparrow present at its death , if he does not care what becomes of it ?
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 36]: What is he there for , I repeat , if he have no care that it go well with his bird in its dying , that it be neither comfortless nor lost in the abyss ?
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 26]: If his presence be no good to the sparrow , are you very sure what good it will be to you when your hour comes ?
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 30]: Believe it is not by a little only that the heart of the universe is tenderer , more loving , more just and fair , than yours or mine .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 52]: If you did not believe you were yourself to out-live death , I could not blame you for thinking all was over with the sparrow ; but to believe in immortality for yourself , and not care to believe in it for the sparrow , would be simply hard-hearted and selfish .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 36]: If it would make you happy to think there was life beyond death for the sparrow as well as for yourself , I would gladly help you at least to hope that there may be .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 47]: I know of no reason why I should not look for the animals to rise again , in the same sense in which I hope myself to rise again -- which is , to reappear , clothed with another and better form of life than before .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 25]: If the Father will raise his children , why should he not also raise those whom he has taught his little ones to love ?
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 53]: Love is the one bond of the universe , the heart of God , the life of his children : if animals can be loved , they are loveable ; if they can love , they are yet more plainly loveable : love is eternal ; how then should its object perish ?
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 12]: Must the very immortality of love divide the bond of love ?
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 11]: Must the love live on for ever without its object ?
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 20]: or worse still , must the love die with its object , and be eternal no more than it ?
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 23]: What a mis-invented correlation in which the one side was eternal , the other , where not yet annihilated , constantly perishing !
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 13]: Is not our love to the animals a precious variety of love ?
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 43]: And if God gave the creatures to us , that a new phase of love might be born in us toward another kind of life from the same fountain , why should the new life be more perishing than the new love ?
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 54]: Can you imagine that , if , here-after , one of God 's little ones were to ask him to give again one of the earth 's old loves -- kitten , or pony , or squirrel , or dog , which he had taken from him , the Father would say no ?
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 48]: If the thing was so good that God made it for and gave it to the child at first who never asked for it , why should he not give it again to the child who prays for it because the Father had made him love it ?
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 13]: What a child may ask for , the Father will keep ready .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 22]: That there are difficulties in the way of believing thus , I grant ; that there are impossibilities , I deny .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 22]: Perhaps the first difficulty that occurs is , the many forms of life which we can not desire again to see .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 38]: But while we would gladly keep the perfected forms of the higher animals , we may hope that those of many other kinds are as transitory as their bodies , belonging but to a stage of development .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 25]: All animal forms tend to higher : why should not the individual , as well as the race , pass through stages of ascent .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 66]: If I have myself gone through each of the typical forms of lower life on my way to the human -- a supposition by antenatal history rendered probable -- and therefore may have passed through any number of individual forms of life , I do not see why each of the lower animals should not as well pass upward through a succession of bettering embodiments .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 75]: I grant that the theory requires another to complement it ; namely , that those men and women , who do not even approximately fulfil the conditions of their elevated rank , who will not endeavour after the great human-divine idea , striving to ascend , are sent away back down to that stage of development , say of fish or insect or reptile , beyond which their moral nature has refused to advance .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 35]: Who has not seen or known men who _ appeared _ not to have passed , or indeed in some things to have approached the development of the more human of the lower animals !
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 70]: Let those take care who look contemptuously upon the animals , lest , in misusing one of them , they misuse some ancestor of their own , sent back , as the one mercy for him , to reassume far past forms and conditions -- far past in physical , that is , but not in moral development -- and so have another opportunity of passing the self-constituted barrier .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 24]: The suggestion may appear very ridiculous , and no doubt lends itself to humorous comment ; but what if it should be true !
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 16]: what if the amused reader should himself be getting ready to follow the remanded ancestor !
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 75]: Upon it , however , I do not care to spend thought or time , least of all argument ; what I care to press is the question -- If we believe in the progress of creation as hitherto manifested , also in the marvellous changes of form that take place in every individual of certain classes , why should there be any difficulty in hoping that old lives may reappear in new forms ?
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 21]: The typical soul reappears in higher formal type ; why may not also the individual soul reappear in higher form ?
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 44]: Multitudes evidently count it safest to hold by a dull scheme of things : can it be because , like David in Browning 's poem _ Saul _ , they dread lest they should worst the Giver by inventing better gifts than his ?
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 23]: That we do not know , is the best reason for hoping to the full extent God has made possible to us .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 62]: If then we go wrong , it will be in the direction of the right , and with such aberration as will be easier to correct than what must come of refusing to imagine , and leaving the dullest traditional prepossessions to rule our hearts and minds , with no claim but the poverty of their expectation from the paternal riches .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 9]: Those that hope little can not grow much .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 29]: To them the very glory of God must be a small thing , for their hope of it is so small as not to be worth rejoicing in .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 22]: That he is a faithful creator means nothing to them for far the larger portion of the creatures he has made !
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 17]: Truly their notion of faithfulness is poor enough ; how then can their faith be strong !
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 14]: In the very nature of divine things , the common-place must be false .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 40]: The stupid , self-satisfied soul , which can not know its own stupidity , and will not trouble itself either to understand or to imagine , is the farthest behind of all the backward children in God 's nursery .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 33]: As I say , then , I know no cause of reasonable difficulty in regard to the continued existence of the lower animals , except the present nature of some of them .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 15]: But what Christian will dare to say that God does not care about them ?
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 12]: -- and he knows them as we can not know them .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 8]: Great or small , they are his .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 12]: Great are all his results ; small are all his beginnings .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 32]: That we have to send many of his creatures out of this phase of their life because of their hurtfulness in this phase of ours , is to me no stumbling-block .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 94]: The very fact that this has always had to be done , the long protracted combat of the race with such , and the constantly repeated though not invariable victory of the man , has had an essential and incalculable share in the development of humanity , which is the rendering of man capable of knowing God ; and when their part to that end is no longer necessary , changed conditions may speedily so operate that the wolf shall dwell with the lamb , and the leopard lie down with the kid .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 22]: The difficulty may go for nothing in view of the forces of that future with which this loving speculation concerns itself .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 51]: I would now lead my companion a little closer to what the apostle says in the nineteenth verse ; to come closer , if we may , to the idea that burned in his heart when he wrote what we call the eighth chapter of his epistle to the Romans .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 29]: Oh , how far ahead he seems , in his hope for the creation , of the footsore and halting brigade of Christians at present crossing the world !
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 15]: He knew Christ , and could therefore look into the will of the Father .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 19]: _ For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God _ !
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 54]: At the head of one of his poems , Henry Vaughan has this Latin translation of the verse : I do not know whether he found or made it , but it is closer to its sense than ours : -- ` Etenim res creatae exerto capite observantes expectant revelationem filiorum Dei . '
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 23]: -- ` For the things created , watching with head thrust out , await the revelation of the sons of God . '
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 34]: Because God has subjected the creation to vanity , in the hope that the creation itself shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 20]: For this double deliverance -- from corruption and the consequent subjection to vanity , the creation is eagerly watching .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 13]: The bondage of corruption God encounters and counteracts by subjection to vanity .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 21]: Corruption is the breaking up of the essential idea ; the falling away from the original indwelling and life-causing thought .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 10]: It is met by the suffering which itself causes .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 9]: That suffering is for redemption , for deliverance .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 43]: It is the life in the corrupting thing that makes the suffering possible ; it is the live part , not the corrupted part that suffers ; it is the redeemable , not the doomed thing , that is subjected to vanity .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 81]: The race in which evil -- that is , corruption , is at work , needs , as the one means for its rescue , subjection to vanity ; it is the one hope against the supremacy of corruption ; and the whole encircling , harboring , and helping creation must , for the sake of man , its head , and for its own further sake too , share in this subjection to vanity with its hope of deliverance .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 12]: Corruption brings in vanity , causes empty aching gaps in vitality .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 18]: This aching is what most people regard as evil : it is the unpleasant cure of evil .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 23]: It takes all shapes of suffering -- of the body , of the mind , of the heart , of the spirit .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 32]: It is altogether beneficent : without this ever invading vanity , what hope would there be for the rich and powerful , accustomed to , and set upon their own way ?
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 15]: what hope for the self-indulgent , the conceited , the greedy , the miserly ?
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 37]: The more things men seek , the more varied the things they imagine they need , the more are they subject to vanity -- all the forms of which may be summed in the word disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 16]: He who would not house with disappointment , must seek the incorruptible , the true .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 23]: He must break the bondage of havings and shows ; of rumours , and praises , and pretences , and selfish pleasures .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 35]: He must come out of the false into the real ; out of the darkness into the light ; out of the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 17]: To bring men to break with corruption , the gulf of the inane yawns before them .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 12]: Aghast in soul , they cry , ` Vanity of vanities !
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 5]: all is vanity ! '
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 13]: and beyond the abyss begin to espy the eternal world of truth .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 47]: Note now ` the hope that the creation itself also , ' as something besides and other than God 's men and women , ` shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption , into the liberty of the glory of the children of God . '
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 19]: The creation then is to share in the deliverance and liberty and glory of the children of God .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 33]: Deliverance from corruption , liberty from bondage , must include escape from the very home and goal of corruption , namely death , -- and that in all its kinds and degrees .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 39]: When you say then that for the children of God there is no more death , remember that the deliverance of the creature is from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 20]: Dead , in bondage to corruption , how can they share in the liberty of the children of Life ?
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 5]: Where is their deliverance ?
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 31]: If such then be the words of the apostle , does he , or does he not , I ask , hold the idea of the immortality of the animals ?
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 79]: If you say all he means is , that the creatures alive at the coming of the Lord will be set free from the tyranny of corrupt man , I refer you to what I have already said of the poverty of such an interpretation , accepting the failure of justice and love toward those that have passed away , are passing , and must yet , ere that coming , be born to pass away for ever .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 20]: For the man whose heart aches to adore a faithful creator , what comfort lies in such good news !
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 10]: He must perish for lack of a true God !
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 8]: Oh lame conclusion to the grand prophecy !
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 11]: Is God a mocker , who will not be mocked ?
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 12]: Is there a past to God with which he has done ?
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 7]: Is Time too much for him ?
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 34]: Is he God enough to care for those that happen to live at one present time , but not God enough to care for those that happened to live at another present time ?
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 13]: Or did he care for them , but could not help them ?
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 28]: Shall we not rather believe that the vessels of less honour , the misused , the maltreated , shall be filled full with creative wine at last ?
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 22]: Shall not the children have little dogs under the Father 's table , to which to let fall plenty of crumbs ?
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 53]: If there was such provision for the sparrows of our Lord 's time of sojourn , and he will bring yet better with him when he comes again , how should the dead sparrows and their sorrows be passed over of him with whom is no variableness , neither shadow of turning ?
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 39]: Or would the deliverance of the creatures into the groaned-for liberty have been much worth mentioning , if within a few years their share in the glory of the sons of God was to die away in death ?
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 9]: But the gifts of God are without repentance .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 9]: How St Paul longs for and loves liberty !
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 18]: Only true lover of liberty is he , who will die to give it to his neighbour !
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 10]: St Paul loved liberty more than his own liberty .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 34]: But then see how different his notion of the liberty on its way to the children of God , from the dull modern fancies of heaven still set forth in the popular hymn-books !
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 17]: The new heaven and the new earth will at least be a heaven and an earth !
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 14]: What would the newest earth be to the old children without its animals ?
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 15]: Barer than the heavens emptied of the constellations that are called by their names .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 19]: Then , if the earth must have its animals , why not the old ones , already dear ?
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 35]: The sons of God are not a new race of sons of God , but the old race glorified : -- why a new race of animals , and not the old ones glorified ?
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 39]: The apostle says they are to share in the liberty of the sons of God : will it not then be a liberty like ours , a liberty always ready to be offered on the altar of love ?
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 14]: What sweet service will not that of the animals be , thus offered !
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 13]: How sweet also to minister to them in their turns of need !
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 26]: For to us doubtless will they then flee for help in any difficulty , as now they flee from us in dread of our tyranny .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 44]: What lovelier feature in the newness of the new earth , than the old animals glorified with us , in their home with us -- our common home , the house of our father -- each kind an unfailing pleasure to the other !
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 5]: Ah , what horses !
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 5]: Ah , what dogs !
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 13]: Ah , what wild beasts , and what birds in the air !
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 13]: The whole redeemed creation goes to make up St Paul 's heaven .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 29]: He had learned of him who would leave no one out ; who made the excuse for his murderers that they did not know what they were doing .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 25]: Is not the prophecy on the groaning creation to have its fulfilment in the new heavens and the new earth , wherein dwelleth righteousness ?
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 13]: Does not this involve its existence beyond what we call this world ?
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 8]: Why should it not then involve immortality ?
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 22]: Would it not be more like the king eternal , immortal , invisible , to know no life but the immortal ?
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 13]: to create nothing that could die ; to slay nothing but evil ?
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 23]: ` For he is not a God of the dead , but of the living ; for all live unto him . '
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 19]: But what is this liberty of the children of God , for which the whole creation is waiting ?
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 42]: The children themselves are waiting for it : when they have it , then will their house and retinue , the creation , whose fate hangs on that of the children , share it with them : what is this liberty ?
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 43]: All liberty must of course consist in the realization of the ideal harmony between the creative will and the created life ; in the correspondence of the creature 's active being to the creator 's idea , which is his substantial soul .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 28]: In other words the creature 's liberty is what his obedience to the law of his existence , the will of his maker , effects for him .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 45]: The instant a soul moves counter to the will of its prime cause , the universe is its prison ; it dashes against the walls of it , and the sweetest of its uplifting and sustaining forces at once become its manacles and fetters .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 38]: But St Paul is not at the moment thinking either of the metaphysical notion of liberty , or of its religious realization ; he has in his thought the birth of the soul 's consciousness of freedom .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 45]: ` And not only so ' -- that the creation groaneth and travaileth -- ` but ourselves also , which have the first fruits of the spirit , even we ourselves groan within ourselves , waiting for ... the redemption of our body . '
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 25]: -- We are not free , he implies , until our body is redeemed ; then all the creation will be free with us .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 10]: He regards the creation as part of our embodiment .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 43]: The whole creation is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God -- that is , the redemption of their body , the idea of which extends to their whole material envelopment , with all the life that belongs to it .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 46]: For this as for them , the bonds of corruption must fall away ; it must enter into the same liberty with them , and be that for which it was created -- a vital temple , perfected by the unbroken indwelling of its divinity .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 51]: The liberty here intended , it may be unnecessary to say , is not that essential liberty -- freedom from sin , but the completing of the redemption of the spirit by the redemption of the body , the perfecting of the greater by its necessary complement of the less .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 41]: Evil has been constantly at work , turning our house of the body into a prison ; rendering it more opaque and heavy and insensible ; casting about it bands and cerements , and filling it with aches and pains .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 55]: The freest soul , the purest of lovers , the man most incapable of anything mean , would not , for all his mighty liberty , yet feel absolutely at large while chained to a dying body -- nor the less hampered , but the more , that that dying body was his own .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 36]: The redemption of the body , therefore , the making of it for the man a genuine , perfected , responsive house-alive , is essential to the apostle 's notion of a man 's deliverance .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 15]: The new man must have a new body with a new heaven and earth .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 72]: St Paul never thinks of himself as released from body ; he desires a perfect one , and of a nobler sort ; he would inhabit a heaven-made house , and give up the earth-made one , suitable only to this lower stage of life , infected and unsafe from the first , and now much dilapidated in the service of the Master who could so easily give him a better .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 22]: He wants a spiritual body -- a body that will not thwart but second the needs and aspirations of the spirit .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 40]: He had in his mind , I presume , such a body as the Lord died with , changed by the interpenetrating of the creative indwelling will , to a heavenly body , the body with which he rose .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 40]: A body like the Lord 's is , I imagine , necessary to bring us into true and perfect contact with the creation , of which there must be multitudinous phases whereof we can not now be even aware .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 54]: The way in which both good and indifferent people alike lay the blame on their bodies , and look to death rather than God-aided struggle to set them at liberty , appears to me low and cowardly : it is the master fleeing from the slave , despising at once and fearing him .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 22]: We must hold the supremacy over our bodies , but we must not despise body ; it is a divine thing .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 26]: Body and soul are in the image of God ; and the lord of life was last seen in the glorified body of his death .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 9]: I believe that he still wears that body .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 35]: But we shall do better without these bodies that suffer and grow old -- which may indeed , as some think , be but the outer cases , the husks of our real bodies .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 91]: Endlessly helpful as they have been to us , and that , in a measure incalculable , through their very subjection to vanity , we are yet surely not in altogether and only helpful company , so long as the houses wherein we live have so many spots and stains in them which friendly death , it may be , can alone wash out -- so many weather-eaten and self-engendered sores which the builder 's hand , pulling down and rebuilding of fresh and nobler material , alone can banish .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 28]: When the sons , then , are free , when their bodies are redeemed , they will lift up with them the lower creation into their liberty .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 68]: St Paul seems to believe that perfection in their kind awaits also the humbler inhabitants of our world , its advent to follow immediately on the manifestation of the sons of God : for our sakes and their own they have been made subject to vanity ; for our sakes and their own they shall be restored and glorified , that is , raised higher with us .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 8]: Has the question no interest for you ?
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 30]: It would have much , had you now what you must one day have -- a heart big enough to love any life God has thought fit to create .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 43]: Had the Lord cared no more for what of his father 's was lower than himself , than you do for what of your father 's is lower than you , you would not now be looking for any sort of redemption .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 30]: I have omitted in my quotations the word _ adoption _ used in both English versions : it is no translation of the Greek word for which it stands .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 36]: It is used by St Paul as meaning the same thing with the phrase , ` the redemption of the body ' -- a fact to bring the interpretation given it at once into question .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 51]: Falser translation , if we look at the importance of the thing signified , and its utter loss in the word used to represent it , not to mention the substitution for that of the apostle , of an idea not only untrue but actively mischievous , was never made .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 22]: The thing St Paul means in the word he uses , has simply nothing to do with adoption -- nothing whatever .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 24]: In the beginning of the fourth chapter of his epistle to the Galatians , he makes perfectly clear what he intends by it .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 75]: His unusual word means the father 's recognition , when he comes of age , of the child 's relation to him , by giving him his fitting place of dignity in the house ; and here the deliverance of the body is the act of this recognition by the great Father , completing and crowning and declaring the freedom of the man , the perfecting of the last lingering remnant of his deliverance .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 96]: St Paul 's word , I repeat , has nothing to do with _ adoption _ ; it means the manifestation of the grown-up sons of God ; the showing of those as sons , who have always been his children ; the bringing of them out before the universe in such suitable attire and with such fit attendance , that to look at them is to see what they are , the sons of the house -- such to whom their elder brother applied the words : ' I said ye are Gods . '
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 36]: If then the sons groan within themselves , looking to be lifted up , and the other inhabitants of the same world groan with them and cry , shall they not also be lifted up ?
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 8]: Have they not also a faithful creator ?
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 17]: He must be a selfish man indeed who does not desire that it should be so .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 53]: It appears then , that , in the expectation of the apostle , the new heavens and the new earth in which dwell the sons of God , are to be inhabited by blessed animals also -- inferior , but risen -- and I think , yet to rise in continuous development .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 65]: Here let me revert a moment , and say a little more clearly and strongly a thing I have already said : -- When the apostle speaks of the whole creation , is it possible he should have dismissed the animals from his thoughts , to regard the trees and flowers bearing their part in the groaning and travailing of the sore burdened world ?
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 56]: Or could he , animals and trees and flowers forgotten , have intended by the creation that groaned and travailed , only the bulk of the earth , its mountains and valleys , plains and seas and rivers , its agglomeration of hard and soft , of hot and cold , of moist and dry ?
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 38]: If he could , then the portion that least can be supposed to feel or know , is regarded by the apostle of love as immeasurably more important than the portion that loves and moans and cries .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 44]: Nor is this all ; for thereupon he attributes the suffering-faculty of the excluded , far more sentient portion at least , to the altogether inferior and less sentient , and upon the ground of that faculty builds the vision of its redemption !
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 43]: If it could be so , then how should the seeming apostle 's affected rhapsody of hope be to us other than a mere puff-ball of falsest rhetoric , a special-pleading for nothing , as degrading to art as objectless in nature ?
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 35]: Much would I like to know clearly what animals the apostle saw on his travels , or around his home when he had one -- their conditions , and their relations to their superiors .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 27]: Anyhow they were often suffering creatures ; and Paul was a man growing hourly in likeness to his maker and theirs , therefore overflowing with sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 24]: Perhaps as he wrote , there passed through his mind a throb of pity for the beasts he had to kill at Ephesus .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 26]: If the Lord said very little about animals , could he have done more for them than tell men that his father cared for them ?
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 18]: He has thereby wakened and is wakening in the hearts of men a seed his father planted .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 14]: It grows but slowly , yet has already borne a little precious fruit .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 38]: His loving friend St Francis has helped him , and many others have tried , and are now trying to help him : whoever sows the seed of that seed the Father planted is helping the Son .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 26]: Our behaviour to the animals , our words concerning them , are seed , either good or bad , in the hearts of our children .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 39]: No one can tell to what the animals might not grow , even here on the old earth under the old heaven , if they were but dealt with according to their true position in regard to us .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 13]: They are , in sense very real and divine , our kindred .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 20]: If I call them our poor relations , it is to suggest that poor relations are often ill used .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 39]: Relatives , poor or rich , may be such ill behaved , self-assertive , disagreeable persons , that we can not treat them as we gladly would ; but our endeavour should be to develop every true relation .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 34]: He who is prejudiced against a relative because he is poor , is himself an ill-bred relative , and to be ill-bred is an excluding fault with the court of the high countries .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 9]: There , poverty is welcome , vulgarity inadmissible .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 37]: Those who love certain animals selfishly , pampering them , as so many mothers do their children with worse results , that they may be loved of them in return , betray them to their enemies .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 26]: They are not lovers of animals , but only of favourites , and do their part to make the rest of the world dislike animals .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 26]: Theirs are the dogs that inhospitably growl and bark and snap , moving the indifferent to dislike , and confirming the unfriendly in their antagonism .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 27]: Any dog-parliament , met in the interests of their kind , would condemn such dogs to be discreetly bitten , and their mistresses to be avoided .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 32]: And certainly , if animals are intended to live and grow , she is the enemy of any individual animal , who stunts his moral and intellectual development by unwise indulgence .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 22]: Of whatever nature be the heaven of the animals , that animal is not in the fair way to enter it .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 21]: The education of the lower lies at the door of the higher , and in true education is truest kindness .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 18]: But what shall I say of such as for any kind of end subject animals to torture ?
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 18]: I dare hardly trust myself to the expression of my judgment of their conduct in this regard .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 26]: ` We are investigators ; we are not doing it for our own sakes , but for the sake of others , our fellow-men . '
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 16]: The higher your motive for it , the greater is the blame of your unrighteousness .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 29]: Must we congratulate you on such a love for your fellows as inspires you to wrong the weaker than they , those that are without helper against you ?
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 32]: Shall we count the man worthy who , for the sake of his friend , robbed another man too feeble to protect himself , and too poor to punish his assailant ?
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 13]: For the sake of your children , would you waylay a beggar ?
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 11]: No real good can grow in the soil of injustice .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 26]: I can not help suspecting , however , that the desire to know has a greater share in the enormity than the desire to help .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 19]: Alas for the science that will sacrifice the law of righteousness but to behold a law of sequence !
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 14]: The tree of knowledge will never prove to man the tree of life .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 21]: There is no law says , Thou shalt know ; a thousand laws cry out , Thou shalt do right .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 13]: These men are a law unto themselves -- and what a law !
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 20]: It is the old story : the greed of knowing casts out righteousness , and mercy , and faith .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 24]: Whatever believed a benefit may or may not thus be wrought for higher creatures , the injustice to the lower is nowise affected .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 21]: Justice has no respect of persons , but they are surely the weaker that stand more in need of justice !
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 14]: Labour is a law of the universe , and is not an evil .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 16]: Death is a law of this world at least , and is not an evil .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 14]: Torture is the law of no world but the hell of human invention .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 21]: Labour and death are for the best good of those that labour and die ; they are laws of life .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 27]: Torture is doubtless over-ruled for the good of the tortured , but it will one day burn a very hell in the hearts of the torturers .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 9]: Torture can be inflicted only by the superior .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 50]: The divine idea of a superior , is one who requires duty , and protects , helps , delivers : our relation to the animals is that of their superiors in the family , who require labour , it may be , but are just , helpful , protective .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 36]: Can they know anything of the Father who neither love nor rule their inferiors , but use them as a child his insensate toys , pulling them to pieces to know what is inside them ?
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 71]: Such men , so-called of science -- let them have the dignity to the fullness of its worth -- lust to know as if a man 's life lay in knowing , as if it were a vile thing to be ignorant -- so vile that , for the sake of his secret hoard of facts , they do right in breaking with torture into the house of the innocent !
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 11]: Surely they shall not thus find the way of understanding !
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 19]: Surely there is a maniac thirst for knowledge , as a maniac thirst for wine or for blood !
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 23]: He who loves knowledge the most genuinely , will with the most patience wait for it until it can be had righteously .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 6]: Need I argue the injustice ?
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 36]: Can a sentient creature come forth without rights , without claim to well-being , or to consideration from the other creatures whom they find , equally without action of their own , present in space ?
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 24]: If one answer , ` For aught I know , it may be so , ' -- Where then are thy own rights ?
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 3]: I ask .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 25]: If another have none , thine must lie in thy superior power ; and will there not one day come a stronger than thou ?
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 25]: Mayst thou not one day be in Naboth 's place , with an Ahab getting up to go into thy vineyard to possess it ?
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 20]: The rich man may come prowling after thy little ewe lamb , and what wilt thou have to say ?
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 11]: He may be the stronger , and thou the weaker !
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 22]: That the rights of the animals are so much less than ours , does not surely argue them the less rights !
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 19]: They have little , and we have much ; ought they therefore to have less and we more ?
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 18]: Must we not rather be the more honourably anxious that they have their little to the full .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 25]: Every gain of injustice is a loss to the world ; for life consists neither in length of days nor in ease of body .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 18]: Greed of life and wrong done to secure it , will never work anything but direst loss .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 16]: As to knowledge , let justice guide thy search and thou wilt know the sooner .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 27]: Do the will of God , and thou shalt know God , and he will open thine eyes to look into the very heart of knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 13]: Force thy violent way , and gain knowledge , to miss truth .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 24]: Thou mayest wound the heart of God , but thou canst not rend it asunder to find the Truth that sits there enthroned .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 25]: What man would he be who accepted the offer to be healed and kept alive by means which necessitated the torture of certain animals ?
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 31]: Would he feel himself a gentleman -- walking the earth with the sense that his life and conscious well-being were informed and upheld by the agonies of other lives ? '
